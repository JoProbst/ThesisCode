Asthma is a condition in which your airways narrow and swell and produce extra mucus. This can make breathing difficult and trigger coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath. For some people, asthma is a minor nuisance. For others, it can be a major problem that interferes with daily activities and may lead to a life-threatening asthma attack. Asthma can't be cured, but its symptoms can be controlled. Because asthma often changes over time, it's important that you work with your doctor to track your signs and symptoms and adjust treatment as needed. Asthma symptoms vary from person to person. You may have infrequent asthma attacks, have symptoms only at certain times—such as when exercising—or have symptoms all the time. Trouble sleeping caused by shortness of breath, coughing, or wheezing A whistling or wheezing sound when exhaling (wheezing is a common sign of asthma in children) Coughing or wheezing attacks that are worsened by a respiratory virus, such as a cold or the flu Signs that your asthma is probably worsening include: Asthma signs and symptoms that are more frequent and bothersome Increasing difficulty breathing (measurable with a peak flow meter, a device used to check how well your lungs are working) For some people, asthma signs and symptoms flare up in certain situations: which may be worse when the air is cold and dry triggered by workplace irritants such as chemical fumes, gases, or dust triggered by airborne substances, such as pollen, mold spores, cockroach waste, or particles of skin and dried saliva shed by pets (pet dander) Severe asthma attacks can be life-threatening. Work with your doctor to determine what to do when your signs and symptoms worsen—and when you need emergency treatment. Signs of an asthma emergency include: Rapid worsening of shortness of breath or wheezing No improvement even after using a quick-relief inhaler, such as albuterol Shortness of breath when you are doing minimal physical activity If you have frequent coughing or wheezing that lasts more than a few days or any other signs or symptoms of asthma, see your doctor. Treating asthma early may prevent long-term lung damage and help keep the condition from worsening over time. If you know you have asthma, work with your doctor to keep it under control. Good long-term control helps you feel better from day to day and can prevent a life-threatening asthma attack. Contact your doctor right away if your medication doesn't seem to ease your symptoms or if you need to use your quick-relief inhaler more often. Don't try to solve the problem by taking more medication without consulting your doctor. Overusing asthma medication can cause side effects and may make your asthma worse. Asthma often changes over time. Meet with your doctor regularly to discuss your symptoms and make any needed treatment adjustments. It isn't clear why some people get asthma and others don't, but it's probably due to a combination of environmental and genetic (inherited) factors. Exposure to various irritants and substances that trigger allergies (allergens) can trigger signs and symptoms of asthma. Asthma triggers are different from person to person and can include: Airborne substances, such as pollen, dust mites, mold spores, pet dander, or particles of cockroach waste Certain medications, including beta blockers, aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others), and naproxen (Aleve) Sulfites and preservatives added to some types of foods and beverages, including shrimp, dried fruit, processed potatoes, beer, and wine Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), a condition in which stomach acids back up into your throat A number of factors are thought to increase your chances of developing asthma. These include: Having a blood relative (such as a parent or sibling) with asthma Having another allergic condition, such as atopic dermatitis or allergic rhinitis (hay fever) Exposure to exhaust fumes or other types of pollution Exposure to occupational triggers, such as chemicals used in farming, hairdressing, and manufacturing Signs and symptoms that interfere with sleep, work, or recreational activities Sick days from work or school during asthma flare-ups Permanent narrowing of the bronchial tubes (airway remodeling) that affects how well you can breathe Emergency room visits and hospitalizations for severe asthma attacks Side effects from long-term use of some medications used to stabilize severe asthma Proper treatment makes a big difference in preventing both short-term and long-term complications caused by asthma. You're likely to start by seeing your family doctor or a general practitioner. However, when you call to set up an appointment, you may be referred to an allergist or a pulmonologist. Because appointments can be brief, and because there's often a lot of ground to cover, it's a good idea to be well-prepared. Here's some information to help you get ready for your appointment, as well as what to expect from your doctor. These steps can help you make the most of your appointment: including any that may seem unrelated to the reason for which you scheduled the appointment. for example, if your symptoms tend to get worse at certain times of the day, during certain seasons, or when you're exposed to cold air, pollen, or other triggers. including any major stresses or recent life changes. vitamins, and supplements that you're taking. if possible. Sometimes it can be difficult to recall all the information provided to you during an appointment. Someone who accompanies you may remember something that you missed or forgot. Your time with your doctor is limited, so preparing a list of questions will help you make the most of your time together. List your questions from most important to least important in case time runs out. For asthma, some basic questions to ask your doctor include: Is asthma the most likely cause of my breathing problems? Other than the most likely cause, what are other possible causes for my symptoms? What are the alternatives to the primary approach that you're suggesting? I have these other health conditions. How can I best manage them together? Is there a generic alternative to the medicine you're prescribing me? Are there any brochures or other printed material that I can take home with me? What websites do you recommend visiting? In addition to the questions that you've prepared to ask your doctor, don't hesitate to ask questions during your appointment. Your doctor is likely to ask you a number of questions. Being ready to answer them may reserve time to go over any points you want to spend more time on. Your doctor may ask: Do you have breathing problems most of the time or only at certain times or in certain situations? Do you have allergies, such as atopic dermatitis or hay fever? What, if anything, appears to worsen your symptoms? What, if anything, seems to improve your symptoms? To rule out other possible conditions—such as a respiratory infection or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)—your doctor will do a physical exam and ask you questions about your signs and symptoms and about any other health problems. You may also be given lung (pulmonary) function tests to determine how much air moves in and out as you breathe. These tests may include: This test estimates the narrowing of your bronchial tubes by checking how much air you can exhale after a deep breath and how fast you can breathe out. A peak flow meter is a simple device that measures how hard you can breathe out. Lower than usual peak flow readings are a sign your lungs may not be working as well and that your asthma may be getting worse. Your doctor will give you instructions on how to track and deal with low peak flow readings. Lung function tests often are done before and after taking a medication called a bronchodilator (brong-koh-DIE-lay-tur), such as albuterol, to open your airways. If your lung function improves with use of a bronchodilator, it's likely you have asthma. Methacholine is a known asthma trigger that, when inhaled, will cause mild constriction of your airways. If you react to the methacholine, you likely have asthma. This test may be used even if your initial lung function test is normal. This test, though not widely available, measures the amount of the gas, nitric oxide, that you have in your breath. When your airways are inflamed—a sign of asthma—you may have higher than normal nitric oxide levels. A chest X-ray and high-resolution computerized tomography (CT) scan of your lungs and nose cavities (sinuses) can identify any structural abnormalities or diseases (such as infection) that can cause or aggravate breathing problems. This can be performed by a skin test or blood test. Allergy tests can identify allergy to pets, dust, mold, and pollen. If important allergy triggers are identified, this can lead to a recommendation for allergen immunotherapy. This test looks for certain white blood cells (eosinophils) in the mixture of saliva and mucus (sputum) you discharge during coughing. Eosinophils are present when symptoms develop and become visible when stained with a rose-colored dye (eosin). Provocative testing for exercise and cold-induced asthma. In these tests, your doctor measures your airway obstruction before and after you perform vigorous physical activity or take several breaths of cold air. To classify your asthma severity, your doctor considers your answers to questions about symptoms (such as how often you have asthma attacks and how bad they are), along with the results of your physical exam and diagnostic tests. Determining your asthma severity helps your doctor choose the best treatment. Asthma severity often changes over time, requiring treatment adjustments. Asthma is classified into four general categories: Mild symptoms up to two days a week and up to two nights a month Symptoms more than twice a week, but no more than once in a single day Symptoms once a day and more than one night a week Symptoms throughout the day on most days and frequently at night Prevention and long-term control are key in stopping asthma attacks before they start. Treatment usually involves learning to recognize your triggers, taking steps to avoid them, and tracking your breathing to make sure your daily asthma medications are keeping symptoms under control. In case of an asthma flare-up, you may need to use a quick-relief inhaler, such as albuterol. The right medications for you depend on a number of things—your age, symptoms, asthma triggers, and what works best to keep your asthma under control. Preventive, long-term control medications reduce the inflammation in your airways that leads to symptoms. Quick-relief inhalers (bronchodilators) quickly open swollen airways that are limiting breathing. In some cases, allergy medications are necessary. generally taken daily, are the cornerstone of asthma treatment. These medications keep asthma under control on a day-to-day basis and make it less likely you'll have an asthma attack. Types of long-term control medications include: These anti-inflammatory drugs include fluticasone (Flonase, Flovent HFA), budesonide (Pulmicort Flexhaler, Rhinocort), flunisolide (Aerospan HFA), ciclesonide (Alvesco, Omnaris, Zetonna), beclomethasone (Qnasl, Qvar), mometasone (Asmanex), and fluticasone furoate (Arnuity Ellipta). You may need to use these medications for several days to weeks before they reach their maximum benefit. Unlike oral corticosteroids, these corticosteroid medications have a relatively low risk of side effects and are generally safe for long-term use. These oral medications—including montelukast (Singulair), zafirlukast (Accolate), and zileuton (Zyflo)—help relieve asthma symptoms for up to 24 hours. In rare cases, these medications have been linked to psychological reactions, such as agitation, aggression, hallucinations, depression and suicidal thinking. Seek medical advice right away for any unusual reaction. These inhaled medications, which include salmeterol (Serevent) and formoterol (Foradil, Perforomist), open the airways. Some research shows that they may increase the risk of a severe asthma attack, so take them only in combination with an inhaled corticosteroid. And because these drugs can mask asthma deterioration, don't use them for an acute asthma attack. These medications—such as fluticasone-salmeterol (Advair Diskus), budesonide-formoterol (Symbicort), and formoterol-mometasone (Dulera)—contain a long-acting beta agonist along with a corticosteroid. Because these combination inhalers contain long-acting beta agonists, they may increase your risk of having a severe asthma attack. Theophylline (Theo-24, Elixophyllin, others) is a daily pill that helps keep the airways open (bronchodilator) by relaxing the muscles around the airways. It's not used as often now as in past years. are used as needed for rapid, short-term symptom relief during an asthma attack—or before exercise if your doctor recommends it. Types of quick-relief medications include: These inhaled, quick-relief bronchodilators act within minutes to rapidly ease symptoms during an asthma attack. They include albuterol (ProAir HFA, Ventolin HFA, others) and levalbuterol (Xopenex). Short-acting beta agonists can be taken using a portable, hand-held inhaler or a nebulizer—a machine that converts asthma medications to a fine mist—so that they can be inhaled through a face mask or a mouthpiece. Like other bronchodilators, ipratropium acts quickly to immediately relax your airways, making it easier to breathe. Ipratropium is mostly used for emphysema and chronic bronchitis, but it's sometimes used to treat asthma attacks. These medications—which include prednisone and methylprednisolone—relieve airway inflammation caused by severe asthma. They can cause serious side effects when used long term, so they're used only on a short-term basis to treat severe asthma symptoms. If you have an asthma flare-up, a quick-relief inhaler can ease your symptoms right away. But if your long-term control medications are working properly, you shouldn't need to use your quick-relief inhaler very often. Keep a record of how many puffs you use each week. If you need to use your quick-relief inhaler more often than your doctor recommends, see your doctor. You probably need to adjust your long-term control medication. may help if your asthma is triggered or worsened by allergies. These include: Over time, allergy shots gradually reduce your immune system reaction to specific allergens. You generally receive shots once a week for a few months, then once a month for a period of three to five years. This medication, given as an injection every two to four weeks, is specifically for people who have allergies and severe asthma. It acts by altering the immune system. This treatment—which isn't widely available nor right for everyone—is used for severe asthma that doesn't improve with inhaled corticosteroids or other long-term asthma medications. Generally, over the span of three outpatient visits, bronchial thermoplasty heats the insides of the airways in the lungs with an electrode, reducing the smooth muscle inside the airways. This limits the ability of the airways to tighten, making breathing easier and possibly reducing asthma attacks. Treat by severity for better control: A stepwise approach Your treatment should be flexible and based on changes in your symptoms, which should be assessed thoroughly each time you see your doctor. Then your doctor can adjust your treatment accordingly. For example, if your asthma is well-controlled, your doctor may prescribe less medicine. If your asthma isn't well-controlled or is getting worse, your doctor may increase your medication and recommend more-frequent visits. Work with your doctor to create an asthma action plan that outlines in writing when to take certain medications or when to increase or decrease the dose of your medications based on your symptoms. Also include a list of your triggers and the steps you need to take to avoid them. Your doctor may also recommend tracking your asthma symptoms or using a peak flow meter on a regular basis to monitor how well your treatment is controlling your asthma. Although many people with asthma rely on medications to prevent and relieve symptoms, you can do several things on your own to maintain your health and lessen the possibility of asthma attacks. Taking steps to reduce your exposure asthma triggers is a key part of asthma control, including: Air conditioning reduces the amount of airborne pollen from trees, grasses, and weeds that finds its way indoors. Air conditioning also lowers indoor humidity and can reduce your exposure to dust mites. If you don't have air conditioning, try to keep your windows closed during pollen season. Minimize dust that may worsen nighttime symptoms by replacing certain items in your bedroom. For example, encase pillows, mattresses, and box springs in dustproof covers. Remove carpeting and install hardwood or linoleum flooring. Use washable curtains and blinds. If you live in a damp climate, talk to your doctor about using a dehumidifier. Clean damp areas in the bath, kitchen, and around the house to keep mold spores from developing. Get rid of moldy leaves or damp firewood in the yard. If you're allergic to dander, avoid pets with fur or feathers. Having pets regularly bathed or groomed also may reduce the amount of dander in your surroundings. Clean your home at least once a week. If you're likely to stir up dust, wear a mask or have someone else do the cleaning. If your asthma is worsened by cold or dry air, wearing a face mask can help. Taking care of yourself can help keep your symptoms under control, including: Having asthma doesn't mean you have to be less active. Treatment can prevent asthma attacks and control symptoms during activity. Regular exercise can strengthen your heart and lungs, which helps relieve asthma symptoms. If you exercise in cold temperatures, wear a face mask to warm the air you breathe. Being overweight can worsen asthma symptoms, and it puts you at higher risk of other health problems. Control heartburn and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). It's possible that the acid reflux that causes heartburn may damage lung airways and worsen asthma symptoms. If you have frequent or constant heartburn, talk to your doctor about treatment options. You may need treatment for GERD before your asthma symptoms improve. Certain alternative treatments may help with asthma symptoms. However, keep in mind that these treatments are not a replacement for medical treatment—especially if you have severe asthma. Talk to your doctor before taking any herbs or supplements, as some may interact with medications you take. While some alternative remedies are used for asthma, in most cases more research is needed to see how well they work and to measure the extent of possible side effects. Alternative asthma treatments include: These exercises may reduce the amount of medication you need to keep your asthma symptoms under control. A few herbal and natural remedies that may help improve asthma symptoms include black seed, caffeine, choline, and pycnogenol. Asthma can be challenging and stressful. You may sometimes become frustrated, angry, or depressed because you need to cut back on your usual activities to avoid environmental triggers. You may also feel limited or embarrassed by the symptoms of the disease and by complicated management routines. But asthma doesn't have to be a limiting condition. The best way to overcome anxiety and a feeling of helplessness is to understand your condition and take control of your treatment. Here are some suggestions that may help: Take breaks between tasks and avoid activities that make your symptoms worse. This may help you avoid feeling overwhelmed. Reward yourself for accomplishing simple goals. Chat rooms and message boards on the Internet or support groups in your area can connect you with people facing similar challenges and let you know you're not alone. Focus attention on the things your child can do, not on the things he or she can't. Involve teachers, school nurses, coaches, friends, and relatives in helping your child manage asthma. While there's no way to prevent asthma, by working together, you and your doctor can design a step-by-step plan for living with your condition and preventing asthma attacks. With your doctor and health care team, write a detailed plan for taking medications and managing an asthma attack. Then be sure to follow your plan. Asthma is an ongoing condition that needs regular monitoring and treatment. Taking control of your treatment can make you feel more in control of your life in general. Staying current with vaccinations can prevent flu and pneumonia from triggering asthma flare-ups. A number of outdoor allergens and irritants—ranging from pollen and mold to cold air and air pollution—can trigger asthma attacks. Find out what causes or worsens your asthma, and take steps to avoid those triggers. You may learn to recognize warning signs of an impending attack, such as slight coughing, wheezing, or shortness of breath. But because your lung function may decrease before you notice any signs or symptoms, regularly measure and record your peak airflow with a home peak flow meter. If you act quickly, you're less likely to have a severe attack. You also won't need as much medication to control your symptoms. When your peak flow measurements decrease and alert you to an oncoming attack, take your medication as instructed and immediately stop any activity that may have triggered the attack. If your symptoms don't improve, get medical help as directed in your action plan. Just because your asthma seems to be improving, don't change anything without first talking to your doctor. It's a good idea to bring your medications with you to each doctor visit, so your doctor can double-check that you're using your medications correctly and taking the right dose. Pay attention to increasing quick-relief inhaler use. If you find yourself relying on your quick-relief inhaler, such as albuterol, your asthma isn't under control.

falcon7b_prompt_112," Asthma is a chronic respiratory condition that can cause difficulty breathing, wheezing, chest tightness, and coughing. Common triggers of asthma include allergens, such as pollen, dust mites, and animal dander, as well as irritants like smoke and pollution. Symptoms usually occur in episodes and may vary from person to person. It is important to consult a doctor if you suspect you may have asthma, as there are various treatment options available depending on the severity of the condition.

Mayo Clinic Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences Mayo Clinic School of Continuous Professional Development If you have asthma, the inside walls of the airways in your lungs can become inflamed and swollen. In addition, membranes in your airway linings may secrete excess mucus. The result is an asthma attack. During an asthma attack, your narrowed airways make it harder to breathe, and you may cough and wheeze. Asthma is a condition in which your airways narrow and swell and may produce extra mucus. This can make breathing difficult and trigger coughing, a whistling sound (wheezing) when you breathe out and shortness of breath. For some people, asthma is a minor nuisance. For others, it can be a major problem that interferes with daily activities and may lead to a life-threatening asthma attack. Asthma can't be cured, but its symptoms can be controlled. Because asthma often changes over time, it's important that you work with your doctor to track your signs and symptoms and adjust your treatment as needed. Asthma symptoms vary from person to person. You may have infrequent asthma attacks, have symptoms only at certain times — such as when exercising — or have symptoms all the time. Wheezing when exhaling, which is a common sign of asthma in children Trouble sleeping caused by shortness of breath, coughing or wheezing Coughing or wheezing attacks that are worsened by a respiratory virus, such as a cold or the flu Signs that your asthma is probably worsening include: Asthma signs and symptoms that are more frequent and bothersome Increasing difficulty breathing, as measured with a device used to check how well your lungs are working (peak flow meter) For some people, asthma signs and symptoms flare up in certain situations: which may be worse when the air is cold and dry triggered by workplace irritants such as chemical fumes, gases or dust triggered by airborne substances, such as pollen, mold spores, cockroach waste, or particles of skin and dried saliva shed by pets (pet dander) Severe asthma attacks can be life-threatening. Work with your doctor to determine what to do when your signs and symptoms worsen — and when you need emergency treatment. Signs of an asthma emergency include: Rapid worsening of shortness of breath or wheezing No improvement even after using a quick-relief inhaler Shortness of breath when you are doing minimal physical activity If you have frequent coughing or wheezing that lasts more than a few days or any other signs or symptoms of asthma, see your doctor. Treating asthma early may prevent long-term lung damage and help keep the condition from getting worse over time. If you know you have asthma, work with your doctor to keep it under control. Good long-term control helps you feel better from day to day and can prevent a life-threatening asthma attack. Contact your doctor right away if your medication doesn't seem to ease your symptoms or if you need to use your quick-relief inhaler more often. Don't take more medication than prescribed without consulting your doctor first. Overusing asthma medication can cause side effects and may make your asthma worse. Asthma often changes over time. Meet with your doctor regularly to discuss your symptoms and make any needed treatment adjustments. It isn't clear why some people get asthma and others don't, but it's probably due to a combination of environmental and inherited (genetic) factors. Exposure to various irritants and substances that trigger allergies (allergens) can trigger signs and symptoms of asthma. Asthma triggers are different from person to person and can include: Airborne allergens, such as pollen, dust mites, mold spores, pet dander or particles of cockroach waste Certain medications, including beta blockers, aspirin, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, such as ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others) and naproxen sodium (Aleve) Sulfites and preservatives added to some types of foods and beverages, including shrimp, dried fruit, processed potatoes, beer and wine Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), a condition in which stomach acids back up into your throat A number of factors are thought to increase your chances of developing asthma. They include: Having a blood relative with asthma, such as a parent or sibling Having another allergic condition, such as atopic dermatitis — which causes red, itchy skin — or hay fever — which causes a runny nose, congestion and itchy eyes Exposure to exhaust fumes or other types of pollution Exposure to occupational triggers, such as chemicals used in farming, hairdressing and manufacturing Signs and symptoms that interfere with sleep, work and other activities Sick days from work or school during asthma flare-ups A permanent narrowing of the tubes that carry air to and from your lungs (bronchial tubes), which affects how well you can breathe Emergency room visits and hospitalizations for severe asthma attacks Side effects from long-term use of some medications used to stabilize severe asthma Proper treatment makes a big difference in preventing both short-term and long-term complications caused by asthma. While there's no way to prevent asthma, you and your doctor can design a step-by-step plan for living with your condition and preventing asthma attacks. With your doctor and health care team, write a detailed plan for taking medications and managing an asthma attack. Then be sure to follow your plan. Asthma is an ongoing condition that needs regular monitoring and treatment. Taking control of your treatment can make you feel more in control of your life. Staying current with vaccinations can prevent flu and pneumonia from triggering asthma flare-ups. A number of outdoor allergens and irritants — ranging from pollen and mold to cold air and air pollution — can trigger asthma attacks. Find out what causes or worsens your asthma, and take steps to avoid those triggers. You may learn to recognize warning signs of an impending attack, such as slight coughing, wheezing or shortness of breath. But because your lung function may decrease before you notice any signs or symptoms, regularly measure and record your peak airflow with a home peak flow meter. A peak flow meter measures how hard you can breathe out. Your doctor can show you how to monitor your peak flow at home. If you act quickly, you're less likely to have a severe attack. You also won't need as much medication to control your symptoms. When your peak flow measurements decrease and alert you to an oncoming attack, take your medication as instructed. Also, immediately stop any activity that may have triggered the attack. If your symptoms don't improve, get medical help as directed in your action plan. Don't change your medications without first talking to your doctor, even if your asthma seems to be improving. It's a good idea to bring your medications with you to each doctor visit. Your doctor can make sure you're using your medications correctly and taking the right dose. Pay attention to increasing quick-relief inhaler use. If you find yourself relying on your quick-relief inhaler, such as albuterol, your asthma isn't under control. See your doctor about adjusting your treatment. Weinberger SE, et al. Asthma.

Inflamed airways are very sensitive, and they tend to react to things in the environment called triggers, such as substances that are inhaled. When the airways react, they swell and narrow even more, and also produce extra mucus, all of which make it harder for air to flow to the lungs. The muscles around the airways also tighten, which further restricts air flow. When the airways react to asthma triggers, people can experience what's called an asthma flare-up or . Symptoms of an asthma attack include: coughing, chest tightness, wheezing and trouble breathing, according to the . Some people have mild asthma symptoms, or only experience asthma symptoms in response to certain activities like exercising. Other people have more serve and frequent symptoms, which may need treatment with medication. The underlying cause of asthma is not known, but it's thought to be due to a combination of genetic and environmental factors. People with asthma may have genetic risk factors that make them more susceptible to the disease, and certain environmental factors, such as exposure to allergens or certain viral infections in infancy, may increase the risk of developing the disease, according to the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI). Symptoms of asthma can be caused by triggers. Common asthma triggers include: tobacco smoke, dust mites, air pollution, pollen, mold, respiratory infections, physical activity, cold air and allergic reactions to some foods. Asthma shows up in different ways in different people, said Dr. David Beuther, of the Division of Pulmonary, Critical Care and Sleep Medicine at National Jewish Health Hospital in Denver. People sometimes first discover they have asthma because they have a persistent cough or wheeze and shortness of breath that won't go away, which brings them to the doctor, Beuther said. Asthma can sometimes be missed because people think they are just getting frequent colds or other respiratory infections, but they actually have poorly controlled asthma, Beuther said. A patient who has frequent chest colds probably needs to be evaluated for asthma, he said. In other cases, people are misdiagnosed with asthma when they actually don't have the condition, Beuther said.  For example, people with  can have symptoms that mimic asthma, he said, because extra weight can make the chest stiffer and heavier, which in turn makes breathing more difficult. People with acid reflux or nasal allergies can also have symptoms that mimic asthma, he said. To diagnose asthma, doctors perform a lung function test called spirometry, to see if there's a problem with the way the lungs are working, Beuther said. This test measures how much air people are able to blow out of the lungs, and how quickly they do this, . There is no cure for asthma. People who experience asthma symptoms should speak with their doctor about how to best treat and manage their condition. Managing asthma usually involves avoiding asthma triggers, and taking medications to prevent or treat symptoms. The goal of asthma therapy is for the patient to be symptom-free, Beuther said. ""We want you to be able to do what you want to do, without limitation,"" and with the fewest side effects from treatment, Beuther said. ""[People] feel like they have to suffer through symptoms, but our goal is to eliminate or nearly eliminate symptoms,"" he said.  There are two types of medications to treat asthma: quick-relief medications and long-term medications. Quick-relief medications provide relief from acute asthma symptoms. A common quick-relief medication is inhaled short-acting beta2-agonists, which help relax muscles around the airways, allowing more air to flow through them. People with asthma should have a quick-relief inhaler with them at all times to case they need it, . Long-term medications are typically taken daily to help prevent asthma symptoms from starting in the first place. A common medication is inhaled corticosteroids, which reduce airway inflammation and make airways less sensitive. Other long-term medications include omalizumab, a shot given one or two times a month to prevent the body from reacting to asthma triggers, and inhaled long-acting beta2-agonists, which help open airways, according to NHLBI. If patients are taking long-term medications, they should meet with their doctor frequently to assess how well the medications are working, or if the dose needs to be adjusted, Beuther said. It's important that people who are taking long-term medications do not suddenly stop taking the medications if they feel well, because symptoms can return, Beuther said. People who consistently take their medication end up taking less over the long term because their condition improves, and the dose can be lowered, he said. Anyone can have asthma, but it most often starts in childhood. Of the 25 million asthma sufferers in the United States, 7 million are children, . Most children with asthma develop it before age 5, according to the American Academy of Allergy Asthma & Immunology (AAAAI). In children, asthma can appear as wheezing or whistling sound when breathing, coughing, rapid or labored breathing, complaints of chest pain and feeling weak or tired, the academy says In children, asthma is the leading cause of emergency room visits, hospitalizations and missed days of school, . A child's asthma symptoms may continue into adulthood, the Mayo Clinic says. Some children with asthma will ""grow out"" of it as they get older, meaning the condition goes away completely, Beuther said. This may happen because as people grow up, their lungs become larger and more open, he said, and people experience hormone changes that may also affect asthma risk. On the other hand, people who develop asthma as an adult tend to have the condition for life, he said. Some studies suggest that inhaled corticosteroids may slightly restrict children's growth. A 2014 review study, published in the journal The Cochrane Library, found that children who took daily doses of the medication grew about 0.2 inches (0.5 cm) less during a year than those who took a placebo or nonsteroidal medications. However, the researchers said that this effect ""seems minor"" compared with the known benefits of the drugs. ""Without [these drugs], poorly controlled asthma is quite a big risk,"" said Beuther, who was not involved in the study. The NHLBI says that inhaled corticosteroids are generally safe when taken as prescribed. Follow Rachael Rettner .

Some children with asthma have only occasional or episodic symptoms, and some have seasonal symptoms. Others have a more chronic form of the disease and experience symptoms such as a chronic cough, shortness of breath or activity limitation weekly or daily. Some children have “asthma attacks,” in which symptoms seem to develop suddenly. You and your child can learn to recognize signs and symptoms of asthma, and take precautions to decrease the exposure to and the severity of an asthma episode. It is important to recognize and even mild symptoms. This can help decrease the amount of inflammation and reduce the risk of a more serious episode. Many times, you receive clues that an asthma episode may be developing — before breathing difficulty begins. These clues are called early warning signs. Listed below are common early warning signs. These early warning signs are often unique for each person. Keep track of these signs for a few weeks. It is also helpful to look back on past episodes and see if your child had any of these early warning signs. Asthma symptoms indicate that an asthma episode or asthma attack is occurring. Changes have taken place in the airways, and airflow is obstructed. Individuals with asthma experience some or all of these during an asthma episode. Action should be taken to treat these symptoms before they become worse. Severe asthma symptoms or a severe asthma attack can be a life-threatening emergency. Severe coughing, shortness of breath, tightness in the chest and/or wheezing Breathing that may be shallow and faster or slower than usual Neck area and area between or below the ribs moving inward with breathing (retractions) Gray or bluish tint to skin, beginning around the mouth (cyanosis) If any of these symptoms occur, seek emergency treatment right away. Have an action plan for getting emergency care quickly in the event of severe asthma symptoms. In addition to watching for asthma symptoms, a peak flow meter can help you monitor your child’s asthma. A peak flow meter can be especially useful if a child has moderate to severe asthma or has difficulty identifying asthma symptoms. A peak flow meter is a small, easy-to-use instrument that measures the peak expiratory flow — how fast you blow out air after a maximum inhalation. It reveals how well your child’s lungs are working. Young children, often by age 5 or 6, can learn to use a peak flow meter and produce reliable, consistent results. It is important to know that peak flow numbers are effort dependent. This means your child needs to put forth a good effort to have reliable, consistent results. Your doctor may have your child demonstrate peak flow meter technique at each visit to make sure it is done correctly. It is very important to understand that you should seek medical attention (doctor’s office or emergency room) when your child is not responding to treatment at home. A daily (or regular) record of peak flow numbers can provide you with a valuable early warning sign. Sometimes peak flow numbers will decrease hours, or even a day or two, before other asthma symptoms become evident. When you monitor peak flow numbers on a daily (or regular) basis, you can identify this drop and take steps to prevent an asthma episode. The peak flow numbers, along with watching for asthma symptoms, can be used to make decisions about asthma treatment. The highest number your child can blow regularly is the “personal best.” This is determined by recording peak flow numbers daily for two to three weeks when the asthma is under good control. Talk with your child’s doctor about determining your child’s “personal best.” Once you know your child’s personal best, it may be helpful for you and your doctor to establish zones. Zones will cue you about how well your child is breathing and actions you should take. The zone system can be compared to the colors of a traffic light. This indicates good lung function. Follow the routine treatment plan for maintaining asthma control. Your child may need more aggressive medical management for asthma. This may include a temporary increase in quick-relief medication and inhaled steroid medications, an oral steroid burst or other medications, as prescribed by your child’s doctor. Your child needs immediate treatment with quick-relief medication. Notify your child’s doctor or go to the emergency room if peak flow numbers don’t return and stay in the yellow or green zone. Your doctor can help determine what your child’s “personal best” is and what steps you should take when the peak flow numbers are in the green, yellow or red zones.

It is condition in which airways of lungs gets narrower and swell and produce extra mucus. It is characterized by variable and recurring symptoms, reversible airflow obstruction, and bronchospasm. General symptoms of asthma are wheezing, coughing, chest tightness and shortness of breath. The episodes of asthma attack are found to be few times a day or few times a week. This asthma episodes may increase or get worse depending on the person at night or during and after exercise. Asthma is though to be caused by the combination of genetic and environmental factors. Their is no cure for asthma but it can be symptoms can be prevented by avoiding triggers such as allergens and irritant. This symptoms can be prevented by inhaling corticosteriods , long acting beta agonist (LABA) or antileukotriene  may be used to control asthma. Signs and symptoms may vary form person to person and also influenced by environmental conditions.This include; trouble sleeping due to shortness of breath and chest pain An asthma attack is when you symptoms starts getting worse compared to usual, enough to cause the person distress. Asthma attack can come quickly or gradually. The number of  attack can range form few per day to few per week. The symptoms that are seen during the asthma attack are : Allergic reactions may be delayed in some children, making it difficult to identify the trigger involved. The most common asthma triggers include: Some medications, both over-the-counter (OTC) and prescription Upper respiratory infections such as colds and the flu Acid reflux (stomach acids rising up into the esophagus, causing heartburn and indigestion) Weather extremes such as thunderstorms, high humidity, or cold, dry air Yes, alcohol can cause asthma to worsen. One possible reason is that alcohol can cause various degrees of acid reflux.  In this common condition, acidic stomach fluids bubble up into the food tube (esophagus) and sometimes make their way into the breathing tubes via the back of the throat. This may also happen shortly after eating, or during the night as you sleep. Any acid in the breathing tubes is very aggravating, causing swelling and the production of mucus. An asthma inhaler is an handheld device that delivers medication straight into your lungs. You get the drugs faster and with fewer side effects then any other kind of dosage form like pills or I.V injections and I.V bolus. Asthma inhalers are available in different types they are Metered Dose Inhalers (MDIs) , Dry Powder Inhalers (DPIs) and Nebulizers. They contain different kind of medication, to provide fast relief or long acting symptoms of asthma. This different medication have different mechanism of action. This systems sometimes have to pumped and others are breath activated.  This system provide the drug through a small, handheld aerosol canister. They basically work like an spray can. You have to push the inhaler system and it sprays out the medicine, and you Deep breathe it in. A tube like gadget is their called spacer which helps kids and old people who have trouble breathing it in. Dry Powder Inhalers (DPIs) – Breathe activated inhalers: This kind of system have dry powders in them. You need not to press or pump for the medication to be released. The system require you to breathe quickly and deeply which will make you inhale the single dose in it for treatment. This are basically hard to use under the asthma attack because one can not take a deep breathe which is required by the system.  Nebulizers are mechanical system through which it deliver medication via mouthpiece or mask. They are easy to use because you can breathe normally. This system have an advantage for both categories like old people and under asthma attack. Therefore it makes them good for children and people with severe asthma who may not be able to use MDIs or DPIs.c The common types of asthma inhaler are divided into short acting bronchodilators and long acting bronchodilators. ( ventolin HFA, Proair HFA, Proventil HFA, this are also available in generic drug solution for nebulizers). Yes, asthma inhaler has an expiry date, by this date the manufacturer guarantees 100% safety and efficacy of the medication in the inhaler. After this date of expiration the manufacturer no longer guarantees 100% safety and efficacy of the drug. If one uses expired asthma inhaler and side effects are observed the manufacturer and regulatory authorities are not responsible for this kind of side of effects. This medication begins to breakdown by time and loses its potency over time. For this reason, US Food and Drug Ddministration (FDA) mandates all medication should have an expiry date on it. This date is estimated date at which time the medicine will lose its 10% of its potency. Any drug is under manufactured guaranteed efficacy and safety  on and before expiration date. Likewise, asthma inhaler have an expiration date until which the manufacturer provides the guaranteed efficacy and safety of drug. After the expiration date passes it starts losing its efficacy and after which manufacturer is no longer responsible for safety and efficacy of it. Side effects can be minor to major depending upon person to person as well as on environmental factors. The common side effects are : Serious side effects of expired asthma inhaler are: chest pain and fast, pounding or uneven heart beats “Can honey go bad over time?

7ff5ec9e-dbfb-4ea5-a64b-f27e5d749e06,"Asthma is one of the major noncommunicable diseases that affects millions across the world including children.  This condition, which affects your airways, is triggered when inhaled substances provoke allergic reactions. Asthma can be controlled by medications and avoiding triggers. Asthma is a that affects your airways and causes difficulty in breathing. It is triggered by inflammation of the air passages which makes them narrow. Symptoms of narrowing airways include whistling noisy breathing, shortness of breath, chest tightness and coughing. There can be several triggers or factors that can aggravate the symptoms of asthma. Common factors include dust, mites, pollen, smoke, , weather change, cold & cough and respiratory infections. Asthma can be broadly classified into two categories – specific and non-specific. Specific asthma hits you when you breathe in allergens or irritants while non-specific asthma is caused by exercise, weather or genetic predisposition. The exact cause of asthma is not known but it is seen in families with a history of the condition. Asthma cannot be cured, but it can be managed well with a number of treatment options aimed at relieving the symptoms and preventing the occurrence of severe attacks. Here's what Dr Navneet Sood, Consultant, Pulmonary & Critical Care Medicine, Jaypee Hospital, Noida has to say about the types, causes, symptoms, and treatment of asthma. Broadly speaking, there are two types of asthma, based on the nature of trigger behind it: Extrinsic asthma and intrinsic asthma. It is an immune response to an external allergen such as pollen, animal dander, dust, etc.  It occurs when you inhale certain chemical agents such as cigarette smoke, paint vapours, etc. In some cases, it may also be worsened by a chest infection, stress, and even loud bouts of laughter. Some drugs like aspirin and other  are also known to cause asthma attacks. Most people with asthma experience symptoms intermittently. The time gap between asthma flare-ups could be weeks or months. The symptoms generally worsen in the night or early in the morning. Other factors that can worsen asthma manifestations are breathing in cold air, strenuous physical exercise and heartburn. The tell-tale signs of this condition include Chest tightness: Pulling in of the skin between the ribs when breathing Wheezing: A musical, whistling or hissing sound with breathing. Apart from these, there are other manifestations of this condition which demand immediate addressal by the doctor Decreased level of alertness, such as severe drowsiness or confusion During an episode of asthma attack, the muscles surrounding the airways become tight and the lining of the air passages become swollen. This reduces the amount of air that can pass by. Though doctors haven’t been able to identify a specific cause behind asthma, specific triggers  have been spotted. Asthma triggers can be broadly categorized into Specific and Non-Specific Trigger When we say specific triggers, we talk about , irritants, conditions like heartburn and more. Any substance you breathe in can become an allergen. These might include traffic fumes, animal dander (from dogs and cats), house dust mites, pollen, mold, industrial fumes (especially those containing sulphur dioxide), household chemicals (air fresheners and aerosols), perfumed cosmetics, scented flowers, etc.  Viral or bacterial respiratory infections that trigger an asthma attack are common cold, flu, bronchitis and sinus infections. They are a common cause of asthma, especially in children.  Some of the most common foods associated with allergic symptoms are eggs, cow’s milk, peanuts, soy, wheat, fish, shrimp, etc. Food preservatives, especially sulphite additives can also be potential triggers behind an asthma flare-up. They include sodium bisulphite, potassium bisulphite, sodium metabisulphite, potassium metabisulfite and sodium sulphite.  Cigarette smoke contains different chemicals and gases that can irritate the lungs. Smoking increases your chance of getting asthma. Symptoms such as coughing and wheezing become worse when you smoke with asthma. Newborns can have poor lung function and an increased risk of wheezing if their moms smoke during pregnancy.  Severe , known as gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), and asthma often go hand-in-hand. Your stomach acids reflux into the oesophagus when the valve between this organ and the stomach does not function properly. If the acid reaches your airways, the irritation and inflammation can trigger an asthma attack.  Certain prescription and over-the-counter drugs like aspirin and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (ibuprofen and beta blockers) may trigger asthma attacks. : alcohol can cause asthma symptoms to worsen. One possible reason could be that alcohol causes acid reflux. Another probable factors could be the sulphites used in wines and beers. This category of triggers includes everything from emotional stress to genetic predisposition. Extreme emotions such as anxiety, anger and fear induce stress which in turn changes heart rate and breathing patterns. Rapid, shallow breathing causes constriction of airways which consequently leads to an asthmatic attack. Asthma can be triggered by intense exercise sessions or physical exertion. Hot and humid weather or extremely cold weather causes asthma symptoms to flare-up. : Yes, if you have a family member with asthma or have a family history of allergies, you are more likely to be vulnerable to asthma attack triggers. : It signifies the decreased ability to exercise and take part in other activities, fatigue, under performance or absence from work, psychological problems including stress, anxiety and depression. : Asthma can lead to a number of serious respiratory complications, like (infection of the lungs), a collapse of part or all of thelung and respiratory functions. In acute respiratory failure, the bronchial tubes are completely blocked. Oxygen level in the blood becomes dangerously low, or carbon dioxidelevel becomes alarmingly high. Such patients have to beimmediately shifted on ventilators to avoid fatality. In pregnant women asthma complications may include early labour, hypertension, gestational diabetes and haemorrhage. Asthma also puts the babies at risk of lower birth weight and breathing disorders. The diagnosis of asthma is based on a patient’s medical history, physical examination and laboratory test results. Your doctor will take a detailed medical history and ask you about your symptoms and allergy triggers. He may suggest one or more of the following tests to diagnose asthma, assess your breathing and monitor the effectiveness of asthma treatment: These include a battery of diagnostic tests to assess the performance of your lungs. Most commonly advised lung function tests include: : This is a breathing test that tells your doctor how much and how fast you blow out air. The purpose is to measure airway obstruction. This is a confirmatory test for asthma, in case your spirometry doesn’t show clear results. It measures your capacity to push air out of your lungs. It can be performed at home with a device called peak flow meter to figure out how successful your treatment is, whether or not you need emergency, etc. It measures the levels of nitric oxide in your breath. An increase in the volume of this gas indicates inflammation in the airways. This is a first level imaging test that your doctor may suggest just to have a broad overview of your lungs. The aim of asthma treatment is symptom control and easing of airway inflammation. Broadly speaking, treatment of this condition rests on three pillars: Long-term asthma control medicines, quick-acting drugs and breathing workouts. Your treatment regimen has to be decided by your doctor. Do not indulge in self-medication as the consequences can be dangerous. They don’t provide immediate relief to your symptoms. They work to reduce the severity and instances of asthma attack. These are commonly used for most people with asthma, particularly the inhaled steroids. They prevent asthma attacks by reducing swelling and mucus production in the airways.For severe asthma (status asthmaticus), injections of drugs such as prednisone are often necessary. Prednisone is the most potent and effective anti-inflammatory asthma medication available. : They are often combined with inhaled steroids for long-term control of asthma symptoms. Long-acting bronchodilators are never used alone for long-term therapy. These drugs are mainly used during an emergency caused by a severe flare-up. They are prescribed by a pulmonologist and the patient is told how to use them in case the need arises.  inhalers are used to quickly relieve cough, wheezing, chest tightness, and shortness of breath caused by asthma. Bronchodilators relieve the symptoms of asthma by dilating or widen the bronchial tubes. They should not be used regularly. The most commonly used short-acting bronchodilator is albuterol. Here's every you need to know about . Your doctor will suggest breathing techniques to increase your lung capacity and ensure healthy inflow and outflow of air. During a severe asthma attack that does not respond to asthma drugs, a mechanical ventilator may be needed to assist the lungs and respiratory muscles. A facemask is applied or a breathing tube is inserted in the nose or mouth for this asthma treatment. These breathing aids are temporary and removed once the attack has subsided and the lungs have recovered sufficiently to resume the work of breathing on their own. A short hospital stay in an intensive care unit may be necessary with an acute attack. In case of a severe flare-up, continuous use of an asthma nebulizer and injections of drugs such as epinephrine and prednisone for asthma are often necessary. Other therapies may include terbutaline injections, magnesium sulphate (induces smooth muscle relaxation of the airways) and leukotriene inhibitors. They are anti-inflammatory drugs. Here are dietary guidelines by nutritionist,  to deal with asthma: Here is detailed information on . The best way to prevent the relapse of an asthma attack episode is to avoid the triggers. However, the triggers vary from person to person. Common triggers include air pollution, allergies, cold air, a cold or virus, smoke, fragrances, etc. Here, we guide you on how to tackle the culprits behind an asthma attack. Identify your triggers and make a note of them in a diary. Also, keep a tab on your symptoms and pen them down. This will help you avoid and manage them. Discuss with your physician about all of these to chalk out a fool proof plan for dealing with asthma. Smoke from tobacco, candles and fire aren’t good for asthma patients. Do not smoke or allow anyone to do so in your car or at home. Coming in close contact with someone suffering from cough and cold will increase your risk of asthma attack. Stay away from them. Also, wash your hands well before eating and avoid touching your face as much as possible. Immunise yourself against the flu virus because it can trigger an asthma attack. You need to take this shot every year. Getting a vaccine for pneumonia is highly recommended for asthma patients. This vaccine needs to be administered once in every 5 to 10 years. ‘Enhanced immunity, no serious adverse events’: Lancet releases Covaxin’s Phase 1 trial data South African coronavirus variant may 'escape antibodies, cause reinfection' Beware!

Asthma symptoms can occur in reaction to contact with triggers such as pollen, dust, mold, cold air, smoke, chemicals, pets, and certain foods. They may even be brought on in response to exercise. Asthma symptoms vary in frequency and severity. Some people have symptoms often, some rarely. Some people have only one troublesome asthma symptom; others have all symptoms. Asthma is a very personal disease. You are the best judge of your asthma symptoms, how difficult they are, and when they are getting better or worse. Your doctor will want to know certain information about your asthma symptoms. Keeping a record of your asthma symptoms will help you control your asthma. An Asthma Diary is an excellent way to gather information day to day about your asthma symptoms. You can record things such as: how bad your asthma symptoms are when you have them Many symptoms related to asthma can be other problems in disguise.

Some are mild and may not be very noticeable. Sometimes the asthma symptoms can be very uncomfortable and serious enough to be life threatening. It is important to understand your symptoms and personal triggers in order to control your asthma symptoms and anticipate the onset of an asthma attack. Not everyone with asthma has all the following symptoms, but usually at least one is bothersome and recurring. is the hoarse, whistling sound you hear when you breathe in or out if your airways are inflamed or obstructed. Wheezing is caused by air rushing through tight, narrowed airways. Wheezing in people who have asthma is usually more noticeable when exhaling. occurs when the body tries to rid itself of an irritant In people with asthma, an increased sensitivity in the breathing passages causes them to tighten over and over as if trying to expel an irritant from your lungs, resulting in coughing. Asthma often causes a persistent cough, which may get worse at night, in the early morning, or after exercise. Sometimes coughing spasms also occur. For many people, especially children, coughing is the first symptom of asthma. is a feeling of not having enough air and is caused by an inability to fully empty your lungs during an asthma attack. You may feel like you need to sit down and ""catch your breath"" even if you are not being very active. The air trapped in your lungs keeps you from taking in as much new air as you need on your next breath. The sensation that you can't get enough air into your lungs usually feels worse when you try to inhale. The inflammation and tightening that asthma can cause in your airways can make you feel uncomfortable pressure in your chest. This is a discomfort you may have to learn to live with when you have asthma. However, other serious medical conditions such as angina and heart attack can also cause chest pressure and pain. So if you have this symptom, be sure to talk with your doctor right away so that he or she can rule out these more serious problems. The only way to prevent the chest pressure that is caused by asthma is to keep your asthma under control. You can do this by taking your medicine as directed and following your treatment plan. Mucus is a sticky substance in your throat and breathing passages that increases as airways swell. The lungs normally produce mucus to help trap dust and irritants so you can cough them out. However, when your airways are inflamed by asthma, your body reacts as if there is an irritant to get rid of and produces more mucus. You may find yourself coughing up a lot of mucus or needing to spit out mucus often in order to clear your throat. Emergency Medicine resident at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.

7a0125e7-4185-4410-bded-af82aabca9e5,"In childhood asthma, the lungs and airways become easily inflamed when exposed to certain triggers, such as inhaling pollen or catching a cold or other respiratory infection. Childhood asthma can cause bothersome daily symptoms that interfere with play, sports, school and sleep. In some children, unmanaged asthma can cause dangerous asthma attacks. Childhood asthma isn't a different disease from asthma in adults, but children face unique challenges. The condition is a leading cause of emergency department visits, hospitalizations and missed school days. Unfortunately, childhood asthma can't be cured, and symptoms can continue into adulthood. But with the right treatment, you and your child can keep symptoms under control and prevent damage to growing lungs. Common childhood asthma signs and symptoms include: Frequent coughing that worsens when your child has a viral infection, occurs while your child is asleep or is triggered by exercise or cold air Trouble sleeping due to shortness of breath, coughing or wheezing Bouts of coughing or wheezing that get worse with a cold or the flu Delayed recovery or bronchitis after a respiratory infection Asthma signs and symptoms vary from child to child, and might get worse or better over time. Your child might have only one indication, such as a lingering cough or chest congestion. It can be difficult to tell whether your child's symptoms are caused by asthma. Periodic or long-lasting wheezing and other asthma-like symptoms can be caused by infectious bronchitis or another respiratory problem. Take your child to see the doctor if you suspect he or she has asthma. Early treatment will help control symptoms and possibly prevent asthma attacks. Make an appointment with your child's doctor if you notice: Coughing that is constant, is intermittent or seems linked to physical activity Wheezing or whistling sounds when your child breathes out Repeated episodes of suspected bronchitis or pneumonia If your child has asthma, he or she may say things such as, ""My chest feels funny"" or ""I'm always coughing."" Listen for coughing, which might not wake your child, when he or she is asleep. Crying, laughing, yelling, or strong emotional reactions and stress also might trigger coughing or wheezing. If your child is diagnosed with asthma, creating an asthma plan can help you and other caregivers monitor symptoms and know what to do if an asthma attack occurs. In severe cases, you might see your child's chest and sides pulling inward as he or she struggles to breathe. Your child might have an increased heartbeat, sweating and chest pain. Seek emergency care if your child: Has to stop in midsentence to catch his or her breath Is trying so hard to breathe that the abdomen is sucked under the ribs when he or she breathes in Even if your child hasn't been diagnosed with asthma, seek medical attention immediately if he or she has trouble breathing. Although episodes of asthma vary in severity, asthma attacks can start with coughing, which progresses to wheezing and labored breathing. Childhood asthma causes aren't fully understood. Some factors thought to be involved include: Some types of airway infections at a very young age Exposure to environmental factors, such as cigarette smoke or other air pollution Increased immune system sensitivity causes the lungs and airways to swell and produce mucus when exposed to certain triggers. Reaction to a trigger can be delayed, making it more difficult to identify the trigger. Triggers vary from child to child and can include: Allergies to dust mites, pet dander, pollen or mold Sometimes, asthma symptoms occur with no apparent triggers. Factors that might increase your child's likelihood of developing asthma include: Previous allergic reactions, including skin reactions, food allergies or hay fever (allergic rhinitis) Respiratory conditions, such as a chronic runny or stuffy nose (rhinitis), inflamed sinuses (sinusitis) or pneumonia Heartburn (gastroesophageal reflux disease, or GERD) Asthma can cause a number of complications, including: Severe asthma attacks that require emergency treatment or hospital care Symptoms that interfere with play, sports or other activities Careful planning and avoiding asthma triggers are the best ways to prevent asthma attacks. Help your child avoid the allergens and irritants that trigger asthma symptoms. Exposure to tobacco smoke during infancy is a strong risk factor for childhood asthma, as well as a common trigger of asthma attacks. As long as your child's asthma is well-controlled, regular physical activity can help the lungs to work more efficiently. Check in regularly. Don't ignore signs that your child's asthma might not be under control, such as needing to use a quick-relief inhaler too often. Asthma changes over time. Consulting your child's doctor can help you make needed treatment adjustments to keep symptoms under control. Being overweight can worsen asthma symptoms, and it puts your child at risk of other health problems. Acid reflux or severe heartburn (gastroesophageal reflux disease, or GERD) might worsen your child's asthma symptoms. He or she might need over-the-counter or prescription medications to control acid reflux. Any use of this site constitutes your agreement to the Terms and Conditions and Privacy Policy linked below.

Breathing is just one of those things you take for granted until it feels like every inhale or exhale is a struggle. Unfortunately, people with severe have to deal with breathing issues way more often than anyone should, and it can be completely terrifying. Asthma is a respiratory condition that affects the airways that extend from your and mouth to your lungs, according to the (NHLBI). When you’re exposed to triggers like animal fur, pollen, mold, , and respiratory infections, these airways can narrow, restricting your airflow. This can then make the muscles surrounding your airways constrict, making it even harder to breathe, and cause your airways to produce more mucus than normal, further compounding the problem. All together, this can lead to asthma symptoms like , coughing, wheezing (a whistling sound when you breathe), and chest tightness or pain, according to the . Like most , asthma severity runs along a spectrum, Emily Pennington, M.D., a pulmonologist at the Cleveland Clinic, tells SELF. Some people have cases where they experience minor symptoms here and there (maybe even so mildly that they ). Others can have asthma that is basically an ever-present problem and might result in scary asthma attacks, which is when symptoms ramp up in severity and can even become life-threatening. The most important part of preventing severe asthma attacks is knowing you have the condition in the first place. Here are the top signs you have severe asthma, plus which kinds of treatment may help. 1. Difficulty breathing jolts you out of sleep at night. If your asthma symptoms don’t only affect you most days, but also rear their head more than one night a week, you may have what experts call “severe persistent” asthma. This is the most serious classification of this condition, according to the . Doctors don’t know exactly why asthma can flare up at night, but they think it may be due to hormonal changes your body goes through while you sleep, Dr. Pennington says. During the wee hours of the night, your body can release higher levels of the stress hormone cortisol which may cause more inflammation, including in your airways, she explains. Voila, nighttime asthma flares. 2. You’re short of breath even when you’re not exerting a lot of energy. Obviously you’re going to be winded when you do something strenuous, like . However, you should pay close attention if you’re getting out of breath when you do everyday stuff like walk around your house. While people who have less intense cases of asthma may experience this here and there when they have asthma attacks, people with severe asthma may have airways that are pretty much constantly inflamed, Raymond Casciari, M.D., a pulmonologist at St. Joseph Hospital in Orange, Calif., tells SELF. This can restrict your airflow to the point where you have trouble breathing even when you’re not pushing yourself physically. 3. Sometimes it’s hard to speak in complete sentences, seemingly out of the blue. Asthma doesn’t just keep you from getting air in; it can also cause issues getting air out. “People [with severe asthma] can’t get enough air in to be able to expel air at a slow enough rate to speak a sentence before they need to take another breath,” Dr. Casciari says. This is especially likely to happen during an asthma attack, when airways narrow even more than usual, Sadia Benzaquen, M.D., a pulmonologist and associate professor in the department of internal medicine at the University of Cincinnati College of Medicine, tells SELF. Unfortunately, people with severe asthma are more likely to have these flare-ups that can make speaking way too difficult. 4. You feel breathless even when you sit or lie down. If you’re huffing and puffing, your instinct may be to or lie down to try to breathe more easily. “Theoretically, sitting or lying [down] reduces your energy expenditure and therefore reduces the need for oxygen,” Dr. Casciari says. For many people, this makes it easier for your lungs to get enough air to breathe comfortably. But severe asthma doesn’t really work that way, so sitting or lying down won’t suddenly make it way easier to breathe if you’re still exposed to a trigger or haven’t started treating your symptoms, Dr. Pennington says. 5. Your chest constantly feels like it’s stuck in a vise. Chest tightness is often part and parcel of having asthma, but people with a severe form of the condition can feel like their chest is constantly under pressure. This is due to how the muscles surrounding your airways react to irritants, , and other things that can activate your asthma. When you’re exposed to these triggers, muscles clamp down and narrow your airways, making your chest feel tight, Dr. Pennington says. If your airways and their surrounding muscles are constantly overreacting to asthma triggers, it might feel like your chest rarely (if ever) gets a break. 6. You’re agitated, confused, or sleepy and aren’t sure why. , you’re getting rid of carbon dioxide, which is a waste byproduct you create by breathing. If you have a bad case of severe asthma, it can limit your carbon dioxide output to such an extent that too much remains in your system, making you suddenly feel confused, agitated, or tired, Richard H. Huynh, M.D., a pulmonologist with Torrance Memorial Medical Center, tells SELF. This is known as , and it’s extremely serious. While the above symptoms all signal that you need to see your doctor for evaluation, this one is means you need to seek emergency treatment immediately. A bluish tint to your skin can be a sign of cyanosis, which happens when there is a lack of oxygen in your blood, according to the . Much like agitation, confusion, and sleepiness, this is a serious symptom that shouldn’t be ignored, Dr. Benzaquen says. Red cells in your body provide oxygen to your tissues, and in doing so, they give your skin a pink or red undertone that can either be really obvious or hard to pick up on, depending on your skin color. If a condition like asthma makes it tough to get as much oxygen as you need, your blood can take on a blue hue, which can impact the color of your skin. In people with lighter skin, this can show up all over the body, and in people with darker skin, it may be more obvious in the lips, gums, nails, and around the eyes, according to the . Dr. Casciari notes that this change can happen suddenly, like if you have an intense asthma attack, or over time if you’re not getting treatment for chronic severe asthma. Either way, if you notice this issue, you need to call 911 immediately, Dr. Benzaquen says. That’s especially true if you’re dealing with other asthma symptoms, like shortness of breath. Whether or not you’ve already been diagnosed, if you’re having life-threatening or even seriously uncomfortable asthma symptoms, your doctor will first address those. They can do this by administering treatment like a short-acting beta antagonist you can inhale to relax your airways, giving you an oral corticosteroid to calm airway inflammation, or even helping you breathe with an oxygen machine, according to the . Once that’s under control, if you’ve already been diagnosed with asthma, your doctor may decide to adjust your medications so you’re less likely to deal with such severe symptoms, Dr. Pennington says. If you haven’t yet been diagnosed, they’ll want to do that before delving into your treatment plan. Diagnosing your asthma will involve various tests to see how your lungs function. These lung tests include spirometry, which checks how much air you can blow out after taking a deep breath along with how fast you can blow that air out, according to the . Your doctor may also order what’s known as a peak flow test, which measures how hard you can breathe out with a handheld device. If you don’t perform well on those tests, it’s usually a sign that you’re struggling with severe asthma, Dr. Benzaquen says. They can also perform other exams, like allergy tests to see whether you may have certain triggers that kick off your symptoms, and imaging tests to rule out things like respiratory infections as the cause of your issues, says the . No matter your situation, it’s critical that you and your doctor work on a plan to help you control your asthma. Treatment often involves a double-pronged approach using long-term preventive medications and quick-relief treatments, according to the . Long-term preventive medications, which include drugs like oral corticosteroids to reduce airway inflammation, are designed to make asthma attacks less likely. Then you can use quick-relief treatments, like a short-acting beta agonist to relax your airways, if your symptoms flare up anyway. People with severe asthma don’t necessarily take different medications from those with less extreme forms of the condition, but they may take more. “Severe asthma patients tend to need higher doses of medication or multiple inhalers to keep their asthma under control,” Dr. Pennington says. Your doctor will likely also hammer out an actual asthma action plan with you (and you should ask them for help with this if they don’t). This is a written summary of the medications you’ll need to take and how to avoid your triggers. If you have severe asthma, it’s also pretty likely that your doctor will want you to track your symptoms or regularly use a peak flow meter to see how well your treatment is helping, according to the . Bottom line: Don’t just ignore symptoms you suspect are due to severe asthma. Getting help now could make a huge positive impact on your health immediately and in the long-term, too.

890ffb40-ef3e-4b65-b0ad-e00d06756f36,"To revisit this article, visit My Profile, then . Comprehensive overview covers treatment and warning signs of this potentially life-threatening situation. During an asthma attack, also called an asthma exacerbation, your airways become swollen and inflamed. The muscles around the airways contract and the airways also produce extra mucus, causing your breathing (bronchial) tubes to narrow. During an attack, you may cough, wheeze, and have trouble breathing. An asthma attack may be minor, with symptoms that get better with prompt home treatment, or it may be more serious. A severe asthma attack that doesn't improve with home treatment can become a life-threatening emergency. The key to stopping an asthma attack is recognizing and treating an asthma flare-up early. Follow the treatment plan you worked out with your doctor ahead of time. Your treatment plan should include what to do when your asthma starts getting worse, and how to deal with an asthma attack in progress. Severe shortness of breath, chest tightness or pain, and coughing or wheezing Low peak expiratory flow (PEF) readings, if you use a peak flow meter Symptoms that fail to respond to use of a quick-acting (rescue) inhaler Signs and symptoms of an asthma attack vary from person to person. Work with your doctor to identify your particular signs and symptoms of worsening asthma—and what to do when they occur. If your asthma symptoms keep getting worse even after you take medication as your doctor directed, you may need emergency room care. Your doctor can help you learn to recognize an asthma emergency so that you'll know when to get help. If your asthma flares up, immediately follow the treatment steps you and your doctor worked out ahead of time in your written asthma plan. If your symptoms and peak expiratory flow (PEF) readings improve, home treatment may be all that's needed. If your symptoms don't improve with home treatment, you may need to seek emergency care. When your asthma symptoms flare up, follow your written asthma plan's instructions for using your quick-acting (rescue) inhaler. PEF readings ranging from 50 to 79 percent of your personal best are a sign you need to use the quick-acting (rescue) medications prescribed by your doctor. Asthma can change over time, so you'll need periodic adjustments to your treatment plan to keep daily symptoms under control. If your asthma isn't well-controlled, it increases your risk of future asthma attacks. Lingering lung inflammation means your asthma could flare up at any time. Go to all scheduled doctor's appointments. If you have regular asthma flare-ups, low peak flow readings or other signs your asthma isn't well-controlled, make an appointment to see your doctor. Seek medical attention right away if you have signs or symptoms of a serious asthma attack, which include: Severe breathlessness or wheezing, especially at night or in the early morning The inability to speak more than short phrases due to shortness of breath Low peak flow readings when you use a peak flow meter No improvement after using a quick-acting (rescue) inhaler An overly sensitive immune system makes your airways (bronchial tubes) become inflamed and swollen when you're exposed to certain triggers. Asthma triggers vary from person to person. Common asthma attack triggers include: For many people, asthma symptoms get worse with a respiratory infection such as a cold. Some people have asthma flare-ups caused by something in their work environment. Sometimes, asthma attacks occur with no apparent cause. Anyone who has asthma is at risk of an asthma attack. You may be at increased risk of a serious asthma attack if: You've previously been admitted to the hospital or had to go to the emergency room for asthma You've previously required intubation for an asthma attack You use more than two quick-acting (rescue) inhalers a month Your asthma attacks tend to sneak up on you before you notice symptoms have worsened You have other chronic health conditions, such as sinusitis or nasal polyps, or cardiovascular or chronic lung disease Asthma attacks can interrupt everyday activities such as sleep, school, work, and exercise, causing a significant impact on your quality of life—and can disrupt the lives of those around you. Serious asthma attacks mean you're likely to need trips to the emergency room, which can be stressful and costly. A very severe asthma attack can lead to respiratory arrest and death. For adults and children over 5 years old, lung (pulmonary) function tests are used to check how well the lungs are working. Poor lung function is a sign that your asthma isn't well-controlled. In some cases, lung function tests are also used in asthma emergencies to help check the severity of an asthma attack or how well treatment is working. Your doctor may take a peak flow reading when you come in for a scheduled visit or for emergency treatment during an asthma attack. This test measures how quickly you can breathe out. You also may use a peak flow meter at home to monitor your lung function. The results of this test are known as peak expiratory flow (PEF). A peak flow test is done by blowing into a mouthpiece as hard and as fast as you can with a single breath (expiration). During spirometry, you take deep breaths and forcefully exhale into a hose connected to a machine called a spirometer. A common spirometry measurement is forced expiratory volume, which measures how much air you can breathe out in one second. The results of this test are known as forced expiratory volume (FEV). Spirometry can also measure how much air your lungs can hold and the rate at which you can inhale and exhale. A newer diagnostic test, this exam measures the amount of nitric oxide gas you have in your breath when you exhale. High nitric oxide readings indicate inflammation of the bronchial tubes. Exhaled nitric oxide can be measured by having a patient exhale directly into an analyzer. Exhaled air may be captured in a nitric-oxide-impervious container for measurement later. This test is used during a severe asthma attack. It measures the amount of oxygen in your blood. It's measured through your fingernail and only takes seconds. If you and your doctor have worked out an asthma plan, follow its directions at the first sign of an asthma attack. This generally means taking two to six puffs of a quick-acting (rescue) inhaler to get airway-expanding medication, such as albuterol (ProAir HFA, Proventil HFA, Ventolin HFA, others), deep into your lungs. Small children and those who have trouble with inhalers can use a nebulizer. After 20 minutes, you can repeat the treatment one time if necessary. For an asthma attack with severe symptoms, such as difficulty speaking because you're so short of breath, start with the same initial step of using quick-acting medication—but instead of waiting for the drug to work, get to a doctor's office or urgent care immediately. Same-day medical care is also warranted if you continue to wheeze and feel at all breathless after initial treatment. Your doctor may recommend that you continue to use quick-acting medication every three to four hours for a day or two after the attack. You might also need to take oral corticosteroid medication for a short time. If you go to the emergency room for an asthma attack in progress, you'll need medications to get your asthma under immediate control. These can include: Short-acting beta agonists, such as albuterol (ProAir HFA, Proventil HFA, Ventolin HFA, others). These are the same medications as those in your quick-acting (rescue) inhaler. You may need to use a machine called a nebulizer, which turns the medication into a mist that can be inhaled deep into your lungs. Taken in pill form, these medications help reduce lung inflammation and get your asthma symptoms under control. Corticosteroids can also be given intravenously, typically to patients who are vomiting or under respiratory failure. Ipratropium is sometimes used as a bronchodilator to treat a severe asthma attack, especially if albuterol is not fully effective. If your asthma attack is life-threatening, your doctor may put a breathing tube down your throat into your upper airway. Using a machine that pumps oxygen into your lungs will help you breathe while your doctor gives you medications to bring your asthma under control. After your asthma symptoms improve, your doctor may want you to stay in the emergency room for a few hours or longer to make sure you don't have another asthma attack. When your doctor feels your asthma is sufficiently under control, you'll be able to go home. Your doctor will give you instructions on what to do if you have another asthma attack. If your asthma symptoms don't improve after emergency treatment, your doctor may admit you to the hospital and give you medications every hour or every few hours. If you're having severe asthma symptoms, you may need to breathe oxygen through a mask. In some cases, a severe, persistent asthma attack requires a stay in the intensive care unit (ICU). Be prepared for your visit to your doctor so that you can get the most out of your appointment. At each visit: Take your asthma action plan with you when you see your doctor. If you haven't made one yet, work with your doctor to create one. This plan should discuss how to treat an asthma attack. Also bring your peak flow meter results and all of your medications. Be prepared to discuss your symptoms, and how much your asthma has been bothering you. Often, periodic changes in treatment are needed to keep asthma under control and to prevent asthma attacks. Be prepared to demonstrate using your metered-dose inhaler. Improper use can reduce an inhaler's effectiveness. Your time with your doctor is limited, so preparing a list of questions will help you make the most of your time together. Some good questions to ask your doctor include: Do my medications or treatment plan need to be changed? What are the signs that I may be about to have an asthma attack? What can I take to prevent an asthma attack when my symptoms get worse, or when I'm exposed to my triggers? What steps do I need to take to stop an asthma attack in progress? When do I need to go to the emergency room or seek other emergency treatment? I'm having more heartburn. What can I do to prevent this? Is it time for my flu shot? Am I due for a pneumonia shot? What else can I do to protect my health during cold and flu season? In addition to the questions that you've prepared to ask your doctor, don't hesitate to ask questions during your appointment. Your doctor is likely to ask you a number of questions. Being ready to answer them may reserve time to go over any points you want to spend more time on. Your doctor may ask: Have you noticed anything that makes your asthma worse? Can you show me how you use your inhaled medication? Are you having any problems with your medications? Do you know when to call me or go to the hospital? Do you have any questions about your asthma action plan? Are you having any problems with your asthma action plan? Is there anything you want to be able to do that you can't because of your asthma? All asthma attacks require treatment with a quick-acting (rescue) inhaler such as albuterol. One of the key steps in preventing an asthma attack is to avoid your triggers. If your asthma attacks seem to be set off by outside triggers, your doctor can help you learn how to minimize your exposure to them. Allergy tests can help identify any allergic triggers. Washing your hands frequently can help reduce your risk of catching a cold virus. If your asthma flares up when you exercise in the cold, it may help to cover your face with a mask or scarf until you get warmed up. The best way to avoid an asthma attack is to make sure your asthma is well-controlled in the first place. This means following a written asthma plan to track symptoms and adjust your medication. While you may not be able to eliminate your risk of an asthma attack, you're less likely to have one if your current treatment keeps your asthma under control. Take your inhaled medications as prescribed in your written asthma plan. These preventive medications treat the airway inflammation that causes asthma signs and symptoms. Taken on a daily basis, these medications can reduce or eliminate asthma flare-ups—and your need to use a quick-acting inhaler. See your doctor if you're following your asthma action plan but still have frequent or bothersome symptoms or low peak flow readings. These are signs your asthma isn't well-controlled, and you need to work with your doctor to change your treatment. If your asthma symptoms flare up when you have a cold or the flu, take steps to avoid an asthma attack by watching your lung function and symptoms and adjusting your treatment as needed. Be sure to reduce exposure to your allergy triggers, and wear a face mask when exercising in cold weather. ©1998-2020 Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research (MFMER). All rights reserved.

7dae6916-fdd7-479b-b4d6-d1c38ae604c9,"Asthma is a respiratory condition in which the lung passages become hyper-responsive to different types of stimuli. As a result, the smooth muscle in the wall of the bronchial passages contracts, along with swelling of the mucus membrane lining the airways. This is accompanied by excessive mucus production. All these lead to airway narrowing, resulting in symptoms like breathlessness, wheezing while breathing, coughing and a feeling of tightness in the chest. The severity of these symptoms varies from patient to patient and from day to day. Unlike chronic lung disease where the lung is permanently damaged, asthma is chiefly characterized by its reversibility. No matter how dangerously severe the symptoms are, in all cases, prompt and effective treatment can open the airways again normal breathing can resume. Child holding asthma inhaler in hands. Image Credit: OnlyZoia / Shutterstock Asthma occurs in different patterns. Different types of asthma are classified by their temporal pattern, or the time when attacks occur and the following forms have been identified: In some people episodes of asthma occur between  intervening symptom-free  periods. In most cases, the asthmatic symptoms resolve spontaneously. The symptom-free periods are usually quite long. In such patients viral infections of the respiratory tract such as those which cause the common cold are a common trigger of asthma symptoms. This is especially true in small children between 2-5 years of age who may get 8-12 viral colds and coughs a year. In other cases, strenuous exercise or physical activity, exposure to cold air, or certain environmental agents have been found to act as asthma triggers. has been observed in response to the seasonal release of allergens such as pollens that occur in the environment. Mold spores are another common cause of seasonal asthma. It is important to understand how your local climate and air allergen level vary from season to season to determine whether you have this type of asthma is, and to prevent it by appropriate measures. Higher consumption of meat linked with increased wheezing in children Children with asthma having fewer attacks amid the coronavirus pandemic, study says COVID-19 pandemic drives asthma patients to use telemedicine Everyone with allergies do not necessarily develop asthma, neither do all asthmatics have allergies. However, allergies do intensify asthma in some cases. Thus, exposure to cold or dry air, dust, pet hair or pollen may set off an acute attack of asthma. In addition, there is another type of allergic asthma in which the asthma triggers are not related to season, but may be due to a hyper-reaction of the airway mucosa to things that are not typically allergenic. These include viruses, air pollutants or irritants like tobacco smoke or paint fumes, heavy exercise, certain chemicals in food or drugs, and changes in the weather. This term is used when a bout of exercise is followed by narrowing of the airways. It may be found in up to 80% of people with asthma. However, not all cases of EIB are found in asthma patients. It is thought to be caused by the dehydration and/or heating up that occurs with strenuous physical activity in a dry climate. In children with asthma it is often the first symptom to develop. Certain irritants which are encountered during the course of various sport activities include chlorine in swimming pools, air pollutants while jogging, running or cycling, cold dry air during winter sports, and strong smells due to chemicals or perfumes in a gym environment. The transient and treatable nature of EIB, means that patients with this condition should not be prevented from physical activity at any level whatsoever, provided it is properly managed. Exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (EIB). Image Credit: Lopolo / Shutterstock In this form the symptoms are caused or worsened by chemical irritants or dust in the air. Pre-existing asthma can also become worse with such exposure. Clues to the nature of a patient’s asthma may include the time of earliest symptoms coinciding with a change of workplace or job, an improvement in symptoms upon leaving the workplace, and the occurrence of breathing difficulty due to workplace chemicals. There are over 250 occupational asthma triggers or promoters. As always, pre-existing asthma also increases the risk of this condition, as does smoking and the presence of allergies in the individual or the family. Some high-risk occupations include bakers, manufacturers of drugs and detergents, those who measure grain, metal workers and laboratory workers, plastic workers and woodworkers. Also called persistent asthma, this condition is defined by daily symptoms or those which recur several times a week. The intensity of symptoms may be quite variable, but there are no long periods without symptoms. Acute exacerbations may supervene at any time upon the chronic course of the disease. These may be traced in some cases to seasonal increase in air allergens or viral pathogens that provoke airway inflammation. Chronic asthma must be correctly identified in a patient to ensure proper intervention strategies. Most cases of asthma begin in childhood, but in some patients, the first symptoms appear only in adult life. The causes may be many. Some people were just not exposed to potential triggers for their asthma until they became adults. For example, they are exposed to a house pet when their room-mate brings one home, or they begin to work in an environment containing chemical fumes, that triggers their latent hypersensitivity. It could even be a viral infection that sets off an asthmatic reaction for the first time in adulthood. Acaai.org. (2019). Types of asthma. . Uichildrens.org.

fc2b0782-90b3-46ef-8ab0-188d6844a955,"Medically reviewed by — Living with a chronic condition like asthma means you may experience flare-ups from time to time. This is especially the case if you encounter specific triggers for your asthma. Allergens, weather changes, and viral infections can make your symptoms flare up. Asthma symptoms occur when there’s swelling and constriction in your airways, along with increased mucus. Sometimes you may experience additional symptoms that are considered unusual. While this doesn’t mean the symptoms are rare, having unusual asthma symptoms could mean your treatment is managing your condition well, or an asthma attack is imminent. Learn more about some unusual asthma symptoms and when to talk to your doctor about how you can manage them. Sleeping difficulties may arise with asthma that isn’t well managed. You may experience issues with insomnia, for example. Your airway function naturally decreases during sleep, especially if you have asthma. If you have severe asthma and your treatment isn’t managing your symptoms well, you may find that traditional asthma symptoms, like coughing, are worse when you’re trying to get some shut-eye. If it seems that you almost exclusively experience your symptoms at night, you may have a subtype called nocturnal asthma. You can help decrease your risk for nighttime asthma symptoms by making sure triggers are left outside your sleeping space. This includes: Also, talk to your doctor about medications that reduce airway inflammation, such as inhaled corticosteroids and leukotriene modifiers. When you have an asthma flare-up, a wheezy, wet cough isn’t out of the norm. In fact, coughing is the most prominent symptom in more than of people with asthma. You may also have a lingering cough after recovering from a cold or other sickness that’s made your asthma symptoms worse. However, having only a chronic, dry cough is considered unusual in traditional asthma. It may instead be a sign of a subtype called cough-variant asthma, when you experience a constant cough without excess mucus. This is also known as an unproductive cough. If your asthma symptoms are making it difficult to fall asleep and stay asleep, then you may experience daytime fatigue as a result. A chronic cough can also make you feel tired because you’re using energy during coughing spells. When your body is working overtime to get more oxygen through airways that are inflamed and constricted, you can experience fatigue on a regular basis. Shortness of breath is a classic asthma symptom. It’s the result of airway constriction during a flare-up. Taking quick breaths is a more unusual asthma symptom, though. It’s done as a means of getting more oxygen into the lungs. Rapid breathing may also come in the form of constant sighing or yawning. You may not even realize you’re doing it. While sighing is often due to stress or anxiety, it occasionally can be a sign of asthma. One misconception about people with asthma is that you can’t or shouldn’t exercise. But asthma that’s well managed shouldn’t place any limitations on exercising. Exercise-induced asthma is a subtype of asthma when physical activity triggers airway constriction and inflammation. Certain high-intensity exercises that require deep, rapid breathing can also trigger your symptoms, including running. Aside from the activity itself, other factors can trigger exercise-induced asthma, such as: If you find yourself having to use your rescue inhaler whenever you work out, this likely means your asthma treatment needs to be changed. You may need to see your doctor for a long-term control medication. Some people with asthma may also experience an itchy face and throat in addition to the more traditional symptoms of wheezing and coughing. These itchy sensations aren’t related to asthma itself but may be instead attributed to allergies. If allergens trigger your asthma symptoms, then you may have a subtype called allergic asthma. When you have allergic asthma, you may experience more traditional asthma symptoms. along with: The best way to reduce itchiness and other allergic asthma symptoms is to reduce contact with the substances that trigger your allergies. These may include: Allergy shots, also called immunotherapy, are frequently an effective tool to manage allergic asthma and the other symptoms caused by environmental allergies. While asthma symptoms are largely physical, it’s possible to experience effects to your mood, too. Some people with asthma have anxiety along with difficulty concentrating. Long-term anxiety may also trigger your asthma, creating a cycle that’s hard to break. Since there’s no cure for asthma, the only way to prevent flare-ups is to proactively manage your condition. This includes taking your medications as directed by your doctor and avoiding your triggers whenever possible. Sometimes asthma can cause symptoms that go beyond the usual wheezing, coughing, and chest tightness. It’s especially important to watch out for these unusual asthma symptoms if you have a child or other loved one with asthma. These could be early signs of an impending flare-up or asthma attack. If you consistently experience unusual asthma symptoms, it may be time to see your doctor to modify your current treatment plan.

It’s kind of obvious if you just...can’t really breathe, right? Actually, asthma symptoms can present with a lot more complexity and subtlety than that. There’s a range in how can be and which signs you might experience, Raymond Casciari, M.D., a pulmonologist at St. Joseph Hospital in Orange, California, tells SELF. As a result, it’s possible to write off asthma symptoms for months or even years without realizing you have a persistent—and ultimately treatable—health condition. Even though asthma symptoms can be diverse, at its core the condition follows a pretty specific playbook. Asthma impacts your airways, which extend between your nose and mouth and your lungs. Those airways have the critical role of carrying air in and out of your body, and they can get inflamed by triggers like , pollen, mold, cold air, cigarette smoke, , and respiratory infections like colds, according to the (NHLBI). That inflammation can cause swelling, which in turn can prompt the muscles around your airways to tighten, making it hard to get air in and out. At the same time, your airways might also expel more mucus than they usually do, making it even harder to breathe. So what are the asthma symptoms and signs you should watch out for? It’s possible that you’ll have such a mild reaction to one of your personal asthma triggers that you don’t take much note of it. But if the effects get worse, they can turn into an , which is a potentially life-threatening exacerbation of asthma symptoms. That’s why it’s so important to know the common signs of asthma, including the more subtle ones. : This is an obvious complication that happens when you can’t get enough oxygen due to the way your airways and their surrounding muscles are reacting to asthma triggers, Sadia Benzaquen, M.D., a pulmonologist and associate professor in the department of internal medicine at the University of Cincinnati College of Medicine, tells SELF. : If you have asthma, you may notice that you have a cough, which makes sense. Coughing is your body’s way of trying to get rid of irritants and secretions in your lungs, according to the . You may also notice your cough is worse at night, May-Lin Wilgus, M.D., a pulmonologist and assistant clinical professor at UCLA, tells SELF. This is likely because at night, your body can release that may promote more bodily inflammation, including in your airways. That can cause your airways to narrow and make you cough, Dr. Wilgus says. : When your airways narrow, you don’t have as much space through which to breathe. As a result, you can experience wheezing, which may sound similar to the whistling sound you might hear if you were to breathe through a straw, Purvi Parikh, M.D., an allergist/immunologist with Allergy & Asthma Network, tells SELF. : When you have asthma, it’s tough to get air in—but it’s also tough to get air out, Dr. Casciari says. “If you take a really deep breath and then try to take another one on top of it, your chest feels tight. That’s what it can feel like when you have asthma, because air gets trapped in there,” he says. Some people may have these less common signs of asthma: : OK, so we did cover that coughing can be one of many common signs of asthma—but a might also be the sign of asthma you have. That’s because there’s this entire called , which can make it easier for this health condition to fly under the radar. If you have it, you can cough in response to triggers like pollen, animal dander, and mold, but you won’t experience other signs of asthma like wheezing or breathlessness, Dr. Wilgus says. : Depending on the severity of your asthma, you might have trouble sleeping at night. Things like trouble breathing and coughing can make it hard to fall asleep or wake you up, then make it hard to get back to sleep, Dr. Parikh says. : If you have too much trouble fully expelling air from your lungs, which can happen often if you have asthma, you might automatically breathe more quickly to make up for it, Dr. Casciari says. : Obviously having a terrible cold or doesn’t automatically mean you have asthma. But people with asthma often have that seem to last longer and be worse than what others experience, because that infection causes even more inflammation in their airways, Dr. Casciari says. : If you have uncontrolled asthma, you’re not getting enough oxygen to your muscles, which can make you feel physically wiped out, Dr. Benzaquen says. In general, the symptoms of an asthma attack are similar to those of having asthma—they’re just magnified, Dr. Casciari says. For example, you’ll likely have severe shortness of breath, uncontrollable coughing, loud wheezing, and severe while having an asthma attack, according to the . If you’re having an asthma attack, your symptoms might not get better with a rescue inhaler, which is a portable device with a quick-acting agent to open up your airways. Low readings on a peak flow meter, a different portable device that measures lung capacity, can also be a sign of an asthma attack, the says. First things first, you need to get yourself to a doctor. There, you’ll probably undergo a physical exam to look at your overall health before your doctor gives you specific tests to look at your lung function. One of those tests is a spirometry, which checks how much air you can blow out after taking a deep breath, as well as how fast you can blow it out, the says. Your doctor may also have you do a peak flow test, which measures how hard you can expel air. If you can’t blow out enough air or do it quickly enough, it could be a sign that you have asthma, Dr. Casciari says. Typically, doctors will start there, and see how you do, Dr. Benzaquen says. But there are other tests that your doctor can use, like exposing you to methacholine, a known (and mild) asthma trigger, to see if your airways narrow, or allergy testing, since and asthma are often linked. (, which is when exposure to allergens triggers asthma symptoms, is clear evidence of this connection.) Like many health conditions, all forms of asthma aren’t alike. When making a diagnosis, doctors generally divide asthma into four categories, per the : : This means you have minimal asthma symptoms for up to two days a week and up to two nights a month. : You have symptoms more than twice a week, but not more than once on any given day. : This means you have symptoms once a day and more than one night a week. : You have constant symptoms most days and often at night, too. One of the most important ways to treat asthma is to avoid being exposed to your triggers, Dr. Wilgus says. Of course, that can feel impossible if your trigger is something that’s seemingly everywhere, like dust or pollen. Though you can definitely to to those, avoiding them entirely is tough. Luckily, there are medications that can help when you’ve done everything you can trigger-wise. Asthma medications can generally be split into two categories: long-term preventive medications and fast-acting drugs that can help when you’re having an asthma attack or on your way to one. Long-term preventive medications like allergy medications and inhaled anti-inflammatory corticosteroids are designed to help control your asthma so you’re less likely to have an asthma attack in the first place, the says. Quick relief medications (also called rescue medications) like short-acting beta agonists that you use via an inhaler can help relax your airways when they’re acting up enough that your asthma is noticeably worse. Once you and your doctor have figured out the best way to treat your asthma, the two of you should jot it all down in an . That’s essentially a written document that spells out your treatment, including which medications to take when your asthma is well-controlled, which to turn to when you’re having some asthma issues, and which to try when you’re having an asthma attack. It also includes information like your doctor’s contact information and notifies you of which asthma symptoms are signs that you should seek immediate medical treatment. Make no mistake: If you have asthma, creating an action plan is crucial. “It’s important to have a plan with your physician for what to do when your asthma symptoms flare,” Dr. Wilgus says. Whatever you do, don’t resign yourself to living with asthma symptoms like trouble breathing and coughing all the time. “Asthma is a very controllable illness as long as the signs and symptoms are not ignored,” Dr. Parikh says.

33633858-b260-4a77-8ac0-9b0620ffbf33,"COVID-19 updates, including vaccine information, for our patients and visitors Asthma is a potentially deadly, commonly chronic lung disease that affects approximately 1 in 11 children and 1 in 12 adults in the U.S. Asthma can have a significant impact on health and quality of life. One of the main characteristics of asthma is inflammation and narrowing of the airways. Airways are tubes that help carry air in and out of your lungs. When inflammation and narrowing occurs, less air is able to flow in and out. During asthma symptoms, it is common for the airways to produce more mucus than usual. This extra mucus can further limit the airflow within the airways. It is predicted that the number of people with asthma will grow to worldwide by 2025. -- . While asthma can affect people at any age, it is common for symptoms to start during childhood or as a young adult. Colds that don’t seem to go away (ten days or longer) Coughing after exercise or after being exposed to cold or dry air If you are experiencing one or several of these symptoms, you should schedule a pulmonary evaluation with your doctor. An asthma attack is an acute episode of wheezing, coughing and/or chest tightness. Difficulty breathing is usually associated with an asthma attack. Asthma attacks can range from mild to severe. Since severe cases can lead to death, knowing about the disease and how to handle an acute attack is very important. Our experts can work with you to create a customized that can help minimize asthma attacks. If you have diagnosed asthma and your short-acting inhaler such as albuterol (e.g., 4-6 puffs) does not improve symptoms, you should contact 9-1-1 or go to the . In order to make a proper diagnosis, your doctor will: Review your exposure to pollutants, family asthma history, smoking history, history of seasonal and/or food allergies. Conduct a physical exam. This usually involves listening to your lungs and an examination of your skin, ears, eyes, oral cavity, nose and chest. Conduct spirometry (if necessary). Spirometry is a lung function test that measures how fast you can move air in and out of your lungs. A bronchodilator test should be performed following spirometry to look for hyperreactivity of the airway. If the results of your spirometry test are negative, additional testing may be needed. Other diagnostic tests that may help in the initial evaluation: : Mild constriction in the airways is deliberately triggered and the reaction of the lungs is assessed. : Looks for abnormalities in the lungs. Sometimes a CT scan following a chest X-ray is necessary to rule out other important medical conditions such as emphysema or bronchiectasis. : This test helps diagnose exercise-induced asthma by purposely triggering constriction in the airways. : Recommended in the initial evaluation to identify potential allergens (e.g., skin dander or certain pollens). A (prick test) or a blood test (RAST) can help assess the body’s response to allergens that may cause or contribute to the presence of asthma. We provide thorough, state-of-the-art exercise and lung function testing in our . In addition to diagnosing lung disease, our testing laboratory also determines oxygen needs to help you manage breathing problems. If you have a family history of asthma, you have an increased risk of having the disease. Although there are some recognized factors that trigger asthma symptoms, many cases have no known triggers. Common triggers and conditions associated with asthma: Exposure to chemical pollutants or irritants at home or in the workplace Tobacco smoke is a common trigger for asthma attacks. People who are exposed to second-hand smoke during childhood are more likely to develop asthma. Furthermore, people who smoke do not respond as well to inhaled asthma treatments as non-smokers. ​ ​. Asthma that is triggered by an allergic reaction is very common. About 70 percent of people who have asthma may also have allergies to some degree – this is known as allergic asthma. People with non-allergic (intrinsic) and allergic asthma (extrinsic) have similar symptoms. Allergy testing (e.g., ) can help determine if allergies are present and if they potentially contribute to your asthma. Some of the known allergens that can trigger asthma symptoms include: Learn more about asthma triggers in our Health Library. Any form of exercise can trigger asthma. If you are diagnosed with exercise-induced asthma, using a short-term bronchodilator (e.g., albuterol) 20 to 30 minutes prior to exercise may prevent symptoms. : While swimming can be a good exercise option for those with exercise-induced asthma, exposure to chlorine in pools may exacerbate symptoms or cause asthma symptoms to develop. Intense emotions of happiness and sadness can trigger wheezing and shortness of breath. Our respiratory therapists can show you behavioral techniques that can help reduce stress levels for better asthma control. Common colds and inflammation of the sinuses (sinusitis) are the most common causes of asthma exacerbations, especially during the winter season. Staying current on vaccinations is important in disease prevention (e.g., flu or pneumonia vaccines). If you have a lung infection in the upper or lower airway and you are experiencing respiratory symptoms such as shortness of breath or coughing, seek treatment immediately. Several studies have been done over the last few decades to confirm a relationship between gastroesophageal reflux disease and asthma. The results are mixed: While some studies support a connection between the two, other studies do not.  If you have symptoms of heartburn, let your doctor know to see if it may be contributing to your asthma symptoms.

Reviewed By: Asthma is a chronic lung disorder that can make breathing difficult. It features narrow, inflamed airways (bronchial tubes). ""Asthma"" is an ancient Greek word meaning ""short breath,"" and as the name implies, it can leave you gasping for air. One of the telltale signs of an asthma attacks is wheezing with difficulty breathing. Other asthma symptoms include chest tightness, coughing, and shortness of breath. When the breathing tubes of the lungs become chronically inflamed, they can become sensitive to inhaled environmental allergens and irritants that can trigger asthma. These environmental triggers include pollen, pollution, and tobacco smoke. Exercise can also be an asthma trigger for some. About 25 million people in the U.S. have asthma; about 6 million of these are children. The condition affects men and women equally. Asthma causes over 14 million visits to doctors each year and nearly 2 million emergency room visits. And, tragically, asthma can kill. Most people who die from asthma are over age 50, but children sometimes die of the condition. Asthma inhalers and nebulizers have advantages over oral medications and injections in that they deliver medicine directly to your airways. They also have fewer side effects than other forms of asthma medication. The most common treatment for asthma involves a device called an inhaler. An inhaler is a small device that delivers asthma medicine directly to the airways. Inhalers come in two types: Metered Dose Inhalers (MDI): MDIs are the most common type of inhaler. They spray medicine from the inhaler like an aerosol can. Dry powder inhalers: Dry powder inhalers deliver a powdered medicine that does not spray from the inhaler. Instead, the user must inhale the medicine quickly and forcefully. Sometimes MDIs are used along with a device called a spacer. Spacers help coordinate breathing with the release of the asthma medicine, and use smaller droplets of medicine, making it easier to breath them in. An inhaler cannot be used for babies and very young children. For them, a nebulizer can be used. Nebulizers are powered by electricity to turn asthma medicine into a fine mist. Respiration is the process by which our bodies inhale oxygen and express carbon dioxide. This process becomes more difficult during an asthmatic attack. When you inhale, air passes through your windpipe (trachea). Meanwhile your diaphragm contracts and moves downward creating air space in your chest cavity. The air enters your lungs, passing through the bronchial tubes and finally into tiny air sacs (alveoli). Oxygen from the air passes from the alveoli and into the bloodstream through tiny blood vessels called capillaries. Capillaries deliver this oxygen-rich blood to pulmonary veins, which pass it to the left side of your heart. The heart then pumps the oxygen-rich blood to the rest of your body. When you exhale, air that is rich in carbon dioxide (CO2) passes out of your lungs, through your windpipe, and out your body through your nose and/or mouth. During an asthma attack, airways become inflamed and sensitive. Swelling narrows the airways, making breathing difficult, often leading to panting and gasping fits. Three factors cause this narrowing: Inflammation is the main cause of airway narrowing during asthma episodes. It makes airways more swollen and sensitive. When airways are inflamed, air has a smaller passageway. In addition, the surrounding muscles of the airways may tighten during an asthma attack, further narrowing the opening for airflow. When airways react to inflammation, they also produce more mucus. This thick, sticky liquid can clump together and also narrow air passages. Moreover, certain allergy and inflammation cells (white blood cells, including eosinophils) accumulate at the site of the inflammation, causing tissue damage further narrowing airways. This chain reaction causes the breathing difficulty associated with an asthma attack. The larger tubes that split off from your trachea and into your lungs are called your bronchial tubes. These tubes are surrounded by muscles. When the muscles of your bronchial tubes contract in asthma, they obstruct your airways, a process referred to as bronchospasm. Coughing and wheezing may be symptoms of bronchospasm, and bronchospasm can occur when the airways are irritated by cold air. Bronchospasm may come on suddenly. It can be treated by medicines called bronchodilators. People with asthma may become overly sensitive (hyperreactive) to certain inhaled allergens or irritants. These are called triggers of asthma, and these triggers can cause inflammation and narrowing of your airways. This occurs because some people's bodies are immunologically inclined to overreact to certain substances. The precise substance that may cause such a reaction varies from person to person. In the next three slides, we'll review asthma triggers in more detail. Things that can initiate an asthma attack are referred to as ""triggers."" Not everyone with asthma has the same triggers. Triggers can be allergens or irritants. People with asthma need to learn what their triggers are to optimally manage and avoid them. Recognizing and avoiding triggers can help you prevent further asthma attacks. Allergists and immunologists are medical doctors who specialize in helping patients identify irritants and allergies that cause problems like asthma. They can help develop a plan to avoid asthma triggers to optimize daily health. Asthma can have both allergic and nonallergic triggers. Allergic asthma triggers include many allergens. Some of these allergens include: Some foods, including peanuts, egg, dairy, soy, and fish Nonallergic asthma triggers include many irritants. Some of these come from environmental toxins, including tobacco smoke, smog, and various chemicals, dusts, and occupational gases. They can also come from medications, such as over-the-counter painkillers and beta-blockers. Sometimes respiratory infections can trigger asthma, and so can GERD. Exercise can also bring on asthma attacks. Asthma can develop at any age. However, asthma does tend to start in children ages 2-6. At this age, asthma is commonly triggered by allergens such as dust mites, tobacco smoke, and dust mites. In young children, asthma may first be diagnosed as reactive airway disease (RAD). Adults can also develop asthma, and only about 30% of adult-onset asthma triggers are related to allergies. Risk factors for adult-onset asthma include being female, obesity, hormonal fluctuations such as those experienced during or after pregnancy or menopause, and viral or other infections. Allergic (extrinsic) asthma is the type triggered by an allergic reaction. This is an example of your immune system responding to an irritant. Allergic asthma is the most common form, affecting more than half of all sufferers. It can often be managed with medication, and tends to be less severe than other forms. Non-allergic (intrinsic) asthma is caused by factors other than allergies, such as exercise, stress, inhaling cold air, smoke, viral infections, and other irritants. This type of asthma is less common, develops more often in adults, and is more difficult to treat than allergic (extrinsic) asthma. In many cases this type seems to be more severe. Different people experience asthma in different ways. When asthma is under control, you may have fewer symptoms or no symptoms. Symptoms of asthma are the same for both allergic and non-allergic types. They include Not everyone with asthma will experience every symptom, and the severity of symptoms can vary depending on the individual—even in an individual symptoms may vary over time. The National Asthma Education and Prevention Program classifies asthma based on a patient's symptoms and lung function tests into these four categories: An asthma attack is an acute worsening of asthma symptoms. During an acute asthma attack, there is inflammation, bronchospasm, and excess mucus production. These can lead to symptoms such as Frequently, asthma attacks can be controlled with inhalers (inhaled bronchodilators). When that is ineffective, the patient should call 911 or be taken to an emergency room immediately. When asthma does not respond to initial treatment it can result in a life-threatening reaction called status asthmaticus. There are several tests that can determine whether you have asthma and how severe it is. Lung (pulmonary) function tests measure how functional your lungs are. These may include spirometry or peak flow meter tests. A bronchial challenge test helps the doctor determine how reactive your lungs are to environmental triggers. This testing includes a methacholine challenge test, a histamine challenge test, and bronchoprovocation. Blood tests measure the IgE antibodies that are released during an allergic reaction. Other tests may be used to rule out other causes of shortness of breath, including acid reflux and sleep apnea. Sometimes chest x-rays or EKGs are performed to detect a foreign object in the lungs or another condition. Asthma medications are classified as either for long-term control, or quick relief. Most are inhaled rather than taken in tablet or liquid form, to act directly on the airways where the breathing problems start. Montelukast, oral medicine that helps prevent wheezing and shortness of breath Albuterol and other short-acting beta2-agonists (bronchodilators) Common medications used with inhalers and nebulizers include the following three types: : Inhaled corticosteroids reduce airway inflammation. Sometimes these medicines are used even for people who don’t have any asthma symptoms, as they can help prevent future asthma attacks. : Bronchodilators have no steroids. They work by relaxing the tiny muscles that can tighten airways during asthma attacks. Short-acting bronchodilators relieve asthma symptoms quickly. : Long-acting bronchodilators are taken daily to help control asthma and prevent future asthma attacks. Types of long-acting bronchodilators include salmeterol and formoterol. Asthma is a chronic lung disorder that can make breathing difficult. It causes inflammation, swelling, and narrowing of the airways (bronchial tubes). About 25 million people in the U.S have asthma; 6 million of those are children. Asthma is diagnosed based on the physical exam and the patient's history. It is confirmed with breathing tests. Asthma is caused by three major factors: inflammation, bronchospasm, and hyperreactivity. Allergy plays a role in some, but not all asthma cases. Allergens and irritants can cause asthma attacks. When they do, they are called ""triggers.""

Asthma Treatment: 3 Steps to Better Asthma Control Asthma Treatment: 3 Steps to Better Asthma Control Follow this three-step approach to keep asthma symptoms under control and prevent asthma attacks. Effective treatment requires routinely tracking symptoms and measuring how well your lungs are working. Taking an active role in managing your asthma treatment will help you maintain better long-term asthma control, prevent asthma attacks, and avoid long-term problems. Create a written asthma action plan with your doctor. This written plan will serve as an asthma treatment guide tailored to your specific needs. It will help you follow these three important steps and keep a good record of your asthma treatment: Write down your symptoms in an asthma diary each day. Recording symptoms can help you recognize when you need to make treatment adjustments according to your asthma action plan. Use your asthma diary to record: Shortness of breath or whistling sounds when you exhale (wheezing). Disturbed sleep caused by shortness of breath, coughing, or wheezing. Quick-relief (rescue) inhaler use—record when you need to use your quick-relief inhaler, such as albuterol (Proventil HFA, Ventolin HFA), and write down how many puffs you take. Disruptions to work, school, exercise, or other day-to-day activities caused by asthma symptoms. Hay fever symptoms such as sneezing and runny nose. Your doctor may have you periodically record results of breathing tests (lung function tests). If your lungs aren't working as well as they should be, your asthma may not be under control. There are two main lung function tests: This test is done at home with a simple hand-held device called a peak flow meter. A peak expiratory flow measurement indicates how fast you can force air out of your lungs. Peak flow readings are sometimes gauged as a percentage of how your lungs work at their best. This is called your personal best peak flow. Spirometry tests can be done at your doctor's office with a machine called a spirometer. Some people use a hand-held spirometer to take measurements at home. Spirometry tests measure how much air your lungs can hold and how much air you can exhale in one second after you've taken a deep breath. This measurement is called forced expiratory volume (FEV). Your FEV measurement is compared with the typical FEV for people who don't have asthma. As with your peak flow reading, this comparison is often expressed as a percentage. 3. Adjust treatment according to your asthma action plan. When your lungs aren't working as well as they should be, you may need to adjust your medications according to the plan you made with your doctor ahead of time. Your written asthma action plan will let you know exactly when and how to make adjustments. The chart below can help you determine if you're doing a good job of keeping your asthma under control. A similar system should be included in your asthma action plan. Depending on where your asthma control falls on the chart, you may need to make adjustments to your medications. Levels of asthma control in children older than 12 and adults Symptoms such as coughing, wheezing, or shortness of breath More than 80 percent of your predicted personal bestLess than 60 percent of your predicted personal best There are two main types of medications used to treat asthma: such as inhaled corticosteroids are the most important medications used to keep asthma under control. These preventive medications treat the airway inflammation that leads to asthma symptoms. Used on a daily basis, these medications can reduce or eliminate asthma flare-ups. contain a fast-acting medication such as albuterol (Proventil HFA, Ventolin HFA). These medications are sometimes called rescue inhalers. They're used as needed to quickly open your airways and make breathing easier. Knowing when to use these medications can help prevent an impending asthma attack. Long-term control medications are the key to keeping your asthma controlled and in the green zone. If you frequently use a quick-relief inhaler to treat symptoms, your asthma isn't under control. See your doctor about making treatment changes. Make sure you know how to use your asthma medications properly. They will only keep your asthma under control if you use them correctly. Asthma symptoms and severity are always changing. Following your plan will help you avoid asthma attacks and minimize the disruptions caused by asthma symptoms. Meet with your doctor regularly to review your treatment. Take your asthma diary and action plan with you so that you can review them with your doctor and make any needed changes to your treatment plan. Here are some reasons why you might need to adjust your medications: If you're still having bothersome symptoms even though you're following your plan, talk to your doctor about possibly increasing or changing your medications. If your asthma is well-controlled, you may be able to reduce the amount of medication you take. If you have seasonal allergy triggers, your asthma medication may need to be increased at certain times of the year. ©1998-2020 Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research (MFMER).

Asthma causes swelling and in the airways that lead to your lungs. When asthma flares up, the airways tighten and become narrower. This keeps the air from passing through easily and makes it hard for you to breathe. These flare-ups are also called asthma attacks or exacerbations (say ""ig-zas-er-BAY-shuns""). Asthma affects people in different ways. Some people have asthma attacks only during allergy season, or when they breathe in cold air, or when they exercise. Others have many bad attacks that send them to the doctor often. Even if you have few asthma attacks, you still need to treat your asthma.

In some people, an causes asthma symptoms. An makes the immune system cells release chemicals that cause inflammation. Studies show that exposure to allergens such as , cockroaches, and may influence asthma's development. Asthma is much more common in people who have allergies. But not all people who have allergies get asthma. And not all those who have asthma have allergies. Environmental factors and today's germ-conscious lifestyle may play a role in the development of asthma. Some experts believe that there are more cases of asthma because of pollution and less exposure to certain types of bacteria or infections. As a result, children's immune systems may develop in a way that makes it more likely they will also get allergies and asthma. Asthma in adults also can be related to exposure to substances at work. This is called . Symptoms of asthma can be mild or severe. You may have no symptoms, severe symptoms every day, or something in between. How often you have symptoms can also change.

URIs cause more than half of the asthma attacks in adults. , such as dust mites, mold, or , in people allergic to them. About the effect that pets in the home have on getting asthma. A review of several studies found that having a pet cat appeared to protect against asthma, while pet dogs slightly increased the risk of asthma. The effect of other furry pets on the risk of asthma was not clear. If your child already has asthma and allergies to pets, having a pet in the home may make his or her asthma worse. if: Call your doctor now or seek immediate medical care if: Your symptoms do not get better after you have followed your asthma action plan.

This test is needed when you have symptoms off and on but have normal spirometry test results. An may be used if the spirometry test results have been normal or near normal but asthma is still suspected. These tests measure how quickly you can breathe in and out after exercise or after using a medicine. An inhalation challenge also may be done using a specific irritant or if your doctor suspects .

Asthma medicines are divided into two groups: those for prevention and long-term control of inflammation and those that provide quick relief for asthma attacks. are used daily for . are used as needed and provide rapid relief of symptoms during asthma attacks. Most medicines for asthma are inhaled. Inhaled medicines are used because a specific dose can be given directly to the . include metered-dose and dry powder and . Doctors recommend using a with an MDI to better deliver the medicine to the lungs. For many people, a spacer makes an MDI easier to use. . These are the preferred controller medicines for long-term treatment of asthma. They reduce inflammation of your airways. You take them every day to keep asthma under control and to prevent sudden and severe symptoms (asthma attacks). They include budesonide, fluticasone, and mometasone. Oral or injected corticosteroids (systemic corticosteroids). They get your asthma under control before you start taking daily medicine. You may also need these medicines to treat asthma attacks. Oral corticosteroids are used much more than injected corticosteroids. They include methylprednisolone and prednisone. for asthma attacks. They relax the airways, allowing you to breathe easier. These quick-relief medicines include albuterol. There are other long-term medicines for daily treatment. They include: Anticholinergics (such as tiotropium) for poorly controlled asthma. Leukotriene pathway modifiers (such as montelukast, zafirlukast, and zileuton). Long-acting beta2-agonists (such as formoterol and salmeterol). They are always used with an inhaled corticosteroid as a single medicine combination. Less commonly, mast cell stabilizers (such as cromolyn) or theophylline. Magnesium sulfate may be used if asthma does not improve with standard treatment. Anticholinergics (such as ipratropium) are sometimes used for severe asthma attacks. Your doctor may recommend other medicines if you have severe allergic asthma and the symptoms aren't relieved by avoiding allergens or by taking standard medicines. Examples include mepolizumab and omalizumab. A quick-relief medicine, racepinephrine (Asthmanefrin), is available without a prescription. This medicine isn't used with an inhaler. It comes with an atomizer that delivers the medicine as a mist. Be safe with medicine. Read and follow all instructions on the label. Medicine treatment for asthma depends on your age and type of asthma, and how well the treatment is controlling your asthma symptoms. The least amount of medicine that controls the asthma symptoms is used. The amount of medicine and number of medicines are increased in steps. So if asthma isn't controlled at a low dose of one controller medicine, the dose may be increased. Or another medicine may be added. If the asthma has been under control for several months at a certain dose of medicine, the dose may be reduced. This can help find the least amount of medicine that will control the asthma. Quick-relief medicine is used to treat asthma attacks. But if you need to use quick-relief medicine a lot, the amount and number of controller medicines may be changed. Your doctor will work with you to help find the number and dose of medicines that work best. One of the best tools for managing asthma is a daily controller medicine that has a corticosteroid (""steroid""). But some people worry about taking steroid medicines because of myths they've heard about them. If you're making a decision about a steroid inhaler, . At the start of asthma treatment, the number and dosage of medicines are chosen to get the asthma under control. Your doctor may start you at a higher dose within your asthma so that the inflammation is controlled right away. After the asthma has been controlled for several months, the dose of the last medicine added is reduced to the lowest possible dose that prevents symptoms. This is known as step-down care. Step-down care is believed to be a better way to control inflammation in the airways than starting at lower doses of medicine and increasing the dose if it is not enough. Because quick-relief medicine quickly reduces symptoms, people sometimes overuse these medicines instead of using the slower-acting long-term medicines. But may have harmful effects, such as reducing how well these medicines will work for you in the future. You may have to take more than one medicine each day to manage your asthma. Help yourself remember when to take each medicine, such as taping a note to your refrigerator to remind yourself. Tell your doctor about all the medicines you are taking, so he or she can choose asthma medicines that won't interfere with other medicines. Some people only have symptoms during certain times of the year (seasonal asthma). If you know when you will most likely have symptoms, start using a medicine to decrease inflammation before the symptoms start. If you have severe asthma, bronchial thermoplasty may be an option. This treatment is being studied in . For this treatment, is used to apply heat to the airways. This may help reduce the thickness of the airways and may help improve the ability to breathe. If you have asthma symptoms that are triggered by , your doctor may recommend immunotherapy. For this treatment, you get allergy shots or use pills that have a small amount of certain allergens in them. Your body ""gets used to"" the allergen, so you react less to it over time. This kind of treatment may help prevent or reduce some allergy symptoms. For some people, reduce asthma symptoms and the need for medicines. But allergy shots don't work equally well for all allergens. Allergy shots should not be given when asthma is poorly controlled. is a term used for a wide variety of health care practices that may be used along with standard medical treatment. Some people have found that mind and body practices such as , breathing exercises, and have been helpful for their asthma. But reviewers who have looked at the research say that there isn't enough scientific evidence to say that complementary practices will help people who have asthma. Talk with your doctor about any complementary health practice that you would like to try or are already using. Your doctor can help you manage your health better if he or she has the whole picture about your health. For more information on alternative treatments, see the topic . McGeady SJ (2004).

Asthma also leads to the production of mucus in your airways. Asthma causes wheezing, shortness of breath, and coughing. can be very mild and need little or no medical treatment. However, it can also be severe and life-threatening. Medical professionals rank asthma into four types from mild to severe. These types are determined by the frequency and severity of your asthma symptoms. With mild intermittent asthma, the symptoms are mild. This classification means you’ll have symptoms up to two days per week or two nights per month. This asthma type will usually not hinder any of your activities and can include exercise-induced asthma. You will usually only need a rescue inhaler to treat this mild form of asthma. You don’t typically need daily medication since your symptoms only occur occasionally. However, your medication needs will be assessed based on how severe your attacks are when they do occur. Your doctor may also prescribe allergy medications if your asthma is triggered by . If your asthma is exercise induced, your doctor may instruct you to use your rescue inhaler before exercise to prevent symptoms. The largest number of people with asthma have mild asthma. Mild intermittent and mild persistent are the most common types of asthma. Mild asthma is more likely than other types to be untreated since the symptoms are so mild. A number of factors increase your risk for any type of asthma. These include: If you have mild persistent asthma, your symptoms are still mild but occur more than twice per week. For this type classification, you don’t have symptoms more than once per day. At this asthma level your doctor may prescribe a low-dose inhaled corticosteroid medication. An is taken by quickly inhaling it. It’s usually taken daily. Your doctor may also prescribe a rescue inhaler to have in case your symptoms still occur from time to time. Your doctor may also prescribe allergy medications if your asthma is triggered by allergies. For those over the age of 5, a round of oral corticosteroids may also be considered. The factors that increase your risk of developing any type of asthma include: With moderate persistent asthma you’ll have symptoms once each day, or most days. You will also have symptoms at least one night each week. For moderate persistent asthma, your doctor will usually prescribe a slightly higher dose of inhaled corticosteroid that’s used for mild persistent asthma. A rescue inhaler will also be prescribed for any onset of symptoms. Your doctor may also prescribe allergy medications if your asthma is triggered by allergies. Oral corticosteroids may also be added for people aged 5 and older. The factors that increase your risk of developing any type of asthma include: If you have severe persistent asthma, you’ll have symptoms several times during the day. These symptoms will occur almost every day. You will also have symptoms many nights each week. Severe persistent asthma doesn’t respond well to medications even when taken regularly. If you have severe persistent asthma, your treatment will be more aggressive and may involve experimenting with combinations and dosages. Your doctor will work to find the combination that gives you be most control over your symptoms. inhaled corticosteroids — at a higher dose than with other asthma types oral corticosteroids — at a higher dose than with other asthma types medications that will help combat the cause or trigger Severe persistent asthma can affect any age group. It can start as another type of asthma and become severe later. It can also start as severe, though in these cases you probably had a milder case of asthma that wasn’t previously diagnosed. Severe persistent asthma can be triggered by a respiratory illness like pneumonia. Hormonal changes may also cause an onset of severe asthma. It is the least common type of asthma. Factors that increase your risk of developing any type of asthma include: With any type of asthma, educating yourself about your condition is important in managing your symptoms. Everyone with asthma should also have an asthma action plan. An asthma action plan is developed with your doctor and lists the steps that you need to take in case of an asthma attack. Since even mild asthma has the possibility of increasing in severity, you should follow the treatment plan your doctor gives you and have regular checkups.

02021e97-d96d-46bc-b4cd-9bf06b25287d,"Everything You Should Know About Asthma Attacks and Panic Attacks Medically reviewed by — One of the main goals when you live with asthma is to manage your symptoms to avoid having an asthma attack. Environmental triggers such as pollen and pet dander can bring on asthma complications. Another common trigger for asthma symptoms is severe stress. Stress itself is a normal part of life. But when left unmanaged, stress can lead to anxiety. It’s also possible to have both stress and an anxiety disorder. Severe anxiety can even lead to a panic attack. Sometimes it’s difficult to distinguish between an asthma attack and a panic attack because they have similar symptoms. But these are two different conditions that require separate considerations for management and treatment. The better you’re able to manage both asthma and anxiety, the less likely you are to experience an asthma or panic attack. Asthma is caused by underlying inflammation and constriction of your airways or bronchial tubes. Both inflammation and constriction can make it hard to breathe. This causes symptoms like wheezing, chest tightness, and coughing. When you have an asthma attack, your bronchial tubes constrict even further, making it difficult to breathe. Wheezing may be audible, and you may have tightness or a rattling sensation in your chest. Depending on the severity of your asthma attack, your symptoms could last from several minutes to hours, or even days. Quick-relief medications (bronchodilators) can reduce your symptoms and stop the attack. But if your symptoms continue to get worse, you may need to seek emergency medical attention. An asthma attack is brought on by triggers that irritate your lungs. These can include: allergens, such as pollen, animal dander, and dust mites chemicals, including perfume, smoke, and cleaning products exercise, especially if it’s more strenuous than what you’re used to A panic attack is a severe bout of anxiety that comes on suddenly. When you’re having a panic attack, you may experience shortness of breath and chest tightness. This can feel similar to an asthma attack. But unlike coughing and wheezing associated with asthma, panic attacks can also cause: feelings of detachment from yourself and your surroundings A panic attack can peak after , and then often begins to subside. While a panic attack can occur in the middle of a state of severe anxiety, these symptoms can also occur unexpectedly when you feel calm. Both asthma and panic attacks can cause breathing difficulties and a tight feeling in your chest. One key difference is that the constriction in your airways during an asthma attack can decrease oxygen intake, while hyperventilation in a panic attack can oxygen flow. Panic attacks also pose a wide range of symptoms beyond breathing difficulties. Wheezing and coughing are also symptoms usually only associated with asthma attacks. Psychologically, both asthma and anxiety can create stress. It can feel like a never-ending cycle if you live with both of these conditions. But recognizing the difference between asthma and anxiety can help you and your doctor create a more effective treatment plan. For example, some medications used to treat asthma, such as bronchodilators, have the side effect of making anxiety worse. Managing your asthma can make a difference in airway function. Plus, experiencing fewer symptoms can make you feel less stressed about your condition overall. You should see your doctor about making changes to your current asthma treatment plan if: You’re wheezing more throughout the day and night. You experience frequent coughing and chest tightness that make it difficult to fall asleep. You’re relying on your rescue inhaler more than a few times per week. An asthma attack is typically treated with a quick-relief medication, such as your rescue inhaler. If you continue to have asthma attacks, you may need a corticosteroid inhaler or leukotriene modifier to decrease airway inflammation. Emergency medical care may be required if you continue to experience shortness of breath. Anxiety that builds up can lead to panic attacks. If you experience frequent anxiety, consider seeking help from a mental health professional. They can help you work through your anxiety and reduce the likelihood of external stressors triggering a panic attack. Even if you don’t have an anxiety disorder, stress itself is a fact of life. However, stress can also trigger your asthma, so it’s important to manage it as best as you can. Some steps you can take to reduce everyday stress include: relaxation techniques, such as meditation and deep breathing exercises making time for socializing and doing activities you enjoy outside of work and other obligations While asthma attacks and panic attacks share some similarities, they have very different symptoms overall. It’s possible to experience anxiety and asthma at the same time, which can make it difficult to distinguish between the two. If you’re consistently experiencing asthma or panic attacks, it may be because you’re not getting proper treatment for one. Tracking your symptoms can help your doctor get you on the right treatment.

Our general interest e-newsletter keeps you up to date on a wide variety of health topics. Diagnosing asthma generally includes a medical history, physical exam and lung tests. An asthma diagnosis is based on several factors, including a detailed medical history, a physical exam, your symptoms, and overall health and test results. The first step in diagnosing asthma is talking to your doctor about your symptoms and your health. This can provide clues as to whether asthma or something else is causing your symptoms. Your doctor will likely ask about your symptoms and your exposure to substances that have been linked to asthma. Questions might include: What are your symptoms? When do they occur? What, if anything, seems to trigger them? Are you often exposed to tobacco smoke, chemical fumes, dust or other airborne irritants? Do you have hay fever or another allergic condition? Do you have blood relatives, such as a parent, aunt, grandparent or cousin, with asthma, hay fever or other allergies? What medications or herbal supplements do you take? Wheezing — high-pitched whistling sounds when you breathe out — is one of the main signs of asthma. Examine your skin for signs of allergic conditions such as eczema and hives. Your doctor will want to know whether you have common signs and symptoms of asthma, such as: Symptoms that are triggered by cold air, exercise or exposure to allergens In children, additional signs and symptoms may signal asthma. These may include: Frequent coughing or coughing that worsens after active play Coughing, clear mucus and a runny nose caused by hay fever A spirometer is a diagnostic device that measures the amount of air you're able to breathe in and out and its rate of flow. Your doctor may use several tests to determine how well your lungs are working. This is the main test doctors generally use to diagnose asthma in people 5 years or older. To help determine how well your lungs are working (pulmonary function), you take a deep breath and forcefully breathe out (exhale) into a tube connected to a spirometer. This records both the amount (volume) of air you exhale and how quickly you exhale. If certain measurements are below normal for a person your age, it may indicate that asthma has narrowed your airways. After taking lung test measurements, your doctor may ask you to inhale an asthma drug to open air passages and then do the test again. Showing significant improvement after taking the medication could mean you have asthma. If your spirometer results are normal or near normal, your doctor might try to trigger asthma symptoms by having you inhale a substance that causes the airways to narrow in people with asthma, such as methacholine (meth-uh-KO-leen). If you appear to have asthma triggered by exercise (exercise-induced asthma), you may be asked to do physical activity to see whether it triggers symptoms. After either action, you'll retake the spirometry test. If your spirometry measurements remain normal, you probably don't have asthma. But if your measurements have fallen significantly, it's possible you do. Doctors seldom do lung tests in children under age 5. Instead, diagnosis is generally based on a child's signs and symptoms, medical history, and physical examination. It can be especially difficult to diagnose asthma in young children because there are many conditions that cause asthma-like symptoms in this age group. If your child's doctor suspects asthma, the doctor may prescribe a bronchodilator — a drug that opens the airways. If your child's signs and symptoms improve after using the bronchodilator, your child may have asthma. You breathe into a tube connected to a machine that measures the amount of nitric oxide gas in your breath. Nitric oxide gas is produced by the body normally, but high levels in your breath can mean your airways are inflamed — a sign of asthma. Additional tests: Ruling out conditions other than asthma If your doctor suspects that you have a condition in addition to or other than asthma, you may need tests such as: X-ray or computerized tomography (CT) imaging of your chest Examination of the phlegm in your lungs (sputum induction and examination) for signs of a viral or bacterial infection Your doctor may also want to see whether you have other conditions that often accompany asthma and can worsen symptoms. These include: Heartburn (also known as gastroesophageal reflux disease or GERD) Your doctor may also perform allergy tests. These can be skin tests, blood tests or both. Although not used to diagnose asthma, allergy tests can help identify an allergic condition, such as hay fever, that may be causing your symptoms or worsening existing asthma. Sometimes, diagnosing the cause of breathing problems is a challenge. It can be difficult to differentiate asthma from other conditions — particularly in young children. When asthma coexists with another condition that affects breathing, it can further complicate diagnosis. Even if a diagnosis isn't certain, your doctor may prescribe medications or other treatment to see what helps. It may take time — and patience — to get the correct diagnosis and determine the best course of treatment. Guidelines for the diagnosis and management of asthma (EPR-3) — 2012.

Asthma is a long-term lung condition that is caused by narrowing of the airways when they become inflamed. People with asthma experience difficulty breathing, and the most common symptoms are wheezing, coughing, feeling ‘out of breath’ and tightness in the chest. Symptoms are usually mild but can flare up and cause an ‘asthma attack’ that may require hospital care. There are effective medicines for asthma that, if taken correctly, will help you feel well and keep you out of hospital. Asthma can be managed with reliever inhalers to treat symptoms and attacks. Preventer or controller medications can prevent symptoms. Asthma is a common condition that affects the airways (breathing tubes) in your lungs. People with asthma have sensitive airways that become inflamed when exposed to triggers. Inflamed airways make it difficult to breathe which leads to mild symptoms like wheezing, or . Asthma affects 1 in 9 Australians, and 1 in 4 children develop asthma sometime in their childhood. However, any adult can get asthma, even if you didn’t have it as a child. Sometimes asthma can flare up and symptoms become worse compared to usual — known as an asthma attack. Some asthma sufferers describe asthma attacks as feeling as though you are breathing through a straw. They can happen rapidly (such as after exposure to smoke), or emerge gradually over hours or days (for example, after getting a ). A serious or severe asthma flare-up needs urgent medical attention from a doctor or hospital emergency department, even for people whose symptoms are usually mild or well controlled. If you or another person show signs of a severe asthma attack, call triple zero (000) immediately and ask for an ambulance. If calling triple zero (000) does not work on your mobile, call 112. Early treatment could save a life. While symptoms vary from person to person, the most common signs of mild asthma include: — feeling breathless, even while resting, or being unable to finish full sentences before needing to take another breath wheezing — making a whistling sound while breathing — either at specific times (for example, at night, early in the morning, during cool weather) or after certain activities (such as exercise) During a severe asthma attack, you may notice more serious symptoms, such as: feeling very distressed, exhausted or even limp from trying to breathe deep sucking motions at the throat or chest while trying to breathe — Use the for breathing problems and find out if you need to seek medical help. Call triple zero (000) immediately and ask for an ambulance if you notice symptoms of a severe asthma attack. It’s important to have an ‘’ for anyone under your care, so you can recognise symptoms of an attack and know how to manage them when they happen.

A child’s risk of developing asthma is also greater if they were born or with , if the mother , if they , or if they have been exposed to air pollution or mould. Healthy adults can also develop asthma after extended exposure to air pollution (such as fumes that irritate the lungs, or breathing in dusts that they’re to). Even athletes can get asthma this way — for example, if they have trained intensely while breathing in polluted, cold or dry air. allergens such as , , food items and mould (allergic asthma) smoke from cigarettes, and traffic pollution other irritants such as cleaning products, perfumes, aerosol products and certain workplace chemicals physical activity (referred to as exercise-induced asthma) , such as whether your close relatives have asthma or allergies breathing tests to assess how your well your lungs are working (such as ) For children aged under 5 years who find breathing tests difficult, your doctor may prescribe some asthma medication first (referred to as a ‘treatment trial’), then use the results of the treatment to make a diagnosis. Asthma is likely to be diagnosed if the symptoms improve quickly with reliever medication. You may also need to undergo . This is because asthma is more likely to be diagnosed if your symptoms are triggered by known allergies, or occur at the same time each year (seasonal). — The can help you find doctors, pharmacies, hospitals and other health services. Asthma treatment helps keep your lungs healthy, prevents asthma symptoms from interfering with normal life and helps prevent flare-ups or attacks. Your doctor may prescribe or suggest these treatments. There are three main types of : relievers, preventers and controllers. Asthma reliever medication helps open up your airways quickly to relieve symptoms during an asthma attack. They work within minutes and the effects can last for about 4 hours. One common reliever medication is salbutamol (Ventolin). You or your child may need to use asthma relievers more regularly until the symptoms are gone, but use them as prescribed by your doctor. Asthma preventer medicine helps prevent asthma attacks and keeps your asthma under control. Preventer treatments relax your airways with anti-inflammatory medicine — usually corticosteroids, a substance similar to the steroid your body produces — into your lungs. Preventer medication comes in either inhaler or tablet form and should be taken every day. Sometimes, short courses of oral corticosteroids (such as ) may be used to help manage asthma flare-ups. Asthma controller medicine helps to control asthma when a preventer medication isn’t enough. They help in a similar way to asthma reliever medications but last longer, and are often combined with a preventer medicine into a single inhaler. Sometimes, short courses of oral corticosteroids (e.g. prednisolone) may be used to help manage flare-ups of asthma. Using inhalers and spacers properly takes practice, so it’s important to learn the correct technique for getting the optimal amount of medicine. Read our article on . It is important to note that severe asthma is asthma that can’t be controlled despite the correct use of prescribed high-dose regular preventer medicines. A small number of people may experience severe asthma and have symptoms which are not adequately controlled with high doses of treatment, and they may need additional treatments. For more information on the treatment of severe asthma visit the website. Asthma triggers cause your airways to narrow and lead to asthma symptoms. These triggers vary from person to person, but avoiding or managing them can help to control asthma. Read the National Asthma Council’s article on .

a8832957-e0b7-4999-a1c4-c76de4c87131,"» Are you sure your patient has asthma? What are the typical findings for this disease? 1. Recurrent cough, wheeze, or shortness of breath often with specific triggers that is at least partially relieved by a bronchodilator. 2. Wheezing with illnesses that responds at least partially to a bronchodilator. 3. Rule out other causes such as those listed below. When a child presents with recurrent symptoms of airway obstruction such as chronic cough, recurrent wheeze, cough or chest tightness with exercise or other triggers, the following elements in the history and physical suggest asthma: History of present illness: recurrent symptoms, at least partial response to bronchodilator. Specific triggers such as exercise, exposure to allergens, or viral illness. Past medical history: history of eczema, allergies (environmental and/or food); history of recurrent bronchiolitis, recurrent pneumonia, or wheeze with illnesses. Environmental history: home environment including exposure to animals, molds, tobacco smoke, and odors; attendance of daycare/school. Physical exam is usually normal. Children may also wheeze or have a prolonged expiratory phase. Consider alternate diagnoses in a child with clubbing, failure to thrive, rhonchi, or rales in a child who is not currently ill; oxygen saturations chronically below 90% in a child who is not ill are not consistent with asthma. What other disease/condition shares some of these symptoms? Diseases and conditions that share some symptoms with asthma Chronic lung disease: bronchopulmonary dysplasia, cystic fibrosis, aspiration pneumonia Immunodeficiency leading to recurrent pulmonary infections Airway anomalies such as laryngomalacia, tracheomalacia, bronchomalacia Airway compression due to: mediastinal mass, vascular ring (e.g. a double aortic arch), or pulmonary artery sling, lymphadenopathy The Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) Guidelines was updated in 2014 and The National Heart Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI) and the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program (NAEPP) published “Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Management of Asthma (Expert Panel Report-3)” in 2007. In 2012, Colorado put together a document that is much shorter and simplifies the guidelines while preserving all of the key elements. This guideline is available at: www.healthteamworks.org/guidelines/asthma.html. The cause of asthma in every patient is multifactorial. In pediatric asthma, 80-90% of children have allergies and the asthma symptoms are often triggered by allergen exposure. Nevertheless, not all children with allergies develop asthma. Therefore there are probably genetic and environmental factors that influence the development of asthma in certain children with allergies. In children who do not have allergies, the cause may be genetic and/or epigenetic. In other words, the development of asthma and the severity of the disease may be the result of exposures to respiratory illness, tobacco smoke, air pollution, or other sources of stress before or after birth that alter the expression of genes. Many investigators and multiple cohort studies are endeavoring to find the cause for asthma in allergic and non-allergic children. In a child with a diagnosis of asthma, the following questions in the history might help discern the cause of an asthma exacerbation while also providing information about the severity of the disease at baseline: Current severity of symptoms of airway obstruction, timing of symptoms, response to bronchodilator, recent frequency of use of the bronchodilator and other asthma medications including a daily controller, if applicable (see below), and recent viral illness or environmental exposures or exposure to any food allergens. History and frequency of severe asthma exacerbations requring hospitalization or intensive care, baseline frequency of bronchodilator use per week and number of bronchodilator refills in the last 6-12 months, compliance with controller medications if applicable (see below). Home environment including exposure to animals, molds, tobacco smoke, and odors; attendance of daycare/school. Check vital signs including oxygen saturation; listen for wheeze or prolonged expiratory phase or decreased aeration. Evaluate the level of respiratory distress. Evaluate for signs of allergic reaction including hives or swelling of the face that might indicate anaphylaxis. What laboratory studies should you request to help confirm the diagnosis of asthma? How should you interpret the results? Asthma causes obstructive lung disease due to airway inflammation and bronchospasm. The flow of air during exhalation will be slower if airways are inflamed or obstructed by bronchospasm. Spirometry can be used to evaluate obstruction by measuring flow rate in children over the age of six. Even basic spirometry can be difficult to perform. Refer to the American Thoracic Society criteria for a comprehensive description of procedures and interpretation. Spirometry involves a deep inhalation to total lung capacity and a strong, sustained exhalation of the whole vital capacity for at least 3 seconds. The measure needs to be repeated 3 times and should be reproducible within 5% of the forced vital capacity (FVC) liter value. The total amount exhaled, or FVC, on a pulmonary function test report (PFT) will show the best of three liter values and the percent predicted. The percent predicted is generated by comparing results to a group of children of similar age, height, gender, and ethnicity. The amount of air forcefully exhaled in one second is the FEV1. The last value to consider in asthma is the FEV1/FVC ratio. The normal value for the FVC and FEV1 on a PFT is greater than 80% predicted. The normal value for the ratio is 0.85 for children up to 18 years old. The amount of air forced out in one second (FEV1) will be decreased in a patient with obstructive lung disease. Another value to consider in the diagnosis of asthma is the FEV1/FVC ratio. The normal value for the FVC and FEV1 on a PFT is greater than 80% of predicted. The normal value for the ratio is 0.85 for children up to 18 years of age. In obstructive disease, the volume of air inhaled should be normal. As a result, the FVC should be normal even if it takes the child longer to exhale. The FEV1 will be low and the ratio will be low. If a child responds clinically to a bronchodilator and has PFT results showing a low FEV1 and FEV1/FVC ratio in the presence of normal FVC, the diagnosis of asthma is confirmed. Asthma can be diagnosed in the absence of a history of bronchodilator use. Since the error of the FEV1 is approximately 12%, 15% improvement in FEV1 15 minutes after three puffs of a bronchodilator represents a positive bronchodilator response and confirms the diagnosis of asthma. If spirometry is not available or the child is unable to perform spirometry, the diagnosis of asthma may be made clinically. The caregiver can be given a bronchodilator to use at home. The medication can be used during an illness when the child is wheezing or to prevent wheezing before exposure to a known trigger such as a trip to the park. If the child at least partially responds to the bronchodilator and no other diagnosis is suspected, asthma may be the diagnosis. Would imaging studies be helpful in the diagnosis of asthma? If so, which ones? Imaging studies can be useful in a child where the diagnosis of asthma is unclear. Children with asthma who are not sick often have a normal chest x-ray. In children with very poorly controlled asthma, the chest x-ray may show hyperinflation. An argument for a chest x-ray in all children who may have asthma is that a mediastinal mass must be ruled out before corticosteroids are administered. However, routine chest x-rays thereafter are not cost effective. If you are able to confirm that the patient has asthma, what treatment should be initiated? Guidelines to the management of asthma can be found in the Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) Guidelines updated in 2014 and in the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute’s (NHLBI) and the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program’s (NAEPP) “Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Management of Asthma (Expert Panel Report-3)”, published in 2007. In 2012, Colorado put together a document that is much shorter and simplifies the guidelines while preserving all of the key elements. This guideline is available at www.healthteamworks.org/guidelines/asthma.html. The first step in the treatment and management of asthma is diagnosis. The next step is to rate the asthma severity in order to understand the degree of disease activity using the guidelines listed above. The most important distinction to be made is between intermittent and persistent asthma. A simple algorithm to use to decide intermittent versus persistent is as follows: Any child who displays ANY of the following has persistent asthma: Quick-relief medication use more than 2 times a week, OR Abnormal pulmonary function tests showing airway obstruction. If the child has been treated with oral corticosteroids more than 2 times in 12 months, the child may also have persistent asthma. If a child needs to take a daily medication to prevent the symptoms listed above, that child has persistent asthma. All children and families with a child who has asthma should understand that asthma is a chronic disease that can be controlled. Children with asthma should be able to play and exercise without limitation, sleep through the night, and attend school every day when they are well. In order to maintain control, all children with asthma need a quick-relief or bronchodilator medication to relieve acute symptoms. Short acting beta-agonists (SABA) are used for quick-relief in asthma. All children with persistent asthma need to be treated with a “controller medication” to control the airway inflammation that is causing the persistent symptoms. The dose of controller medication depends upon the severity of the disease and is described in detail in the algorithms mentioned above. The first choice for all levels of severity will be an inhaled corticosteroid. Inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) are always listed as the first choice because studies show that ICS control symptoms and decrease the risk of exacerbation better than available alternate medications. Asthma education should include information about the disease including the pathophysiology, information about triggers, and a complete description of the medications, including why to use them, which medications to use and when, and how to deliver the medications correctly. Medication device technique should be reviewed at every visit. Patients of all ages should use a spacer with a metered dose inhaler to ensure adequate delivery of the medication. Children should be seen within 4-6 weeks of the initiation of chronic therapy for asthma. At that visit, the asthma control should be rated according to the algorithms mentioned above. If the child is well controlled, management will be continued. If the child is poorly controlled, the provider should evaluate environmental control, medication compliance, medication device technique, and comorbidities before adjusting medications. Children should be followed every 3-6 months depending on the level of control. Medications can be stepped down after 3-6 months of good control. Well controlled asthma criteria are listed below. In the management of exacerbations for a child who has increased symptoms, the first line treatment is always a bronchodilator. The bronchodilator can be delivered as a nebulized solution or through a metered dose inhaler and valved holding chamber. In the emergency room setting, three doses of albuterol combined with ipratropium bromide has been shown to decrease the likelihood of hospital admission in the setting of a moderate to severe asthma exacerbation. If the child’s symptoms continue or do not resolve with a bronchodilator, systemic corticosteroids will be necessary. Early use of systemic corticosteroids decreases the risk for hospitalization for an asthma exacerbation, ameliorates the symptoms, and may shorten the course of the illness. There is an algorithm for the care of acute asthma exacerbations available on p. 55 of the 2007 summary report. Evidence does not support doubling the dose of inhaled corticosteroids in the setting of an asthma exacerbation. Interventions to avoid intubation or treat impending acute respiratory failure include intravenous magnesium and inhaled heliox (please refer to the guideline for dosing). Other possibilities (equivocal recommendation due to insufficient evidence) include intravenous beta-agonist, and noninvasive ventilation. Interventions not recommended are theophylline, antibiotics, aggressive hydrations, chest physiotherapy, mucolytics and sedation. What are the adverse effects associated with each treatment option? Short Acting Beta Agonists (SABA) medications can cause the patient to be jittery and to have tachycardia. High doses can cause nausea and hypokalemia. Locally, Inhaled Corticosteroids (ICS) medications can lead to thrush if not well rinsed off of the mucous membranes. Systemically, at low doses, these medications have been associated with decreased height velocity and a possible decrease in adult height of approximately 1 cm. At high doses, systemic side effects include many of the systemic side effects seen with oral corticosteroids. Multiple anecdotal reports of altered behavior are reported in the literature and in the package insert for Leukotriene receptor antagonists (LTRA). However, large, multicenter studies of children and adults reveal no significant differences between LTRA and placebo in behavioral change. It is possible that the problem is that the reported types of psychiatric and behavior changes are common and LTRA use is common and the relationship suggested by the anecdotes is circumstantial. There are multiple side effects of systemic oral corticosteroids including (but not limited to) cortisol suppression, immunosuppression, decreased bone growth, behavior change, increased appetite, elevated blood pressure and blood sugar. Several large studies evaluated the safety of long-acting beta agonists (LABA). The results of some show an increased risk of severe respiratory events and even death. It is not clear how that risk changes when the medication is given in combination with an ICS, but it may be decreased. All combination agents have a black box warning in the package insert due to these study results. The data for or against LABA in children is limited. There is significant debate in the literature about their use in children. In 2010, the Food and Drug Administration released a statement recommending that children and adolescents only use LABA in combination with an ICS and that they use these medications only if the symptoms cannot be controlled on ICS alone. Long-acting beta agonists are only available in combination in most pharmacies in the United States. Prognosis (or the probability that any child will ""outgrow"" asthma) Asthma can present at any age. Several large birth cohort studies describe “wheezing pheynotypes” that may be useful in predicting the natural history of wheezing/asthma in children. In the Tucson birth cohort, children were classified as having “transient wheeze,” “persistent wheeze,” and “late onset wheeze.” Transient wheeze: children who wheeze only with illness. Wheezing can begin in infancy and peaks at around 2 years. 75% of these children stop wheezing around age 3 years. Future episodes are infrequent. Persistent wheeze/asthma: children who wheeze with illness and outside of illness starting before 3 years old and persist past 6 years old. This cohort is more likely to be allergic. Late onset wheeze/asthma: children who wheeze with illness and outside of illness starting after 6 years old. This cohort of children is also more likely to be allergic. Based upon this study, the Tucson group created an “asthma predictive index”. This has been modified and used widely. This tool has been shown most effective to predict who will not have asthma (negative predictive index). The positive predictive index is low. No studies have found a tool that successfully predicts which children will have asthma later in life. Risk factors for asthma in school age children include positive aeroallergen tests or symptoms, male gender, and tobacco smoke exposure. Children with asthma will continue to have symptoms if they are not well controlled as described above. Risk factors for persistent symptoms include poor compliance with controller medications and repeated exposure to asthma triggers such as allergens and tobacco smoke. Asthma exacerbations leading to an emergency department visit or hospitalization are described in children of every age and children at every level of disease severity. The biggest risk factor for a serious exacerbation is history of a previous exacerbation. Therefore, any child who has received prednisone more than twice in 12 months or who has been to the emergency department or hospital for asthma should be considered high risk for a future exacerbation. Death due to asthma is rare in children. The CDC reports 0.3 deaths per 1000 children under the age of 18 from 2005-2007. Children at risk for death include those with a previous asthma exacerbation leading to respiratory failure, seizure, or loss of consciousness; previous exacerbations with rapid deterioration; food-associated asthma exacerbation, psychosocial factors including failure to perceive symptoms or severity, noncompliance, depression, and dysfunctional family unit; and demographics such as inner-city residence and race/ethnicity. Long-term complications include loss of lung function; recurrent, severe, exacerbations; and even death. Risk factors for progression of the disease are not entirely clear. Children with a history of severe asthma exacerbations are at risk for future exacerbations. Asthma is the most common acquired, chronic disease of childhood. Prevalence is rising. As of 2011, the CDC reported asthma prevalence in children to be 9.6%. In children under the age of 18, asthma is more common in boys than girls (11.3% versus 7.9%), non-Hispanic black children versus non-Hispanic white children (17.0% versus 8.5%), and poor versus not poor (13.5% versus 8.3%). The etiology of asthma is unclear. Most theories include a double hit phenomenon with predisposing genetics and exposures triggering inflammatory cascades. It is likely that there is genetic predisposition and triggering exposures such as upper respiratory illnesses, allergens, airway irritants, such as tobacco smoke and pollution, and stress. Airway inflammation consists of increased inflammatory cells such as lymphocytes, macrophages, mast cells and eosinophils. Bronchial and lung biopsies of school age children show increased eosinophils and lymphocytes (See Figure 1). In children with allergic inflammation, the degranulation of eosinophils and mast cells causes acute airway swelling. Chronic inflammation is also IgE-mediated and includes processes involving increased numbers of mast cells and eosinophils, increased levels of cytokines such as IL-4 and IL-13, and impaired regulation of inflammation. In children with non-allergic inflammation, the etiology of the inflammation is not clear. Increased mucous production further drives inflammation and leads to airway obstruction and atelectasis. Increased inflammation and mucous plugging causes hypoxemia due to ventilation/perfusion mismatch. Bronchial hyperreactivity (bronchospasm) is most likely due to inflammation since bronchial hyperreactivity decreases when airway inflammation decreases. Bronchial hyperreactivity can be partially relieved by inhaled beta-agonists which lead to muscle relaxation. Reponse to beta-agonists is a key component in the diagnosis of asthma. Children over age 6 and beyond may develop airway muscle hypertrophy. Over time, persistent airway inflammation can lead to airway remodeling and decline in lung function. What are the triggers for asthma symptoms and exacerbations? Many children have more than one trigger for asthma. Triggers may include: Exposure to environmental allergens in sensitized individuals. Common allergens include: Alternaria (a mold), dust mites, cockroach, mice, animals (cats, dogs, horses), grasses, trees, weeds, and other molds. Air pollutants including tobacco smoke, particulate matter, and ozone. Noxious exposure such as inhalants, fumes, and even strong smells for some children. Weather changes are often reported by families as a trigger although studies do not confirm this. Physical activity may cause an asthma exacerbation. Nuts, shellfish, insect venom and medications are common triggers. The reaction of each child to an allergen will be unique and may not include any respiratory symptoms. However, some children with asthma have severe respiratory manifestations when exposed to allergens to which they are sensitized. For example, children with nut allergies may be at risk for more severe asthma exacerbations than children without nut allergies. Several viral infections are linked to exacerbations; the most common are rhinovirus, respiratory syncytial virus and human metapneumovirus. Laughing, crying, and anxiety/stress can trigger asthma exacerbation. Other diagnoses that may complicate asthma (comorbidities) What complications might you expect from the disease? Long-term complications can include loss of lung function, recurrent, severe, exacerbations, and even death. Risk factors for progression of the disease are not entirely clear. Children with history of severe asthma exacerbations are at risk for future exacerbations. Other risks for severe exacerbations and death are listed in the national guidelines for asthma management. They include severe airway obstruction, frequent SABA use (more than 3 refills in 12 months), patients and families frightened by asthma, demographic factors such as race/ethnicity, lower socioeconomic status and psychosocial factors such as depression, denial, dysfunctional family units and noncompliance. Death due to asthma is rare in children. The CDC reports 0.3 deaths per 1000 children under the age of 18 from 2005-2007. Children at risk for death include those with a previous asthma exacerbation leading to respiratory failure, seizure, or loss of consciousness; previous exacerbations with rapid deterioration; food-associated asthma exacerbation; psychosocial factors including failure to perceive symptoms or severity, noncompliance, depression, and dysfunctional family unit; and demographics such as inner-city residence and race/ethnicity. Long-term complications can include loss of lung function; recurrent, severe, exacerbations; and even death. Risk factors for progression of the disease are not entirely clear. Children with a history of severe asthma exacerbations are at risk for future exacerbations. Are additional laboratory studies available; even some that are not widely available? Exercise induced bronchospasm testing can be done on a treadmill. There are specific criteria for conducting these tests that are available from the American Thoracic Society. Some have employed stair stepping and outdoor running applying heart rate criteria from the American Thoracic Society. Methacholine challenge: Methacholine is an inhaled agent that causes acute bronchospasm in patients with asthma at doses below 8mg/ml of inhaled methacholine. Other agents include histamine and cold air. Tests can be performed in a pulmonary function laboratory and should be supervised by a specialist. Guidelines are provided listed by the American Thoracic Society. Exhaled Nitric Oxide may be useful. Its use for ongoing management is unclear. Several review articles listed below detail use of exhaled nitric oxide in adults and children. Asthma cannot be prevented. The genetics of asthma are complicated. There are probably genetic factors that predispose children and adults to asthma, many linked to allergy. There may also be epigenetic factors, for example, if the child is born with a certain gene, environmental factors such as allergen exposure or possibly early infectious exposure or disease may affect the way the gene is expressed. At this point, it is not possible to avoid environmental factors because it is not clear which genes or combination of genes are affected or how to test for them.

(A review article of studies evaluating the diagnosis and treatment of asthma in preschool children.) Ongoing controversies regarding etiology, diagnosis, treatment According to the national guidelines, asthma can be diagnosed in any child who meets the criteria for diagnosis. The risk for chronic asthma symptoms beyond the age of 6 years is discussed in the outcomes section above. However, children under 4 years old who wheeze only with illness and who do not have any symptoms in between their respiratory illnesses are a difficult population to diagnose and to treat. The diagnosis of asthma is difficult because although the children respond to asthma medications (short acting beta-agonists), the risk for chronic, long-term symptoms or even symptoms between illnesses is unclear. Studies looking at the kind of inflammation seen in these patients show variable results and suggest that the pathophysiology in this population may be different. Several studies recently have investigated the best way to treat children ages 2-4 who wheeze with illness. Unfortunately, the treatment is not yet clear. Children who have a positive asthma predictive index (see outcomes above), and who have had severe episodes requiring hospitalization, may benefit from low-dose, daily inhaled corticosteroids. Exercise induced bronchospasm (EIB) or exercise induced asthma: recurrent symptoms of airway obstruction with exercise that improve with albuterol is a form of asthma. The question in the literature is whether or not EIB would be classified as persistent asthma. The literature suggests that children who report symptoms with exercise only will usually reveal more frequent symptoms if appropriately interviewed. These studies suggest that EIB is most likely a symptom of persistent asthma. Primary care pediatricians report significant numbers of children with EIB alone in their practices. Future studies are needed to evaluate EIB and clearly define the relationship between EIB and persistent asthma. Guidelines for diagnosis and treatment from the American Thoracic Society can be found at: http://www.atsjournals.org/doi/pdf/10.1164/rccm.201303-0437ST. Reactive Airway Disease or “RAD” is descriptive and used frequently. Many providers report that they use RAD in children where the diagnosis of asthma is unclear or when the family is not ready for the diagnosis. RAD is a separate diagnosis under the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD 10). The problem with treating RAD as an alternate diagnosis in the text of the chart or in the diagnosis section of a chart is that RAD is confusing for families and caregivers who do not know what it means or how to treat it. Therefore, if the diagnosis of asthma is unclear, other diagnoses such as “wheeze”, “cough”, or “viral pneumonia” can be used as alternate diagnoses if the provider does not believe that the diagnosis is asthma. The treatment of wheeze, cough, or other symptoms in these children should also be clear to the families. Copyright © 2017, 2013 Decision Support in Medicine, LLC. All rights reserved.

6735e86f-4d2b-481a-8e51-dd07f10aaef1,"— — is a chronic respiratory condition that causes inflammation and narrowing of the airways. It can cause symptoms such as: wheezing, a sound similar to whistling while you breathe Symptom severity varies from person to person. Sometimes wheezing and coughing can trigger an asthma attack, where symptoms temporarily get worse. There’s no cure for asthma, but treatment can help. It’s important to treat the condition early to prevent health complications from developing. These complications can be short-term, such as asthma attacks, or long-term, such as obesity or depression. Read on to learn what complications you can avoid with proper attention and preventive care. It’s important to know when to see a doctor, if you have asthma. An asthma inhaler usually improves your symptoms. But seek immediate medical attention if your asthma symptoms don’t improve after using an inhaler. Make an appointment with a doctor even if you have asthma symptoms with little or no exertion. Asthma can worsen over time. Talk to your doctor if the frequency of your symptoms increases and you have to use an inhaler more often. Your doctor may need to adjust your treatment. Complications that can cause lifestyle disruption Some people with asthma experience most of their symptoms during the night. Over time, this can lead to serious sleep deprivation. Chronic lack of sleep impedes the ability to function properly at work and school. It can be especially dangerous if you need to drive or operate machinery. Asthma may keep some people from participating in exercise or sports. A lack of exercise also increases your risk for: Adults and children experience . But the complications that develop can have a different impact based on age. Asthma is a long-term and potentially life-threatening condition that requires ongoing treatment. If left untreated, there’s a greater risk for long-term effects and severe complications. These long-term effects include: For some people, asthma causes ongoing chronic inflammation of the airway. This can lead to permanent structural changes in the airways, or airway remodeling. Airway remodeling includes all the alterations in structural cells and tissues in an asthmatic airway. Changes in the airway can lead to: The reported in 2011 that asthma accounts for 1.3 percent of all U.S. emergency room visits. Fortunately, almost everyone who received treatment recovers from even the most severe attacks. At the hospital, you may be given oxygen through a face mask or nasal tube. You may also need fast-acting medication or a dose of steroids. In severe cases, the doctor may insert a breathing tube into your airway to maintain airflow into your lungs. You will be monitored for a few hours until you are stable. People with severe asthma also have an increased risk for respiratory failure. Respiratory failure occurs when not enough oxygen travels from your lungs to your blood. Life-threatening asthma is rare, but tends to cause symptoms that get progressively worse over several days. Ask your doctor more about your treatment options and how to manage your condition, if you believe you may have asthma that is life-threatening. If respiratory failure isn’t treated immediately, it can lead to death. The estimates that nine Americans die from asthma every day. There are more than 4,000 asthma-related deaths a year in America. But many of these deaths are preventable with proper symptom and emergency care. Pneumonia: Asthma affects the airways and breathing. This can affect how long it takes for you to recover from .

This increased incidence is more common with cases of depression and anxiety. Another concluded that depression was associated with a 43 increased risk for developing adult-onset asthma. But the link between mental health conditions and asthma has not been widely studied. Asthma complications occur for various reasons. Common flare-up triggers include frequent or heavy exposure to irritants or allergens, such as: In addition, some people are more prone to flare-ups after participating in physical activity. This is known as exercise–induced asthma. Emotional and medical factors can also trigger asthma complications. Stress or anxiety can worsen asthma symptoms. A cold or acid reflux can do the same.

However, asthma does flare up sometimes without warning. Sudden cough or shortness of breath can happen, usually triggered by some common allergen such as dust or pollen. Asthma can also get worse over a period of time in which you see that more quick-relief medicine than usual is needed to control asthma symptoms. An asthma attack needs to be treated quickly using the right medicine. If left unattended, asthma attacks and related symptoms worsen and can even become fatal. Symptoms of asthma can vary in different situations. To effectively track the symptoms and act when they get worse, you need to work with your doctor to develop a clear asthma action plan. To determine if your asthma is getting worse, you will need to understand the importance of the three zones of asthma control – green zone, yellow zone and red zone. The green zone indicates full control of your asthma. You have up to 90% normal breathing ability and remain largely asymptomatic. You are able to be active and take part in day to day activities at work or school. Your sleep is not disturbed by asthma symptoms such as cough or chest tightness. You don’t use your controller or reliever medication except for the pre-exercise dose. In this stage, continue your controller medications as per your doctor’s directions. If your symptoms are in the green zone for over 3 months, you can discuss with your doctor about decreasing the dose of your controller medications. However, do not stop taking your medications without consulting your doctor. You have 60 to 80% of normal breathing ability and have mild asthma symptoms that interfere with your routine activities or exercise. Symptoms make it difficult to sleep and you may also have a cold or chest infection. Frequency of reliever medication intake is 4 or more times in a week You are forced to miss work or school because of your symptoms. Proactive interventions associated with reduced healthcare utilization, costs for children with asthma Researchers find a better way to block asthma triggers High levels of steroids put asthma patients at greater risk of serious side-effects If you see that you are in the yellow zone, speak to your physician and seek modification of your asthma medications and updation of asthma action plan. If asthma symptoms in the yellow zone are left untreated they might worsen and move to the red zone. The red zone indicates a medical emergency. People in the red zone experience severe asthma symptoms such as: Reliever medications may not work effectively towards easing these symptoms. Make a note of these signs and make sure you recognize them. If you have any of these symptoms, immediate medical attention is required. Call your local emergency service immediately and get to the ER as soon as possible. At the emergency room, healthcare professionals will treat you with oral or intravenous corticosteroids, inhalation of reliever medications such as bronchodilators, and oxygen masks. They also use peak flow monitoring, oximetry, and spirometry to assess the progress of asthma post medication. Remember that delays in getting medical attention when you have red zone asthma symptoms can be fatal. Note down important phone numbers of your doctor, local emergency service, and local ambulance service. Always be alert about your symptoms and follow your doctor’s action plan for managing asthma. https://www.asthma.org.uk/advice/understanding-asthma/types/severe-asthma/ http://www.aaaai.org/conditions-and-treatments/asthma Last Updated: Feb 26, 2019 Susha has a Bachelor of Science (B.Sc.) degree in Chemistry and Master of Science (M.Sc) degree in Biochemistry from the University of Calicut, India.

Normally, when someone breathes in, air goes in through the nose or mouth, down the windpipe (trachea), and into the airways (bronchioles) of the lungs. When people breathe out, air exits the body in the opposite direction. With asthma, air has a harder time passing through. Airways swell and fill with mucus. The muscles around the airways tighten, making airways narrower. Things that can irritate the airways are called ""triggers."" Common triggers include cigarette smoke, allergies, and exercise. Triggers can lead to asthma flare-ups or ""attacks."" are when asthma symptoms get worse. They happen when airways get more irritated and inflamed (swollen) than usual.

Asthma is the most common pediatric lung disease. It affects about one in ten children. This means asthma effects children in school. Children with asthma have swollen (inflammation), sensitive airways that lead to episodes of trouble breathing. Although there is no known cure for asthma, it can be controlled. When asthma is under good control, the inflammation and obstruction in the airways will be decreased. Because children spend most of their day at school, it is important that school personnel understand asthma and asthma management in school. This handout introduces asthma management concepts and gives school personnel detailed information about this student's asthma management program.  This is often called a school asthma action plan. Managing asthma will make it possible for the child to participate in school to the level of their ability. are the things that make asthma worse right away or slowly over time. Every child with asthma has different asthma triggers. Things that make asthma worse should be avoided or controlled in the school environment. Things that can make asthma worse include: irritants (e.g., smoke and fumes), allergens (e.g., furry animals, grasses and trees), exercise, infections and emotions. Although emotions may make asthma symptoms worse, they do not cause asthma. Many children with asthma may use a metered-dose-inhaler before exercise to prevent asthma symptoms during exercise at school. are indicators that a child's asthma may be getting worse. Monitoring asthma signs and symptoms is helpful in managing asthma at school. Signs and symptoms are things that children feel or that you may notice when asthma is getting worse. Common symptoms to watch for include: coughing, shortness of breath, chest tightness and/or wheezing. In addition to watching for asthma symptoms, some children with asthma may monitor their breathing at school by using a peak flow meter. A peak flow meter measures the flow of air in a forced exhalation. Peak flow monitoring can help identify the start of an asthma episode, often before the child is having symptoms. divide the peak flow meter into the colors of a traffic light and can help children and school personnel make decisions about asthma management. are divided into two groups: long-term control and quick-relief medications. Some quick-relief medications (e.g., Proventil, Ventolin, ProAir) work quickly to relax the muscles around the airways. These are used to treat asthma symptoms.  They may also be used as a pre-treatment before exercise. Long-term control medications are used daily to maintain control of asthma and prevent asthma symptoms. Long-term control medications may be inhaled (e.g., Flovent, Pulmicort, QVar, Advair, DuleraSymbicort, or oral (e.g., Singulair). Children often use these at home.  Most children use a combination of long-term control and quick-relief medications to manage their asthma. Spacers or holding chambers are devices that attach to the inhaler to increase the amount of medication that is delivered to the child's airways. Many children may use these.

This usually involves testing breathing with a , a machine that analyzes airflow through the airways. There's no cure for asthma, but it can be managed to prevent flare-ups. Asthma treatment involves two important things: avoiding triggers and . There are many ways to avoid triggers. After your child's triggers are identified, the doctor will work with you to come up with a plan to avoid them. For example, if pet dander or mold in your home trigger your child's asthma symptoms, you can make your home by changing the linens often, vacuuming regularly, and keeping the family pet out of your child's bedroom. If outdoor allergies (like pollen) are a problem, your child should avoid the outdoors on days when pollen counts are high. If exercise is a trigger, the doctor may prescribe a medicine for your child to take before physical activity to prevent airways from tightening up. Doctors help people with exercise-induced asthma manage physical activity, not avoid it. Exercise can help people stay healthier overall (in fact, many pro athletes have asthma!). Getting a yearly is also important, as illnesses like the flu can trigger asthma flare-ups. Most asthma medicines are breathed directly into the lungs (inhaled), but some are pills or liquids. There are two types of asthma medicines: act fast to open up tight airways. They can be used as needed during a flare-up. Quick-relief medicines act fast, but their effect doesn't last long. These kinds of medicines are also called ""fast-acting"" or ""rescue"" medicines. manage asthma by preventing symptoms from happening.

This happens because airways in the get swollen, smaller, and filled with mucus. Asthma is common in kids and teens, and tends to run in families. It can be mild or so severe that it gets in the way of daily activities. With and the right care plan, asthma symptoms can be managed so that kids and teens can do just about anything they want to do. No one knows exactly why some people develop asthma. Experts think it might be a combination of environmental factors and genes. People with asthma may have a parent or other close relative with asthma. Those who are overweight may be more likely to have it. In asthma, air doesn't move through the lungs the way it should. Normally, when someone breathes in, air goes in through the nose or mouth, down the windpipe (trachea), and into the airways (bronchioles) of the lungs. When people breathe out, air exits the body in the opposite direction. With asthma, air has a harder time passing through. Airways swell and fill with mucus. The muscles around the airways tighten, making airways narrower. Things that can irritate the airways are called ""triggers."" Common triggers include cigarette smoke, allergies, and exercise. Triggers can lead to asthma flare-ups or ""attacks."" are when asthma symptoms get worse. They happen when airways get more irritated and inflamed (swollen) than usual. Some flare-ups are serious, but others are mild. Flare-ups can happen suddenly or build up over time, especially if kids don't take their asthma medicines as directed. Things that bring on a flare-up are called . Triggers vary from person to person, but common ones include: allergies to things like , mold, and irritants and in the air respiratory infections, like or (some kids only have asthma symptoms during or after exercise) An important part of managing asthma is avoiding triggers.

Retrieved Jan 16 2021 from https://www.thefreelibrary.com/Health+WatchManaging+Asthma.-a0246412809 Name Asthma is an inflammatory disorder of the airways which causes attacks of wheezing, shortness of breath, chest tightness, and coughing. The first attacks of asthma usually occur in childhood, although it is not uncommon that it affects adults who have never before had respiratory problems. Asthma in children can be triggered by a cold. Recent studies indicate that children born from smoking parents and who have received lengthy treatment with antibiotics during their first year of life are more likely to have asthma. Causes Asthma is caused by inflammation in the airways. When an asthma attack occurs, the muscles surrounding the airways become tight and the lining of the air passages swell. This reduces the amount of air that can pass through and can lead to wheezing sounds. Most people with asthma have wheezing attacks separated by symptom-free periods. Some patients have long-term shortness of breath with episodes of even more increased shortness of breath. In others, a cough may be the main symptom. Asthma attacks can last minutes to days and can become dangerous if the airflow becomes severely restricted. Among sensitive individuals, asthma symptoms can be triggered by breathing in allergy-causing substances (allergens or triggers). Common asthma triggers include pet hair or dander, dust, changes in weather, chemicals in the air or in food, exercise, mold, pollen, respiratory infections such as the common cold, strong emotions, tobacco smoke, aspirin and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs etc. Sometimes the triggers can also stem from the kitchen area, such as smoke from burned food and gas from stoves. Many people with asthma also have an individual or family history of allergies, such as hay fever (allergic rhinitis) or eczema. Others have no such history of allergies. Exams and tests Allergy testing may be helpful in identifying allergens in people with persistent asthma. Such tests may include arterial blood gas analysis, blood tests to measure eosinophil count (a type of white blood cell caused by such allergic conditions as asthma), Immunoglobulin E (IgE) levels (a type of antibody that may increase when exposed to asthmatic triggers), chest x-ray, lung function tests, peak flow measurements (discussed below). Symptoms Breathlessness, coughing with or without sputum (a mixture of saliva and mucus coughed up from the reparatory tract), wheezing, a rapid pulse, sweating and occasional severe drowsiness or confusion and blu-ish color to the lips and face are all common symptoms. There can also be abnormal breathing patterns, chest pains, nasal flaring and the temporary suspension of breathing, all of which are serious symptoms. Treatment The goal of treatment is to avoid contact with the substances that trigger the symptoms and to control airway inflammation, for which there are two basic kinds of medication: Long-acting medications to prevent further attacks Quick-relief medications for use during attacks Long-term control medications are used on a regular basis to prevent attacks, not to treat them. Quick relief, or rescue medications mainly come in the form of short-acting bronchodilators (inhalers) such as Proventil, Ventolin, Xopenex and corticosteroids such as methylprednisolone. People with mild asthma (infrequent attacks) may use quick relief medication as required. Those with persistent asthma should take longer-term control medications on a regular basis to prevent symptoms. A severe asthma attack requires a check up by a doctor and, possibly, a hospital stay, oxygen, and medications through intravenous therapy (IV). A peak flow meter is a simple device to measure how quickly one is able to breath air in out of your lungs. It can help you see if an attack is coming, sometimes even before any symptoms appear, and also when medication is needed or other action needs to be taken. Peak flow values of 50-80% of an individual's best results are a sign of a moderate asthma attack, while values below 50% are a sign of a severe attack. The peak flow meter is a boon to asthmatics and is not expensive. If any of the following symptoms occur, the patient must be rushed to the hospital immediately: An asthma attack that requires more medication than has been recommended to them Symptoms that are getting worse or that have not improved with treatment Shortness of breath while talking treatment Increased drowsiness or confusion A severe shortness of breath while at rest A peak flow measurement less than 50% Severe chest pain If you are an asthmatic, always carry an asthma inhaler with you wherever you go, try to remain calm and control your breathing as much as possible until it slows down. Do not lie down or sit with your hands on your knees for extra support as this restricts airflow. If symptoms do not improve within five minutes, visit your doctor. Complications The complications of asthma can be severe. Among them include a decreased ability to exercise and take part in other such necessary activities. It can also result in insomnia due to symptoms occurring during the night. Asthma can also cause permanent changes to the functioning of the lungs which results in persistent and serious coughing and breathing difficulties that require breathing assistance through a ventilator in order to avoid the worst possible scenario of death. Prevention Asthma symptoms can be substantially reduced by avoiding known triggers and substances that irritate the airways. Removing carpets from bedrooms and regular vacuuming is also helpful. Detergents and cleaning materials used in the home should be unscented and asthmatics should also avoid perfumes and bakhoor. Keeping humidity levels low and fixing water leaks can reduce growth of organisms such as mold. Keeping the house clean and food in containers and out of bedrooms also help. This reduces the possibility of cockroaches entering the house, which can trigger asthma attacks in some. Many people in Yemen keep cattle and also have cats as pets in their houses. If an asthma sufferer is allergic to a certain animal that cannot be removed from the home then the animal should be kept out of the individual's bedroom. Filtering material can also be placed over heating outlets to trap animal dander. Eliminating tobacco smoke from the home is the single most important thing that a family can do to help a child with asthma. Smoking outside the house is also not enough. Family members and visitors who smoke outside carry smoke residue inside the house on their clothes and hair and this can trigger symptoms of asthma. People with asthma should also avoid air pollution, dust, and other irritating fumes as much as possible. Also, make sure that you have proper ventilation in your home and office. There is no cure for asthma, although symptoms sometimes improve over time. However, with proper self-management and medical treatment, most people with asthma can lead normal lives.

a4f54d79-8e9e-4398-9fd0-420d024e7857,"— — Asthma and bronchitis have similar symptoms, but different causes. In both asthma and bronchitis, the airways become inflamed. They swell up, making it harder for air to move into the lungs. As a result, less oxygen gets out to the organs and tissues. Too little oxygen causes symptoms like shortness of breath, coughing, and chest tightness. Viruses or environmental factors like tobacco smoke and pollution cause bronchitis. Gene changes and environmental triggers like pollen and dust in the air cause asthma. Here’s a look at some of the other differences between asthma and bronchitis. Both asthma and bronchitis can cause these symptoms: If you have bronchitis, you’ll produce a thick, goopy substance called mucus when you cough. The mucus can be clear, yellow, or green. low fever, or a temperature of 100°F (37.7°C)-102°F (38.8°C) In acute bronchitis, the cough, chest tightness, and wheezing usually last for a few days to a few weeks until the infection clears up. Chronic bronchitis symptoms continue long-term. Symptoms of asthma come and go. Some people may have asthma that’s triggered by certain events, such as exercise, allergies, or even your workplace. Doctors don’t know exactly what causes asthma. It may be from a combination of genes and the environment. Genes you inherit from your parents may make your airways more sensitive to allergic triggers like smoke, pollen, and pet dander. you had a lot of respiratory infections as a child you are regularly exposed to chemicals or dust at work Usually something in the environment sets off asthma symptoms. Asthma triggers include: Bronchitis can be acute or chronic. Acute bronchitis is caused by a virus or bacteria. Chronic bronchitis is triggered by something in the environment, such as: These substances irritate and inflame the airways. have a weakened immune system that makes you more likely to catch infections work in an industry where you’re exposed to dust and chemical fumes, like coal mining, textiles, or farming If you’re coughing or wheezing and your symptoms don’t go away, see your primary care doctor. You can also see a pulmonologist. A pulmonologist is a doctor who treats asthma and other diseases of the lungs. Your doctor will get clues from your symptoms about which condition you have. Your doctor will ask about your family history of allergies and asthma. Questions might include: Have you recently been sick with a cold or the flu? Are you exposed to chemicals, pollutants, dust, or fumes at home or work? Your doctor will then listen to your lungs through a stethoscope. You may have one or more of these tests, which check for both asthma and bronchitis: You blow into a device that shows how well your lungs are working. This scan uses small amounts of radiation to create a picture of your lungs. A chest x-ray can look for growths in your lungs that might be causing your symptoms. The doctor will take a sample of the mucus you cough up from your lungs. The sputum is tested for bacteria to find out if you have an infection. If your doctor suspects you have asthma, you might also have a methacholine challenge or bronchoprovocation test.You’ll breathe in a substance that makes your airways tighten if you have asthma. Then you’ll take a spirometry test to see how much air you can blow out of your lungs. You can also take a spirometry test after exercising or breathing in cold air. Allergies are often the cause of asthma. You may need to see an allergist for blood and skin tests. These tests can help you learn which substances trigger your asthma, such as dust, mold, or pet dander. Learn more: Common asthma triggers and how to avoid them » Acute bronchitis usually isn’t treated with antibiotics, because it’s often caused by a virus. Antibiotics only kill bacteria. Your doctor will recommend that you rest, drink lots of fluids, and take pain relievers to ease your symptoms. Chronic bronchitis and asthma have similar treatments. The goal with both conditions is to open up your airways and help you breathe easier. The same medicines may be used to treat both asthma and bronchitis. Bronchodilators are a type of medication that relaxes the muscles around the airways to open them up and ease your breathing. They can also reduce the amount of mucus your lungs produce. You breathe these medicines into your lungs through a device called an inhaler. Short-acting bronchodilatorsstart working within a few minutes to relieve your cough and shortness of breath when these symptoms flare up. Short acting drugs are sometimes called “rescue” or “quick-relief” drugs. Examples include: Long-acting bronchodilatorstake longer to start working, but their effects last for several hours. You take these drugs every day. Examples include: Steroids bring down swelling in the airways. Usually you’ll breathe in steroids through an inhaler. Examples include: If you only need steroids short-term, you might take a drug like prednisone (Rayos) in pill form. Some medicines combine a long-acting beta agonist with a steroid. These include: If allergies trigger your asthma or bronchitis, you may need allergy shots. These medicines help your immune system get used to the substance so you no longer have a reaction. Acute bronchitis should get better once the infection clears up. Chronic bronchitis and asthma can stick with you long term. By avoiding your triggers and taking the medicine your doctor prescribed, you can prevent symptoms and stay healthy. To prevent asthma and chronic bronchitis, avoid your triggers. If you smoke, ask your doctor for methods like nicotine replacement and medicine to help you quit. Stopping smoking is one of the best ways to prevent the lung damage that causes bronchitis. Stay away from pollen, dust, pollution, or chemicals that can irritate your lungs. When you have to be around these substances, wear a mask or ventilator. Keep up-to-date on all your vaccines. Flu and pneumonia vaccines are especially important for protecting your lungs. Get regular checkups to make sure you stay as healthy as possible. If you have asthma, follow the treatment plan your doctor recommends. — — Albuterol is a rescue medication that people with asthma use to stop flare-ups.

0c8166ae-0d8d-4c74-961f-e55f8d6a3f1b,"COVID-19 is an emerging, rapidly evolving situation Get the latest information and resources from NHLBI Asthma is a chronic (long-term) condition that affects the airways in the lungs. The airways are tubes that carry air in and out of your lungs. If you have asthma, the airways can become inflamed and narrowed at times. Asthma affects people of all ages and often starts during childhood. You may wheeze, cough, or feel tightness in your chest. These symptoms can range from mild to severe and can happen every day or only once in a while. Certain things can set off or worsen asthma symptoms, such as cold air. These are called asthma triggers. When symptoms get worse, it is called an asthma attack. An asthma action plan can help you manage your asthma. The plan may include monitoring, avoiding triggers, and using medicines. Explore this Health Topic to learn more about asthma and , our role in and Find asthma guides, tip sheets, and other resources from NHLBI’s program. The exact cause of asthma is unknown, and the causes may vary from person to person. However, asthma is often the result of a strong response of the immune system to a substance in the lungs. To understand asthma, it helps to understand . Normally, the body’s immune system helps to fight infections. Sometimes a person’s immune system responds to a substance in the environment called an allergen. When someone breathes in an allergen, such as ragweed, the immune system in the airways may react strongly. Other people exposed to the same substance may not react at all. The immune system reacts to an allergen by creating . Inflammation makes your airways swell and narrow and possibly produce more mucus. This can make it harder to breathe. The muscles around the airways may also tighten, which is called a bronchospasm. This can make it even harder to breathe. Over time, the airway walls can become thicker. The image below shows how airways narrow during asthma. Your asthma may have been caused partly by a viral infection or allergens in the air when you were a baby or young child. During this stage of life, your immune system is still developing. It’s not clear why one person reacts to an exposure while others do not. Genes seem to play a role in making some people more susceptible to asthma. Your environment or occupation, your family history or genes, other medical conditions, your race or ethnicity, or your sex may raise your risk for developing asthma. Asthma affects people of all ages, but it often starts during childhood. Sometimes asthma develops in adults, particularly women. This type of asthma is called adult-onset or late-onset asthma. Things in your environment, including at work or home, may raise your risk of developing asthma or make asthma symptoms worse.  or in a child’s first few years raises the risk of developing asthma symptoms early in life. This exposure may also affect lung growth and development.  especially early in life, can affect how the immune system develops. These effects on the immune system may either increase or protect against the risk of developing asthma.  such as chemical irritants or industrial dusts, may also raise the risk of developing asthma in susceptible people. This type of asthma is called occupational asthma. It may develop over a period of years, and it often lasts even after you are no longer exposed.  may make asthma worse. Pollutants may include traffic-related air pollution. Allergens in the air may include pollen, dust, or other particles. Genes mayplay a role in the development of asthma because they affect how the immune system develops. More than one gene is likely involved. You inherit genes from your parents. Having a parent who has asthma, especially if the mother has asthma, increases the risk that a child will develop asthma. Asthma is often linked to other medical conditions, such as:  Asthma is usually a type of allergic reaction. People who have asthma often have other types of allergies. They may have food allergies or get a runny or stuffy nose from pollen. You may be at higher risk for developing asthma if you had allergic reactions in early childhood to substances in the air, such as pollen, dander, mold, or dust. The more things you are allergic to, the higher your risk of asthma. can increase the chances of developing asthma or worsening asthma symptoms. This may be because people who have obesity can have inflammation or changes in the immune system.  Young children who often have respiratory infections caused by viruses are at highest risk of developing asthma symptoms early in life. African Americans and Puerto Ricans are at higher risk of asthma than people of other races or ethnicities. African American and Hispanic children are more likely to die from asthma-related causes than non-Hispanic white Americans. Among children, more boys than girls have asthma. Among teens and adults, asthma is more common among women than men. There is no routine screening for asthma, and there is no way to prevent asthma. Your doctor may recommend avoiding certain  to help prevent asthma from getting worse or causing asthma attacks. Learn about tests your doctor may use to . How often  and  of asthma occur may depend on how severe, or intense, the asthma is and whether you are exposed to allergens. Some people have symptoms every day, while others have symptoms only a few days of the year. For some people, asthma may cause discomfort but does not interfere with daily activities. If you have more severe asthma, however, your asthma may limit what you are able to do. When asthma is well controlled, a person shows few symptoms. When symptoms worsen, a person can have what is called an asthma attack, or an exacerbation. Over time, uncontrolled asthma can damage the airways in the lungs.  which causes a whistling sound when you exhale While other conditions can cause the same symptoms as asthma, the pattern of symptoms in people who have asthma usually has some of the following characteristics. They come and go over time or within the same day. They start or get worse with viral infections, such as a cold. They are triggered by exercise, allergies, cold air, or   are episodes that occur when symptoms get much worse and require a change in typical treatment. These can come on gradually or suddenly and may be life-threatening. People who have severe asthma often get asthma attacks more often. Asthma is diagnosed based on your medical history, a physical exam, and results from diagnostic tests. You may need to see a team of healthcare providers, including your doctor; an asthma specialist, called a pulmonologist; or an allergy specialist, called an allergist. . They may ask also about any known allergies. This includes how often symptoms occur, what seems to trigger your symptoms, when or where symptoms occur, and if your symptoms wake you up at night. Listen to your breathing and look for of asthma Look for allergic skin conditions, such as eczema Your doctor may ask you to perform the following tests to determine whether your symptoms are caused by asthma.  such as spirometry, which involves breathing in and out through a tube connected to a computer. This measures how much and how fast the air moves when you breathe in and out with maximum effort. Watch this video to learn more about . tomeasure how much and how fast air moves in and out both before and after you take an inhaled medicine to relax the muscles in your airway.   to measure how your airways react to specific exposures. During this test, you inhale different concentrations of allergens or medicines that may tighten the muscles in your airways. Spirometry is done before and after the test.  to measure how fast you can blow air out using maximum effort. This test can be done during spirometry or by breathing into a separate device, such as a tube. to measure levels of nitric oxide in your breath when you breathe out. High levels of nitric oxide may mean that your lungs are inflamed. This test is done in adults and children age 5 and older.  if you have a history of allergies. These tests can tell your doctor which allergens, such as pet dander or pollen, causes a reaction from your immune system. It can be hard to tell whether a child under age 6 has asthma or another respiratory condition, because young children often cannot perform a pulmonary function test such as spirometry. After checking a child’s history and symptoms, the doctor may try asthma medicines for a few months to see how well a child responds. About 40% of children who wheeze when they get colds or respiratory infections are eventually diagnosed with asthma. If you are diagnosed with asthma, your doctor will work with you to create a treatment plan to manage your asthma symptoms and prevent asthma attacks. Treatment usually depends on your age, asthma severity, and response to a given treatment option. Your doctor may adjust your treatment until asthma symptoms are controlled. Most people are treated long-term with daily controller(s), along with another inhaler for short-term relief, when they have symptoms or to prevent symptoms. An inhaler allows the medicine to go into the mouth and . Watch our video to learn about treatment for asthma.  Short-term relief medicines, also called quick-relief medicines, help prevent symptoms or relieve symptoms during an asthma attack. They may be the only medicines needed for mild asthma or asthma that happens only with physical activity. Your doctor will prescribe a quick-relief inhaler for you to carry at all times. Visit the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to .  to quickly relax tight muscles around your airways. This allows the airways to open so air can flow through them. Side effects can include tremors and rapid heartbeat. If symptoms and medical history suggest asthma, doctors may treat it with inhaled corticosteroids for a trial period to see whether they help. If symptoms do not improve, corticosteroids will be stopped to avoid side effects. to reduce inflammation caused by severe asthma symptoms. to help open the airways quickly. This medicine may be less effective than SABAs, but it is an option for people who may have side effects from SABAs. Your doctor may prescribe long-term control medicines to take daily to help prevent symptoms by reducing airway inflammation and preventing narrowing of the airways. Treatment with specific control medicines may differ depending on age, such as whether the person is an adult or child. Return to  to review what causes asthma symptoms.  to reduce the body’s inflammatory response. Your doctor may prescribe inhaled or oral (as a pill) corticosteroids. Common side effects from inhaled corticosteroids include a hoarse voice or a mouth infection called thrush. A spacer or holding chamber on your inhaler can help avoid these side effects. Oral corticosteroids can have more side effects than inhaled corticosteroids, because the medicine goes outside the lungs. Read more about inhaled corticosteroids for asthma management. Read more about inhaled corticosteroids for asthma management. such as omalizumab, mepolizumab, reslizumab, and benralizumab, to target specific parts of the body’s response to allergens. Biologic medicines are antibodies used in people who have severe asthma. Benralizumab is injected into a vein, while the other medicines are injected below the skin or in a vein. They are given every few weeks.  to reduce inflammation and keep your airways open. You take these pills by mouth, alone or with corticosteroids, depending on what your doctor prescribes. such as ,to help prevent airway inflammation when you are exposed to allergens or other triggers. These medicines stop certain immune cells from releasing the signals that cause inflammation. such as long-acting beta2-agonists (LABAs), tokeep the airways open by preventing narrowing of the airways. LABAs may be added to your inhaled corticosteroids to reduce narrowing and inflammation. A similar medicine called inhaled long-acting muscarinic antagonists (LAMAs) is sometimes also used.  to reduce the body’s response to allergens. It can be given as an injection, known as an or by mouth as a liquid or tablet. If you have a severe asthma attack and need emergency care, you may be treated with medicines, such as those listed above, given with a nebulizer or IV. You may also receive oxygen therapy or breathing assistance. This may include or through a mask with forced air. In certain cases, your doctor may recommend a procedure called bronchial thermoplasty if you are 18 years or older and have severe asthma that remains uncontrolled despite using other treatments. In this procedure, your doctor will insert a bronchoscope into your airway through the mouth or the nose. This helps your doctor see inside the airways. Heat is used to reduce the muscle around the airway to help prevent constriction. Read more about bronchial thermoplasty in our fact sheet. After being diagnosed with asthma, work with your doctor to learn how to manage it yourself. Because asthma symptoms may be different at different times, it is important to know which medicines to use to prevent and relieve symptoms. You can work with your doctor to develop a plan, called an asthma action plan. Follow-up care will help to make sure your or your child’s asthma is well-controlled. Staying healthy also includes avoiding asthma triggers and maintaining a healthy lifestyle. Watch NHLBI’s video for more information. Work with your doctor to create an asthma action plan that works for you. An asthma action plan is a written treatment plan document that describes the following. When to call your doctor or go to the emergency room If your child has asthma, then your child’s caretakers and school staff should know about the asthma action plan. For a sample plan, see the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute’s (NHLBI) . Your doctor will make sure you are using your inhaler correctly. There are different types of inhalers. Review the way you use your inhaler at every medical visit. Sometimes asthma may get worse because of incorrect inhaler use. Watch our video on Asthma Action Plans to learn more. Then, download a . Asthma triggers are things that set off or worsen asthma symptoms. If you know that your asthma symptoms occur when you are exposed to specific triggers, it may be worthwhile to reduce your exposure to those triggers, using multiple different methods to reduce the exposure. If you are sensitive to dust, consider removing carpet from your home and using air purifiers and mattress and pillowcases that keep out dust mites. If you are sensitive to mice or cockroaches, consider using multiple ways of removing them or preventing them from entering the home in the first place.  Emotional stress, such as intense anger, crying, or laughing, can cause hyperventilation and airway narrowing, triggering an asthma attack. Get the flu vaccine each year to help prevent the flu, which can raise the risk of an asthma attack. Some people who have severe asthma may be sensitive to medicines, such as aspirin, and may experience serious respiratory problems. Tell your doctor about all medicines you or your child currently takes. Pollution or certain kinds of weather, such as thunderstorms, can affect air quality. Pollution can include indoor pollution caused by gases from inefficient cooking or heating devices that are not vented. Outdoor air pollution may be hard to avoid, but you can keep windows closed and avoid strenuous outdoor activity when air quality is low. For guidance, check the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s . This is less common. Regular checkups are important to help your doctor determine how well you are controlling your asthma and adjust treatment if needed. Your doctor will also do regular tests to see how well your lungs are working and how well air is flowing. Your medicines or dosages may change over time, based on changes in your condition or in your life, such as:  Older adults may need different treatments because of other conditions they may have and medicines they may take. Beta-blockers, pain relievers, and anti-inflammatory medicines can affect asthma. Your asthma symptoms may change during pregnancy. You are also at higher risk of asthma attacks. Your doctor will continue to treat you with long-term medicines such as inhaled corticosteroids. Controlling your asthma is important for preventing complications such as preeclampsia, pre-term delivery, and low birth weight of the baby.  Asthma may increase your risk of complications during and after surgery. For instance, having a tube put into your throat may cause an asthma attack. Talk to your doctor and surgeon about how to prepare for surgery. Return to to review possible treatment options for your asthma. Ask your doctor about asthma training or support groups to help you keep asthma under control. Education can help you understand the purpose of your medicines, how to prevent symptoms, how to recognize asthma attacks early, and when to seek medical attention. As part of your asthma action plan, your doctor may show you how to monitor your asthma using a peak flow meter. You can compare your numbers over time to make sure your asthma is controlled. A low number can help warn you of an asthma attack, even before you notice symptoms. Keeping a diary may help if you find it hard to follow your asthma action plan or the plan is not working well. If you have any of the following experiences, record them in the diary and make an appointment to see your doctor. Bring the diary with you to your appointment. You are limiting normal activities and missing school or work. You use your quick-relief inhaler more than two days a week. Your asthma medicines do not seem to work well anymore. Your peak flow number is low or varies a lot from day to day. Your symptoms occur more often, are more severe, or cause you to lose sleep. If your young child’s asthma is not well-controlled, you may notice that he or she is coughing more at night and eating less. Your child also may seem more tired (called ), irritable, or moody. Your doctor may recommend one or more of the following changes to help keep asthma symptoms in check.  Obesity can make asthma harder to manage. Talk to your doctor about programs that can help. Even a 5% to 10% weight loss can help symptoms. Eating more fruits and vegetables and getting enough .  Even though exercise is an asthma trigger for some people, you should not avoid it. Physical activity is an important part of a healthy lifestyle. Talk with your doctor about what level of physical activity is right for you. Ask about medicines that can help you stay active. Learn breathing and relaxation techniques, which can help symptoms. Meet with a mental health professional if you have anxiety, depression, or panic attacks.  Smoking tobacco and inhaling smoke from secondhand smoke make asthma harder to treat. Vaping e-cigarettes and getting exposed to secondhand vapor may also be linked to asthma symptoms. Research suggests that nicotine and flavorings found in vaping e-cigarettes can damage your lungs. Visit  or call the National Cancer Institute’s Smoking Quitline at 1-877-44U-QUIT (1-877-448-7848). Getting quality sleep can sometimes be difficult with asthma. Develop healthy sleep habits by going to sleep and getting up at regular times, following a calming bedtime routine, and keeping you bedroom cool and dark.  Your doctor may recommend that you keep your medicine dose as low as possible to prevent long-term side effects. High doses of certain asthma medicines over time can increase your risk of cataracts and osteoporosis. A cataract is the clouding of lens in your eye. Osteoporosis is a disorder that makes your bones weak and more likely to break. Read more in What People With Asthma Need To Know About Osteoporosis. Keep your asthma under control and contact your doctor if anything changes. When asthma is unmanaged, it can lead to potentially life-threatening asthma attacks. If you are pregnant, it can put the health of your unborn baby at risk. A written asthma action plan developed with your doctor can help you know when to for emergency care. Asthma attacks can be more dangerous for some people. You should seek care immediately during an asthma attack if you or your child: Has been hospitalized for asthma in the past year Has had life-threatening asthma attacks in the past Uses more than one canister of inhaled short-acting beta2-agonists (SABAs) medicine each month Has a mental health condition or alcohol or drug use disorder For young children with asthma, call if they: The NHLBI is part of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ National Institutes of Health (NIH)—the Nation’s biomedical  agency that makes important scientific discovery to improve health and save lives.

View more information about Are you an adult who has asthma, or are you willing to be a healthy volunteer? This study aims to test a new and less invasive way to look at the levels of a protein called GSNOR in people who have asthma. High levels of this protein can lead to inflammation (swelling) in the airways. Normally, doctors measure GSNOR levels with bronchoscopy (a tube inserted through your mouth into your airways). But this often requires you to be sedated. In the new approach being studied here, you will breathe in a chemical that your body makes, called GSNO. Researchers will look at how much of the chemical is broken down in your breath. This will tell them what your GSNOR levels are. They will compare the levels between people who have asthma and people who do not to see whether the test works.

6a4341d7-53d3-4834-9a92-2098bb8801ca,"COVID-19 is an emerging, rapidly evolving situation Get the latest information and resources from NHLBI Asthma is a chronic (long-term) condition that affects the airways in the lungs. The airways are tubes that carry air in and out of your lungs. If you have asthma, the airways can become inflamed and narrowed at times. Asthma affects people of all ages and often starts during childhood. You may wheeze, cough, or feel tightness in your chest. These symptoms can range from mild to severe and can happen every day or only once in a while. Certain things can set off or worsen asthma symptoms, such as cold air. These are called asthma triggers. When symptoms get worse, it is called an asthma attack. An asthma action plan can help you manage your asthma. The plan may include monitoring, avoiding triggers, and using medicines. Explore this Health Topic to learn more about asthma and , our role in and Find asthma guides, tip sheets, and other resources from NHLBI’s program. The exact cause of asthma is unknown, and the causes may vary from person to person. However, asthma is often the result of a strong response of the immune system to a substance in the lungs. To understand asthma, it helps to understand . Normally, the body’s immune system helps to fight infections. Sometimes a person’s immune system responds to a substance in the environment called an allergen. When someone breathes in an allergen, such as ragweed, the immune system in the airways may react strongly. Other people exposed to the same substance may not react at all. The immune system reacts to an allergen by creating . Inflammation makes your airways swell and narrow and possibly produce more mucus. This can make it harder to breathe. The muscles around the airways may also tighten, which is called a bronchospasm. This can make it even harder to breathe. Over time, the airway walls can become thicker. The image below shows how airways narrow during asthma. Your asthma may have been caused partly by a viral infection or allergens in the air when you were a baby or young child. During this stage of life, your immune system is still developing. It’s not clear why one person reacts to an exposure while others do not. Genes seem to play a role in making some people more susceptible to asthma. Your environment or occupation, your family history or genes, other medical conditions, your race or ethnicity, or your sex may raise your risk for developing asthma. Asthma affects people of all ages, but it often starts during childhood. Sometimes asthma develops in adults, particularly women. This type of asthma is called adult-onset or late-onset asthma. Things in your environment, including at work or home, may raise your risk of developing asthma or make asthma symptoms worse.  or in a child’s first few years raises the risk of developing asthma symptoms early in life. This exposure may also affect lung growth and development.  especially early in life, can affect how the immune system develops. These effects on the immune system may either increase or protect against the risk of developing asthma.  such as chemical irritants or industrial dusts, may also raise the risk of developing asthma in susceptible people. This type of asthma is called occupational asthma. It may develop over a period of years, and it often lasts even after you are no longer exposed.  may make asthma worse. Pollutants may include traffic-related air pollution. Allergens in the air may include pollen, dust, or other particles. Genes mayplay a role in the development of asthma because they affect how the immune system develops. More than one gene is likely involved. You inherit genes from your parents. Having a parent who has asthma, especially if the mother has asthma, increases the risk that a child will develop asthma. Asthma is often linked to other medical conditions, such as:  Asthma is usually a type of allergic reaction. People who have asthma often have other types of allergies. They may have food allergies or get a runny or stuffy nose from pollen. You may be at higher risk for developing asthma if you had allergic reactions in early childhood to substances in the air, such as pollen, dander, mold, or dust. The more things you are allergic to, the higher your risk of asthma. can increase the chances of developing asthma or worsening asthma symptoms. This may be because people who have obesity can have inflammation or changes in the immune system.  Young children who often have respiratory infections caused by viruses are at highest risk of developing asthma symptoms early in life. African Americans and Puerto Ricans are at higher risk of asthma than people of other races or ethnicities. African American and Hispanic children are more likely to die from asthma-related causes than non-Hispanic white Americans. Among children, more boys than girls have asthma. Among teens and adults, asthma is more common among women than men. There is no routine screening for asthma, and there is no way to prevent asthma. Your doctor may recommend avoiding certain  to help prevent asthma from getting worse or causing asthma attacks. Learn about tests your doctor may use to . How often  and  of asthma occur may depend on how severe, or intense, the asthma is and whether you are exposed to allergens. Some people have symptoms every day, while others have symptoms only a few days of the year. For some people, asthma may cause discomfort but does not interfere with daily activities. If you have more severe asthma, however, your asthma may limit what you are able to do. When asthma is well controlled, a person shows few symptoms. When symptoms worsen, a person can have what is called an asthma attack, or an exacerbation. Over time, uncontrolled asthma can damage the airways in the lungs.  which causes a whistling sound when you exhale While other conditions can cause the same symptoms as asthma, the pattern of symptoms in people who have asthma usually has some of the following characteristics. They come and go over time or within the same day. They start or get worse with viral infections, such as a cold. They are triggered by exercise, allergies, cold air, or   are episodes that occur when symptoms get much worse and require a change in typical treatment. These can come on gradually or suddenly and may be life-threatening. People who have severe asthma often get asthma attacks more often. Asthma is diagnosed based on your medical history, a physical exam, and results from diagnostic tests. You may need to see a team of healthcare providers, including your doctor; an asthma specialist, called a pulmonologist; or an allergy specialist, called an allergist. . They may ask also about any known allergies. This includes how often symptoms occur, what seems to trigger your symptoms, when or where symptoms occur, and if your symptoms wake you up at night. Listen to your breathing and look for of asthma Look for allergic skin conditions, such as eczema Your doctor may ask you to perform the following tests to determine whether your symptoms are caused by asthma.  such as spirometry, which involves breathing in and out through a tube connected to a computer. This measures how much and how fast the air moves when you breathe in and out with maximum effort. Watch this video to learn more about . tomeasure how much and how fast air moves in and out both before and after you take an inhaled medicine to relax the muscles in your airway.   to measure how your airways react to specific exposures. During this test, you inhale different concentrations of allergens or medicines that may tighten the muscles in your airways. Spirometry is done before and after the test.  to measure how fast you can blow air out using maximum effort. This test can be done during spirometry or by breathing into a separate device, such as a tube. to measure levels of nitric oxide in your breath when you breathe out. High levels of nitric oxide may mean that your lungs are inflamed. This test is done in adults and children age 5 and older.  if you have a history of allergies. These tests can tell your doctor which allergens, such as pet dander or pollen, causes a reaction from your immune system. It can be hard to tell whether a child under age 6 has asthma or another respiratory condition, because young children often cannot perform a pulmonary function test such as spirometry. After checking a child’s history and symptoms, the doctor may try asthma medicines for a few months to see how well a child responds. About 40% of children who wheeze when they get colds or respiratory infections are eventually diagnosed with asthma. If you are diagnosed with asthma, your doctor will work with you to create a treatment plan to manage your asthma symptoms and prevent asthma attacks. Treatment usually depends on your age, asthma severity, and response to a given treatment option. Your doctor may adjust your treatment until asthma symptoms are controlled. Most people are treated long-term with daily controller(s), along with another inhaler for short-term relief, when they have symptoms or to prevent symptoms. An inhaler allows the medicine to go into the mouth and . Watch our video to learn about treatment for asthma.  Short-term relief medicines, also called quick-relief medicines, help prevent symptoms or relieve symptoms during an asthma attack. They may be the only medicines needed for mild asthma or asthma that happens only with physical activity. Your doctor will prescribe a quick-relief inhaler for you to carry at all times. Visit the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to .  to quickly relax tight muscles around your airways. This allows the airways to open so air can flow through them. Side effects can include tremors and rapid heartbeat. If symptoms and medical history suggest asthma, doctors may treat it with inhaled corticosteroids for a trial period to see whether they help. If symptoms do not improve, corticosteroids will be stopped to avoid side effects. to reduce inflammation caused by severe asthma symptoms. to help open the airways quickly. This medicine may be less effective than SABAs, but it is an option for people who may have side effects from SABAs. Your doctor may prescribe long-term control medicines to take daily to help prevent symptoms by reducing airway inflammation and preventing narrowing of the airways. Treatment with specific control medicines may differ depending on age, such as whether the person is an adult or child. Return to  to review what causes asthma symptoms.  to reduce the body’s inflammatory response. Your doctor may prescribe inhaled or oral (as a pill) corticosteroids. Common side effects from inhaled corticosteroids include a hoarse voice or a mouth infection called thrush. A spacer or holding chamber on your inhaler can help avoid these side effects. Oral corticosteroids can have more side effects than inhaled corticosteroids, because the medicine goes outside the lungs. Read more about inhaled corticosteroids for asthma management. Read more about inhaled corticosteroids for asthma management. such as omalizumab, mepolizumab, reslizumab, and benralizumab, to target specific parts of the body’s response to allergens. Biologic medicines are antibodies used in people who have severe asthma. Benralizumab is injected into a vein, while the other medicines are injected below the skin or in a vein. They are given every few weeks.  to reduce inflammation and keep your airways open. You take these pills by mouth, alone or with corticosteroids, depending on what your doctor prescribes. such as ,to help prevent airway inflammation when you are exposed to allergens or other triggers. These medicines stop certain immune cells from releasing the signals that cause inflammation. such as long-acting beta2-agonists (LABAs), tokeep the airways open by preventing narrowing of the airways. LABAs may be added to your inhaled corticosteroids to reduce narrowing and inflammation. A similar medicine called inhaled long-acting muscarinic antagonists (LAMAs) is sometimes also used.  to reduce the body’s response to allergens. It can be given as an injection, known as an or by mouth as a liquid or tablet. If you have a severe asthma attack and need emergency care, you may be treated with medicines, such as those listed above, given with a nebulizer or IV. You may also receive oxygen therapy or breathing assistance. This may include or through a mask with forced air. In certain cases, your doctor may recommend a procedure called bronchial thermoplasty if you are 18 years or older and have severe asthma that remains uncontrolled despite using other treatments. In this procedure, your doctor will insert a bronchoscope into your airway through the mouth or the nose. This helps your doctor see inside the airways. Heat is used to reduce the muscle around the airway to help prevent constriction. Read more about bronchial thermoplasty in our fact sheet. After being diagnosed with asthma, work with your doctor to learn how to manage it yourself. Because asthma symptoms may be different at different times, it is important to know which medicines to use to prevent and relieve symptoms. You can work with your doctor to develop a plan, called an asthma action plan. Follow-up care will help to make sure your or your child’s asthma is well-controlled. Staying healthy also includes avoiding asthma triggers and maintaining a healthy lifestyle. Watch NHLBI’s video for more information. Work with your doctor to create an asthma action plan that works for you. An asthma action plan is a written treatment plan document that describes the following. When to call your doctor or go to the emergency room If your child has asthma, then your child’s caretakers and school staff should know about the asthma action plan. For a sample plan, see the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute’s (NHLBI) . Your doctor will make sure you are using your inhaler correctly. There are different types of inhalers. Review the way you use your inhaler at every medical visit. Sometimes asthma may get worse because of incorrect inhaler use. Watch our video on Asthma Action Plans to learn more. Then, download a . Asthma triggers are things that set off or worsen asthma symptoms. If you know that your asthma symptoms occur when you are exposed to specific triggers, it may be worthwhile to reduce your exposure to those triggers, using multiple different methods to reduce the exposure. If you are sensitive to dust, consider removing carpet from your home and using air purifiers and mattress and pillowcases that keep out dust mites. If you are sensitive to mice or cockroaches, consider using multiple ways of removing them or preventing them from entering the home in the first place.  Emotional stress, such as intense anger, crying, or laughing, can cause hyperventilation and airway narrowing, triggering an asthma attack. Get the flu vaccine each year to help prevent the flu, which can raise the risk of an asthma attack. Some people who have severe asthma may be sensitive to medicines, such as aspirin, and may experience serious respiratory problems. Tell your doctor about all medicines you or your child currently takes. Pollution or certain kinds of weather, such as thunderstorms, can affect air quality. Pollution can include indoor pollution caused by gases from inefficient cooking or heating devices that are not vented. Outdoor air pollution may be hard to avoid, but you can keep windows closed and avoid strenuous outdoor activity when air quality is low. For guidance, check the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s . This is less common. Regular checkups are important to help your doctor determine how well you are controlling your asthma and adjust treatment if needed. Your doctor will also do regular tests to see how well your lungs are working and how well air is flowing. Your medicines or dosages may change over time, based on changes in your condition or in your life, such as:  Older adults may need different treatments because of other conditions they may have and medicines they may take. Beta-blockers, pain relievers, and anti-inflammatory medicines can affect asthma. Your asthma symptoms may change during pregnancy. You are also at higher risk of asthma attacks. Your doctor will continue to treat you with long-term medicines such as inhaled corticosteroids. Controlling your asthma is important for preventing complications such as preeclampsia, pre-term delivery, and low birth weight of the baby.  Asthma may increase your risk of complications during and after surgery. For instance, having a tube put into your throat may cause an asthma attack. Talk to your doctor and surgeon about how to prepare for surgery. Return to to review possible treatment options for your asthma. Ask your doctor about asthma training or support groups to help you keep asthma under control. Education can help you understand the purpose of your medicines, how to prevent symptoms, how to recognize asthma attacks early, and when to seek medical attention. As part of your asthma action plan, your doctor may show you how to monitor your asthma using a peak flow meter. You can compare your numbers over time to make sure your asthma is controlled. A low number can help warn you of an asthma attack, even before you notice symptoms. Keeping a diary may help if you find it hard to follow your asthma action plan or the plan is not working well. If you have any of the following experiences, record them in the diary and make an appointment to see your doctor. Bring the diary with you to your appointment. You are limiting normal activities and missing school or work. You use your quick-relief inhaler more than two days a week. Your asthma medicines do not seem to work well anymore. Your peak flow number is low or varies a lot from day to day. Your symptoms occur more often, are more severe, or cause you to lose sleep. If your young child’s asthma is not well-controlled, you may notice that he or she is coughing more at night and eating less. Your child also may seem more tired (called ), irritable, or moody. Your doctor may recommend one or more of the following changes to help keep asthma symptoms in check.  Obesity can make asthma harder to manage. Talk to your doctor about programs that can help. Even a 5% to 10% weight loss can help symptoms. Eating more fruits and vegetables and getting enough .  Even though exercise is an asthma trigger for some people, you should not avoid it. Physical activity is an important part of a healthy lifestyle. Talk with your doctor about what level of physical activity is right for you. Ask about medicines that can help you stay active. Learn breathing and relaxation techniques, which can help symptoms. Meet with a mental health professional if you have anxiety, depression, or panic attacks.  Smoking tobacco and inhaling smoke from secondhand smoke make asthma harder to treat. Vaping e-cigarettes and getting exposed to secondhand vapor may also be linked to asthma symptoms. Research suggests that nicotine and flavorings found in vaping e-cigarettes can damage your lungs. Visit  or call the National Cancer Institute’s Smoking Quitline at 1-877-44U-QUIT (1-877-448-7848). Getting quality sleep can sometimes be difficult with asthma. Develop healthy sleep habits by going to sleep and getting up at regular times, following a calming bedtime routine, and keeping you bedroom cool and dark.  Your doctor may recommend that you keep your medicine dose as low as possible to prevent long-term side effects. High doses of certain asthma medicines over time can increase your risk of cataracts and osteoporosis. A cataract is the clouding of lens in your eye. Osteoporosis is a disorder that makes your bones weak and more likely to break. Read more in What People With Asthma Need To Know About Osteoporosis. Keep your asthma under control and contact your doctor if anything changes. When asthma is unmanaged, it can lead to potentially life-threatening asthma attacks. If you are pregnant, it can put the health of your unborn baby at risk. A written asthma action plan developed with your doctor can help you know when to for emergency care. Asthma attacks can be more dangerous for some people. You should seek care immediately during an asthma attack if you or your child: Has been hospitalized for asthma in the past year Has had life-threatening asthma attacks in the past Uses more than one canister of inhaled short-acting beta2-agonists (SABAs) medicine each month Has a mental health condition or alcohol or drug use disorder For young children with asthma, call if they: The NHLBI is part of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ National Institutes of Health (NIH)—the Nation’s biomedical  agency that makes important scientific discovery to improve health and save lives.

View more information about Are you an adult who has asthma, or are you willing to be a healthy volunteer? This study aims to test a new and less invasive way to look at the levels of a protein called GSNOR in people who have asthma. High levels of this protein can lead to inflammation (swelling) in the airways. Normally, doctors measure GSNOR levels with bronchoscopy (a tube inserted through your mouth into your airways). But this often requires you to be sedated. In the new approach being studied here, you will breathe in a chemical that your body makes, called GSNO. Researchers will look at how much of the chemical is broken down in your breath. This will tell them what your GSNOR levels are. They will compare the levels between people who have asthma and people who do not to see whether the test works. To participate in this study, you should be between 18 and 80 years old and either have been diagnosed with asthma for at least a year or not have asthma and not smoke.

The airways are tubes that carry air in and out of your lungs. If you have asthma, the airways can become inflamed and narrowed at times. Asthma affects people of all ages and often starts during childhood. You may wheeze, cough, or feel tightness in your chest. These symptoms can range from mild to severe and can happen every day or only once in a while. Certain things can set off or worsen asthma symptoms, such as cold air. These are called asthma triggers. When symptoms get worse, it is called an asthma attack. An asthma action plan can help you manage your asthma. The plan may include monitoring, avoiding triggers, and using medicines. Explore this Health Topic to learn more about asthma and , our role in and Find asthma guides, tip sheets, and other resources from NHLBI’s program. The exact cause of asthma is unknown, and the causes may vary from person to person. However, asthma is often the result of a strong response of the immune system to a substance in the lungs. To understand asthma, it helps to understand . Normally, the body’s immune system helps to fight infections. Sometimes a person’s immune system responds to a substance in the environment called an allergen. When someone breathes in an allergen, such as ragweed, the immune system in the airways may react strongly. Other people exposed to the same substance may not react at all. The immune system reacts to an allergen by creating . Inflammation makes your airways swell and narrow and possibly produce more mucus. This can make it harder to breathe. The muscles around the airways may also tighten, which is called a bronchospasm. This can make it even harder to breathe. Over time, the airway walls can become thicker. The image below shows how airways narrow during asthma. Your asthma may have been caused partly by a viral infection or allergens in the air when you were a baby or young child. During this stage of life, your immune system is still developing. It’s not clear why one person reacts to an exposure while others do not. Genes seem to play a role in making some people more susceptible to asthma. Your environment or occupation, your family history or genes, other medical conditions, your race or ethnicity, or your sex may raise your risk for developing asthma. Asthma affects people of all ages, but it often starts during childhood. Sometimes asthma develops in adults, particularly women. This type of asthma is called adult-onset or late-onset asthma. Things in your environment, including at work or home, may raise your risk of developing asthma or make asthma symptoms worse.  or in a child’s first few years raises the risk of developing asthma symptoms early in life. This exposure may also affect lung growth and development.  especially early in life, can affect how the immune system develops. These effects on the immune system may either increase or protect against the risk of developing asthma.  such as chemical irritants or industrial dusts, may also raise the risk of developing asthma in susceptible people. This type of asthma is called occupational asthma. It may develop over a period of years, and it often lasts even after you are no longer exposed.  may make asthma worse. Pollutants may include traffic-related air pollution. Allergens in the air may include pollen, dust, or other particles. Genes mayplay a role in the development of asthma because they affect how the immune system develops. More than one gene is likely involved. You inherit genes from your parents. Having a parent who has asthma, especially if the mother has asthma, increases the risk that a child will develop asthma. Asthma is often linked to other medical conditions, such as:  Asthma is usually a type of allergic reaction. People who have asthma often have other types of allergies. They may have food allergies or get a runny or stuffy nose from pollen. You may be at higher risk for developing asthma if you had allergic reactions in early childhood to substances in the air, such as pollen, dander, mold, or dust. The more things you are allergic to, the higher your risk of asthma. can increase the chances of developing asthma or worsening asthma symptoms. This may be because people who have obesity can have inflammation or changes in the immune system.  Young children who often have respiratory infections caused by viruses are at highest risk of developing asthma symptoms early in life. African Americans and Puerto Ricans are at higher risk of asthma than people of other races or ethnicities. African American and Hispanic children are more likely to die from asthma-related causes than non-Hispanic white Americans. Among children, more boys than girls have asthma. Among teens and adults, asthma is more common among women than men. There is no routine screening for asthma, and there is no way to prevent asthma. Your doctor may recommend avoiding certain  to help prevent asthma from getting worse or causing asthma attacks. Learn about tests your doctor may use to . How often  and  of asthma occur may depend on how severe, or intense, the asthma is and whether you are exposed to allergens. Some people have symptoms every day, while others have symptoms only a few days of the year. For some people, asthma may cause discomfort but does not interfere with daily activities. If you have more severe asthma, however, your asthma may limit what you are able to do. When asthma is well controlled, a person shows few symptoms. When symptoms worsen, a person can have what is called an asthma attack, or an exacerbation. Over time, uncontrolled asthma can damage the airways in the lungs.  which causes a whistling sound when you exhale While other conditions can cause the same symptoms as asthma, the pattern of symptoms in people who have asthma usually has some of the following characteristics. They come and go over time or within the same day. They start or get worse with viral infections, such as a cold. They are triggered by exercise, allergies, cold air, or   are episodes that occur when symptoms get much worse and require a change in typical treatment. These can come on gradually or suddenly and may be life-threatening. People who have severe asthma often get asthma attacks more often. Asthma is diagnosed based on your medical history, a physical exam, and results from diagnostic tests. You may need to see a team of healthcare providers, including your doctor; an asthma specialist, called a pulmonologist; or an allergy specialist, called an allergist. . They may ask also about any known allergies. This includes how often symptoms occur, what seems to trigger your symptoms, when or where symptoms occur, and if your symptoms wake you up at night. Listen to your breathing and look for of asthma Look for allergic skin conditions, such as eczema Your doctor may ask you to perform the following tests to determine whether your symptoms are caused by asthma.  such as spirometry, which involves breathing in and out through a tube connected to a computer. This measures how much and how fast the air moves when you breathe in and out with maximum effort. Watch this video to learn more about . tomeasure how much and how fast air moves in and out both before and after you take an inhaled medicine to relax the muscles in your airway.   to measure how your airways react to specific exposures. During this test, you inhale different concentrations of allergens or medicines that may tighten the muscles in your airways. Spirometry is done before and after the test.  to measure how fast you can blow air out using maximum effort. This test can be done during spirometry or by breathing into a separate device, such as a tube. to measure levels of nitric oxide in your breath when you breathe out. High levels of nitric oxide may mean that your lungs are inflamed. This test is done in adults and children age 5 and older.  if you have a history of allergies. These tests can tell your doctor which allergens, such as pet dander or pollen, causes a reaction from your immune system. It can be hard to tell whether a child under age 6 has asthma or another respiratory condition, because young children often cannot perform a pulmonary function test such as spirometry. After checking a child’s history and symptoms, the doctor may try asthma medicines for a few months to see how well a child responds. About 40% of children who wheeze when they get colds or respiratory infections are eventually diagnosed with asthma. If you are diagnosed with asthma, your doctor will work with you to create a treatment plan to manage your asthma symptoms and prevent asthma attacks. Treatment usually depends on your age, asthma severity, and response to a given treatment option. Your doctor may adjust your treatment until asthma symptoms are controlled. Most people are treated long-term with daily controller(s), along with another inhaler for short-term relief, when they have symptoms or to prevent symptoms. An inhaler allows the medicine to go into the mouth and . Watch our video to learn about treatment for asthma.  Short-term relief medicines, also called quick-relief medicines, help prevent symptoms or relieve symptoms during an asthma attack. They may be the only medicines needed for mild asthma or asthma that happens only with physical activity. Your doctor will prescribe a quick-relief inhaler for you to carry at all times. Visit the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to .  to quickly relax tight muscles around your airways. This allows the airways to open so air can flow through them. Side effects can include tremors and rapid heartbeat. If symptoms and medical history suggest asthma, doctors may treat it with inhaled corticosteroids for a trial period to see whether they help. If symptoms do not improve, corticosteroids will be stopped to avoid side effects. to reduce inflammation caused by severe asthma symptoms. to help open the airways quickly. This medicine may be less effective than SABAs, but it is an option for people who may have side effects from SABAs. Your doctor may prescribe long-term control medicines to take daily to help prevent symptoms by reducing airway inflammation and preventing narrowing of the airways. Treatment with specific control medicines may differ depending on age, such as whether the person is an adult or child. Return to  to review what causes asthma symptoms.  to reduce the body’s inflammatory response. Your doctor may prescribe inhaled or oral (as a pill) corticosteroids. Common side effects from inhaled corticosteroids include a hoarse voice or a mouth infection called thrush. A spacer or holding chamber on your inhaler can help avoid these side effects. Oral corticosteroids can have more side effects than inhaled corticosteroids, because the medicine goes outside the lungs. Read more about inhaled corticosteroids for asthma management. Read more about inhaled corticosteroids for asthma management. such as omalizumab, mepolizumab, reslizumab, and benralizumab, to target specific parts of the body’s response to allergens. Biologic medicines are antibodies used in people who have severe asthma. Benralizumab is injected into a vein, while the other medicines are injected below the skin or in a vein. They are given every few weeks.  to reduce inflammation and keep your airways open. You take these pills by mouth, alone or with corticosteroids, depending on what your doctor prescribes. such as ,to help prevent airway inflammation when you are exposed to allergens or other triggers. These medicines stop certain immune cells from releasing the signals that cause inflammation. such as long-acting beta2-agonists (LABAs), tokeep the airways open by preventing narrowing of the airways. LABAs may be added to your inhaled corticosteroids to reduce narrowing and inflammation. A similar medicine called inhaled long-acting muscarinic antagonists (LAMAs) is sometimes also used.  to reduce the body’s response to allergens. It can be given as an injection, known as an or by mouth as a liquid or tablet. If you have a severe asthma attack and need emergency care, you may be treated with medicines, such as those listed above, given with a nebulizer or IV. You may also receive oxygen therapy or breathing assistance. This may include or through a mask with forced air. In certain cases, your doctor may recommend a procedure called bronchial thermoplasty if you are 18 years or older and have severe asthma that remains uncontrolled despite using other treatments. In this procedure, your doctor will insert a bronchoscope into your airway through the mouth or the nose. This helps your doctor see inside the airways. Heat is used to reduce the muscle around the airway to help prevent constriction. Read more about bronchial thermoplasty in our fact sheet. After being diagnosed with asthma, work with your doctor to learn how to manage it yourself. Because asthma symptoms may be different at different times, it is important to know which medicines to use to prevent and relieve symptoms. You can work with your doctor to develop a plan, called an asthma action plan. Follow-up care will help to make sure your or your child’s asthma is well-controlled. Staying healthy also includes avoiding asthma triggers and maintaining a healthy lifestyle. Watch NHLBI’s video for more information. Work with your doctor to create an asthma action plan that works for you. An asthma action plan is a written treatment plan document that describes the following. When to call your doctor or go to the emergency room If your child has asthma, then your child’s caretakers and school staff should know about the asthma action plan. For a sample plan, see the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute’s (NHLBI) . Your doctor will make sure you are using your inhaler correctly. There are different types of inhalers. Review the way you use your inhaler at every medical visit. Sometimes asthma may get worse because of incorrect inhaler use. Watch our video on Asthma Action Plans to learn more. Then, download a . Asthma triggers are things that set off or worsen asthma symptoms. If you know that your asthma symptoms occur when you are exposed to specific triggers, it may be worthwhile to reduce your exposure to those triggers, using multiple different methods to reduce the exposure. If you are sensitive to dust, consider removing carpet from your home and using air purifiers and mattress and pillowcases that keep out dust mites. If you are sensitive to mice or cockroaches, consider using multiple ways of removing them or preventing them from entering the home in the first place.  Emotional stress, such as intense anger, crying, or laughing, can cause hyperventilation and airway narrowing, triggering an asthma attack. Get the flu vaccine each year to help prevent the flu, which can raise the risk of an asthma attack. Some people who have severe asthma may be sensitive to medicines, such as aspirin, and may experience serious respiratory problems. Tell your doctor about all medicines you or your child currently takes. Pollution or certain kinds of weather, such as thunderstorms, can affect air quality. Pollution can include indoor pollution caused by gases from inefficient cooking or heating devices that are not vented. Outdoor air pollution may be hard to avoid, but you can keep windows closed and avoid strenuous outdoor activity when air quality is low. For guidance, check the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s . This is less common. Regular checkups are important to help your doctor determine how well you are controlling your asthma and adjust treatment if needed. Your doctor will also do regular tests to see how well your lungs are working and how well air is flowing. Your medicines or dosages may change over time, based on changes in your condition or in your life, such as:  Older adults may need different treatments because of other conditions they may have and medicines they may take. Beta-blockers, pain relievers, and anti-inflammatory medicines can affect asthma. Your asthma symptoms may change during pregnancy. You are also at higher risk of asthma attacks. Your doctor will continue to treat you with long-term medicines such as inhaled corticosteroids. Controlling your asthma is important for preventing complications such as preeclampsia, pre-term delivery, and low birth weight of the baby.  Asthma may increase your risk of complications during and after surgery. For instance, having a tube put into your throat may cause an asthma attack. Talk to your doctor and surgeon about how to prepare for surgery. Return to to review possible treatment options for your asthma. Ask your doctor about asthma training or support groups to help you keep asthma under control. Education can help you understand the purpose of your medicines, how to prevent symptoms, how to recognize asthma attacks early, and when to seek medical attention. As part of your asthma action plan, your doctor may show you how to monitor your asthma using a peak flow meter. You can compare your numbers over time to make sure your asthma is controlled. A low number can help warn you of an asthma attack, even before you notice symptoms. Keeping a diary may help if you find it hard to follow your asthma action plan or the plan is not working well. If you have any of the following experiences, record them in the diary and make an appointment to see your doctor. Bring the diary with you to your appointment. You are limiting normal activities and missing school or work. You use your quick-relief inhaler more than two days a week. Your asthma medicines do not seem to work well anymore. Your peak flow number is low or varies a lot from day to day. Your symptoms occur more often, are more severe, or cause you to lose sleep. If your young child’s asthma is not well-controlled, you may notice that he or she is coughing more at night and eating less. Your child also may seem more tired (called ), irritable, or moody. Your doctor may recommend one or more of the following changes to help keep asthma symptoms in check.  Obesity can make asthma harder to manage. Talk to your doctor about programs that can help. Even a 5% to 10% weight loss can help symptoms. Eating more fruits and vegetables and getting enough .  Even though exercise is an asthma trigger for some people, you should not avoid it. Physical activity is an important part of a healthy lifestyle. Talk with your doctor about what level of physical activity is right for you. Ask about medicines that can help you stay active. Learn breathing and relaxation techniques, which can help symptoms. Meet with a mental health professional if you have anxiety, depression, or panic attacks.  Smoking tobacco and inhaling smoke from secondhand smoke make asthma harder to treat. Vaping e-cigarettes and getting exposed to secondhand vapor may also be linked to asthma symptoms. Research suggests that nicotine and flavorings found in vaping e-cigarettes can damage your lungs. Visit  or call the National Cancer Institute’s Smoking Quitline at 1-877-44U-QUIT (1-877-448-7848). Getting quality sleep can sometimes be difficult with asthma. Develop healthy sleep habits by going to sleep and getting up at regular times, following a calming bedtime routine, and keeping you bedroom cool and dark.  Your doctor may recommend that you keep your medicine dose as low as possible to prevent long-term side effects. High doses of certain asthma medicines over time can increase your risk of cataracts and osteoporosis. A cataract is the clouding of lens in your eye. Osteoporosis is a disorder that makes your bones weak and more likely to break. Read more in What People With Asthma Need To Know About Osteoporosis. Keep your asthma under control and contact your doctor if anything changes. When asthma is unmanaged, it can lead to potentially life-threatening asthma attacks. If you are pregnant, it can put the health of your unborn baby at risk. A written asthma action plan developed with your doctor can help you know when to for emergency care. Asthma attacks can be more dangerous for some people. You should seek care immediately during an asthma attack if you or your child: Has been hospitalized for asthma in the past year Has had life-threatening asthma attacks in the past Uses more than one canister of inhaled short-acting beta2-agonists (SABAs) medicine each month Has a mental health condition or alcohol or drug use disorder For young children with asthma, call if they: The NHLBI is part of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ National Institutes of Health (NIH)—the Nation’s biomedical  agency that makes important scientific discovery to improve health and save lives.

This study aims to test a new and less invasive way to look at the levels of a protein called GSNOR in people who have asthma. High levels of this protein can lead to inflammation (swelling) in the airways. Normally, doctors measure GSNOR levels with bronchoscopy (a tube inserted through your mouth into your airways). But this often requires you to be sedated. In the new approach being studied here, you will breathe in a chemical that your body makes, called GSNO. Researchers will look at how much of the chemical is broken down in your breath. This will tell them what your GSNOR levels are. They will compare the levels between people who have asthma and people who do not to see whether the test works. To participate in this study, you should be between 18 and 80 years old and either have been diagnosed with asthma for at least a year or not have asthma and not smoke.

4a4146a7-e975-475e-bdf7-f4d8aec155d7,"Everything You Want to Know About Asthma in Children — is a respiratory condition that’s characterized by inflammation of the airways. According to the , asthma is a common childhood condition that affects roughly 6 million children around the United States. If your child has asthma, it’s important to understand their triggers and create a long-term treatment plan to keep the condition managed. This article will explore everything you need to know about asthma in children, including symptoms, triggers, treatment, and more. It can be difficult to distinguish the symptoms of childhood asthma from other respiratory conditions, such as a head or chest cold. However, asthma symptoms are usually chronic and can negatively affect your child’s quality of life. The most common symptoms of childhood asthma include: , which becomes worse at night or when your child is sick , which can appear as a whistling or squeaking noise when breathing , even when your child is doing normal activities In addition, there are some other asthma symptoms that can appear in both toddlers and older children. Toddlers aren’t always able to communicate when they’re not feeling well, which means it’s important for parents to pay attention to any new symptoms. In toddlers with asthma, symptoms may also include: Older children have an easier time communicating symptoms to their parents. In older children with asthma, in addition to the symptoms above, they may also experience: Some children will experience only a few of the symptoms above, while others may show obvious signs of respiratory distress. In some children with severe asthma, a worsening of the symptoms can lead to an asthma attack. Asthma attacks generally present as a worsening of asthma symptoms. in children may also look like: Severe asthma attacks in both children and adults can be life threatening and require immediate medical attention. The development of childhood asthma can be caused by a variety of factors, including: Having a family history of asthma or allergies has been shown to increase the risk of having asthma. Having allergies may increase a child’s risk of developing asthma. Allergy symptoms can also mimic the symptoms of asthma in children. Having frequent respiratory infections may lead to the development of symptoms of asthma in children, especially in children under age 5. Some of the risk factors for asthma, such as allergies and infections, can also trigger asthma symptoms in children. For most children with asthma, there are certain “triggers” that can cause a worsening of symptoms or lead to an asthma attack. Common asthma triggers include: , such as the common cold or flu , especially in cold, dry, or humid weather , from tobacco, bonfires, and industrial pollution , especially to animals, dust mites, mold, and other common allergens Once you know your child’s asthma triggers, you can make a few lifestyle adjustments to help your child avoid them as much as possible. Here are several examples: Teaching your child good personal hygiene can of contracting a cold or the flu. If your child has , getting treatment to properly manage their condition can help limit restrictions on playtime, sports, and other activities they may enjoy. Keeping your house clean of dust, dander, and other allergens can help reduce the risk of allergy-related asthma symptoms. Diagnosing asthma in children can be difficult, especially when they have a hard time communicating symptoms. There are some diagnostic tools your child’s doctor can use to narrow down a diagnosis. A pediatrician will likely do a full review of your child’s medical history. They’ll ask about the symptoms your child has been experiencing, the length of those symptoms, and any other conditions they’ve been diagnosed with. If your child’s pediatrician suspects allergies, they can perform blood or skin tests to check for inflammatory markers. They may also choose to perform allergy testing, which can help determine if allergy triggers could be causing asthma symptoms. Your child’s doctor may choose to perform a chest X-ray to determine if the symptoms are due to conditions other than asthma. A chest X-ray can sometimes also show changes in the airways caused by severe asthma. Note: One of the most common diagnostic tools for asthma in adults is the , which involves using a spirometer to check for lung function. However, this test is not usually performed on younger children because they have trouble performing the test as directed. There’s no cure for asthma. Instead, asthma treatments focus on reducing or eliminating the symptoms of the condition and preventing ongoing airway inflammation. Both clinical and at-home treatments are effective in helping manage the symptoms of childhood asthma. Even with lifestyle changes, some children will require medication to manage their asthma symptoms. These may include: , which are medications that help to relax the airways and increase airflow. , which help to reduce the inflammation and swelling of the airways. Bronchodilators are generally used as rescue therapies for quick relief of asthma symptoms. These quick-relief medications, including short-acting beta agonists and anticholinergics, are most helpful during asthma attacks and acute flareups. Anti-inflammatories are generally used as long-term asthma medications to help manage symptoms and decrease the need for rescue therapies. These long-term medications, including corticosteroids, and more, help to reduce the inflammation that may cause asthma symptoms. While most of these medications can be given in multiple forms, younger children generally benefit from utilizing nebulizers and oral medications for their treatment. Younger children can also be given medications via inhalers using a spacer device and an appropriately sized mask. There are a few steps that you can try at home with your child to help reduce asthma symptom flare-ups. If the air in your home is too dry, it may trigger asthma symptoms. Use a in or near your child’s room to keep the relative humidity . Be sure to clean a humidifier often, according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Practicing breathing exercises with your child can help prevent hyperventilation when symptoms flare up. Some research has suggested that diffusing may help to reduce airway inflammation. However, more research is needed to determine if essential oils can help reduce asthma symptoms, and essential oils are not recommended for children. Having an asthma attack can be scary, but there are ways that you and your child can prepare. The first step you should take after your child has been diagnosed with asthma is to create an action plan. This plan should include information about: how to notice when your child’s asthma symptoms are getting worse Rescue medications can be used at the start of an asthma attack to open the airways. The dosage that your child needs during an asthma attack may be different, so it’s important to ask your doctor how much medication is needed. If there’s no rescue medication available or the medication doesn’t help, you should seek immediate medical attention. You can also use these with your child: Sit your child up straight to keep the airways open as much as possible. Use breathing exercises to help them steady their breathing. Speak quietly, offer a comforting hand, and try to keep them as calm as possible. Statistics from the CDC have suggested that roughly of all children with asthma will have an asthma attack at some point. Having an action plan ready can help reduce the severity of an attack, but the most important step is to keep your child’s asthma properly managed. If you’re worried that your child’s asthma is not well managed, you may benefit from using the , which is designed for children ages 4 to 11. This questionnaire uses a scoring system to help you determine if your child’s asthma is under control. The higher the score, the more managed your child’s symptoms may be. For children, ages 12 and older, you may benefit from using the Asthma Control Test™. It’s designed and works similarly to the childhood test. If you believe your child may be showing symptoms of childhood asthma, it’s time to visit a doctor. The longer you wait to address their symptoms, the higher your child’s risk is of having an asthma attack if they do, in fact, have asthma. If your child has been diagnosed with asthma, you can begin a treatment protocol that will improve both the asthma symptoms and your child’s quality of life. Childhood asthma is one of the most common lung conditions worldwide. Symptoms of asthma in children may include: Diagnosis of childhood asthma includes a medical history review and, if necessary, other diagnostic tests. Treatment options for asthma include both short-term and long-term medications and lifestyle changes to help manage the symptoms. If your child has been experiencing asthma symptoms, schedule a visit with their pediatrician to find out more. — The Differences Between Childhood and Adult-Onset Asthma Asthma for children and adults has the same symptoms, but affects each differently.

487d90df-8193-4e4b-b66c-61809cd8a13c,"| | > > > symptomviewer Use this guide only if a doctor has told you your child has asthma Symptoms of an asthma attack are wheezing, a cough, tight chest, and trouble breathing. Wheezing is the classic symptom. Wheezing is a high-pitched whistling or purring sound. You can hear it best when your child is breathing out. The diagnosis of asthma requires attacks of wheezing that recur. The diagnosis is rarely made before 1 year of age. that affect breathing (like colds or the flu) (such as smog, car exhaust, menthol vapors, barns, dirty basement) Asthma attacks caused by food allergy can be life-threatening (anaphylaxis). Examples are nuts or fish. No Shortness of Breath (SOB) at rest. Mild SOB with walking. Can talk normally. Speaks in sentences. Can lay down flat. Wheezes not heard or mild. (Green Zone: Peak Flow Rate 80-100% of normal rate) SOB at rest. Speaks in phrases. Wants to sit (can't lay down flat). Wheezing can be heard. Retractions are present (ribs pull in with each breath). (Yellow Zone: Peak Flow Rate 50-80% of normal rate) Severe SOB at rest. Speaks in single words. Struggling to breathe. Wheezing may be loud. Rarely, wheezing is absent due to poor air movement. Retractions may be severe. (Red Zone: Peak Flow Rate less than 50% of normal rate) a peak flow meter measures Peak Flow Rates (PFR). It tells us how well a person can move air out of the lungs. A PFR can be used in children 6 years and older. Wheezing and life-threatening allergic reaction to similar substance in the past Start to wheeze suddenly after a bee sting, taking medicine, or eating an allergic food Severe trouble breathing (struggling for each breath, can barely speak or cry) You think your child has a life-threatening emergency Looks like he did when hospitalized before with asthma Trouble breathing not gone 20 minutes after neb or inhaler Peak flow rate less than 50% of normal rate (Red Zone) Ribs are pulling in with each breath (called retractions) Pulse oxygen level less than 90% during asthma attack PEFR is 50-80% of normal rate after using nebulizer or inhaler (Yellow Zone) Wheezing not gone 20 minutes after using neb or inhaler Nonstop coughing not better after using nebulizer or inhaler Need to use asthma medicine (neb or inhaler) more often than every 4 hours You think your child needs to be seen, and the problem is urgent Mild wheezing lasts more than 24 hours on neb or inhaler treatments You think your child needs to be seen, but the problem is not urgent Don't have written asthma action plan from your doctor Miss more than 1 day of school per month for asthma When you are away from your home, always take your child's medicines with you. The sooner you start treatment, the faster your child will feel better. Your child's quick-relief (rescue) medicine is albuterol or xopenex. Start it at the first sign of any wheezing, shortness of breath or hard coughing. Give by inhaler with a spacer (2 puffs each time) or use a neb machine. Repeat it every 4 hours if your child is having any asthma symptoms. Never give it more often than 4 hours without talking with your child's doctor. Coughing. The best ""cough med"" for a child with asthma is always the asthma medicine. Caution: Don't use cough suppressants. If over 6 years old, cough drops may help a tickly cough. Caution: If the inhaler hasn't been used in over 7 days, prime it. Test spray it twice into the air before using it for treatment. Also, do this if it is new. Use the medicine until your child has not wheezed or coughed for 48 hours. Spacer. Always use inhalers with a spacer. It will get twice the amount of medicine into the lungs. Your child may have been told to use a controller drug. An example is an inhaled steroid. It's for preventing attacks and must be used daily. During asthma attacks, keep giving this medicine to your child as ordered. For signs of nasal allergies (hay fever), it's okay to give allergy medicine. Reason: Poor control of nasal allergies makes asthma worse. Reason: It will loosen up any phlegm in the lungs. Then it's easier to cough up. If the air in your home is dry, use a humidifier. Reason: Dry air makes coughs worse. Shower to remove pollens or other allergens from the body and hair. Avoid known causes of asthma attacks (such as smoke or cats). During attacks, reduce exercise or sports if it makes your child's asthma worse. If treatment is started early, most asthma attacks are quickly brought under control. Step 1. Shake the inhaler well. Then attach it to the spacer (holding chamber). Step 2. Breathe out completely and empty the lungs. Step 3. Close the lips and teeth around the spacer mouthpiece. Step 4. Press down on the inhaler. This will put one puff of the medicine in the spacer. Step 5. Breathe in slowly until the lungs are full. Step 6. Hold a deep breath for 10 seconds. Allow the medicine to work deep in the lungs. If your doctor has ordered 2 or more puffs, wait 1 minute. Then repeat steps 1-6. Metered Dose Inhaler (MDI): How to Use Without a Spacer (if you don't have one) Step 2. Breathe out completely and empty the lungs. Step 3. Close the lips and teeth around the inhaler mouthpiece. Step 4. Press down on the inhaler to release a puff. Do this just as your child starts to breathe in. Step 5. Breathe in slowly until the lungs are full. Step 6. Hold a deep breath for 10 seconds. Allow the medicine to work deep in the lungs. If your doctor has ordered 2 or more puffs, wait 1 minute. Then repeat steps 1-6. Ask your doctor for a spacer if you don't have one. It will help send more medicine into the lungs. Older children who don't like a spacer can be prescribed an albuterol dry powder device. A nebulizer machine changes a liquid medicine (med) into a fine mist. The fine mist can carry the med deep into the lungs. This is called a nebulizer (neb) treatment. Step 1. Prepare the medicine. First, wash your hands with soap and water. For pre-mixed single dose vials, just add one vial to the neb holding cup. For multi-dose vials, you need to do the mixing. First, add the correct amount of normal saline to the neb cup. Then carefully measure and add the correct amount of medicine to the saline. Step 2. Connect the nebulizer to the air compressor tubing. The air compressor is run by electricity. Portable ones run on a battery. Compressors make the jet of air that turns the medicine into a fine mist. Step 3. Turn on the air compressor. It will start making the fine mist that your child needs. Step 4 for an Older Child. Place the mouthpiece between your child's teeth and seal with the lips. Ask your child to breathe slowly and deeply. Ask your child to hold a deep breath for 10 seconds once a minute. Step 4 for a Younger Child. If your child refuses the mouthpiece, use a face mask. It should cover the nose and mouth. It should fit snugly. Step 5. Continue the treatment until the med is gone. If the med sticks to the side of the cup, shake it a little. An average neb treatment takes 10 minutes. Step 6. After each treatment, take the nebulizer apart. Rinse and clean it as directed. Reason: It can't produce mist if it becomes clogged up. Caution: Closely follow your doctor's instructions. Use the exact amount of med your doctor ordered. Don't give a neb treatment more often than every 4 hours. Asthma quick-relief medicine (neb or inhaler) is needed more than every 4 hours And remember, contact your doctor if your child develops any of the 'Call Your Doctor' symptoms. A (or holding chamber) can be useful for all people with asthma. A spacer makes it easier to correctly inhale the asthma medicine from the metered dose inhaler (MDI). A spacer is very useful in younger children and older adults. STEP 1 - Shake the inhaler and then attach it to the spacer (holding chamber). STEP 3 - Place the mouthpiece of the spacer in your mouth. STEP 4 - Press down on the inhaler. This will put one puff of the medicine in the holding chamber or spacer. STEP 6 - Hold your breath for 10 seconds and then exhale. If your doctor has prescribed two or more puffs, wait 1 minute between each puff and then repeat steps 1-6. Copyright 2000-2020. Schmitt Pediatric Guidelines. Used by Permission.

To use a dry powder inhaler, it is important to close your mouth tightly around the mouthpiece of the inhaler and to inhale rapidly. Here are the steps: STEP 1 - Remove the cap and follow package instructions to load a dose of medicine. STEP 3 - Put the mouthpiece of the inhaler in the mouth. STEP 5 - Hold your breath for ten seconds to allow the medicine to reach deeply into your lungs. If your doctor has prescribed two or more inhalations, wait 1 minute and then repeat steps 2-5.

Wheezing is the classic symptom. Wheezing is a high-pitched whistling or purring sound. You can hear it best when your child is breathing out. The diagnosis of asthma requires attacks of wheezing that recur. The diagnosis is rarely made before 1 year of age. that affect breathing (like colds or the flu) (such as smog, car exhaust, menthol vapors, barns, dirty basement) Asthma attacks caused by food allergy can be life-threatening (anaphylaxis). Examples are nuts or fish. No Shortness of Breath (SOB) at rest. Mild SOB with walking. Can talk normally. Speaks in sentences. Can lay down flat. Wheezes not heard or mild. (Green Zone: Peak Flow Rate 80-100% of normal rate) SOB at rest. Speaks in phrases. Wants to sit (can't lay down flat). Wheezing can be heard. Retractions are present (ribs pull in with each breath). (Yellow Zone: Peak Flow Rate 50-80% of normal rate) Severe SOB at rest. Speaks in single words. Struggling to breathe. Wheezing may be loud. Rarely, wheezing is absent due to poor air movement. Retractions may be severe. (Red Zone: Peak Flow Rate less than 50% of normal rate) a peak flow meter measures Peak Flow Rates (PFR). It tells us how well a person can move air out of the lungs. A PFR can be used in children 6 years and older. Wheezing and life-threatening allergic reaction to similar substance in the past Start to wheeze suddenly after a bee sting, taking medicine, or eating an allergic food Severe trouble breathing (struggling for each breath, can barely speak or cry) You think your child has a life-threatening emergency Looks like he did when hospitalized before with asthma Trouble breathing not gone 20 minutes after neb or inhaler Peak flow rate less than 50% of normal rate (Red Zone) Ribs are pulling in with each breath (called retractions) Pulse oxygen level less than 90% during asthma attack PEFR is 50-80% of normal rate after using nebulizer or inhaler (Yellow Zone) Wheezing not gone 20 minutes after using neb or inhaler Nonstop coughing not better after using nebulizer or inhaler Need to use asthma medicine (neb or inhaler) more often than every 4 hours You think your child needs to be seen, and the problem is urgent Mild wheezing lasts more than 24 hours on neb or inhaler treatments You think your child needs to be seen, but the problem is not urgent Don't have written asthma action plan from your doctor Miss more than 1 day of school per month for asthma When you are away from your home, always take your child's medicines with you. The sooner you start treatment, the faster your child will feel better. Your child's quick-relief (rescue) medicine is albuterol or xopenex. Start it at the first sign of any wheezing, shortness of breath or hard coughing. Give by inhaler with a spacer (2 puffs each time) or use a neb machine. Repeat it every 4 hours if your child is having any asthma symptoms. Never give it more often than 4 hours without talking with your child's doctor. Coughing. The best ""cough med"" for a child with asthma is always the asthma medicine. Caution: Don't use cough suppressants. If over 6 years old, cough drops may help a tickly cough. Caution: If the inhaler hasn't been used in over 7 days, prime it. Test spray it twice into the air before using it for treatment. Also, do this if it is new. Use the medicine until your child has not wheezed or coughed for 48 hours. Spacer. Always use inhalers with a spacer. It will get twice the amount of medicine into the lungs. Your child may have been told to use a controller drug. An example is an inhaled steroid. It's for preventing attacks and must be used daily. During asthma attacks, keep giving this medicine to your child as ordered. For signs of nasal allergies (hay fever), it's okay to give allergy medicine. Reason: Poor control of nasal allergies makes asthma worse. Reason: It will loosen up any phlegm in the lungs. Then it's easier to cough up. If the air in your home is dry, use a humidifier. Reason: Dry air makes coughs worse. Shower to remove pollens or other allergens from the body and hair. Avoid known causes of asthma attacks (such as smoke or cats).

d5d951f8-686d-490c-a49d-c96f5f76888c,"Most people associate asthma with sudden fits of coughing and wheezing, but the condition is a round-the-clock disease. If your child has asthma, the tubes that carry air to her lungs are inflamed and may be swollen and clogged with mucus. This state may not impair her breathing, but it does set the stage for asthma attacks. The inflamed airway is extra sensitive, and something as seemingly harmless as dust, cold air, or exercise can cause the muscles lining the airway to suddenly squeeze tight, leaving little room for air to pass. About 1 in 10 Americans under the age of 18 have been diagnosed with asthma. It can strike at almost any age, but the first symptoms usually appear early in life, most often when kids are in grade school. The good news is that while children with severe asthma may never outgrow it, kids with milder forms can be free of symptoms by adulthood. Childhood asthma can be hard to spot. Coughing and wheezing (especially at night) are the most common symptoms in children, but not every kid with asthma has them. Some simply suffer from congestion and tightness in their chests or rapid, raspy breathing. One clue is allergies: Most children with asthma also have allergies. So if your child suffers from hay fever, eczema, or other allergic reactions, take any sign of asthma seriously. Also, since colds and other upper respiratory infections often lead to attacks, you should suspect asthma if your child is still coughing more than seven to 10 days after getting what appears to be a cold. Doctors primarily use two kinds of medications -- long-term control medications and quick-relief medications. Corticosteroids control asthma over the long-term. Corticosteroids and similar drugs are inhaled, injected, or taken as pills; these drugs can ease the inflammation in your child's airways and make her less likely to have attacks. Your child's doctor will periodically assess how much control your child has by evaluating the frequency of her symptoms, her level of activity, how well her lungs function, how often medicine is necessary for the quick relief of asthma, and how often her asthma leads to nighttime awakenings. Your child's doctor will then adjust her medication up or down, depending on her symptoms. The more familiar, quick-relief asthma medications are called short-acting bronchodilators. Taken through an inhaler, these drugs make breathing easier by relaxing the muscles that squeeze the airway during an asthma attack. If your child is still struggling to breathe after using the inhaler, call 911 or get her to an emergency room immediately. If your child has allergic asthma that doesn't respond to these medicines or isn't controlled by avoiding asthma triggers, you may want to ask your doctor about allergy shots. Your doctor can determine which allergens bring on your child's asthma by administering skin tests. Then, your child will get regular injections containing tiny doses of the allergens over the next three to five years. The allergic asthma symptoms should gradually diminish. For children over 5, doctors usually prescribe a peak-flow meter, which you can use to measure the strength of your child's breathing. Taking a reading every morning over a period of months will give you an idea of how much air is getting to your child's lungs and how well the treatments are working. Daily airflow measurement can also alert you and your child to problems that are about to arise, because the peak-flow reading will fall before the child shows symptoms of an asthma attack. Don't limit your child's physical activity just because she has asthma. Children with asthma can play sports and be athletic as long as they monitor their condition. Instead of restricting your child's play or exercise, try to protect her from the irritants that commonly trigger attacks. Keep her away from cigarette smoke, vacuum your home regularly, and clear her room of major dust collectors such as potted plants, stuffed animals, and shag carpeting. If she's allergic to your pets, consult your allergist for advice. Meanwhile, keep them outside or at least out of her room. If she has asthma attacks only in spring or fall, pollen may be the problem. Try keeping the windows closed and installing filters in your air conditioner. It doesn't have to. Asthma can be deadly if left untreated, but almost all asthmatic children who take their medications and control the asthma triggers in their environment lead normal lives. You can help your child cope by getting involved. Make sure her teachers understand the disease and accept inhalers in the classroom, in gym class, and during other physical activities, and don't keep your child home from school unless it's necessary. Reassure her that her friends can't ""catch"" her asthma, and let her know that she's in control of the condition and not the other way around. Most of all, try to relax: A recent survey found that childhood asthma gives rise to far more anxiety in parents than in kids. Manage the disease calmly, and your child will follow suit. The American Lung Association, which you can contact at (800) LUNG USA or , has more tips to help both of you cope.

80451ce0-89f6-41bd-aff0-f029d8d18df8,"— — Asthma triggers are things that can make your asthma symptoms flare up. If you have severe asthma, you’re at a higher risk for an asthma attack. When you encounter asthma triggers, your airways become inflamed, and then they constrict. This can make breathing difficult, and you might cough and wheeze. A severe asthma attack may lead to severe breathing difficulties and chest pain. To help prevent the symptoms of severe asthma, avoid your triggers. Together, you and your doctor can figure out what these triggers are so you can stay away from them in the future, if you can. But first, you’ll need to monitor the things you encounter any time your asthma symptoms flare up. To track your severe asthma triggers, start to familiarize yourself with the most common ones. Severe asthma may be triggered by one or more of the following: allergies to pollen, pet dander, mold, and other substances exercise (often referred to as “exercise-induced asthma” or “exercise-induced bronchoconstriction”) You’ve likely heard of using a food diary for weight loss or elimination diets. You can use a similar approach to keep track of your asthma symptoms. This doesn’t necessarily have to be a full-fledged diary entry — a simple list of what happened that day can help you keep track of your triggers. exercise or other strenuous activities you did that day Make a note of your use of medications — for example, whether you had to use a nebulizer or an inhaler. You’ll also want to jot down how quickly your symptoms resolved (if at all). Also note how long it takes for your rescue medications to work, and whether your symptoms returned later in the day. Tracking your triggers may also be done digitally if you prefer. You can try out an app for your phone, such as Asthma Buddy or AsthmaMD. Whether you track your triggers by hand or by phone, be sure to share all your data with your doctor at your next visit. Talk to your doctor about your asthma treatment plan Once you know and understand your triggers, visit your doctor. They can help confirm these triggers and assist you in managing them. Your doctor can also help determine which types of asthma medications are best for you based on how frequently you encounter severe asthma triggers. Quick-relief medications, such as a rescue inhaler, can provide immediate relief if you face a trigger once in a while. Examples might include being near to someone’s pet, exposure to cigarette smoke, or going outside during times of low air quality. However, the effects of quick-relief asthma remedies are only temporary. If you face certain triggers on a regular basis, then you might benefit more from long-term medications that reduce inflammation and airway constriction. (However, these don’t resolve sudden symptoms like quick-relief medications can.) Some triggers last for several months and might need supplemental medication. Allergy medications, for example, may help prevent the symptoms of severe allergic asthma. Anxiety-induced asthma may benefit from therapeutic measures or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. Despite being on a treatment plan, now’s not the time to stop tracking your severe asthma triggers. In fact, you’ll need to continue tracking them to make sure your medications are working. If your symptoms don’t improve, see your doctor for another evaluation. — — Finding the Right Specialist for Allergic Asthma - Learn the Difference Allergic Asthma and Your Lifestyle: Assess the Impact Allergic Asthma Attack: When Do You Need to Go to the Hospital?

It is more common in people who have allergies, although anyone can develop asthma at any time. Asthma is a chronic disease that affects the airways of the lungs. During normal breathing, the bands of muscle that surround the airways are relaxed and air moves freely. During an asthma episode or ""attack,"" there are three main changes that stop air from moving easily through the airways: The bands of muscle that surround the airways tighten and make the airways narrow. This tightening is called bronchospasm. The lining of the airways becomes swollen or inflamed. The cells that line the airways produce more mucus, which is thicker than normal and clogs the airways. These three factors - bronchospasm, inflammation, and mucus production - cause symptoms such as difficulty breathing, wheezing, and coughing. Asthma affects 22 million Americans; about 6 million of these are children under age 18. People who have a family history of asthma have an increased risk of developing the disease. Asthma is also more common in people who have allergies or who are exposed to tobacco smoke. However, anyone can develop asthma at any time. Some people may have asthma all of their lives, while others may develop it as adults. The airways in a person with asthma are very sensitive and react to many things, or ""triggers."" Asthma “triggers” are those things that make the airways tighten and become inflamed. Contact with these triggers causes asthma symptoms. Sometimes a trigger brings on a reaction right away, but other times it may take several hours or days before symptoms begin. One of the most important parts of asthma control is to identify your triggers and then avoid them when possible. The only trigger you do not want to avoid is exercise. Pre-treatment with medicines before exercise can allow you to stay active yet avoid asthma symptoms. There are many kinds of triggers. The most common asthma triggers are: : cold air or changes in temperature and humidity : - pollens (trees, grasses, ragweed and weeds); mold spores ; : molds, animal dander, dust mites, cockroaches (strong odors from perfumes, cleaning agents, wood smoke, air pollution, etc.) such as anxiety, or episodes of crying, yelling, or laughing hard (not a common trigger in adults, but can cause asthma symptoms, usually in children under age 5) Some people are affected by a number of triggers, while others may only have one trigger such as in exercise-induced asthma. It is important to recognize your triggers and avoid them, if possible. For those triggers you cannot avoid, there are steps you can take to limit your contact and treat your asthma before you encounter them. This is an important step in controlling asthma. The only trigger you do not want to avoid is exercise. If your asthma is well-controlled, you should be able to participate in any activity you want to do. People with asthma have symptoms when the airways are narrowed (bronchospasm), swollen (inflamed), or filled with mucus. Common symptoms of asthma include: Not every person with asthma has the same symptoms in the same way. You might not have all of these symptoms, or you might have different symptoms at different times. The symptoms might also vary from one asthma episode to the next, being mild during one and severe during another. Some people with asthma might have extended symptom-free periods, interrupted by periodic asthma episodes, while others have some symptoms every day. In addition, some people with asthma might only have symptoms during exercise, or when they are exposed to allergens or viral respiratory tract infections. Mild asthma episodes are generally more common. Usually with treatment, the airways open up within a short time period. Severe episodes are less common, but last longer and require immediate medical help. It is important to recognize and treat even mild symptoms to help prevent severe episodes and keep asthma in better control. Early warning signs are changes that happen just before or at the very beginning of an asthma episode. These changes start before the well-known symptoms of asthma and are the earliest signs that a person's asthma may be worsening. In general, these signs are not severe enough to stop a person from going about his or her daily activities. By recognizing these signs, you can stop an asthma episode or prevent one from getting worse. Early warning signs include: Signs of a cold, upper respiratory infection, or allergies (sneezing, runny nose, cough, congestion, sore throat, and headache) If you have early warning signs or symptoms, you should follow the steps listed in your Asthma Action Plan. If you do not have one, you should notify your provider. If early warning signs and symptoms are not recognized and treated, the asthma episode can progress and symptoms might worsen. As symptoms worsen, you might have more difficulty performing daily activities and sleeping. Symptoms of worsening asthma include: Poor response to quick relief, inhaled medicines (bronchodilators) When asthma symptoms become severe, you will be unable to perform regular activities. If you have late, severe symptoms, follow the ""Red Zone"" or emergency instructions in the Asthma Action Plan immediately. These symptoms occur in life-threatening asthma episodes. You need medical help right away. Last reviewed by a Cleveland Clinic medical professional on 06/08/2017. National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute. Accessed 4/27/2017.

f64eb4ea-28eb-489c-a23c-25a97c519eb9,"The Differences Between Childhood and Adult-Onset Asthma — — is a chronic lung disorder that causes swelling and inflammation in the lungs. According to the , asthma affects more than 25 million people in the United States, or about 8 percent of the population. Seven million of them are children. Asthma is common in childhood, but you can develop it at any point in your life. It’s not uncommon for people over the age of 50 to be diagnosed with this lung disorder. Childhood asthma and adult-onset asthma have the same symptoms, and both have similar treatments. However, children with asthma face different challenges. Many cases of adult-onset asthma are triggered by . Allergens are substances that can cause an immune reaction in people who are sensitive to them. Children with allergies may not experience asthma from exposure to allergens when they are younger. Yet over time, their bodies can change and react differently. This can lead to adult-onset asthma. According to the , of the estimated 7 million children in the United States with asthma, more than 4 million experience an asthma attack each year. Asthma is the third leading cause of hospitalizations of American children age 15 and younger. Fortunately, asthma-related deaths in children are quite rare. Asthma causes inflammation and narrowing in the airways. Narrowed airways cause chest tightness and difficulty breathing. Symptoms of childhood and adult-onset asthma are the same and include: delayed recovery from a , such as a flu or cold If you suspect your child’s symptoms are the result of asthma, make an appointment with their doctor. Untreated childhood asthma may have lasting impacts. For example, children with untreated asthma may have increased shortness of breath during exercise, which may discourage them from being physically active. People with asthma can and should be active, and many athletes with asthma are able to have successful careers. Exact causes of asthma can be difficult to pinpoint. Allergies and triggers in the environment can cause asthma symptoms and an asthma flare-up, and genetics can also play a role. But the exact reasons why people develop asthma remain unclear. Childhood asthma and adult-onset asthma share many of the same triggers. For all people with asthma, exposure to one of the following triggers may cause an asthma attack, though different people have different triggers: Children diagnosed with asthma are more likely to have intermittent symptoms, though some children have daily symptoms. Allergens can set off an asthma attack. Children are typically more sensitive to allergens and more prone to an asthma attack because their bodies are still developing. Children diagnosed with asthma may find that their asthma symptoms almost completely disappear or are less severe during puberty, but they may recur later in life. The also states that secondhand smoke is particularly dangerous for children. An estimated 400,000 to 1 million children with asthma have their condition worsened by secondhand smoke. The state that children with asthma are more likely to have routine office, emergency, and urgent care visits than adults with asthma. With adults, symptoms are typically persistent. Daily treatment is often required in order to keep asthma symptoms and flare-ups under control. According to the , at least 30 percent of adult asthma cases are triggered by allergies. Among adults who develop asthma, women are more likely than men to develop it after age 20, and . Death resulting from an asthma attack is rare and mainly occurs in adults over the age of 65, according to the CDC. There are quick-relief and long-term control medications for both children and adults with asthma. Quick-relief medications are designed to ease symptoms caused by an asthma attack or flare-up. Long-term control medications are designed to ease inflammation and swelling for longer periods of time in order to prevent both an asthma attack and the long-term airway damage caused by uncontrolled asthma. Long-term control medications are typically taken daily for months, or even years. Most children and adults with asthma use a combination of these medicines to treat their asthma. Both adults and children need to create an asthma action plan to outline what type of medicine they should take and when. It will also provide details for what to do when a person’s asthma is dangerously out of control. These instructions will help you, your child, friends and relatives know when it’s time to change treatments or seek emergency care. To make this plan, discuss your treatment options with your doctor. Plan what you should do in the event of an asthma flare-up. Define at what point you need to increase treatment measures to prevent or reduce an attack. List what triggers can be avoided and the best ways to avoid them. Share this plan with friends, relatives, and any caregivers your children may have. Together, you will be able to successfully treat your or your child’s asthma and avoid future complications. Asthma is a common disorder among both children and adults. Although it can lead to difficulty breathing, with proper planning and preparation it is possible to control and prevent frequent asthma attacks. There are many medications available for both short- and long-term care. It’s useful to create a plan detailing how to prevent an attack and when to seek emergency care. Share your plan with friends, relatives, and caregivers.

Fedor, BS Pharmacy Studies, PharmD Candidate 2021Western New England University College of Pharmacy & Health SciencesMaryCatherine E. Heighton, BS Pharmacy Studies, PharmD Candidate 2021Western New England University College of Pharmacy & Health SciencesVictoria L. Freniere, BS Pharmacy Studies, PharmD Candidate 2021Western New England University College of Pharmacy & Health SciencesWestern New England University College of Pharmacy & Health Sciences ABSTRACT: Establishing asthma symptom control using pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic interventions improves quality of life and prevents exacerbations in patients with asthma. The Global Initiative for Asthma 2019 guidelines provide recommendations for asthma treatment organized into five steps that correlate with disease severity. Medication options include inhaled corticosteroids (ICS), long-acting beta agonists, short-acting beta agonists (SABAs), leukotriene receptor antagonists, and oral corticosteroids. Recent data show unfavorable outcomes for SABAs used alone for as-needed treatment of symptoms of mild asthma. Guideline changes include the use of a low-dose ICS with formoterol for as-needed treatment in adults with mild asthma, or for use whenever a SABA would be used. Appropriate, effective medication regimens combined with counseling on proper inhaler technique will help patients achieve asthma-management goals. Asthma, a chronic inflammatory airway disease characterized by airway hyperresponsiveness, may present with symptoms such as wheezing, shortness of breath, chest tightness, and cough. These symptoms may vary over time and in intensity, making effective management of asthma important. Symptom triggers may include exercise, viral respiratory infections, and environmental factors, such as smoking. Symptoms that are left untreated may lead to exacerbations. An is an acute episode in which symptoms worsen drastically and lung function progressively declines. Any occurrence of an exacerbation warrants a discussion regarding the patient’s current asthma treatment regimen because of the risks of hospitalization, emergency-care visits, and asthma-related death. The 2019 Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) guidelines do not recommend the use of a short-acting beta agonist (SABA) inhaler alone for the treatment of mild asthma; instead, they recommend low-dose inhaled corticosteroid (ICS)-formoterol use as needed and for maintenance therapy. In patients who present with severe or difficult-to-treat asthma, other options may be considered as add-ons to inhaler therapy, such as leukotriene receptor antagonists (LTRAs), tiotropium, biologics, azithromycin, and oral corticosteroids (OCS). denotes the extent to which asthma features can be observed in the patient or have been reduced or eliminated by treatment. Asthma control should be reviewed over the previous 4 weeks. The patient should be asked the following questions: “In the previous 4 weeks, have you had: 1) daytime asthma symptoms more than twice per week? 2) any nighttime awakenings due to asthma? 3) to use an asthma reliever for symptoms more than twice per week? 4) any activity limitations due to asthma?” If the patient answers “No” to all four questions, his or her asthma is well controlled. If the patient answers “Yes” to one or two of the questions, the asthma is partially controlled, but if the answer is “Yes” to three to four of the questions, the asthma is not well controlled. Risk factors that may cause an exacerbation include uncontrolled asthma, smoking, allergen exposure, air pollution, comorbidities such as obesity, and high SABA use. Assessing adherence to the patient’s inhaled medication is another important step. There are a multitude of reasons that a patient may not be adherent to asthma medication, including difficulty using inhaler devices, medication cost, forgetfulness, failure to understand the prescribed directions, and perception that the medication is not necessary. Goals of therapy for asthma include achieving control of symptoms to maintain normal activity levels, preventing persistent airflow limitation, and reducing adverse effects of the medications discussed in . Pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic interventions reduce the risk of future exacerbations leading to hospitalization or asthma-related death. Nonpharmacologic interventions for all asthma patients include breathing exercises, increased physical activity, incorporation of a healthy diet, and avoidance of exposure to smoke and other substances. The practice of yoga and breathing methods such as the Buteyko and Papworth techniques alters breathing patterns to reduce hyperventilation, thereby promoting voluntary reduction in reliever use and improving asthma symptoms. In obese patients, weight loss combined with twice-weekly aerobic and strength exercises is more effective than physical activity alone for symptom control. Counseling on proper inhaler technique will help patients achieve asthma-management goals. Adjustments are made to asthma-medication regimens through the control-based asthma-management cycle depicted in Once a diagnosis of asthma has been made, an ICS-containing controller treatment should be initiated because of the greater improvement in lung function than when ICS controller treatment is not used. This is an important change in the 2019 GINA guidelines, as it was previously recommended to give newly diagnosed patients a SABA alone. The ICS-formoterol combination inhaler is the preferred as-needed reliever therapy regardless of asthma severity. The alternative reliever therapy is a SABA; however, it must be paired with a second inhaler containing ICS. ICS-formoterol inhalers are safe and efficacious, and their ability to be used both as needed and for maintenance therapy makes them easy for patients to use. GINA recommends the following asthma-treatment steps: • Step 1: This step is advised for patients with mild asthma who have symptoms less than twice per month and no risk of exacerbations. As mentioned previously, based on new evidence, the 2019 GINA guidelines no longer recommend SABA use alone to treat asthma.• Step 2: The preferred controller regimen is as-needed low-dose ICS-formoterol or daily low-dose ICS plus as-needed SABA. The ICS-formoterol regimen avoids the need for daily ICS while providing similar benefits for exercise-induced bronchoconstriction as daily ICS with as-needed SABA.• Step 3: Preferred controller treatments include a low-dose ICS–long-acting beta agonist (LABA) plus as-needed SABA or low-dose ICS-formoterol for both maintenance and reliever therapy.• Step 4: The preferred controller treatment is low-dose ICS-formoterol as maintenance and reliever therapy or medium-dose ICS-LABA as maintenance plus as-needed SABA. Note that ICS-formoterol should not be combined with an ICS-LABA containing a different LABA.• Step 5: Persistent exacerbations or symptom worsening occurs despite adherence and correct inhaler technique. These patients are considered to have severe or difficult-to-treat asthma and should be referred to a pulmonologist. Stepping up through the stages outlined above is appropriate when patients have persistently poor symptom control or exacerbations despite low-dose ICS treatment for 2 to 3 months. Stepping down is appropriate when the patient has good symptom control and stable lung function for at least 3 months. Options for stepping down depend on which medication the patient is taking and which step the patient is on, but for most patients, the outcome is worse if the ICS or LABA is stopped completely. ICS dosing is outlined in Symptoms can be assessed with tools such as the Asthma Control Questionnaire, the Asthma Control Test, and the Royal College of Physicians’ Three Questions. These questionnaires enable a score to be associated with symptoms and ask patients about the frequency and types of symptoms such as nighttime awakenings and limitations in daily activities. The term refers to the acute worsening of lung function and symptoms beyond what the patient usually experiences. The preferred reliever treatment during an exacerbation is low-dose ICS-formoterol that can be increased as needed when symptoms worsen. Use of an ICS-LABA (beclomethasone or budesonide and formoterol) as both reliever and controller medication improves symptom control and reduces hospitalizations and OCS use compared with the same or higher dose of a controller plus as-needed SABA. A short OCS course is a treatment option during an exacerbation when the patient fails to respond to an increased dose of reliever and controller after 2 to 3 days, has a history of sudden severe exacerbations, or has rapidly deteriorating lung function (peak expiratory flow or forced expiratory volume in 1 second <60% of personal best or predicted value). See for a summary of adverse effects of various asthma medications. refers to uncontrolled asthma at treatment steps 4 and 5 despite adequate adherence to treatment and treatment of contributory factors. After initial assessment, patients aged 12 years and older with inadequately controlled asthma who are taking a medium-dose ICS plus a LABA and/or a third controller, such as LTRA or sustained-release theophylline, are switched to a trial of a high-dose ICS for 3 to 6 months. In addition to increasing the ICS, a trial of an add-on nonbiologic such as tiotropium, a leukotriene modifier, or OCS may be considered. For adult patients who have persistent asthma symptoms despite moderate-dose or high-dose ICS and LABA, the 2019 GINA guidelines recommend azithromycin as an add-on. If nonbiologics such as LABA, tiotropium, and leukotriene modifiers fail to manage a patient’s asthma symptoms, then biologics may be considered depending on the price and the patient’s resources. Anti–immunoglobulin E therapy, such as omalizumab, may be considered in those with allergic asthma. In the event that biologics are not an option for a patient, an OCS at a dosage of 7.5 mg or less per day prednisone equivalent may be considered. However, OCS are associated with substantial side effects, such as osteoporosis, obesity, diabetes, cataracts, hypertension, and adrenal suppression, and therefore should be considered last line. A double-blind trial conducted by O’Byrne and colleagues investigated the benefit of using an ICS plus a SABA compared with conventional treatment. A total of 3,849 patients aged 12 years or older with mild asthma were randomly assigned to terbutaline (twice-daily placebo plus terbutaline 0.5 mg prn), budesonide-formoterol (twice-daily placebo plus budesonide-formoterol 200 mcg/6 mcg prn), or budesonide maintenance (twice-daily budesonide 200 mcg plus terbutaline prn). The primary objective was to determine whether as-needed budesonide-formoterol was superior to as-needed terbutaline for symptom control. This outcome was measured via data obtained from an electronic symptom diary. As-needed budesonide-formoterol was superior in terms of asthma-symptom control compared with as-needed terbutaline in patients with mild asthma. Budesonide-formoterol patients showed well-controlled asthma for 34.4% of weeks versus 31.1% of weeks in the terbutaline group ( = .046). Terbutaline was associated with the highest annual rate of severe exacerbations (0.20) compared with budesonide-formoterol (0.07) and budesonide maintenance (0.09). A benefit of budesonide-formoterol use was that exposure to corticosteroids was reduced because of the 17% lower budesonide dose in this group compared with the budesonide-maintenance group (57 mcg vs. 340 mcg, respectively). Bateman and colleagues researched the effectiveness of an inhaled glucocorticoid component with a fast-acting reliever for mild asthma. This 52-week, double-blind, multicenter trial included 4,215 patients with mild asthma aged 12 years and older who were eligible for treatment with regular inhaled glucocorticoids. Participants were divided into two groups to assess whether as-needed budesonide-formoterol or budesonide maintenance therapy twice daily had better efficacy with regard to annual rates of severe exacerbations. The budesonide-formoterol group was noninferior to the budesonide-maintenance group for severe exacerbations. In addition, the median daily metered dose of inhaled glucocorticoid was lower in the budesonide-formoterol group (66 mcg) than in the budesonide-maintenance group (267 mcg). The time to first exacerbation was similar between the groups; however, there was a difference of 0.11U in favor of the budesonide-maintenance group, which had lower scores on the Asthma Control Questionnaire-5 (ACQ-5) compared with the budesonide-formoterol group. The minimal clinically important difference in ACQ-5 scores is 0.5 U. Additionally, there was no difference in adverse events, asthma-related discontinuations, or mortality rate between the two groups. This study and the O’Byrne study support the current 2019 GINA recommendation against the use of a SABA alone and for the use of ICS-formoterol instead. A study by Gibson and colleagues investigated the efficacy and safety of oral azithromycin as add-on therapy in patients with uncontrolled persistent asthma also taking a medium-dose or high-dose ICS plus a LABA. In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trial, 420 patients were randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups (azithromycin 500 mg or placebo three times per week for 48 weeks). The primary efficacy endpoints included rate of total (severe and moderate) asthma exacerbations and overall asthma-related quality of life over the study period. In the Gibson study, azithromycin was found to reduce asthma exacerbations; 44% of azithromycin patients experienced at least one exacerbation, compared with 61% of placebo patients ( <.0001). Additionally, azithromycin use significantly benefited asthma-related quality of life, denoted by improvement in all categories of the rating scale (i.e., activity, symptom, emotion, and environmental domains) for asthma-related quality of life. The only other notable difference between the study groups was in the occurrence of diarrhea, which was significantly higher in azithromycin patients (34% vs. 19% of placebo patients). For safety monitoring, ECGs were conducted at screening, after 6 weeks of treatment, and at the end of treatment. A QTc prolongation longer than 480 ms resulted in withdrawal from the trial in two patients (one from each group). The 2019 guidelines include five notable changes with regard to asthma treatment in adults. The first change is the switch from SABA-only treatment to ICS-containing treatment for as-needed treatment of symptoms in mild asthma. The second change is the use of add-on low-dose azithromycin three times per week for long-term treatment of patients with symptomatic asthma despite moderate-dose or high-dose ICS-LABA treatment; however, potential adverse events should be considered. The third change is the recommendation for dupilumab, an anti–interleukin-4 receptor alpha monoclonal antibody, as an additional treatment option for patients aged 12 years and older with severe type 2 asthma or OCS-dependent asthma. A trial by Wenzel and colleagues demonstrated that dupilumab increased lung function and reduced severe exacerbations in patients with uncontrolled persistent asthma. The fourth change is to include high-dose ICS-LABA treatment only in step 5, whereas previously it had been included in step 4 with moderate-dose ICS-LABA; this is because of the recommendation that high-dose ICS should be prescribed for only a few months based on the consideration of associated adverse events. The fifth change is the switch of maintenance OCS from a “preferred” treatment option to “other controller option” in step 5, based on the high risk of adverse outcomes. Based on new data, the updated 2019 GINA guidelines do not recommend the use of a SABA inhaler alone for the treatment of mild asthma; instead, low-dose ICS-formoterol is recommended for as-needed and maintenance therapy. For patients who present with severe or difficult-to-treat asthma, other options may be considered as add-on treatment to inhaler therapy, including LTRA, tiotropium, biologics, azithromycin, and OCS. To ensure better medication adherence, asthma therapy regimens should be patient-specific, with a stepwise approach taken to find a regimen that controls the patient’s asthma symptoms while keeping the patient on the lowest dose possible, and should also be cost-effective. 1.

abb4ec05-bbf8-4728-9e51-4cd715eca260,"— — Asthma is an inflammatory lung disease that can lead to mild to severe symptoms. In most cases, you can control your asthma through avoiding triggers, daily medications and other treatment options. But if you’re unable to control your asthma with any type of treatment, this means your asthma is severe. Severe asthma may also mean you need high doses of inhaled corticosteroids or long-term oral corticosteroids in addition to other daily medications. Some doctors have differing opinions on the definition of severe asthma. The puts severe asthma into three different categories: While severe asthma can be difficult to treat, it’s still possible to get it under control. Keep reading to learn the symptoms of severe asthma, signs of an attack, and treatments to manage your condition. The symptoms of severe asthma are similar to the symptoms of mild to moderate asthma. But severe asthma symptoms tend to be more intense, potentially life-threatening, and are difficult to control with asthma treatments. Since severe asthma can sometimes be life-threatening, make sure you know when to seek emergency medical care. If you have shortness of breath that occurs when doing simple physical activities or quickly gets worse, call 911 or go to a hospital. If a quick-relief inhaler doesn’t help either, you may need emergency treatment. The definition of severe asthma is that it either doesn’t respond to treatments and medications at all, or it’s very difficult to treat. This lack of response to medications is known as therapy-resistant asthma. It may be because your asthma has become resistant to corticosteroids or other medications used to treat asthma. If your asthma isn’t responding to medications, see your doctor for a diagnosis and alternative treatment options. They will check to see if you have other conditions that may be mimicking asthma, such as angina and heart failure. They will also examine you for complications of severe asthma, such as chronic infections and allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis. If you have severe asthma, your doctor will work with you to develop a treatment plan. This may include medications and lifestyle changes, along with natural treatments. Medications and treatments that you can try for severe asthma may include: The medications listed above may be used alone or in combination to try to get your severe asthma under control. The following lifestyle changes may help in the treatment of your severe asthma: When possible, remove or avoid any allergens or exposure to environmental irritants like chemicals. If you’re living with obesity, gradually lose weight under the care of your doctor. While natural treatments shouldn’t replace your asthma medications, you may benefit from trying some of these in addition to your prescribed treatments. breathing exercises, which may help reduce the amount of medication you need herbal remedies, including black seed, choline, and caffeine yoga and mindfulness, which can decrease stress, an asthma trigger More research is needed for many alternative treatments and their effects on severe asthma symptoms. Discuss any herbs or supplements you’re thinking of taking with your doctor before starting them. The symptoms of a can include: severe shortness of breath where you experience difficulty speaking rapid breathing where your chest or ribs visibly have retractions straining your chest muscles and working hard to breathe nostrils that flare out, moving rapidly as you breathe face, lips, or fingernails becoming pale or blue in color symptoms not getting better after using a rescue inhaler infants unable to recognize their parents or respond to them If you or your child is having symptoms of a severe asthma attack, you should call 911 for immediate medical attention. Severe asthma attacks can lead to respiratory failure, which is a life-threatening condition. Severe asthma usually requires lifelong treatment and medical management. Since severe asthma is difficult to treat, the length of recovery time from a severe asthma attack will vary based on your individual situation and the length of time it takes to get the severe asthma attack under control. Severe asthma can sometimes lead to lung damage, which may be permanent and may require additional treatment. That’s why it’s so important to get help as soon as possible during a severe asthma attack. To speed up your recovery, try to rest as much as you can. You may feel physically and emotionally exhausted, so take a day to relax and don’t overdo things. Also, see your doctor as soon as possible so that you can review your symptoms and medications and make adjustments as needed. They can give you tips for recovery and update your asthma action plan to prevent another attack. The best way to prevent severe asthma and severe asthma attacks is to follow the treatment plan provided by your doctor. If your current one isn’t working, work with them to adjust it. Here are some other ways you can prevent severe asthma and severe asthma attacks: Track your symptoms and use medications regularly to manage them. Get routine vaccinations for the flu, whooping cough, and pneumonia. Let your doctor know if you notice your treatment plan and medications stop working. Reduce your exposure to any allergens that may trigger your asthma. Wear a mask on your face when you exercise in cold weather. If your occupation involves handling chemicals, take proper precautions. Avoid going outside on days with poor air quality. Talk to your doctor about a weight loss plan if necessary. Use your rescue inhaler as instructed at the first signs of an asthma attack. Use your daily medications as directed, which includes allergy treatments and other medications. Ask your doctor to help you create an asthma action plan. This action plan will outline the steps you need to take in case of an asthma attack. You should share this plan with your family, friends, and coworkers. By sharing your plan, they’ll be able to help you if you experience an attack. The goal of treatment is to get your asthma under control, so it’s important to consistently adhere to your treatments and lifestyle changes. If you feel that your treatments aren’t working as they should be, discuss your options with your doctor. Regularly seeing your doctor will ensure that you’re effectively managing your severe asthma. — — Severe Asthma Attacks: Triggers, Symptoms, Treatment, and Recovery 7 Things Never to Say to Someone with Severe Asthma Andrea turned a family diagnosis of asthma into advocacy, and her life's work.

Borschuk, Casey Rodweller, Objective: The current study examined the association between asthma and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) symptoms in a clinical pediatric sample. Methods: Demographic and neuropsychological data for children with a billing diagnosis of ADHD were extracted from a clinical database. Families completed standard rating scales. Seventy-one patients with a co-morbid asthma diagnosis were identified and matched by age to a group of 71 patients with only ADHD. Results: Children with asthma and ADHD were more likely to display clinically elevated levels of hyperactivity, externalizing behaviors, anxiety, and hyperactive/impulsive behaviors compared to children with ADHD alone. Boys with asthma and ADHD had more symptoms than boys with only ADHD of somatization and emotional internalizing, while girls with asthma and ADHD had more symptoms of hyperactivity/impulsivity, conduct problems, anxiety, and emotional internalizing compared to girls with only ADHD. Conclusions: Findings suggest that in children with ADHD, co-morbid asthma is associated with increased behavioral and internalizing symptoms, with distinct gender differences present. Increased behavioral and internalizing symptoms seen in children with both asthma and ADHD may be due to the burden of their medical condition.

d354db31-5092-48c5-98c9-50f4510bf6a5,"This content was created by the National Sleep Foundation Asthma, known medically as reactive airway disease, is a chronic lung condition that affects about 20 million Americans, according to the (NHLBI) at the National Institutes of Health. Symptoms of asthma occur when the airway becomes inflamed and constricts to make breathing difficult. What causes asthma or why incidences of asthma are on the rise is not known, but some have suggested that it could be the result of environmental factors such as an increase in exposure to pollution or indoor allergens. Its increase may also be related to the increase in obesity that is simultaneously occurring. Many researchers are looking for a genetic factor for asthma based on the fact that a person has a higher risk of developing asthma if a member of his or her family has it. Whatever causes asthma, it is a serious and sometimes fatal condition that must be carefully managed. People with asthma often suffer from nighttime coughing, wheezing and breathlessness that disturb their sleep. It is not clear whether there is a factor (a circadian rhythm is a rhythm of biological functions occurring in a 24-hour periodic cycle) responsible for these nighttime disturbances or whether sleep in some way contributes to them, but studies designed to uncover the exact influence of sleep or circadian rhythms on asthma have been largely inconclusive. Even so, many researchers believe that asthmatic symptoms are at least partly due to circadian rhythms and use the term “nocturnal asthma” to describe the phenomenon of asthma symptoms worsening at night. Not all asthma sufferers experience nocturnal asthma. Those who do should discuss their symptoms with their doctor in order to develop a treatment plan that addresses the nighttime condition. People with asthma should also be aware that nocturnal asthma is associated with more severe disease and increased mortality. The Best Time of Day to Exercise for Quality Zzz's There are several underlying mechanisms that may shed light on how and why nighttime seems to exacerbate asthma symptoms. First, airway resistance increases throughout the night, whether or not a person sleeps, although the increase is much greater if the person sleeps. Second, evidence suggests that airway function is best just before the onset of sleep and decreases as sleep progresses. That is, the more a person with asthma sleeps, the greater the impairment of his or her lungs. This phenomenon is true for all people, although the effect tends to be greater for people with asthma. These airway changes do not typically disturb sleep in healthy subjects. However, people with asthma frequently show the first symptoms of their disease during sleep, according to . Although asthma affects people of all ages, it often starts in childhood and is more common in children than adults, according to the . It is extremely important for children with asthma to get adequate sleep. An April 2005 Harris poll conducted for the Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America found that 48% of child asthma sufferers experienced disturbed sleep as a result of asthma. Also, the NHLBI reports that asthma is one of the leading causes of children missing school. In a published in sleep disturbance was studied in children with nocturnal asthma. Researchers found that children whose sleep was disturbed by nocturnal asthma also exhibited signs of psychological problems and impaired performance in school. However, they also found that if treatment were given to improve the nocturnal symptoms and thus reduce sleep disturbance, improvement in mental function followed. This and other studies provide evidence that the effects of asthma on sleep and the possible psychological consequences are important aspects of overall care. Even though the cause of asthma is not known, it is important for a person with asthma to know the factors that may trigger an asthmatic attack. The following are some common triggers: *Medications that may trigger asthma include anti-inflammatory drugs (aspirin and other over-the-counter pain relievers) and beta blockers (for high blood pressure, migraine headaches, etc.). Symptoms of asthma occur when the airway becomes inflamed and constricts to make breathing difficult. People with asthma often suffer from nighttime coughing, wheezing and breathlessness that disturb their sleep. There is no cure for asthma but it can be controlled. The goal of any asthma treatment plan is to minimize flare-ups and maintain normal or near- normal breathing and to participate in a full range of activities such as exercise and childhood play. In addition to modifications to lifestyle and self-directed disease management, most people with asthma use a combination of quick-fix and long-term medicinal remedies. It is important to note that sleep disturbance or is sometimes a side effect of asthma medication. Be sure to discuss any sleep problems that you or your child might be experiencing with your doctor. The most effective long-term therapies for asthma are those that reduce swelling in the airway. The following medications are indicated for long term use by asthmatics to reduce airway swelling : Leukotriene modifier (e.g. Accolate, Singulair, Zyflo) Long-lasting Beta2-Agonist (e.g. Foradil, Serevent) Inhaled quick relief medications relieve asthma symptoms right away quickly and last for a few hours. They include : Inhaled short-acting Beta2-Agonists (e.g. Albuterol, Alupent, Maxair, Xopenex) Steroid (e.g. Deltasone, Medrol, Orapred, Prelone, Pediapred) Most people with asthma are able to live a normal life and to participate in a full range of activities. In order to do this, however, asthma patients must take their medications as prescribed, be able to recognize and avoid things that may trigger an attack, and act quickly when asthma symptoms appear to be getting worse. Here are some tips for living with asthma: Take medication at the prescribed time — this is very important in managing asthma symptoms. Patients should work with their doctors to develop and maintain a medication regime that works best for them. Use a peak flow meter* — asthma patients should monitor their symptoms at all times. A peak flow monitor meter detects changes in lung function and warns patients of an impending asthma attack before they experience symptoms. Avoid asthma triggers — no two asthma patients are exactly the same and something that triggers an attack in one person may not in another. Asthma patients should learn what triggers an attack for them and take steps to avoid exposure to those things. *Peak flow meters are available online and at most major pharmacies. For people with asthma, especially children, it is very important to get adequate sleep. One common trigger of nighttime symptoms is dust mites. In order to reduce exposure to dust mites, make sure that the bedroom is clean and free of dust. Nocturnal asthma symptoms may result from decreased respiratory function during sleep. Taking anti-inflammatory medications may help this condition. Also, there is some evidence that people with asthma are at greater risk of developing sleep apnea, a condition in which breathing is briefly and repeatedly interrupted during sleep. A visit to a sleep center is required to determine whether a person with asthma also suffers from People with asthma may request a referral to a sleep center from their primary care physicians. According to the National Sleep Foundation’s 2004 poll, about 10% of parents or caregivers say their children have trouble breathing (including heavy or loud breathing) while sleeping at least a few times per week.

Patients should work with their doctors to develop and maintain a medication regime that works best for them. Use a peak flow meter* — asthma patients should monitor their symptoms at all times. A peak flow monitor meter detects changes in lung function and warns patients of an impending asthma attack before they experience symptoms. Avoid asthma triggers — no two asthma patients are exactly the same and something that triggers an attack in one person may not in another. Asthma patients should learn what triggers an attack for them and take steps to avoid exposure to those things. *Peak flow meters are available online and at most major pharmacies. For people with asthma, especially children, it is very important to get adequate sleep. One common trigger of nighttime symptoms is dust mites. In order to reduce exposure to dust mites, make sure that the bedroom is clean and free of dust. Nocturnal asthma symptoms may result from decreased respiratory function during sleep. Taking anti-inflammatory medications may help this condition. Also, there is some evidence that people with asthma are at greater risk of developing sleep apnea, a condition in which breathing is briefly and repeatedly interrupted during sleep. A visit to a sleep center is required to determine whether a person with asthma also suffers from People with asthma may request a referral to a sleep center from their primary care physicians. According to the National Sleep Foundation’s 2004 poll, about 10% of parents or caregivers say their children have trouble breathing (including heavy or loud breathing) while sleeping at least a few times per week.

Spirometry is not used with babies and small children. In those cases, the doctor usually will listen for wheezing and will ask how often the child wheezes or coughs. (PEF). This shows how much air your child can breathe out when trying his or her hardest. A chest to see if another disease is causing your child's symptoms. Allergy tests, if your doctor thinks your child's symptoms may be caused by allergies. Your child needs routine checkups so your doctor can keep track of the asthma and decide on treatment.

Asthma in Children: Helping a Child Use a Metered-Dose Inhaler and Mask Spacer The cause of asthma is unknown. Health experts believe that inherited, environmental, and factors combine to cause , which carry air to the lungs. This can lead to asthma symptoms and . Asthma may run in families (inherited). If this is the case in your family, your child may be more likely than other children to develop long-lasting (chronic) inflammation in the bronchial tubes. In some children, immune system cells release chemicals that cause inflammation in response to certain substances () that cause . Studies show that exposure to allergens such as , cockroaches, and may influence asthma's development. Asthma is much more common in children with allergies ( children), though not all children with allergies develop asthma. And not all children with asthma have allergies. Environmental factors and today's germ-conscious lifestyle may play a role in the development of asthma. Some experts believe there are more cases of asthma because of pollution and less exposure to certain types of harmful bacteria and other germs. As a result, children's immune systems may develop in a way that makes it more likely they will also develop allergies and asthma. Symptoms of asthma can be mild or severe. Your child may have no symptoms; severe, daily symptoms; or something in between.

Having atopic dermatitis as a child may also increase the risk of a person having more severe and persistent asthma as an adult. Children who have an allergy and asthma usually have a family history of allergies or asthma. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and wheezing at a young age. Early infection with that causes a lower respiratory infection increases a child's risk for wheezing. Young children who wheeze have a greater risk for asthma than children who do not wheeze. Children who are around secondhand cigarette smoke are at increased risk for developing asthma. If children already have the disease, secondhand smoke increases the severity of their symptoms. Children who smoke are more likely to develop asthma when they become teenagers. A large study found that children who smoked at least 300 cigarettes in a year were almost 4 times more likely to get asthma. Women who smoke during pregnancy increase the risk of wheezing in their babies. Babies whose mothers smoked during pregnancy also have worse lung function than babies whose mothers did not smoke.

A test involves using a flexible scope called a bronchoscope to examine the airways. Sometimes airway problems such as tumors or foreign bodies will create symptoms that mimic those of asthma. A newer test to monitor asthma is the NIOX nitric oxide test system. This test measures nitric oxide in exhaled air. A decrease in nitric oxide suggests that treatment may be reducing inflammation caused by asthma. But some experts believe that this test is not useful for monitoring asthma. Asthma sometimes is hard to diagnose because symptoms vary widely from child to child and within each child over time. Symptoms may be the same as those of other conditions, such as influenza or other viral respiratory infections.

Or another medicine may be added. If your child's asthma has been under control for several months at a certain dose of medicine, the dose may be reduced. This can help find the least amount of medicine that will control your child's asthma. Quick-relief medicine is used to treat asthma attacks. But if your child needs to use quick-relief medicine on more than 2 days a week, the amount and number of controller medicines may be changed. Your child's doctor will work with you and your child to help find the number and dose of medicines that work best. Some parents worry that children who use inhaled steroid (corticosteroid) medicines may not grow as tall as other children. A very small difference in height and growth was found in children using inhaled steroid medicines compared to children not using them. And one study showed a very small difference in height [about ] in adults who used inhaled steroid medicines as children compared to adults who did not use these medicines. But the use of inhaled steroid medicine has important health benefits for children who have asthma. If you are worried about the effects of asthma medicines on your child, talk with your doctor. One of the best tools for managing asthma is a daily controller medicine that has a corticosteroid (sometimes called a ""steroid"" medicine). But some people worry about using corticosteroid medicines because of myths they've heard about them. If you're making a decision about a corticosteroid inhaler medicine, . Because these medicines quickly reduce symptoms, children sometimes overuse them instead of adding the slower-acting, long-term medicines. But may have harmful effects, such as decreasing how well these medicines work in the future. Overuse of quick-relief medicine is also a sign that asthma symptoms are not being controlled. You should talk with your doctor right away if your child is using quick-relief medicine on more than 2 days a week. Research shows that the most important factor in reducing the severity and length of an asthma attack in children is giving corticosteroids by mouth early in a severe attack. These work best when given at the first sign of symptoms. Try to avoid giving your child an inhaled medicine when he or she is crying, because not as much medicine is delivered to the lungs. If your child has asthma symptoms that are triggered by , your child's doctor may recommend immunotherapy. For this treatment, your child get shots or uses pills that have a small amount of certain allergens in them. Your child's body ""gets used to"" the allergen, so your child reacts less to it over time. This kind of treatment may help prevent or reduce some allergy symptoms. have been shown to reduce asthma symptoms and the need for medicines in some people. But allergy shots are not equally effective for all allergens. Allergy shots should not be given when asthma is poorly controlled. Research has shown that (in addition to taking medicine) family therapy, such as counseling, may be helpful to children who have asthma. In one small study, and daytime wheezing improved in children who had therapy compared with those who didn't. Another small study found that children showed overall improvement from therapy. is a term used for a wide variety of health care practices that may be used along with standard medical treatment. While most mind and body practices such as , breathing exercises, and seem to be safe when used in the right way, be sure to check with your child's doctor first. Talk about any complementary health practice that you would like your child to try or that your child is already using. Your doctor can help you manage your child's health better if he or she has the whole picture about your child's health. McGeady SJ (2004). Immunocompetence and allergy. , 113(4): 1107–1113.

Asthma is a chronic disorder that affects the lining of your airways, which become inflamed and narrow, resulting in symptoms like shortness of breath, wheezing, coughing, and chest tightness (). Although there are many conventional treatments for asthma, some herbal teas may relieve symptoms. Ginger tea is made by boiling the roots of the ginger plant (). This powerful spice is loaded with nutrients and bioactive compounds. It’s associated with benefits like reduced inflammation, nausea relief, and lower blood sugar levels (, , ). Plus, research suggests that may help relieve asthma symptoms. Test-tube studies using human cells indicate that ginger compounds, such as gingerols and shogaols, may alleviate asthma symptoms by reducing airway inflammation (, , , ). In a 2-month study, 92 people with asthma took either 450 mg of ginger extract or a placebo daily. Notably, 20% of those in the ginger group experienced wheezing relief, and 52% experienced chest tightness relief (). Alternatively, you can make ginger tea at home. Simply grate a small knob of peeled ginger, steep it in 1 cup (240 mL) of boiling water for 10–20 minutes depending on your desired strength, then strain out the ginger. You can enjoy ginger tea as is or with a dash of lemon, honey, or cinnamon. Ginger contains gingerols and shogaols, which are compounds that may provide temporary relief from asthma symptoms. Green tea is a popular beverage derived from the leaves of the plant. It’s packed with nutrients, plant compounds, and antioxidants, which are tied to weight loss, as well as a lower risk of type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and certain cancers (, , , ). In addition, research suggests that green tea may relieve asthma symptoms. For starters, animal studies show that green tea antioxidants may help reduce inflammation in the lungs — a common feature of asthma (, ). In addition, a study in over 1,000 people found that those who drank at least two 8-ounce (240-mL) cups of green tea had significantly better lung function than those who drank none (). Lastly, is a source of caffeine, which may help relax your airways for up to 4 hours and provide temporary relief from asthma symptoms (). You can purchase green tea loose leaf or in tea bags. Green tea is packed with antioxidants, which may help reduce asthma-related inflammation. It’s also a source of caffeine, which may temporarily relax your airways. Like green tea, black tea comes from the plant. However, it’s exposed to air for oxidation, which causes the leaves to turn dark brown, intensifying the flavor. It’s often blended with other ingredients to make teas like English breakfast or Earl Grey. Similarly to green tea, black tea contains caffeine, which may help relax your airways and modestly improve lung function. This may provide temporary relief from asthma symptoms (). Its other potential benefits include a lower risk of heart disease and type 2 diabetes (, ). You can purchase black tea loose leaf or in tea bags. Black tea provides caffeine, a stimulant that may modestly improve lung function and provide temporary relief from asthma symptoms. Eucalyptus tea is made from the leaves of the eucalyptus tree, which is packed with powerful antioxidants and plant compounds like eucalyptol. Notably, eucalyptol may help treat asthma symptoms. Research suggests that this compound may reduce inflammation, decrease mucus production, and expand your bronchioles — the passageways inside your lungs (, ). In a 12-week study, 32 people with bronchial asthma were given either 600 mg of eucalyptol or a placebo daily. Those who received eucalyptol required 36% less medication to manage asthma symptoms, compared with those in the control group, who needed 7% less (). Alternatively, you can make your own at home using dried . Simply steep the dried leaves in 1 cup (240 mL) of boiling water for up to 10 minutes and use a strainer or cheesecloth to remove the leaves before drinking. Eucalyptus tea contains eucalyptol, a compound that may help reduce certain asthma symptoms. Licorice tea is made from the root of the licorice plant () and has a distinctly sweet but slightly bitter flavor. In traditional medicine, has long been used to treat various conditions, including asthma. Animal studies note that extract of the licorice compound glycyrrhizin relieves symptoms of asthma, especially when combined with conventional asthma treatments like salbutamol (albuterol) (, , ). Although human research has shown similar results, more long-term research is needed (). Keep in mind that large amounts of licorice root may lead to dangerous side effects. It’s best to limit your tea intake to 1 cup (240 mL) per day and speak to your healthcare provider if you have any medical conditions. Licorice tea is made from licorice root, the extract of which may relieve asthma symptoms — especially when combined with conventional treatments. is a rich and aromatic infusion made from the leaves of the common mullein (), which is native to Europe, Asia, and Africa. It has been used in traditional medicine for thousands of years as a remedy for respiratory conditions, such as bronchitis, mucus buildup (catarrh), and asthma. Animal and human studies suggest that mullein may help treat asthma symptoms like coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath by reducing inflammation, which helps relax the muscles in your respiratory tract. Still, more research is needed (). Mullein tea is available in prepackaged tea bags and or dried leaf form. If you’d like to make mullein tea with dried leaves, simply add a small amount to 1 cup (240 mL) of boiling water and steep for 15–30 minutes. Use a strainer or cheesecloth to remove the leaves to avoid throat irritation. Mullein may relieve asthma symptoms by relaxing muscles in your respiratory tract. Keep in mind that more human studies are needed. Breathe Easy tea is a specific herbal formulation meant to improve respiratory health. It’s manufactured by the company Traditional Medicinals. It contains various Western and traditional Chinese herbs, including: a proprietary blend of and ginger rhizome Although no studies have examined this particular tea, it packs a variety of ingredients that may alleviate asthma symptoms (, , ). Breathe Easy is a tea blend that combines fennel, eucalyptus, ginger, and other ingredients that have been linked to asthma relief. Certain may help relieve asthma symptoms. Research suggests that ginger tea, green tea, black tea, eucalyptus tea, fennel tea, and licorice tea may , relax your respiratory muscles, and boost your breathing, among other benefits. Keep in mind that these teas should be used in tandem with your current asthma medications and shouldn’t be seen as a replacement. — In addition to traditional treatments for severe asthma, you may have heard that herbal supplements can help.

e056772e-2922-42b3-bdc5-21bda949ef21,"What Are My Treatment Options for Allergic Asthma? Questions for Your Doctor — — Allergic asthma is the most common type of asthma, affecting about of people with the condition. It’s brought on by airborne allergens such as dust, pollen, mold, pet dander, and more. Symptoms include trouble breathing, coughing, and wheezing. These can be life-threatening in the event of a severe attack. Your doctor is an essential source of information and advice on treating your asthma. Bring your own questions about managing the condition to each of your appointments. If you’re not sure what to ask, here are a few topics to help you get started. What are my treatment options for allergic asthma? Allergic asthma is a long-term condition, but also involves episodes, or attacks, when you’ll need quick relief. Your doctor may recommend both ongoing and short-term treatments to reduce symptoms. They’ll typically start by determining the severity of your symptoms before recommending specific treatments. There are four categories of asthma. Each category is based on asthma severity, which is measured by the frequency of your symptoms. Symptoms occur up to two days a week or wake you up at night at most two nights a month. Symptoms occur more than twice a week, but no more than once a day, and wake you up at night 3–4 times a month. Symptoms occur daily and wake you up at night more than once a week but not every night. Symptoms occur throughout the day on most days and often wake you up at night. It’s important to track and monitor your symptoms to see if they’re improving. Your doctor may recommend using a peak flow meter to measure your lung function. This can help you determine if your asthma is getting worse, even if you don’t feel different. Many people with asthma carry an inhaler, which is a type of bronchodilator. A quick-acting bronchodilator is one you can use in the event of an attack. It opens up your airways and makes it easier for you to breathe. Quick-acting medications should make you feel better quickly and prevent a more serious attack. If they don’t help, you must seek emergency care. Your doctor may prescribe other medications that you only need to take for a short time when your symptoms flare. These include corticosteroids, which are anti-inflammatory drugs that help with airway inflammation. They often come in pill form. Long-term allergic asthma medications are designed to help you manage the condition. Most of these are taken on a daily basis. These are anti-inflammatory medications such as fluticasone (Flonase), budesonide (Pulmicort Flexhaler), mometasone (Asmanex), and ciclesonide (Alvesco). These are oral medications that relieve symptoms for up to 24 hours. Examples include montelukast (Singulair), zafirlukast (Accolate), and zileuton (Zyflo). These medications open the airways and are taken in combination with a corticosteroid. Examples include salmeterol (Serevent) and formoterol (Foradil). These inhalers are a combination of a beta agonist and a corticosteroid. Your doctor will work with you to find the right medication. It’s important to maintain good communication with your physician so they can determine if your type or dose of medication needs to change. Allergic asthma is brought on by specific particles called allergens. To identify which ones cause you problems, your doctor may ask you when and where you experience allergy symptoms. An allergist can also perform skin and blood tests to determine what you’re allergic to. If certain triggers are found, your doctor may recommend immunotherapy, which is a medical treatment that reduces sensitivity to allergens. Your doctor may also recommend allergen avoidance. This means you’ll have to keep your home free of particles that cause allergic reactions. You may also have to avoid going places where you have a higher chance of having an attack because of allergens in the air. For example, you may need to stay inside on days when the pollen count is high or remove carpets in your home to avoid dust. Allergens are the root cause of allergic asthma. By staying away from these allergens, you can help prevent asthma symptoms. The lifestyle changes you need to make depend on your specific triggers. In general, you can help reduce attacks by allergen-proofing your home and modifying your daily outdoor activities to prevent exposure. Asthma is a chronic condition, and there isn’t a cure. You may not be experiencing symptoms, but you still need to stay on track with your long-term medications. It’s also important to avoid your allergic triggers. By using a peak flow meter, you can get an early indicator that your air flow rate is changing, even before you feel an attack beginning. Always keep quick-acting medications with you. These should help you feel better within . If your symptoms don’t improve or continue to get worse, go to an emergency room or dial 911. Severe symptoms that warrant an emergency room visit include not being able to talk or walk due to shortness of breath and blue lips or fingernails. Keep a copy of your asthma action plan on you so people around you have the necessary information to help. If your medications don’t seem to be working, you may have to modify your treatment plan. Symptoms of allergic asthma can change over time. Some long-term medications might be less effective as time goes on. It’s important to discuss symptom and medication changes with your doctor. Using an inhaler or other quick-acting medications too often is a sign that your allergic asthma isn’t under control. Talk to your doctor about your current treatment options and whether you’ll need to make any changes. There’s no cure for allergic asthma. Therefore, it’s important to adhere to your treatments and follow your doctor’s advice. Doing so can prevent severe complications, such as airway remodeling, which is permanent narrowing of the breathing passages. This complication affects how well you can inhale air in and exhale air out of your lungs. Maintaining a good relationship with your doctor helps you have the right information and support for allergic asthma. Your doctor can discuss your treatment options in-depth. Both quick-acting and long-term medications can help you manage your condition, and lifestyle changes can reduce exposure to your triggers. Taking these steps to manage your allergic asthma can make it easier to live a healthy, happy life. — — Finding the Right Specialist for Allergic Asthma - Learn the Difference Allergic Asthma and Your Lifestyle: Assess the Impact Allergic Asthma Attack: When Do You Need to Go to the Hospital?

Asthma is a long-term (chronic) lung disease that causes your child's airways to become sensitive to certain things (triggers). Several things happen to the airways when a child is exposed to triggers: All of these things will cause the airways to narrow. This makes it hard for air to go in and out of your child’s lungs and causes asthma symptoms. Experts don't know the exact cause of asthma. They think it is partly passed down through families. But it can also be caused by many other things such as the environment, infections, and chemicals. A child is more likely to get asthma if he or she: Has environmental allergies, food allergies, or eczema Has another health problem such as sinus problems and being overweight Symptoms can occur a bit differently in each child. Children with asthma have times when they have few, if any symptoms. They also have times when symptoms flare up. Symptoms may include: Wheezing or whistling sound that is heard while your child is breathing Trouble breathing or shortness of breath while your child is active The symptoms of asthma can look like other health conditions. Have your child see his or her healthcare provider for a diagnosis. To diagnose asthma, your child’s healthcare provider may recommend these tests: This test checks lung function. It uses a device called a spirometer. This test can be done in young children, including babies. But it is most often done in children who are age 6 or older.  A peak flow meter is used to measure the amount of air a child can blow out of the lungs. This measurement can be done at home. It is often helpful for day-to-day monitoring of asthma symptoms. This diagnostic test uses energy beams to make images of internal tissues, bones, and organs on film. Allergy tests can show if your child has allergies that may be causing asthma or making it worse. Treatment will depend on your child’s symptoms, age, and general health. It will also depend on how severe the condition is. Your child’s healthcare provider may refer you to a pulmonologist. This is a doctor with special training to treat lung conditions. Your child may also be referred to an asthma and allergy specialist. This is a doctor with special training in treating both asthma and allergies. Your child’s treatment is based on how severe the symptoms are and how easily they are controlled. Treatment includes finding triggers and ways to stay away from them. It will also include medicines. These medicines are used to help open the narrowed airways. They may ease coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, or trouble breathing. Anti-inflammatory medicines (inhaled or oral steroids).  These medicines help ease the inflammation in the airways. These medicines help decrease the narrowing of the airways. These are often given by mouth. They are often used to treat mild symptoms. This can be used to decrease allergies to environmental triggers such as dust, pollen, or animal allergies that can trigger asthma flares in some people. These are injected medicines used for certain types of severe asthma. They are available for children age 6 and older. What are possible complications of asthma in a child? Severe asthma attacks. These can lead to a stay in the hospital or even death. Increased time in the hospital or the emergency department Asthma can’t be completely prevented. There are steps you can take to reduce the chance of your child having asthma. They include: In most children, asthma flare-ups can be prevented by: Finding out your child’s triggers and keeping him or her away from them Giving your child medicine as directed to prevent symptoms The action plan has information on your child’s medicines. It also says what to do when symptoms occur, and what to do in an emergency. Your child's provider will review and updat it as needed at each office visit. You can share it with family, babysitters, and school officials. Closely watching asthma symptoms to know when they are getting worse Letting school officials know about your child's asthma and their asthma action plan. Work with your child’s healthcare provider to find the best way to take care of your child’s asthma. There are guidelines for children from newborn to age 4, ages 5 to 11, and ages 12 and older. The more information a person with asthma has, the better the asthma can be controlled. When should I call my child’s healthcare provider? Call your child’s healthcare provider if your child’s symptoms are not well-controlled. For example, your child is waking at night with symptoms or is having trouble with daily activities. Or your child needs their rescue medicine more often. Call your child’s healthcare provider or get medical help right away if your child has severe symptoms. These severe symptoms can include: Wheezing that gets worse after medicine should be working (most quick-relief medicines work within 15 minutes) Symptoms include trouble breathing, wheezing, chest tightness, and coughing. Staying away from the things that cause asthma symptoms (triggers) is an important part of asthma treatment. Medicines are used to prevent and control symptoms during flare-ups. Asthma can cause serious complications if it is not well-controlled. An up-to-date asthma action plan is key to managing asthma. Tips to help you get the most from a visit to your child’s healthcare provider: Know the reason for the visit and what you want to happen. Before your visit, write down questions you want answered. At the visit, write down the name of a new diagnosis, and any new medicines, treatments, or tests. Also write down any new instructions your provider gives you for your child. Know why a new medicine or treatment is prescribed and how it will help your child. Also know what the side effects are. Ask if your child’s condition can be treated in other ways. Know why a test or procedure is recommended and what the results could mean. Know what to expect if your child does not take the medicine or have the test or procedure. If your child has a follow-up appointment, write down the date, time, and purpose for that visit. Know how you can contact your child’s provider after office hours. This is important if your child becomes ill and you have questions or need advice.",112,symptoms of asthma,-4.279126167297363,67
1d8fe80a-c168-4306-abd2-2b5aaa86af36,"Medically reviewed by — is a chronic condition that affects the airways in your lungs. It makes the airways inflamed and swollen, causing symptoms like coughing and wheezing. This can make it difficult to breathe. Sometimes, aerobic exercise can trigger or worsen asthma-related symptoms. When this happens, it’s called or exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (EIB). If you do have EIB, you might be hesitant to workout. But having it doesn’t mean you should avoid regular exercise. It’s possible for people with EIB to workout with comfort and ease. In fact, can decrease asthma symptoms by improving your lung health. The key is to do the right kind — and amount — of exercise. You can determine what this looks like for you by working with a doctor. Let’s explore how exercise affects asthma, along with ideal activities for people with the condition. Some types of exercise can reduce or prevent asthma symptoms. They work by making your lungs stronger without worsening inflammation. Specifically, these activities minimize symptoms because they: Over time, working out can help your airways build up tolerance to exercise. This makes it easier for your lungs to perform activities that usually make you winded, like walking up stairs. Though asthma inflames the airways, regular exercise can actually decrease inflammation. It works by reducing inflammatory proteins, which improves how your airways respond to exercise. The more you work out, the more your lungs get used to consuming oxygen. This decreases how hard your body must work to breathe on a daily basis. When your muscles are strong, the body functions more efficiently during everyday activities. Exercise improves the overall conditioning of the heart, improving blood flow and the delivery of oxygen. In addition to physical activity, certain breathing exercises can also reduce asthma symptoms. These methods help by opening the airways, moving fresh air into the lungs, and reducing the effort of breathing. Examples of include: However, it’s still important to take your medications as directed. This is the best way to control asthma symptoms, especially during exercise. In general, the best exercises for asthma involve brief bursts of exertion. Gentle, low-intensity activities are also ideal. These exercises don’t overwork your lungs, so they’re less likely to cause asthma symptoms. Everyone is different, though. Be sure to consult your doctor and pay attention to your body. is one of the most recommended exercises for people with asthma. Compared to other activities, it’s less likely to cause asthma-related symptoms due to: Despite these benefits, chlorinated pools can cause symptoms in some individuals. Use caution if you’re new to swimming in pools. As a low-intensity activity, is another great choice. This form of exercise is gentle on the body, which makes it easier to breathe. For the most comfortable experience, only walk outside when it’s warm. Dry, cool air can trigger or worsen your symptoms. You can also walk on a treadmill or indoor track. Another option is to enjoy a gentle hike. Choose a trail that’s relatively flat or has a slow, steady incline. If you have allergies, check the local before . Only hike if pollen levels are low. If you have EIB, try biking at a leisurely pace. This is another gentle activity that doesn’t involve constant exertion. You can also do on a stationary bike. If you’d like to run, opt for short-distance running activities such as . Long-distance running on a track or outside may not be recommended in people with more uncontrolled asthma due to the ongoing effort required. The following sports are appropriate for people with asthma. These activities involve intermittent breaks, which are gentler on the lungs. How can you tell if it’s asthma or you’re just out of shape? Sometimes, it can be difficult to tell if your symptoms are caused by asthma or just being “out of shape.” In both cases, the usual symptoms include: Typically, these symptoms start after 5 to 20 minutes of working out. They might continue for 10 to 15 minutes after you stop exercising. It’s common to have these symptoms if you’re . If you have EIB or asthma, the symptoms will be significantly more severe and will likely include coughing and wheezing. Another sign of EIB is excess mucus production. This occurs due to airway inflammation and usually won’t happen because of poor fitness condition. In addition to choosing less strenuous activities, you can also follow these tips to reduce your asthma symptoms: Your doctor can prescribe a as a pre-exercise treatment. These inhaled medications will relax the airways, making it easier to breathe during physical activity. If a pre-exercise inhaler doesn’t manage your symptoms, you may be given another medication. This could include oral drugs or additional inhalers that decrease airway inflammation. Always before exercise to let your body adjust. When you’re done, gradually stop the activity. Cover your nose and mouth when it’s cold outside. The dryness of can tighten your airways. If you’re allergic to pollen, exercise inside when pollen levels are high. Stay in areas with minimal air pollution. Basketball, soccer, and long-distance running can be hard on the lungs if your asthma is poorly controlled. Avoid sports that are done in the cold, like cross-country skiing and hockey. You should also ask your doctor what you should do if you have an while exercising. By having a plan in place, you can workout with confidence. Even if you have asthma, you shouldn’t avoid exercise altogether. Regular physical activity is essential for managing health, improving energy, and reducing the risk of chronic disease. If you already have a chronic condition, regular exercise can help you manage it. This includes asthma. With a doctor’s guidance, regular exercise could help asthma by: In addition to prescription medication, exercise can help you gain better control of your asthma symptoms. If you experience the following asthma symptoms during exercise, talk to your primary care physician: Depending on your symptoms and medical history, you’ll likely have to see a pulmonologist or allergist-immunologist. These professionals specialize in treating and managing asthma. People with asthma should still get regular exercise. And with the right approach, physical activity can benefit your asthma symptoms. Exercise helps by increasing lung capacity and reducing inflammation, which improves your overall lung health. Despite these benefits, you should still take your medicine as prescribed. Your doctor can determine the best approach for exercising safely and effectively.

Asthma in children: Creating an asthma action plan Our general interest e-newsletter keeps you up to date on a wide variety of health topics. Asthma in children: Creating an asthma action plan Help your child manage his or her asthma by staying organized. Maintaining good day-to-day asthma control is the key to keeping symptoms at bay and preventing asthma attacks. With a written asthma action plan, it's easier for you to measure whether your child's asthma is under control — and it lets you know exactly what steps to take when it isn't. Using an asthma action plan is especially important if your child has moderate to severe asthma or has had a serious asthma attack in the past. Here's how to get started. Because people experience asthma differently, you'll need to work with the doctor to make a customized plan for your child. Children who are old enough to understand why you're setting up the plan may be able to help create it. An action plan can help you and your child: The plan will help you keep tabs on signs and symptoms such as coughing, wheezing and shortness of breath. You can also note when symptoms interfere with school, play, exercise or sleep. You'll also need to track how often your child uses a quick-relief inhaler, such as albuterol (ProAir HFA, Proventil HFA, others), to ease symptoms. If your child is old enough to use one, he or she may have a peak flow meter. This simple hand-held device tests how well the lungs are working day to day. Low measurements indicate that the lungs aren't working as well as they should be. This is often the first sign that asthma's getting worse. The action plan will give you a system for making sense of the information you record. Many asthma plans use a ""traffic light"" system of green, yellow and red zones that correspond to worsening symptoms. This system can help you quickly determine asthma severity and identify signs of an asthma attack. Some asthma plans use a symptoms questionnaire called the Asthma Control Test (ACT) to measure asthma severity over the past month. Your child's plan should say when you need to make medication adjustments based on the severity of symptoms. Asthma medications usually include long-term-control medications such as inhaled corticosteroids, along with as-needed, quick-relief medications such as inhaled albuterol. Make sure you understand what medications to use when, how long to use them and what to expect. Tracking symptoms daily and adjusting treatment accordingly improves asthma control and reduces the risk of having an asthma attack. But if symptoms do start to get worse quickly, follow the action plan's instructions for using quick-relief medications or other steps to get your child's symptoms under control. Some asthma attacks can't be managed at home. Use the action plan to recognize the signs of rapidly worsening asthma, such as trouble speaking, use of abdominal muscles to breathe or wide nostrils when breathing in. If your child uses a peak flow meter, the action plan will also tell you when low peak flow readings signal that your child's asthma attack has become an emergency. The action plan may have a place for you to list your child's asthma triggers and keep notes on how to avoid them. Asthma triggers vary from person to person — examples include cold air, pollen, dust mites, mold, pet dander, smoke and respiratory infections. Make sure caregivers know how to use the action plan Once you and your child's doctor have developed an asthma action plan, keep it close at hand. Make sure children and caregivers — including grandparents and baby sitters — know where to find it and what to do in case asthma symptoms get worse. Give a copy of the plan to the school nurse and your child's teachers and coaches. Keep another copy in your wallet or purse, in case an asthma attack occurs away from home. As children get older, they can take more responsibility for using the plan to track and manage asthma. Work with the doctor to adjust your child's asthma action plan on a regular basis. Asthma changes with age, so your child's treatment plan will need to change too. Make sure your child goes to every scheduled appointment. Review your child's asthma action plan at every doctor visit. Tell the doctor about any problems your child is having sticking with the plan. These checkups are also a good time to double-check that you're tracking symptoms accurately and that your child is using asthma medications properly. If your child is following the action plan but symptoms still aren't under control, a treatment change may be needed. On the other hand, if your child's asthma is well controlled, the doctor may be able to reduce the amount of medication your child takes. If you have any questions or you're concerned about your child's signs and symptoms, call your child's doctor or schedule an appointment. Having asthma shouldn't mean that your child will miss school, be short of breath during sports or play, or wake up coughing at night. By carefully following a written plan, you and your child can control asthma and minimize the disruptions it causes.

When you have asthma, a Asthma is one of the most common lung diseases in children. Adults can develop asthma, too. There is no cure for asthma, but people can learn to control their symptoms. Asthma Symptoms People with asthma can have flare-ups or asthma attacks, which usually occur when something is bothering their airways such as a viral infection, allergy triggers or exercise. Some patients have no symptoms in between attacks, and some have symptoms all the time if they have poor control of their asthma. Asthma can be serious and even deadly. : These 6 questions help us know how well the asthma treatment plan is working for you/your child. Asthma Diagnosis Your doctor or nurse will diagnose asthma based on a physical exam, medical and family history, and spirometry or pulmonary function test. A spirometry test measures how much air you can breathe in and out and how fast you can breathe out. The respiratory therapist or nurse may give you a medicine during the test. This breathing test may be done in your doctor's office or in a lab at the hospital. Your doctor or nurse may refer you to an asthma specialist or an allergist. Asthma Treatment Asthma is treated with different kinds of medicine. Most are medicines called inhalers that patients breathe into their lungs. There are two types of inhalers: quick-relief and controller. Quick-relief: keep this medicine with you but only use when you're wheezy or short of breath. Controller: a medicine used every day to control airway swelling. You need a daily controller medicine if you have day symptoms more than 2 times a week, or night symptoms more than 2 times a month. People with asthma may use a peak flow meter and asthma diary to track their symptoms and measure asthma control. People with asthma should avoid triggers such as tobacco smoke and exposure to second hand smoke. An asthma action plan, a self-management plan, lists what medicines to take when your asthma symptoms get worse. Schedule a visit with your doctor or nurse to review and update your plan every year.

12660796-005c-44c3-8150-2d6d4c15c1bd,"— Research scheduled for presentation at cancelled annual meeting by With the cancellation of the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology's annual meeting on account of the COVID-19 outbreak, is reviewing some of the research abstracts that were scheduled for presentation. Here are some highlights of those focusing on asthma in children and adolescents. When minority parents are under stress, especially in low-income urban families, children with asthma exhibit more breathing symptoms, researchers reported in . When all three types of parental stress -- depression, stress of their environment, and stress caused by discrimination -- were considered, there appeared to be an impact on their children's asthma symptoms, especially cough and nighttime symptoms, reported Erin Rodriguez, PhD, of the University of Texas at Austin. Rodriguez said that of those stressors, parental depression appeared to be the most influential. ""Parental depressive symptoms may be a more important risk factor for asthma symptoms in low-income urban children with asthma than contextual stress or discrimination stress,"" she reported. ""Parental stress is linked with children's asthma symptoms, but the independent associations of co-occurring types of stress with asthma is less understood."" She and colleagues enrolled 102 children with asthma, ages 5 to 17, to participate in an observational study on asthma and housing mobility. Parents/guardians reported their own depressive symptoms on the Personal Health Questionnaire-8 (PHQ-8), contextual stress such as that caused by parenting or issues in the neighborhood, and discrimination stress such as stress experienced at work. The caregivers also recorded children's asthma symptoms, including days of cough, wheezing, and nighttime waking in the previous 2 weeks. All the participants were black or African American, 99% were on public health insurance, and 53% were male. Children had 6.2 asthma symptom days during the 2-week period. The caregivers' average PHQ-8 score was 13.9, indicating an elevated risk for depression, Rodriguez reported. Parental depressive symptoms were associated with childhood cough and nocturnal symptoms; there were trends toward a link between depressive symptoms and overall children's asthma symptoms, and in symptoms limiting the ability to speak among the children. Rodriguez did not observe a link between stressors and slowed activity, exercise-related symptoms, or the use of asthma rescue medication. In , researchers reported that asthma patients who also exhibited symptoms of allergic rhinitis were more likely to be treated in the emergency department, to miss school, and to use rescue medication than children with asthma who were not affected by allergic rhinitis. ""Allergic rhinitis is prevalent in high-risk adolescents with persistent asthma and is associated with significant asthma morbidity and undertreatment,"" reported Jessica Stern, MD, of the University of Rochester Medical Center in New York. She and colleagues enrolled 387 adolescents with persistent asthma into the study. The children, ages 12-16, were from the Rochester City School District and participated in the School Based Asthma Care for Teens trial in 2016-2017. History of allergic rhinitis and asthma outcomes were assessed via clinical history and spirometry. Participants' mean age was 13. About 55% of the student population was black and 32% were Hispanic; 85% were on Medicaid. ""Allergic rhinitis is a known comorbidity in asthmatic adolescents that may exacerbate symptoms,"" Stern noted in her abstract. ""School-based programs have demonstrated that preventive asthma therapy administered under school nurse supervision reduces morbidity. However a subgroup of adolescents continue to have difficult to control asthma despite monitored preventive treatment. Using the unified airway paradigm, we hypothesized that this cohort of adolescents would have significant burden of allergic rhinitis, and allergic rhinitis would be associated with worse asthma outcomes."" Her group found that 77% of participants reported a history of allergic rhinitis. Those with allergic rhinitis were more than twice as likely to be seen in the emergency department for asthma compared with those without (adjusted OR 2.64, 95% CI 1.29-5.44). Additionally, adolescents with allergic rhinitis were more likely to use rescue medication and miss school due to asthma compared with those without allergic rhinitis. ""Importantly, only 52% of adolescents with allergic rhinitis reported taking allergy medication,"" Stern noted. Children who were immediately diagnosed with asthma after an initial visit with a physician had more asthma-specific events in the first year after diagnosis than children whose diagnosis was delayed, but after 5 years the groups had similar outcomes, researchers reported The research team, under the direction of Young Juhn, MD, of the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, examined the records of 1,398 eligible subjects -- 60% of whom were male and 79% white who were part of the Olmsted County (Minnesota) Birth Cohort. Children were stratified into two groups: 808 who were diagnosed with asthma within 4 weeks of their index visit and 590 with a delayed diagnosis (after a median of 452 days). Eligibility for inclusion in the study required 5 years of follow-up. Compared with those with a timely diagnosis, the delayed diagnosis group had lower odds of an asthma-specific emergency department visit and/or hospitalization during the first year after the index visit, the research team reported. About 26% of the timely diagnosed children met the event criteria compared with 23% of those with a delayed diagnosis after the first year (OR 0.66, 95% CI 0.50-0.89). But they reported that by the end of 5 years, there was no difference between the groups, as 37% of those with a timely diagnosis met the endpoint criteria compared with 39% of those with delayed diagnosis (OR 0.90, 95% CI 0.70-1.17). ""A delayed diagnosis of asthma is common,"" the researchers wrote in their abstract. ""Longer-term studies are needed to capture its long-term impact given increasing tendency of poor outcomes in delayed asthma diagnosis group."" High serum insulin levels in childhood were associated with increased risk of asthma -- a risk that was independent of obesity, researchers suggested . Their analysis used records from the Tucson Children's Respiratory Study covering non-fasting insulin levels from participants at age 6 who had body mass index measurements at age 6 and then were later assessed for asthma. The registry used in the study had had continuous follow-up for 36 years. Among those in the highest quartile of insulin levels at age 6, risk of developing asthma was doubled from age 8 to 36 (OR 2.04, 95% CI 1.31-3.2, =0.002), reported Tara Carr, MD, of the University of Arizona in Tucson. ""Asthma and obesity are major, interconnected public health challenges that usually have their origins in childhood, and for which the relationship is strengthened among those with insulin resistance,"" Carr stated. ""We hypothesized that high insulin in early life confers increased risk for asthma independent of obesity."" Adjustment for markers of metabolic syndrome -- leptin, C-reactive protein, and interleukin-6 -- did not alter the association between high childhood insulin levels and future asthma diagnosis, Carr and colleagues reported. But high insulin was not associated with current asthma at age 6. Asthma patients were more likely to get steroid prescriptions from primary care physicians than from specialists, researchers reported In claims data from Symphony Health for October 2016 to October 2018, Fernando Holguin, MD, of the University of Colorado Hospital in Aurora, determined that 2,970,605 adult patients met the criteria for the study, and that primary care physicians prescribed oral corticosteroids to about 42% of the patients. Allergists, on the other hand, prescribed steroids to 32% of patients, and pulmonologists prescribed the medications to about 30% of their asthma patients. The primary care physicians also prescribed steroids for longer periods of time -- an average of 271 days, versus 219 days for allergists and 230 days for pulmonologists. Holguin also noted that patients in specialists' care had more severe cases of asthma, as determined by higher GINA (Global Initiative for Asthma) scores. ""These findings highlight important differences across health care providers in terms of oral corticosteroid use,"" Holguin stated in the abstract. ""While primary care physicians are the largest prescribers of oral corticosteroids, a higher proportion of patients with more severe disease who are more likely to receive chronic oral corticosteroid treatment are managed by specialists. Alternative therapies to replace frequent corticosteroid use should be considered."" None of the authors disclosed relevant relationships with industry.

e3d25ba7-0be8-41f8-a1db-1d50045a98ae,"Recent asthma statistics show this disease now affects 17 million people in the -- that's an increase of 2.5 million people in the past five years. Asthma is the number one cause of chronic illness in kids, affecting more than 5.5 million children. Still, there is reason to be hopeful if you are one of the millions of asthmatics across the country -- although the number of asthma cases continues to climb, researchers are determined to develop more effective treatments. Plus, there are a number of home remedies you can try to ward off attacks and alleviate symptoms. When you take a breath, the air goes from your mouth or nose to the windpipe (or trachea), where it then travels to the lungs. It first enters the lungs through the bronchi, a group of tubes that branch off from the windpipe, and the bronchi then branch off into bronchioles. Asthma attacks occur when the bronchi and bronchioles come in contact with a foreign invader, or asthma ""trigger."" The tendency to develop asthma is inherited, and it is more common among people who have allergies. Indeed, there are two forms of asthma, allergic asthma and nonallergic asthma, with the allergic form being more common. Allergic asthma develops in people who have allergies, and the same substances (called allergens) that provoke their allergy symptoms also trigger their asthma symptoms. Both the allergy and asthma symptoms are the product of an overreaction by the immune system. Common triggers for allergic asthma include dust mites, pollen, mold, and pet dander. However, allergies can come from almost any substance. While dust mites and pollen are both airborne allergens, allergic asthma can also be trigged by an allergic reaction to something ingested, like strawberries. ©2007 Publications International, Ltd.Asthma attacks can be triggered by exposure to allergens. In nonallergic asthma, on the other hand, the triggers that irritate the lungs and bring on asthma symptoms have nothing to do with allergies or the immune system. This type of asthma can be sparked by dry air, cold weather, exercise, smoke (including the secondhand variety), strong perfume, stressful situations, intense emotions, even laughing. The point is, both types of asthma have triggers, and vigilant awareness of these triggers is the first step in living comfortably with asthma. The typical symptoms of allergic and nonallergic asthma are similar. They include wheezing, tightening in the chest, dry coughing, and increased heart rate. The symptoms may occur immediately following contact with a trigger or may be delayed, and their severity varies among individual asthma sufferers.As we said, there is no cure for asthma, but the good news is that asthma, whether mild, moderate, or severe, allergic or nonallergic, can be managed. Doctors who specialize in treating asthma can be very helpful. Every patient with asthma should see a doctor to be sure another cause of wheezing is not present and, if asthma is diagnosed, to develop a therapeutic program for managing the disorder.In addition to working with your doctor, you can use home remedies to help control your asthma. All the medicine in the world won't help an asthma sufferer if he or she smokes. The most expensive air filter you can buy won't make a bit of difference if you leave your windows wide open. The key is to track down your triggers and, as completely as possible, eliminate them from your life. In this article, we will describe some of the home remedies for avoiding common asthma triggers and minimizing your exposure to them. We will begin in the next section with ways to asthma-proof your home.For more information about asthma and the allergies that can trigger an attack, try the following links: To see all of our home remedies and the conditions they treat go to our main page. to learn the causes, symptoms, and types of allergies. includes advice for reducing allergens in your home. For a variety of safe and effective remedies for allergy symptoms, read If you have gone from doctor to doctor in search of a remedy for your asthma, you may feel frustrated and be tempted to explore some ""alternative"" treatments: cytotoxicity testing, special diets, herbal preparations, body manipulation, and vitamins, to name a few. As tempting as these promised solutions may sound, there is one problem: They rarely work. Cytotoxicity, for instance, is based on the premise that if the allergenic extract of a food to which you are allergic is mixed with a drop of your blood, certain cells in your blood will attack the food. Your blood cells will, therefore, be altered and, when viewed under a microscope, will be distorted. However, scientific research has not shown this technique to be reliable or useful for the treatment of allergies or asthma. This information is solely for informational purposes.

The most important battlefront in controlling your asthma is your own house. Given all the hours we spend at home, the continual exposure to asthma triggers will eventually lead to an attack. Here are some home remedies you can try to make your home as asthma-safe as possible: The best approach is to not have a pet that can trigger your asthma, such as a dog, cat, or bird. The problem is not the hair of the animal but the dander, which is the dead, dry skin that flakes off. The animal licks the skin, and the dander remains in its saliva. Dander is a powerful allergen, so close contact with the pet can leave you gasping. ©2007 Publications International, Ltd.The best approach is to not have a pet that can trigger Fortunately, taking a few common-sense measures may allow you to co-exist with a beloved animal companion. Do not allow your pet into the bedroom ever. If the animal is in the bedroom at any time during the day, the dander will remain for hours. Leave the pet home if you are going for a car ride that would necessitate very close contact with the animal. If you do have direct contact with your pet (or any animal, for that matter), wash your hands right away. If you simply cannot keep your hands off your pet, at least keep your face away; kiss the air, and your pet will still get the idea.In addition, try bathing your dog or cat once every other week in warm water with no soap. Bathing the animal in this way significantly reduces the amount of allergen on your pet's fur. Dust mites, or rather the feces and dead bodies of these microscopic insects, are one of the most common allergic asthma triggers. They're everywhere in your home, although they love the bedroom most because they feed on the dead skin cells we constantly shed. Banishing dust mites from your home, or at least reducing their ranks, will help ease symptoms if you have allergic asthma triggered by these little critters. Here are some tips: Enclose your mattress in an airtight cover, then cover it with a washable mattress pad. Wash your sheets in hot water every week, and wash your mattress pads and synthetic blankets every two weeks. Use polyester or dacron pillows, not those made of kapok or feathers, and enclose them in airtight dust covers. Avoid carpeting, which is difficult to clean thoroughly; stick to bare floors with washable area rugs. Avoid dust-catchers all over the house, especially in the bed; the less clutter the better. If possible, avoid storing out-of-season clothing or bedding in the bedroom; if you can't, enclose them in heavy plastic. Try not to do heavy cleaning, but if you must, use only a vacuum cleaner and damp cloth to clean; dust mops and brooms stir up the dust. Wear a mask over your mouth and nose while cleaning, and leave the room when you have finished. Run an air conditioner or dehumidifier in warm weather, especially in spring and fall when mites multiply. Aim to keep the humidity level in your home under 40 percent but above 25 percent. Consider using an air purifier in the bedroom to keep the room free from dust particles. No matter how vigilantly you clean, mold and other forms of fungi are probably lurking somewhere in your house. Fungus is a parasite that can grow on living and nonliving organic material in several forms, including mold, mildew, and dry rot. Fungi reproduce by producing spores. The spores are the real problem, as millions and millions of them float through the air to be inhaled in every breath, touching off an allergic reaction that can contribute to asthma. To stave off the spores, take the following steps: Keep your windows closed, because the mold spores can come right in through the windows even if the windows have screens. Stay out of attics, basements, and other dank, musty places. Wear a face mask and give your bathroom a going-over for signs of mold. The most likely spots for mold growth: dark areas, such as the backs of cabinets and under the sink. Examine all closets regularly to see that molds have not set up housekeeping in unused shoes and boots. On a regular basis, have a family member or friend investigate the inner workings of air conditioners, humidifiers, and vaporizers in your home where molds like to grow. Periodically check houseplants for mold growth. This will help keep your plants healthy, too. Pollen is released when plants are blooming: trees in the spring, grass in the late spring and early summer, ragweed from mid August until the first frost. Plants that are pollinated by the wind are much more of a problem for people with asthma than are those pollinated by insects. Since it's just about impossible to escape pollen, learn how to control your exposure to the powdery allergen, instead.Avoid cutting grass or even being outside while grass is being mowed. Keep your windows closed as much as possible (pollen can get through screens, too) and use an air conditioner to cool your home in warm weather. Room air purifiers are also available that can purify recirculated air, removing particles of all sorts that are suspended in the air and further cleansing the air by passing it through a charcoal filter. After being outside in the midst of pollen, take off your clothes and wash them if possible or run a vacuum over those that can't be washed. Wash yourself, too, and don't forget your hair.For more information about asthma and the allergies that can trigger an attack, try the following links: To see all of our home remedies and the conditions they treat go to our main page.This information is solely for informational purposes.

For a variety of safe and effective remedies for allergy symptoms, read There are also changes you can make everyday in your lifestyle to avoid asthma attacks. Read on to find out more about these home remedies. The key to managing asthma effectively is to prevent an attack before it occurs. By applying these home remedies and making some important lifestyle changes, you may be able to avoid the triggers that can exacerbate your asthma. Tobacco smoke can be an irritant that triggers asthma as well as an allergen that touches off an allergic response leading to asthma. Tobacco smoke is one of the worst irritants known: It paralyzes the tiny hairlike cilia along the mucous membranes of the respiratory tract. It also reduces immune response and leaves a smoker much more susceptible to upper respiratory infection. In addition to preventing asthma attacks, quitting smoking will reduce your risk of cancer, heart disease, and many other conditions, as well as save you money.Nonsmokers who live with a smoker are no better off. Secondhand smoke is particularly harmful to children and teenagers. So if there's someone in your household who won't quit smoking, ask that individual to take his or her habit outdoors.Pay attention to how changes in the weather affect your asthma. You might even keep an ""asthma journal"" by recording the temperature, wind velocity, barometric pressure, and humidity on days when you suffer attacks. Knowing what types of weather conditions can leave you gasping for air can help you avoid problems. While each person responds to weather differently, some general trends may be noted.For instance, people with asthma should stay indoors when it is very cold outside, since a rush of cold air can cause a spasm in the bronchial tubes. Stay indoors if the wind is strong, too. While gusts of wind can blow pollution and smog away, they can also blow pollen in your direction. If you enjoy walking in the rain, you're in luck, because rain tends to wash away roving allergens, pollutants, and irritants. ©2007 Publications International, Ltd.People with asthma should stay indoors when it is very cold outside, since a rush of cold air can cause a spasm in the bronchial tubes. The question of whether foods trigger asthma has yet to be answered. Some foods, such as nuts, shellfish, milk, eggs, chocolate, sodas, and strawberries, can result in an array of allergic responses, including asthma symptoms. Sulfites in wine can have a similar effect. An attack that's precipitated by a certain food will most likely occur within an hour of ingesting it.Existing scientific evidence suggests that food allergies are probably not a major trigger for chronic asthma in adults. Nonetheless, you may have noticed that certain foods worsen your symptoms. If so, it's best to limit or avoid foods that aren't necessary for a balanced, nutritious diet. (Ask your doctor if you're not sure.)Allergies to certain types of food, especially milk and wheat, are more often a trigger of asthma in children. If milk and wheat seem to be causing problems for your child with asthma, eliminate these foods from his or her diet. Check labels, and avoid foods that list milk, milk solids, casein, whey, or caseinate as ingredients. (Talk to your family doctor about alternate dietary sources of nutrients such as calcium.)Eating away from home can sometimes be a problem. If you are invited to dinner and don't know what meal will be served, eat something at home before you leave so you won't be left hungry should the main course be a trigger food for you. If you are eating in a restaurant, inquire about the ingredients in the dish you want to order. No matter where you have your meal, don't overeat, don't eat too fast, and don't talk while you are eating. Steer clear of alcohol, too, especially if you are taking medications for your asthma. One final reminder: Avoid so-called cytotoxicity tests and similar methods that promise to root out hidden food allergies and cure asthma. A problem in the upper airways, such as a respiratory infection, can cause trouble in the lower airways (the bronchial tubes) and precipitate an asthma attack. While taking steps to avoid getting sick makes sense for everyone, maintaining good health can dramatically reduce the frequency and intensity of asthma attacks. Stay away from people who have a cold or the flu, drink plenty of fluids, and avoid getting overtired; otherwise, you will be more susceptible to infections. It's a good idea for asthmatics to get a flu shot each year. If, despite your best efforts, you do develop an infection, see your doctor; early use of antibiotics, when appropriate, can be quite helpful.Any number of chemicals can trigger an asthma attack in susceptible people, whether it's chemical fumes, such as from paint or perfume, or chemical additives, such as the sufites that are used as preservatives in food. Keep your distance from these chemicals whenever possible. Some people with asthma are sensitive to some drugs, especially aspirin and nonsteriodal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Play it safe and avoid aspirin and products that contain it if you have asthma. Even if you have not experienced an asthma flare from aspirin in the past, it's possible for one to occur at any time. Keep aspirin out of your medicine chest, and check labels on every over-the-counter drug that you purchase. Avoid those that list ""aspirin"" and those that contain the initials ""ASA,"" ""APC,"" or ""PAC;"" ask your pharmacist if you are unsure if the medication you want to purchase contains aspirin.According to an expert report from the National Asthma Education Program, people with asthma should also stay away from certain NSAIDs (ibuprofen is one such medication) that have effects similar to aspirin's. Opt instead for such ""usually safe alternatives"" as acetaminophen, sodium salicylate, or disalcid. For a list of precautions to take when using over-the-counter painkillers, .You may also need to avoid tartrazine (yellow food dye #5), which is found in a number of soft drinks, cake mixes, candies, and some medications, if it aggravates your asthma. Inhaling through the mouth often produces shallow, unsatisfying breaths that can resemble panting. Practice inhaling slowly through the nose in a controlled way, instead. Before you start breathing exercises, blow your nose to make sure that your air passages are clear of foreign matter. Then sit in a chair in a comfortable position. Take a deep breath and feel your breath going as far down as possible. Your abdomen should expand as you do this exercise. Exhale slowly, feeling your abdomen relax as your breath comes out of your nose. Repeat this exercise at least three times a day (but never right after eating and never in a hurry, which may trigger hyperventilation). For years, people with asthma have been told to avoid exercise because it would induce attacks. Research has shown, however, that getting regular aerobic exercise increases the amount of huffing and puffing an asthmatic can tolerate. Start by warming up with light exercise before a more vigorous workout. Begin with short workouts and gradually increase them.At least at first, keep a bronchodilator with you. If you feel tightness in your chest and can't work through it, use the device. If you are out in cold or dry air, wear a scarf around your nose and mouth to heat the air before breathing it in. Cool down with light exercise at the end of your workout. If one type of exercise still brings on attacks, try another form of exercise. You may not be able to tolerate running, for example, but you may be able to swim regularly. Exertion causes overweight people to breathe more deeply, forcing their hearts to work extra hard supplying blood to the muscles and organs. If you are overweight, losing weight will ease your heart's burden; unfortunately, asthma medications can cause you to pack on pounds. If you need to lose some pounds, you and your doctor should work together to establish a diet and exercise plan that will help you burn more calories and reduce your calorie intake without depriving you of necessary nutrients. The notion that asthma is ""all in your head"" has gone the way of many medical myths. However, doctors believe that asthma is an illness with both physical and emotional aspects. For example, asthma attacks can be triggered by emotional changes, such as laughing or crying, or by stress. While you may not be able to ""think away"" an asthma attack, keeping your mind at ease may prevent you from panicking at the onset of an asthma attack, which will make a bout with breathing trouble less scary. Develop an upbeat mind-set by committing yourself to feeling better. A positive attitude works wonders to enhance your other coping methods. In addition, be forthright about your asthma; others will respect your directness and, in most cases, try to make things easier for you. Since stress and emotional upsets can trigger or aggravate asthma attacks, it may be helpful to set aside time each day, preferably the same time, to practice some form of relaxation.In our final section, we will look at some natural home remedies for asthma that involve some of the common foods that are probably in your kitchen right now.

For a variety of safe and effective remedies for allergy symptoms, read Although there are many medical ways to help asthma sufferers breathe easier, experts recommend combining certain natural home remedies with prescription anti-inflammatories and bronchodilators. Here are some helpful remedies right from the kitchen. The caffeine in regular coffee can help prevent and control asthma attacks. Researchers have found that regular coffee drinkers have one-third fewer asthma symptoms than those who don't drink the hot stuff. The reason? Caffeine has bronchodilating effects. In fact, caffeine was one of the main anti-asthmatic drugs during the nineteenth century. Don't load up on java, though -- three cups a day will provide the maximum benefit -- and don't give coffee to children with asthma. Onions are loaded with anti-inflammatory properties. Studies have shown that these properties can reduce the constriction of the airways in an asthma attack. Raw onions are generally too irritating, but eating cooked onions may help to lessen asthma attacks. Put a fine cheesecloth over each room's heat outlet. This homemade dust filter can help by catching dust, animal dander, and pollen before it's recirculated into the air. Stick-on commercial filters are also available. And don't forget the number one most effective home aid -- scrupulous cleaning. It's not easy, but being a bit obsessive about keeping a clean house goes a long way toward helping to alleviate asthma symptoms. Hot foods such as chili peppers open up airways. Experts believe this happens because peppers stimulate fluids in the mouth, throat, and lungs. The increase in fluids thins out the mucus formed during an asthma attack so it can be coughed up, making breathing easier. Capsaicin, the stuff that makes hot peppers hot, acts as an anti-inflammatory when eaten. ©2007 Publications International, Ltd.Eating hot foods like chili peppers may help you breathe easier. Vitamin C is the main antioxidant in the lining of the bronchi and bronchioles. Research discovered that people with asthma had low levels of vitamin C; eating foods that had at least 300 mg of vitamin C a day -- equivalent to about three glasses of orange juice -- cut wheezing by 30 percent. Other foods high in vitamin C include red bell pepper, papaya, broccoli, blueberries, and strawberries. Fatty fish such as sardines, salmon, mackerel, and tuna contain omega-3 fatty acids. These fatty acids seem to help the lungs react better to irritants in people who have asthma and may even help prevent asthma in people who have never had an attack. Studies have found that kids who eat fish more than once a week have one-third the risk of getting asthma, as compared to children who don't eat fish. And researchers discovered that people who took fish oil supplements, equivalent to eating 8 ounces of mackerel a day, increased their body's ability to avoid a severe asthma attack by 50 percent. Vitamin B12 can alleviate the symptoms of asthma, and it seems to be even more effective in asthma sufferers who are sensitive to sulfite. Studies have found that taking 1 to 4 micrograms (mcg) works best as protection against asthma attacks. The current RDA for vitamin B12 is 2.4 mcg for adults. One cup of yogurt has 1.4 mcg of the lung-loving vitamin. This is a folk remedy for a homemade vaporizer: Put 1 quart nonchlorinated water in a stainless steel, glass, or enamel pan, and put it on the stove. Add 10 drops peppermint extract or peppermint oil, and bring to a boil. Let it simmer for about 1 hour, until all the water is gone. The volatile oil will saturate the room air. Salt tends to make the airways more sensitive to triggers. Getting rid of animal products in the diet helps asthma by eliminating many food allergens (cow's milk, for example). Remember, though, that vegan diets can be deficient in protein and B12, which can be especially risky for kids and pregnant or lactating women. You might consider seeking the help of a nutritionist or dietician to help you plan a vegan diet.

40162f02-5e62-4d87-bd50-997c6954e4f1,"Treatment Types for Severe Asthma: What to Ask Your Doctor Medically reviewed by — — Severe asthma is a chronic respiratory condition in which your symptoms are more intense and difficult to control than mild-to-moderate cases. Asthma that isn’t well-controlled can affect your ability to complete daily tasks. It can even lead to life-threatening asthma attacks. If you’re experiencing side effects from a medication or don’t think it’s working, it’s important to see your doctor. They can review your medical history and adjust your treatment accordingly. Here are some questions you can bring to your next medical appointment to get the conversation started. Start by asking your doctor to explain the signs and symptoms of severe asthma. Mild-to-moderate asthma can typically be controlled with prescription medication. People with severe asthma require higher doses of these medications and may still find themselves in the emergency room due to asthma attacks. Severe asthma can cause debilitating symptoms that lead to missed school or work. You may also be unable to take part in physical activities like going to the gym or playing sports. Severe asthma is also more likely to be accompanied by other medical conditions, such as obesity, sleep apnea, and gastroesophageal reflux disease. Your doctor may prescribe inhaled corticosteroids for severe asthma to prevent your symptoms and manage the inflammation in your airways. With regular use, inhaled corticosteroids can reduce the frequency and intensity of asthma attacks. They won’t prevent or stop an attack once it has started. Inhaled corticosteroids may cause local side effects, which are limited to a specific part of the body. They can also lead to systemic side effects, which affect the whole body. Oral corticosteroids may be prescribed in addition to inhaled corticosteroids if you’re at risk of a serious asthma attack, or if you’ve already had one in the past. They work by relaxing the muscles around your airways. They also reduce symptoms like coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath. These can carry similar side effects to inhaled corticosteroids, although they’re more common and can be more serious. Side effects may include: Biologic drugs are often taken by injection and help to control symptoms of severe asthma. Biologics tend to be more expensive than other asthma medications. But they’re being used more and more as an alternative to oral steroids, which can sometimes lead to serious side effects. Biologics are typically safe to use. The side effects are generally minor, including: In rare cases, severe allergic reactions to biologics are possible. If you think you’re experiencing an allergic reaction, contact your doctor right away. Short-acting beta agonists (SABAs) are sometimes used as rescue medications for the rapid relief of asthma symptoms. Long-acting beta agonists (LABAs) work in a similar manner but continue to provide relief for 12 hours or more. These both carry the same side effects, as they work in very similar ways. But the side effects of SABAs usually resolve quickly. With LABAs, side effects may persist for extended periods of time. Side effects may include: Leukotriene modifiers work by blocking an inflammatory chemical in the body called leukotriene. This chemical causes your airway muscles to tighten when you come into contact with an allergen or asthma trigger. Leukotriene modifiersare usually well-tolerated in people with severe asthma, but they do carry a number of minor side effects, including: Managing your symptoms is a vital part of living with severe asthma. Your doctor can advise you on strategies to help minimize the effect of asthma on your daily life. See your doctor on a regular basis to check on how well your medications are working. Let your doctor know immediately if you feel as though any of your medications aren’t functioning like they’re supposed to. Your doctor can also help to identify which pollutants and irritants are triggering your asthma. Once you know what your triggers are, you can take steps to avoid them. If you’re a smoker, you should make an effort to quit as soon as possible. Smoking can exacerbate your symptoms and increase your chances of other life-threatening conditions like cancer and heart disease. Talk to your doctor about programs or medications that can help you stop smoking. You’re probably curious about your long-term outlook with severe asthma. If so, consider asking your doctor about this. Severe asthma can be unpredictable, so the long-term outlook is different for everyone. Some people’s symptoms improve, some experience ups and downs, and some find that their symptoms worsen over time. Your doctor can give you the most accurate prediction based on your medical history and how well you’ve been responding to treatment so far. Maintaining a dialogue with your doctor is key to finding the right treatment for you. The questions above are a good place to start, but they are by no means the only things you should ask. Don’t be afraid to contact your doctor’s office whenever you have other questions or concerns. The more you know about your severe asthma, the easier it will be for you to manage your symptoms and lead a normal, healthy life.

This classification will help you and your doctor work together to monitor and treat your asthma. You and your doctor will create a personal Asthma Action Plan based on how your asthma is classified. This is your life plan for managing asthma. Your asthma classification can change over time depending on how well asthma symptoms are controlled. Your doctor will prescribe medicine and develop your Asthma Action Plan based on your asthma classification. These are some of the common symptoms and how they fit with different asthma classifications. nighttime symptoms that wake you two or fewer times a month use of short-acting beta-agonists two or fewer times a week asthma symptoms do not interfere with normal activity asthma symptoms more than two times a week but not every day use of short-acting beta agonists more than 2 days per week but not every day asthma symptoms cause minor limitation of normal activity asthma symptoms daily; use of short-acting beta-agonists daily nighttime symptoms more than once a week but not every night asthma symptoms cause some limitation of normal activity FEV1 or peak flow greater than 60% and less than 80% predicted use of short-acting beta-agonists several times a day asthma symptoms cause extreme limitation of normal activity FEV1 or peak flow equal to or less than 60% predicted National Asthma Education and Prevention Program Expert Panel Report 3: Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Management of Asthma--Summary Report 2007.

Asthma is a syndrome that is comprised of reversible airflow obstruction that leads to breathing difficulty and shortness of breath. It is also associated with airway inflammation that is caused by various triggers including infections and environmental exposures, obesity and allergens. Some patients have a genetic predisposition to asthma with multiple family members being affected by the disease. Asthma is known as a heterogeneous condition, which means that it varies in what is driving it, even if the symptoms are the same. Although asthma can be easily treated in most patients, 10 percent of patients have severe asthma that causes debilitating disease. Asthma that is not well controlled can be fatal given exposure to triggers. The triggers cause blockage of the airway with mucous, and spasms of the muscles around the airways with closure of the bronchial tubes, resulting in an inability to breathe. People with symptoms occurring at least 5-6 times a week and a couple of times at night a month are more at risk for a fatal asthma attack. Everyone is different, so it’s important for you to know when your asthma is flaring, which you can tell by your daily peak flow meter reading and whether you are still having tightness even after using your rescue inhaler. Allergies, such as ragweed and pollen, aspirin, animal dander, or dust Chemical exposures, such as cleaning with bleach in a non-ventilated area Acid reflux (heartburn can spill chemicals from the gastrointestinal tract into airway) People at risk for asthma often have a family history of asthma but it can occur in patients with any family history of the disease. Although it was previously thought that the onset of asthma only occurred in childhood, we now know that there are patients for whom asthma starts in adulthood. In fact, patients with asthma that starts in adulthood tend to have more severe disease that does not respond as well to treatment. Asthma is more common in those who have a history of allergies (seasonal) or atopy (immediate allergic reactions). When asthma starts in childhood it may resolve in the late teens and early 20s. Patients will report that they have “grown out"" of their asthma. However, in some cases, there is a period of minimal asthma symptoms as a young adult but a recurrence of asthma later in life.  Therefore, patients that “grow out of their asthma” must recognize the possibility of a recurrence and pay attention to any asthma symptoms that return later in life and should seek treatment if this occurs. While boys are more likely to have asthma during childhood, more females have asthma as adults. There are several different types of asthma with varying causes and degrees of severity. The different types of asthma are described as which are the characteristics of a disease that can be observed (measured using tests). These phenotypes are produced by the interaction of a person's genetic predisposition and the environmental triggers that cause the disease to occur. The asthma phenotypes include:     Asthma caused by obesity or worsened by obesity, asthma that is associated with frequent attacks called exacerbations, adult onset asthma and asthma that is associated with fixed obstruction (the obstruction in airflow does not reverse with albuterol). Asthma that is associated with increased numbers of various cells associated with inflammation such as eosinophilic asthma (caused by high eosinophils) and non-eosinophilic asthma (asthma is driven by cells other than eosinophils such as neutrophils). These triggers include allergic asthma, exercise induced asthma, occupational asthma and asthma made worse by aspirins/non steroids and anti-inflammatory drugs like ibuprofen. Asthma can vary in severity from person to person, regardless of the type of asthma that you have. The severity of asthma ranges from mild to severe as described below. The severity of your asthma can vary over time and does not stay the same for all individuals throughout the course of their disease. Some patients always have mild asthma, but some experience a progression of their disease and develop severe asthma over time. means that the asthma symptoms do not occur on a consistent basis and an individual can go through long periods without any symptoms. The majority of patients fall into this category. Includes wheezing once or twice a week. Patients with mild intermittent asthma rarely wake up at night. This type of asthma requires a minimal amount of medication and is generally easy to control. It can occur during various seasons of the year, with exercise and exposure to cold air, or with upper respiratory infections. Coughing, wheezing, and chest tightness 3 to 6 times a week. Patients may wake up at night coughing or having trouble breathing a few times a month. On a day-to-day basis, your peak flow meter (an at-home device to measure your lung function) will drop more than 20 percent. Most patients with mild persistent asthma require a low dose of asthma medications every day to keep their asthma under control. Patients report daily symptoms of coughing, wheezing, and chest tightness. The asthma symptoms cause night time awakening more than 5 times a month. Peak flow meter reading is in the 60-80 percent range. Patients with moderate disease will definitely require medications on a daily basis for their asthma. About 10 percent of asthmatics fall into this group. These patients experience continuous symptoms of coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath and chest tightness. Patients report walking up regularly at night due to asthma. Peak flow meter reading is often less than 60 percent. Patients with severe asthma bear the burden of the disease more than any other group.  These patients suffer significantly with asthma symptoms, must take multiple medications for asthma on a daily basis and still continue to have symptoms (remain uncontrolled).  You still have severe asthma if you need multiple medications to maintain asthma control.  There are also other conditions that can make asthma worse, including gastroesophageal reflux disease, obstructive sleep apnea, vocal cord disorders (such as vocal cord dysfunction), smoking, anxiety or depression, allergic rhinitis/sinusitis, nasal polyps, menstruation and bronchiectasis (a condition that is associated with abnormally large bronchial tubes). These other conditions are called comorbidities. Regardless of the type or severity of asthma you have, your physician should focus on controlling it. You cannot control the type or severity of asthma you have BUT you can focus on achieving control of your disease. More than two exacerbations/year (attacks of asthma that require treatment with oral steroids like prednisone or require you to go to urgent care/ER or hospital for your asthma) OR At least one hospitalization or ICU stay per year OR Low lung function (<80% FEV1 – the amount of air that you can blow out of your lungs in one second) Achieving asthma control is the central focus in the management of patients with asthma. Your goal should be to be able to live a productive and symptom-free life with asthma. For more information about asthma diagnosis and treatment at the University of Michigan, visit the page.

42acad0d-6689-4ceb-9389-5f33378a3415,"Type your tag names separated by a space and hit enter Bronchitis and Asthma With CC or Major CC Asthma is classified as an intermittent, reversible, obstructive disease of the lungs. It is a growing health problem in the United States, with approximately 25 million people affected. In the past 20 years, the number of children with asthma has increased markedly, and it is now the leading serious chronic illness in children. Unfortunately, approximately 75% of children with asthma continue to have chronic problems in adulthood. The total deaths annually from asthma have increased by over 100% since 1979 in the United States. Asthma is a disease of the airways characterized by airway inflammation and hyperreactivity (increased responsiveness to a wide variety of triggers). Hyperreactivity leads to airway obstruction due to acute onset of muscle spasm in the smooth muscle of the tracheobronchial tree, thereby leading to a narrowed lumen. In addition to muscle spasm, there is swelling of the mucosa, which leads to edema. Although asthma can result from infections (especially viral) and inhaled irritants, it often is the result of an allergic response. An allergen (antigen) is introduced to the body, and sensitizing antibodies such as immunoglobulin E (IgE) are formed. IgE antibodies bind to tissue mast cells and basophils in the mucosa of the bronchioles, lung tissue, and nasopharynx. An antigen-antibody reaction releases mediator substances such as histamine, slow-reacting substance of anaphylaxis (SRS-A), and others. These mediators cause contraction of the smooth muscle and tissue edema. In addition, goblet cells secrete a thick mucus into the airways that causes obstruction. Intrinsic asthma results from all other causes except allergies, such as infections (especially viral), inhaled irritants, and other causes or etiologies. The parasympathetic nervous system becomes stimulated, which increases bronchomotor tone, resulting in bronchoconstriction. In asthma, the total lung capacity (TLC), functional residual capacity (FRC), and residual volume (RV) increase, but the hallmark of airway obstruction is a reduction in ratio of the forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) to the forced vital capacity (FVC). Complications include pneumonia, atelectasis, respiratory failure with hypoxemia, and status asthmaticus (severe and refractory asthma). The classification for asthma is described in . Less than twice a week: Cough, wheeze, chest tightness, difficulty breathing Brief flare-ups with varying intensity; no symptoms between flare-ups Lung function tests: FEV1 ≥ 80% normal values; peak flow < 20% variability a.m. to a.m. or a.m. to p.m., day to day Three to six times a week: Cough, wheeze, chest tightness, difficulty breathing Lung function tests: FEV1 ≥ 80% normal values; peak flow < 20%–30% variability a.m. to a.m. or a.m. to p.m., day to day Daily: Cough, wheeze, chest tightness, difficulty breathing Lung function tests: FEV1 > 60% but < 80% normal values; peak flow > 30% variability a.m. to a.m. or a.m. to p.m., day to day Continual: Cough, wheeze, chest tightness, difficulty breathing Lung function tests: FEV1 ≤ 60% normal values; peak flow > 30% variability a.m. to a.m. or a.m. to p.m., day to day The main triggers for asthma are allergies, viral infections, autonomic nervous system imbalances that can cause an increase in parasympathetic stimulation, medications, psychological factors, and exercise. Of asthmatic conditions in patients under 30 years old, 70% are caused by allergies. Three major indoor allergens are dust mites, cockroaches, and cats. In older patients, the cause is almost always nonallergic types of irritants, such as smog. Heredity plays a part in about one-third of the cases. The genetic contributions to the development of asthma have been estimated at between 30% and 50% for various asthma phenotypes and up to 70% for overall IgE levels in plasma. Familial factors thus far appear to be autosomal dominant. There are at least 11 candidate genes that contribute to asthma susceptibility. These include , , , , , , , , , , and . Although the incidence of asthma is estimated at 5% to 10% in the general population, children have a higher incidence of 12%. Children make up one-third of the people with asthma; in the United States, 7 million children are affected, and trends suggest an increasing incidence of asthma in children under the age of 6 years. Asthma is diagnosed more frequently in males under 14 years and over 45 years of age and in females between the ages of 15 and 45. Black/African American children have higher morbidity and mortality rates than white children. Most experts agree that environmental factors play a more important role in asthma etiology than do genetic factors. Approximately 80% to 85% of childhood asthma episodes are associated with a prior exposure to a virus. Asthma prevalence varies widely across many nations, with a range from 1% to over 30% in children. Approximately 300 million people globally have asthma, and the prevalence increases by 50% every 10 years. Prevalence is high in developed countries in North America, Europe, and Australia and is increasing in developing countries as they become more industrialized. Examples include increases in South Africa, Eastern Europe, and the Baltic States. The greatest increases are seen in children. The more urbanization and affluence in a nation, the higher the prevalence. Because patients (especially children) with asthma have a history of allergies, obtain a thorough description of the response to allergens or other irritants. The patient may describe a sudden onset of symptoms after exposure, with a sense of suffocation. Symptoms include dyspnea, wheezing, and a cough (either dry or productive) and also chest tightness, restlessness, anxiety, and a prolonged expiratory phase. Ask if the patient has experienced a recent viral infection. Determine the speed of onset of symptoms, the number of asthma attacks in the past year, and the number of emergency department visits and hospitalizations from asthma in the past year. Children with an impending asthma attack may have been vomiting because of the tendency to swallow coughed up mucus rather than expectorating it. The most common symptoms are , , , and . The patient with an acute attack of asthma appears ill, with shortness of breath so severe that he or she can hardly speak. In acute airway obstruction, patients use their accessory muscles for breathing and are often profoundly diaphoretic. Some patients have an increased anteroposterior thoracic diameter. Children with asthma often prefer standing or sitting leaning forward to ease breathing. As airway obstruction becomes more serious, children may develop sternocleidomastoid contractions that indicate an increased expiratory effort, supraclavicular contractions that indicate an increased expiratory effort, and nasal flaring. If the patient has marked color changes such as pallor or cyanosis or becomes confused, restless, or lethargic, respiratory failure may be on the horizon. Percussion of the lungs usually produces hyperresonance, and palpation may reveal vocal fremitus. Auscultation reveals high-pitched inspiratory and expiratory wheezes, but with a major airway obstruction, breath sounds may be diminished. As the obstruction improves, breath sounds may actually worsen as they can be auscultated throughout the lung fields. During the most severe attacks of asthma, wheezing may be absent because of severe reduction of airflow, or its absence. Usually, the patient also has a prolonged expiratory phase of respiration. A rapid heart rate, mild systolic hypertension, and a paradoxic pulse may also be present. The emergency situation and an unfamiliar environment can aggravate the symptoms of the disease, especially if this is the patient's first experience with the condition. If the patient is a child and the parent is anxious, the child's level of anxiety increases and the attack may worsen. FVC: Maximum volume of air that can be forcefully expired after a maximal lung inspiration FEV1: Volume of air expired in 1 second from the beginning of the FVC maneuverAirway obstruction decreases flow rates; hospitalization is recommended if FVC is less than 1 L; FEV1/FVC should be 80% normally, but in asthma, it decreases to as low as 25% Forced expiratory flow (FEF): Maximal flow rate attained during the middle (25%–75%) of FVC maneuver RV: Volume of air remaining in lungs at end of a maximal expirationIncreased RV indicates obstruction; may remain increased for up to 3 weeks after the attack FRC: Volume of air remaining in lungs at end of a resting tidal volume Chest x-ray, high-resolution computed tomography (for chronic symptoms), skin testing, pulse oximetry, arterial blood gases, ECG, serum IgE. Peak expiratory flow rates (maximal flow rate attained during the FVC maneuver; decreased from baseline during periods of obstruction) may be used at home daily for patients who require daily medications. Ineffective airway clearance related to obstruction from narrowed lumen and thick mucus as evidenced by shortness of breath, wheezing, and/or chest tightness Respiratory status: Gas exchange; Respiratory status: Ventilation; Symptom control behavior; Treatment behavior: Illness or injury; Comfort level Airway management; Anxiety reduction; Oxygen therapy; Airway suctioning; Airway insertion and stabilization; Cough enhancement; Mechanical ventilation; Positioning; Respiratory monitoring For all but the most seriously ill patients, the goal is to prevent symptoms and reduce adverse events when acute episodes occur. Airway obstruction is generally managed with quick relief medications such as short-acting bronchodilators, systemic corticosteroids, and ipratropium (Atrovent). During severe exacerbations, patients may require IV fluid replacement. Unless contraindicated by a cardiac problem, 3,000 to 4,000 mL/day of fluid is usually administered intravenously, which helps loosen secretions and facilitates expectoration of the secretions. Low-flow oxygen therapy based on arterial blood gas results is often administered to treat hypoxemia. For the patient with increasing airway obstruction, endotracheal intubation and perhaps mechanical ventilation may be needed to maintain adequate airway and breathing. Close follow-up is needed when patients are discharged from the hospital because airway hyperactivity usually persists for 4 to 6 weeks after the event. To prevent symptoms, long-term control medications such as inhaled corticosteroids, inhaled cromolyn, long-acting bronchodilators, theophylline, leukotriene modifiers, and anti-IgE antibodies are used. Inhaled beta-adrenergic agonists by metered-dose inhaler (MDI); albuterol sulfate, pirbuterol acetate, levalbuterolReversal of airflow obstruction; relieve reversible bronchospasm by relaxing bronchial smooth muscles; used to treat bronchospasm in acute asthmatic episodes; used to prevent bronchospasm associated with exercise-induced asthma or nocturnal asthma Methylprednisolone IV; prednisone PO; inhaled corticosteroids (ciclesonide, beclomethasone, fluticasone, budesonide, mometasone)Decrease inflammatory response; ideal dose is not defined well, but desired outcome is to speed recovery and limit symptoms Montelukast 10 mg PO daily; zafirlukast 20 mg PO dailyInhibits leukotrienes, fatty acids that mediate inflammation, from binding to airway smooth muscle cells; prevents rather than reduces symptoms; used for long-term prevention Xanthines, such as theophylline, have been used successfully in treating chronic severe steroid-dependent asthmatics. Cromolyn sodium decreases bronchospasm, but it is not effective for acute bronchospasms and is used as a preventive measure. Maintenance of airway, breathing, and circulation is the consideration during an acute attack. Patients should be on bedrest to minimize their oxygen consumption and to decrease the work of breathing. Note that patients usually assume a position to ease breathing; some patients breathe more easily while sitting in an upright position: Do not impose bedrest on a patient who can breathe only in another position. Ask questions that can be answered by nodding or a brief one-word answer so the patient can conserve energy for breathing. If the patient is a child, allow the parents to stay with the child during acute attacks. Have the parents identify a security item that reassures the child, such as a special blanket or toy, and keep the item with the child at all times. Reinforce coping strategies to the parents, and allow them to express any feelings of guilt and helplessness. For strategies to prevent future attacks, discuss triggers that can induce asthma attacks and ways to avoid them. If the attack is triggered by an allergen, explore with the patient or family the source and discuss possible strategies for eliminating it. Cold air and exercise may increase symptoms. Aspirin and NSAIDs can cause sudden, severe airway obstruction. Outline the signs and symptoms that require immediate attention. Instruct the patient to notify the physician should she or he develop a respiratory infection that could trigger an attack. Instruct patients regarding their medications, particularly MDIs, and the indications for use. It is important that the patient uses the bronchodilator MDIs first and then uses the steroid inhalers. Explain to patients on steroid inhalers the need to rinse their mouths out after using them to avoid getting thrush. George, M., Abboud, S., Pantalon, M., Sommers, M.S., Mao, J., & Rand, C. (2016). Changes in clinical conversations when providers are informed of asthma patients' beliefs about medication use and integrative medical therapies. (1), 70–78. The purpose of this study was to explore whether asthma patients' personal beliefs about inhaled corticosteroid use and integrative medical therapies are discussed at routine care visits for asthma. The authors used a qualitative analysis of transcripts from 33 recorded care visits. Four themes emerged from the analysis when providers were aware of patients' beliefs: negative beliefs about corticosteroid use, integrative medical therapy use for asthma, decision making, and health lifestyles. When providers did not have this knowledge about their patients, two themes arose: asthma self-management and healthy lifestyles. The authors concluded that when providers understood patient beliefs, they could initiate conversations that were meaningful to their asthma patients about their self-management. Respiratory status: Patency of airway, auscultation of the lungs, presence or absence of adventitious breath sounds, respiratory rate and depth Response to medications, oxygen therapy, hydration, bedrest Presence of complications: Respiratory failure, pneumonia To prevent asthma attacks, teach patients the triggers that can precipitate an attack. In rare instances, asthma can lead to respiratory failure if patients are not treated immediately or are unresponsive to treatment (status asthmaticus). Explain that any dyspnea unrelieved by medications and accompanied by wheezing and accessory muscle use needs prompt attention from a healthcare provider. Encourage patients to identify and avoid things that make their asthma worse and to keep track of their symptoms. The National Institutes of Health provides excellent information for patient and families about asthma: . Teach the patient and family the correct use of medications, including the dosage, route, action, and side effects. Provide instructions about the proper use of MDIs. Note that many patients use complementary and alternative medications (CAM) for asthma or do not use their prescribed dose of medication. Assess the patient's use of CAM therapy and discuss with him or her the long-term consequences. is a sample topic from the . To view other topics, please or .

Keep reading to find out all you need to know to create your plan. There are several components that every action plan should have in common. These include: specific names of the medications you take for asthma and what you use them for, such as short- or long-acting medication symptoms that indicate your asthma is getting worse, including peak flow measurements what medications you should take based on the level of your symptoms symptoms that indicate when you should seek immediate medical attention emergency contact telephone numbers, including your primary care doctor, local hospital, and important family members to contact if you have an Your doctor may recommend that your action plan has three major zones for action, such as: Green is the “good” zone. This is when you’re doing well and your asthma doesn’t usually limit your activity level. This section of your plan includes your goal peak flow, the medications you take every day and when you take them, and if you use any special medications before exercise. Yellow is the “caution” zone. This is when your asthma is starting to show signs of worsening. This section includes the symptoms you experience in the yellow zone, your peak flows in the yellow zone, additional steps or medications to take when you’re in this zone, and the symptoms that indicate you may need to call your doctor. Red is the . This is when you’re having severe symptoms associated with your asthma, such as shortness of breath, significant activity limitations, or need to frequently use . Included in this section are danger signs, such as blue-tinged lips; medications to take; and when to call your doctor or seek emergency medical attention. include all the information listed above. But some modifications may help make the plan more user-friendly for children and caregivers. These include: You may want to include pictures of each medication or inhaler, as well as and pictures of the identified green, yellow, and red zones on the peak flow meter. Many children’s asthma action plans include a consent statement that parents sign to allow a school or caregiver to give medications, such as fast-acting medications. Children may not describe “wheezing” in these exact terms. Ask your child what certain symptoms mean to them. Write down these descriptions to help you and others best understand what symptoms your child is having. These are some of the modifications you can make to ensure your child’s asthma action plan is as user-friendly as possible. An asthma action plan for adults should include the information listed above, but with considerations for when you need help and may not be able to direct people to what you need. Consider including the following: Provide directions as to where a person can find your medication in your home if your breathing is so affected that you can’t direct them to it. List an emergency contact or healthcare provider to call if you need immediate medical attention and are at the hospital or a doctor’s office. You may want to give a copy of your asthma action plan to your boss or a human resources manager at your workplace to ensure someone can assist you if needed. You don’t have to start from scratch when creating an asthma action plan. There are many online resources that can help you create a paper or web-based plan. Here are some places to start: includes downloadable action plans in English and Spanish. There are plans for home and school. offers downloadable plans for home, childcare, and school. provides printable, online, and interactive plans, including those translated into Spanish. Your doctor’s office is also a good resource for asthma action plans. They can work with you to create the best plan for you. An action plan is a good idea for anyone diagnosed with asthma. Having a plan in place can take the guesswork out of what to do if your asthma worsens. It can also help identify when you’re managing your asthma well. An asthma action plan should be easily accessible to anyone who may need to use it. Once you create one, it’s a good idea to make several copies and distribute them to caretakers. Consider doing the following: Keep one posted on an easily accessible place in your home, such as the refrigerator or a message board. Keep one near where you store your asthma medications. Distribute one to your child’s teacher and add one to your child’s school records. Give one to any family member who may take care of you or your child should emergency medical attention be needed. In addition, you may wish to take photos of each page of the plan and save them on your phone to “favorites.” You can also e-mail the plan to yourself so you’ll always have a copy handy. An asthma action plan comes with the following benefits: It helps you identify when your asthma is well managed, and when it isn’t. It provides an easy-to-follow guide as to what medications to take when you have certain symptoms. It takes the guesswork out of helping you or a loved one in a school setting or when a caretaker is at your home. It ensures that you understand what each prescribed medication does and when you should use them. When you or a loved one has asthma, it’s easy to sometimes feel panicked or unsure what to do. An asthma action plan can give you added confidence because it has answers for exactly what to do and when to do it. Talk with your doctor when establishing your asthma action plan. They should review the plan and add any suggestions. Be sure to bring the plan to regularly scheduled checkups. Other times when you should see your doctor and consider updating your plan include: if you’re having trouble maintaining your asthma, such as if you’re often in yellow or red zones of your plan if you don’t feel like your medications are working as well as they used to if you’re having side effects to the medications you’ve been prescribed If you have concerns about your asthma and action plan, call your doctor. Taking steps to prevent an asthma attack and make note of worsening symptoms is key to managing your asthma. An asthma action plan can be vital to helping you, caretakers, and your doctor manage your asthma. Many online resources can help you establish your plan.

825c8be5-4be8-4da4-9c7c-76a03bd699bb,"— — If you have , a respiratory condition that causes breathing difficulties, you might experience chest pain. This symptom is common right before or during an asthma attack. The discomfort may feel like a dull ache or a sharp, stabbing pain. Some describe it as if they have a heavy brick sitting on their chest. While chest pain isn’t unusual in people with asthma, it could be a sign of another condition. Read on to learn about what causes chest pain in people with asthma, how to treat it, and when you should seek help. Chest pain or tightness is common in people with asthma. In one emergency department survey, of people with asthma reported chest pain. Chest pain is known as a subjective symptom. A subjective symptom is one that doctors can’t measure. Instead, they must rely on a description of the pain. This symptom is usually one of many that someone with asthma experiences. However, a published in 2013 suggested that chest tightness may be the only symptom for some people with asthma. If you have asthma, your immune system your airways to become inflamed and swollen when you’re around certain irritants. This can lead to chest tightness, pressure, or pain. show that chest pain, along with other non-respiratory symptoms, frequently occur before or during an asthma attack. If you experience chest pain after an asthma attack, it could be because you’re sore from the coughing, deep breathing, or other symptoms you experienced. Coughing, deep breathing, and changing positions chest pain in people with asthma. , which occurs when contents in your stomach back up into your esophagus Before treating your symptoms, your doctor will want to make sure your chest pain is caused by asthma and not any other conditions. If you experience chest pain due to asthma, your physician will probably prescribe an individualized treatment plan. Follow their instructions carefully to lessen your chances of developing symptoms. When you’re having an asthma attack, you may be told to use an emergency or to relax your airways and improve your symptoms. In one study, using inhaled albuterol resulted in improvement in of children and adolescents with asthma-induced chest pain who performed exercises on a treadmill. The best way to prevent chest pain caused by asthma is to follow the treatment plan provided by your doctor. Try not to miss any doses of medicine, and avoid potential asthma triggers if possible. Chest pain is a common symptom of asthma, but it could also be a sign of something else. Let your doctor know right away if you experience chest pain so you can get an accurate diagnosis. With the right treatment approach, this unwelcome symptom can be effectively controlled. Asthma may not be the reason for your chest pain. Several other conditions can also cause this symptom. Serious heart issues can manifest as pain in the chest area, including: , which occurs when a clot blocks blood flow to the heart , a condition in which plaques, or fatty deposits, narrow arteries and restrict your heart’s blood supply , a condition in which your heart’s main artery ruptures , which is an inflammation around the sac surrounding your heart is a common culprit for burning or painful sensations in the chest. Other digestive problems, such as or swallowing disorders, can cause these symptoms as well. Chest pain or discomfort is often a hallmark sign of a . You may also feel like your heart is racing and experience shortness of breath. A bruised or broken rib is sometimes to blame for chest pain. Pain syndromes, such as , cause persistent sore muscles that you might feel in the chest area. You may also feel chest pain if you’ve recently lifted weights or done other exercises that involved your chest muscles. With , the cartilage of your rib cage becomes inflamed and painful. That sometimes causes chest pain. If a blood clot travels to the lung, it can cause chest pain. , which is characterized by high blood pressure in the arteries that carry blood to the lungs, can produce discomfort in the chest. When air leaks into the area between the lungs and ribs, your lung can . Many people experience chest pain when this happens. If the membrane that covers your lungs is inflamed, chest pain can occur. The blisters caused by the virus can extend to the area around your chest wall, leading to discomfort. Many of the conditions that cause chest pain are considered serious or life-threatening.

It is a growing health problem in the United States, with approximately 25 million people affected. In the past 20 years, the number of children with asthma has increased markedly, and it is now the leading serious chronic illness in children. Unfortunately, approximately 75% of children with asthma continue to have chronic problems in adulthood. The total deaths annually from asthma have increased by over 100% since 1979 in the United States. Asthma is a disease of the airways characterized by airway inflammation and hyperreactivity (increased responsiveness to a wide variety of triggers). Hyperreactivity leads to airway obstruction due to acute onset of muscle spasm in the smooth muscle of the tracheobronchial tree, thereby leading to a narrowed lumen. In addition to muscle spasm, there is swelling of the mucosa, which leads to edema. Although asthma can result from infections (especially viral) and inhaled irritants, it often is the result of an allergic response. An allergen (antigen) is introduced to the body, and sensitizing antibodies such as immunoglobulin E (IgE) are formed. IgE antibodies bind to tissue mast cells and basophils in the mucosa of the bronchioles, lung tissue, and nasopharynx. An antigen-antibody reaction releases primary mediator substances such as histamine, slow-reacting substance of anaphylaxis (SRS-A), and others. These mediators cause contraction of the smooth muscle and tissue edema. In addition, goblet cells secrete a thick mucus into the airways that causes obstruction. Intrinsic asthma results from all other causes except allergies, such as infections (especially viral), inhaled irritants, and other causes or etiologies. The parasympathetic nervous system becomes stimulated, which increases bronchomotor tone, resulting in bronchoconstriction. In asthma, the total lung capacity (TLC), functional residual capacity (FRC), and residual volume (RV) increase, but the hallmark of airway obstruction is a reduction in ratio of the forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) to the forced vital capacity (FVC). Complications include pneumonia, atelectasis, respiratory failure with hypoxemia, and status asthmaticus (severe and refractory asthma). The classification for asthma is described in . Less than twice a week: Cough, wheeze, chest tightness, difficulty breathing Brief flare-ups with varying intensity; no symptoms between flare-ups Lung function tests: FEV1 ≥ 80% normal values; peak flow < 20% variability a.m. to a.m. or a.m. to p.m., day to day Three to six times a week: Cough, wheeze, chest tightness, difficulty breathing Lung function tests: FEV1 ≥ 80% normal values; peak flow < 20%–30% variability a.m. to a.m. or a.m. to p.m., day to day Daily: Cough, wheeze, chest tightness, difficulty breathing Lung function tests: FEV1 > 60% but < 80% normal values; peak flow > 30% variability a.m. to a.m. or a.m. to p.m., day to day Continual: Cough, wheeze, chest tightness, difficulty breathing Lung function tests: FEV1 ≤ 60% normal values; peak flow > 30% variability a.m. to a.m. or a.m. to p.m., day to day The main triggers for asthma are allergies, viral infections, autonomic nervous system imbalances that can cause an increase in parasympathetic stimulation, medications, psychological factors, and exercise. Of asthmatic conditions in patients under 30 years old, 70% are caused by allergies. Three major indoor allergens are dust mites, cockroaches, and cats. In older patients, the cause is almost always nonallergic types of irritants, such as smog. Heredity plays a part in about one-third of the cases. The genetic contributions to the development of asthma have been estimated at between 30% and 50% for various asthma phenotypes and up to 70% for overall IgE levels in plasma. Familial factors thus far appear to be autosomal dominant. There are at least 11 candidate genes that contribute to asthma susceptibility. These include , , , , , , , , , , and . Although the incidence of asthma is estimated at 5% to 10% in the general population, children have a higher incidence of 12%. Children make up one-third of the people with asthma; in the United States, 7 million children are affected, and trends suggest an increasing incidence of asthma in children under the age of 6 years. Asthma is diagnosed more frequently in males under 14 years and over 45 years of age and in females between the ages of 15 and 45. Black/African American children have higher morbidity and mortality rates than white children. Most experts agree that environmental factors play a more important role in asthma etiology than do genetic factors. Approximately 80% to 85% of childhood asthma episodes are associated with a prior exposure to a virus. Asthma prevalence varies widely across many nations, with a range from 1% to over 30% in children. Approximately 300 million people globally have asthma, and the prevalence increases by 50% every 10 years. Prevalence is high in developed countries in North America, Europe, and Australia and is increasing in developing countries as they become more industrialized. Examples include increases in South Africa, Eastern Europe, and the Baltic States. The greatest increases are seen in children. The more urbanization and affluence in a nation, the higher the prevalence. Because patients (especially children) with asthma have a history of allergies, obtain a thorough description of the response to allergens or other irritants. The patient may describe a sudden onset of symptoms after exposure, with a sense of suffocation. Symptoms include dyspnea, wheezing, and a cough (either dry or productive) and also chest tightness, restlessness, anxiety, and a prolonged expiratory phase. Ask if the patient has experienced a recent viral infection. Determine the speed of onset of symptoms, the number of asthma attacks in the past year, and the number of emergency department visits and hospitalizations from asthma in the past year. Children with an impending asthma attack may have been vomiting because of the tendency to swallow coughed up mucus rather than expectorating it. The most common symptoms are , , , and . The patient with an acute attack of asthma appears ill, with shortness of breath so severe that he or she can hardly speak. In acute airway obstruction, patients use their accessory muscles for breathing and are often profoundly diaphoretic. Some patients have an increased anteroposterior thoracic diameter. Children with asthma often prefer standing or sitting leaning forward to ease breathing. As airway obstruction becomes more serious, children may develop sternocleidomastoid contractions that indicate an increased expiratory effort, supraclavicular contractions that indicate an increased expiratory effort, and nasal flaring. If the patient has marked color changes such as pallor or cyanosis or becomes confused, restless, or lethargic, respiratory failure may be on the horizon. Percussion of the lungs usually produces hyperresonance, and palpation may reveal vocal fremitus. Auscultation reveals high-pitched inspiratory and expiratory wheezes, but with a major airway obstruction, breath sounds may be diminished. As the obstruction improves, breath sounds may actually worsen as they can be auscultated throughout the lung fields. During the most severe attacks of asthma, wheezing may be absent because of severe reduction of airflow, or its absence. Usually, the patient also has a prolonged expiratory phase of respiration. A rapid heart rate, mild systolic hypertension, and a paradoxic pulse may also be present. The emergency situation and an unfamiliar environment can aggravate the symptoms of the disease, especially if this is the patient's first experience with the condition. If the patient is a child and the parent is anxious, the child's level of anxiety increases and the attack may worsen. FVC: Maximum volume of air that can be forcefully expired after a maximal lung inspiration FEV1: Volume of air expired in 1 second from the beginning of the FVC maneuverAirway obstruction decreases flow rates; hospitalization is recommended if FVC is less than 1 L; FEV1/FVC should be 80% normally, but in asthma, it decreases to as low as 25% Forced expiratory flow (FEF): Maximal flow rate attained during the middle (25%–75%) of FVC maneuver RV: Volume of air remaining in lungs at end of a maximal expirationIncreased RV indicates obstruction; may remain increased for up to 3 weeks after the attack FRC: Volume of air remaining in lungs at end of a resting tidal volume Chest x-ray, high-resolution computed tomography (for chronic symptoms), skin testing, pulse oximetry, arterial blood gases, ECG, serum IgE. Peak expiratory flow rates (maximal flow rate attained during the FVC maneuver; decreased from baseline during periods of obstruction) may be used at home daily for patients who require daily medications. Ineffective airway clearance related to obstruction from narrowed lumen and thick mucus as evidenced by shortness of breath, wheezing, and/or chest tightness Respiratory status: Gas exchange; Respiratory status: Ventilation; Symptom control behavior; Treatment behavior: Illness or injury; Comfort level Airway management; Anxiety reduction; Oxygen therapy; Airway suctioning; Airway insertion and stabilization; Cough enhancement; Mechanical ventilation; Positioning; Respiratory monitoring For all but the most seriously ill patients, the primary goal is to prevent symptoms and reduce adverse events when acute episodes occur. Airway obstruction is generally managed with quick relief medications such as short-acting bronchodilators, systemic corticosteroids, and ipratropium (Atrovent). During severe exacerbations, patients may require IV fluid replacement. Unless contraindicated by a cardiac problem, 3,000 to 4,000 mL/day of fluid is usually administered intravenously, which helps loosen secretions and facilitates expectoration of the secretions. Low-flow oxygen therapy based on arterial blood gas results is often administered to treat hypoxemia. For the patient with increasing airway obstruction, endotracheal intubation and perhaps mechanical ventilation may be needed to maintain adequate airway and breathing. Close follow-up is needed when patients are discharged from the hospital because airway hyperactivity usually persists for 4 to 6 weeks after the event. To prevent symptoms, long-term control medications such as inhaled corticosteroids, inhaled cromolyn, long-acting bronchodilators, theophylline, leukotriene modifiers, and anti-IgE antibodies are used. Inhaled beta-adrenergic agonists by metered-dose inhaler (MDI); albuterol sulfate, pirbuterol acetate, levalbuterolReversal of airflow obstruction; relieve reversible bronchospasm by relaxing bronchial smooth muscles; used to treat bronchospasm in acute asthmatic episodes; used to prevent bronchospasm associated with exercise-induced asthma or nocturnal asthma Methylprednisolone IV; prednisone PO; inhaled corticosteroids (ciclesonide, beclomethasone, fluticasone, budesonide, mometasone)Decrease inflammatory response; ideal dose is not defined well, but desired outcome is to speed recovery and limit symptoms Montelukast 10 mg PO daily; zafirlukast 20 mg PO dailyInhibits leukotrienes, fatty acids that mediate inflammation, from binding to airway smooth muscle cells; prevents rather than reduces symptoms; used for long-term prevention Xanthines, such as theophylline, have been used successfully in treating chronic severe steroid-dependent asthmatics. Cromolyn sodium decreases bronchospasm, but it is not effective for acute bronchospasms and is used as a preventive measure. Maintenance of airway, breathing, and circulation is the primary consideration during an acute attack. Patients should be on bedrest to minimize their oxygen consumption and to decrease the work of breathing. Note that patients usually assume a position to ease breathing; some patients breathe more easily while sitting in an upright position: Do not impose bedrest on a patient who can breathe only in another position. Ask questions that can be answered by nodding or a brief one-word answer so the patient can conserve energy for breathing. If the patient is a child, allow the parents to stay with the child during acute attacks. Have the parents identify a security item that reassures the child, such as a special blanket or toy, and keep the item with the child at all times. Reinforce coping strategies to the parents, and allow them to express any feelings of guilt and helplessness. For strategies to prevent future attacks, discuss triggers that can induce asthma attacks and ways to avoid them. If the attack is triggered by an allergen, explore with the patient or family the source and discuss possible strategies for eliminating it. Cold air and exercise may increase symptoms. Aspirin and NSAIDs can cause sudden, severe airway obstruction. Outline the signs and symptoms that require immediate attention. Instruct the patient to notify the physician should she or he develop a respiratory infection that could trigger an attack. Instruct patients regarding their medications, particularly MDIs, and the indications for use. It is important that the patient uses the bronchodilator MDIs first and then uses the steroid inhalers. Explain to patients on steroid inhalers the need to rinse their mouths out after using them to avoid getting thrush. George, M., Abboud, S., Pantalon, M., Sommers, M.S., Mao, J., & Rand, C. (2016). Changes in clinical conversations when providers are informed of asthma patients' beliefs about medication use and integrative medical therapies. (1), 70–78. The purpose of this study was to explore whether asthma patients' personal beliefs about inhaled corticosteroid use and integrative medical therapies are discussed at routine primary care visits for asthma. The authors used a qualitative analysis of transcripts from 33 recorded primary care visits. Four themes emerged from the analysis when providers were aware of patients' beliefs: negative beliefs about corticosteroid use, integrative medical therapy use for asthma, decision making, and health lifestyles. When providers did not have this knowledge about their patients, two themes arose: asthma self-management and healthy lifestyles. The authors concluded that when providers understood patient beliefs, they could initiate conversations that were meaningful to their asthma patients about their self-management. Respiratory status: Patency of airway, auscultation of the lungs, presence or absence of adventitious breath sounds, respiratory rate and depth Response to medications, oxygen therapy, hydration, bedrest Presence of complications: Respiratory failure, pneumonia To prevent asthma attacks, teach patients the triggers that can precipitate an attack. In rare instances, asthma can lead to respiratory failure if patients are not treated immediately or are unresponsive to treatment (status asthmaticus). Explain that any dyspnea unrelieved by medications and accompanied by wheezing and accessory muscle use needs prompt attention from a healthcare provider. Encourage patients to identify and avoid things that make their asthma worse and to keep track of their symptoms. The National Institutes of Health provides excellent information for patient and families about asthma: . Teach the patient and family the correct use of medications, including the dosage, route, action, and side effects. Provide instructions about the proper use of MDIs. Note that many patients use complementary and alternative medications (CAM) for asthma or do not use their prescribed dose of medication. Assess the patient's use of CAM therapy and discuss with him or her the long-term consequences. is a sample topic from the . To view other topics, please or .

Airway obstruction is generally managed with quick relief medications such as short-acting bronchodilators, systemic corticosteroids, and ipratropium (Atrovent). During severe exacerbations, patients may require IV fluid replacement. Unless contraindicated by a cardiac problem, 3,000 to 4,000 mL/day of fluid is usually administered intravenously, which helps loosen secretions and facilitates expectoration of the secretions. Low-flow oxygen therapy based on arterial blood gas results is often administered to treat hypoxemia. For the patient with increasing airway obstruction, endotracheal intubation and perhaps mechanical ventilation may be needed to maintain adequate airway and breathing. Close follow-up is needed when patients are discharged from the hospital because airway hyperactivity usually persists for 4 to 6 weeks after the event. To prevent symptoms, long-term control medications such as inhaled corticosteroids, inhaled cromolyn, long-acting bronchodilators, theophylline, leukotriene modifiers, and anti-IgE antibodies are used.

Cromolyn sodium decreases bronchospasm, but it is not effective for acute bronchospasms and is used as a preventive measure. Maintenance of airway, breathing, and circulation is the primary consideration during an acute attack. Patients should be on bedrest to minimize their oxygen consumption and to decrease the work of breathing. Note that patients usually assume a position to ease breathing; some patients breathe more easily while sitting in an upright position: Do not impose bedrest on a patient who can breathe only in another position. Ask questions that can be answered by nodding or a brief one-word answer so the patient can conserve energy for breathing. If the patient is a child, allow the parents to stay with the child during acute attacks. Have the parents identify a security item that reassures the child, such as a special blanket or toy, and keep the item with the child at all times. Reinforce coping strategies to the parents, and allow them to express any feelings of guilt and helplessness. For strategies to prevent future attacks, discuss triggers that can induce asthma attacks and ways to avoid them. If the attack is triggered by an allergen, explore with the patient or family the source and discuss possible strategies for eliminating it. Cold air and exercise may increase symptoms. Aspirin and NSAIDs can cause sudden, severe airway obstruction. Outline the signs and symptoms that require immediate attention. Instruct the patient to notify the physician should she or he develop a respiratory infection that could trigger an attack. Instruct patients regarding their medications, particularly MDIs, and the indications for use. It is important that the patient uses the bronchodilator MDIs first and then uses the steroid inhalers. Explain to patients on steroid inhalers the need to rinse their mouths out after using them to avoid getting thrush. George, M., Abboud, S., Pantalon, M., Sommers, M.S., Mao, J., & Rand, C. (2016).

The purpose of this study was to explore whether asthma patients' personal beliefs about inhaled corticosteroid use and integrative medical therapies are discussed at routine primary care visits for asthma. The authors used a qualitative analysis of transcripts from 33 recorded primary care visits. Four themes emerged from the analysis when providers were aware of patients' beliefs: negative beliefs about corticosteroid use, integrative medical therapy use for asthma, decision making, and health lifestyles.

ebf65c97-f4db-482b-8efd-eeb8dde6ec0a,"Type your tag names separated by a space and hit enter Bronchitis and Asthma With CC or Major CC Asthma is classified as an intermittent, reversible, obstructive disease of the lungs. It is a growing health problem in the United States, with approximately 25 million people affected. In the past 20 years, the number of children with asthma has increased markedly, and it is now the leading serious chronic illness in children. Unfortunately, approximately 75% of children with asthma continue to have chronic problems in adulthood. The total deaths annually from asthma have increased by over 100% since 1979 in the United States. Asthma is a disease of the airways characterized by airway inflammation and hyperreactivity (increased responsiveness to a wide variety of triggers). Hyperreactivity leads to airway obstruction due to acute onset of muscle spasm in the smooth muscle of the tracheobronchial tree, thereby leading to a narrowed lumen. In addition to muscle spasm, there is swelling of the mucosa, which leads to edema. Although asthma can result from infections (especially viral) and inhaled irritants, it often is the result of an allergic response. An allergen (antigen) is introduced to the body, and sensitizing antibodies such as immunoglobulin E (IgE) are formed. IgE antibodies bind to tissue mast cells and basophils in the mucosa of the bronchioles, lung tissue, and nasopharynx. An antigen-antibody reaction releases primary mediator substances such as histamine, slow-reacting substance of anaphylaxis (SRS-A), and others. These mediators cause contraction of the smooth muscle and tissue edema. In addition, goblet cells secrete a thick mucus into the airways that causes obstruction. Intrinsic asthma results from all other causes except allergies, such as infections (especially viral), inhaled irritants, and other causes or etiologies. The parasympathetic nervous system becomes stimulated, which increases bronchomotor tone, resulting in bronchoconstriction. In asthma, the total lung capacity (TLC), functional residual capacity (FRC), and residual volume (RV) increase, but the hallmark of airway obstruction is a reduction in ratio of the forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) to the forced vital capacity (FVC). Complications include pneumonia, atelectasis, respiratory failure with hypoxemia, and status asthmaticus (severe and refractory asthma). The classification for asthma is described in . Less than twice a week: Cough, wheeze, chest tightness, difficulty breathing Brief flare-ups with varying intensity; no symptoms between flare-ups Lung function tests: FEV1 ≥ 80% normal values; peak flow < 20% variability a.m. to a.m. or a.m. to p.m., day to day Three to six times a week: Cough, wheeze, chest tightness, difficulty breathing Lung function tests: FEV1 ≥ 80% normal values; peak flow < 20%–30% variability a.m. to a.m. or a.m. to p.m., day to day Daily: Cough, wheeze, chest tightness, difficulty breathing Lung function tests: FEV1 > 60% but < 80% normal values; peak flow > 30% variability a.m. to a.m. or a.m. to p.m., day to day Continual: Cough, wheeze, chest tightness, difficulty breathing Lung function tests: FEV1 ≤ 60% normal values; peak flow > 30% variability a.m. to a.m. or a.m. to p.m., day to day The main triggers for asthma are allergies, viral infections, autonomic nervous system imbalances that can cause an increase in parasympathetic stimulation, medications, psychological factors, and exercise. Of asthmatic conditions in patients under 30 years old, 70% are caused by allergies. Three major indoor allergens are dust mites, cockroaches, and cats. In older patients, the cause is almost always nonallergic types of irritants, such as smog. Heredity plays a part in about one-third of the cases. The genetic contributions to the development of asthma have been estimated at between 30% and 50% for various asthma phenotypes and up to 70% for overall IgE levels in plasma. Familial factors thus far appear to be autosomal dominant. There are at least 11 candidate genes that contribute to asthma susceptibility. These include , , , , , , , , , , and . Although the incidence of asthma is estimated at 5% to 10% in the general population, children have a higher incidence of 12%. Children make up one-third of the people with asthma; in the United States, 7 million children are affected, and trends suggest an increasing incidence of asthma in children under the age of 6 years. Asthma is diagnosed more frequently in males under 14 years and over 45 years of age and in females between the ages of 15 and 45. Black/African American children have higher morbidity and mortality rates than white children. Most experts agree that environmental factors play a more important role in asthma etiology than do genetic factors. Approximately 80% to 85% of childhood asthma episodes are associated with a prior exposure to a virus. Asthma prevalence varies widely across many nations, with a range from 1% to over 30% in children. Approximately 300 million people globally have asthma, and the prevalence increases by 50% every 10 years. Prevalence is high in developed countries in North America, Europe, and Australia and is increasing in developing countries as they become more industrialized. Examples include increases in South Africa, Eastern Europe, and the Baltic States. The greatest increases are seen in children. The more urbanization and affluence in a nation, the higher the prevalence. Because patients (especially children) with asthma have a history of allergies, obtain a thorough description of the response to allergens or other irritants. The patient may describe a sudden onset of symptoms after exposure, with a sense of suffocation. Symptoms include dyspnea, wheezing, and a cough (either dry or productive) and also chest tightness, restlessness, anxiety, and a prolonged expiratory phase. Ask if the patient has experienced a recent viral infection. Determine the speed of onset of symptoms, the number of asthma attacks in the past year, and the number of emergency department visits and hospitalizations from asthma in the past year. Children with an impending asthma attack may have been vomiting because of the tendency to swallow coughed up mucus rather than expectorating it. The most common symptoms are , , , and . The patient with an acute attack of asthma appears ill, with shortness of breath so severe that he or she can hardly speak. In acute airway obstruction, patients use their accessory muscles for breathing and are often profoundly diaphoretic. Some patients have an increased anteroposterior thoracic diameter. Children with asthma often prefer standing or sitting leaning forward to ease breathing. As airway obstruction becomes more serious, children may develop sternocleidomastoid contractions that indicate an increased expiratory effort, supraclavicular contractions that indicate an increased expiratory effort, and nasal flaring. If the patient has marked color changes such as pallor or cyanosis or becomes confused, restless, or lethargic, respiratory failure may be on the horizon. Percussion of the lungs usually produces hyperresonance, and palpation may reveal vocal fremitus. Auscultation reveals high-pitched inspiratory and expiratory wheezes, but with a major airway obstruction, breath sounds may be diminished. As the obstruction improves, breath sounds may actually worsen as they can be auscultated throughout the lung fields. During the most severe attacks of asthma, wheezing may be absent because of severe reduction of airflow, or its absence. Usually, the patient also has a prolonged expiratory phase of respiration. A rapid heart rate, mild systolic hypertension, and a paradoxic pulse may also be present. The emergency situation and an unfamiliar environment can aggravate the symptoms of the disease, especially if this is the patient's first experience with the condition. If the patient is a child and the parent is anxious, the child's level of anxiety increases and the attack may worsen. FVC: Maximum volume of air that can be forcefully expired after a maximal lung inspiration FEV1: Volume of air expired in 1 second from the beginning of the FVC maneuverAirway obstruction decreases flow rates; hospitalization is recommended if FVC is less than 1 L; FEV1/FVC should be 80% normally, but in asthma, it decreases to as low as 25% Forced expiratory flow (FEF): Maximal flow rate attained during the middle (25%–75%) of FVC maneuver RV: Volume of air remaining in lungs at end of a maximal expirationIncreased RV indicates obstruction; may remain increased for up to 3 weeks after the attack FRC: Volume of air remaining in lungs at end of a resting tidal volume Chest x-ray, high-resolution computed tomography (for chronic symptoms), skin testing, pulse oximetry, arterial blood gases, ECG, serum IgE.

Airway obstruction is generally managed with quick relief medications such as short-acting bronchodilators, systemic corticosteroids, and ipratropium (Atrovent). During severe exacerbations, patients may require IV fluid replacement. Unless contraindicated by a cardiac problem, 3,000 to 4,000 mL/day of fluid is usually administered intravenously, which helps loosen secretions and facilitates expectoration of the secretions. Low-flow oxygen therapy based on arterial blood gas results is often administered to treat hypoxemia. For the patient with increasing airway obstruction, endotracheal intubation and perhaps mechanical ventilation may be needed to maintain adequate airway and breathing. Close follow-up is needed when patients are discharged from the hospital because airway hyperactivity usually persists for 4 to 6 weeks after the event. To prevent symptoms, long-term control medications such as inhaled corticosteroids, inhaled cromolyn, long-acting bronchodilators, theophylline, leukotriene modifiers, and anti-IgE antibodies are used.

Cromolyn sodium decreases bronchospasm, but it is not effective for acute bronchospasms and is used as a preventive measure. Maintenance of airway, breathing, and circulation is the primary consideration during an acute attack. Patients should be on bedrest to minimize their oxygen consumption and to decrease the work of breathing. Note that patients usually assume a position to ease breathing; some patients breathe more easily while sitting in an upright position: Do not impose bedrest on a patient who can breathe only in another position. Ask questions that can be answered by nodding or a brief one-word answer so the patient can conserve energy for breathing. If the patient is a child, allow the parents to stay with the child during acute attacks.

6ee706ca-a86e-4318-97b4-522a5516e13d,"Type your tag names separated by a space and hit enter Bronchitis and Asthma With CC or Major CC Asthma is classified as an intermittent, reversible, obstructive disease of the lungs. It is a growing health problem in the United States, with approximately 25 million people affected. In the past 20 years, the number of children with asthma has increased markedly, and it is now the leading serious chronic illness in children. Unfortunately, approximately 75% of children with asthma continue to have chronic problems in adulthood. The total deaths annually from asthma have increased by over 100% since 1979 in the United States. Asthma is a disease of the airways characterized by airway inflammation and hyperreactivity (increased responsiveness to a wide variety of triggers). Hyperreactivity leads to airway obstruction due to acute onset of muscle spasm in the smooth muscle of the tracheobronchial tree, thereby leading to a narrowed lumen. In addition to muscle spasm, there is swelling of the mucosa, which leads to edema. Although asthma can result from infections (especially viral) and inhaled irritants, it often is the result of an allergic response. An allergen (antigen) is introduced to the body, and sensitizing antibodies such as immunoglobulin E (IgE) are formed. IgE antibodies bind to tissue mast cells and basophils in the mucosa of the bronchioles, lung tissue, and nasopharynx. An antigen-antibody reaction releases primary mediator substances such as histamine, slow-reacting substance of anaphylaxis (SRS-A), and others. These mediators cause contraction of the smooth muscle and tissue edema. In addition, goblet cells secrete a thick mucus into the airways that causes obstruction. Intrinsic asthma results from all other causes except allergies, such as infections (especially viral), inhaled irritants, and other causes or etiologies. The parasympathetic nervous system becomes stimulated, which increases bronchomotor tone, resulting in bronchoconstriction. In asthma, the total lung capacity (TLC), functional residual capacity (FRC), and residual volume (RV) increase, but the hallmark of airway obstruction is a reduction in ratio of the forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) to the forced vital capacity (FVC). Complications include pneumonia, atelectasis, respiratory failure with hypoxemia, and status asthmaticus (severe and refractory asthma). The classification for asthma is described in . Less than twice a week: Cough, wheeze, chest tightness, difficulty breathing Brief flare-ups with varying intensity; no symptoms between flare-ups Lung function tests: FEV1 ≥ 80% normal values; peak flow < 20% variability a.m. to a.m. or a.m. to p.m., day to day Three to six times a week: Cough, wheeze, chest tightness, difficulty breathing Lung function tests: FEV1 ≥ 80% normal values; peak flow < 20%–30% variability a.m. to a.m. or a.m. to p.m., day to day Daily: Cough, wheeze, chest tightness, difficulty breathing Lung function tests: FEV1 > 60% but < 80% normal values; peak flow > 30% variability a.m. to a.m. or a.m. to p.m., day to day Continual: Cough, wheeze, chest tightness, difficulty breathing Lung function tests: FEV1 ≤ 60% normal values; peak flow > 30% variability a.m. to a.m. or a.m. to p.m., day to day The main triggers for asthma are allergies, viral infections, autonomic nervous system imbalances that can cause an increase in parasympathetic stimulation, medications, psychological factors, and exercise. Of asthmatic conditions in patients under 30 years old, 70% are caused by allergies. Three major indoor allergens are dust mites, cockroaches, and cats. In older patients, the cause is almost always nonallergic types of irritants, such as smog. Heredity plays a part in about one-third of the cases. The genetic contributions to the development of asthma have been estimated at between 30% and 50% for various asthma phenotypes and up to 70% for overall IgE levels in plasma. Familial factors thus far appear to be autosomal dominant. There are at least 11 candidate genes that contribute to asthma susceptibility. These include , , , , , , , , , , and . Although the incidence of asthma is estimated at 5% to 10% in the general population, children have a higher incidence of 12%. Children make up one-third of the people with asthma; in the United States, 7 million children are affected, and trends suggest an increasing incidence of asthma in children under the age of 6 years. Asthma is diagnosed more frequently in males under 14 years and over 45 years of age and in females between the ages of 15 and 45. Black/African American children have higher morbidity and mortality rates than white children. Most experts agree that environmental factors play a more important role in asthma etiology than do genetic factors. Approximately 80% to 85% of childhood asthma episodes are associated with a prior exposure to a virus. Asthma prevalence varies widely across many nations, with a range from 1% to over 30% in children. Approximately 300 million people globally have asthma, and the prevalence increases by 50% every 10 years. Prevalence is high in developed countries in North America, Europe, and Australia and is increasing in developing countries as they become more industrialized. Examples include increases in South Africa, Eastern Europe, and the Baltic States. The greatest increases are seen in children. The more urbanization and affluence in a nation, the higher the prevalence. Because patients (especially children) with asthma have a history of allergies, obtain a thorough description of the response to allergens or other irritants. The patient may describe a sudden onset of symptoms after exposure, with a sense of suffocation. Symptoms include dyspnea, wheezing, and a cough (either dry or productive) and also chest tightness, restlessness, anxiety, and a prolonged expiratory phase. Ask if the patient has experienced a recent viral infection. Determine the speed of onset of symptoms, the number of asthma attacks in the past year, and the number of emergency department visits and hospitalizations from asthma in the past year. Children with an impending asthma attack may have been vomiting because of the tendency to swallow coughed up mucus rather than expectorating it. The most common symptoms are , , , and . The patient with an acute attack of asthma appears ill, with shortness of breath so severe that he or she can hardly speak. In acute airway obstruction, patients use their accessory muscles for breathing and are often profoundly diaphoretic. Some patients have an increased anteroposterior thoracic diameter. Children with asthma often prefer standing or sitting leaning forward to ease breathing. As airway obstruction becomes more serious, children may develop sternocleidomastoid contractions that indicate an increased expiratory effort, supraclavicular contractions that indicate an increased expiratory effort, and nasal flaring. If the patient has marked color changes such as pallor or cyanosis or becomes confused, restless, or lethargic, respiratory failure may be on the horizon. Percussion of the lungs usually produces hyperresonance, and palpation may reveal vocal fremitus. Auscultation reveals high-pitched inspiratory and expiratory wheezes, but with a major airway obstruction, breath sounds may be diminished. As the obstruction improves, breath sounds may actually worsen as they can be auscultated throughout the lung fields. During the most severe attacks of asthma, wheezing may be absent because of severe reduction of airflow, or its absence. Usually, the patient also has a prolonged expiratory phase of respiration. A rapid heart rate, mild systolic hypertension, and a paradoxic pulse may also be present. The emergency situation and an unfamiliar environment can aggravate the symptoms of the disease, especially if this is the patient's first experience with the condition. If the patient is a child and the parent is anxious, the child's level of anxiety increases and the attack may worsen. FVC: Maximum volume of air that can be forcefully expired after a maximal lung inspiration FEV1: Volume of air expired in 1 second from the beginning of the FVC maneuverAirway obstruction decreases flow rates; hospitalization is recommended if FVC is less than 1 L; FEV1/FVC should be 80% normally, but in asthma, it decreases to as low as 25% Forced expiratory flow (FEF): Maximal flow rate attained during the middle (25%–75%) of FVC maneuver RV: Volume of air remaining in lungs at end of a maximal expirationIncreased RV indicates obstruction; may remain increased for up to 3 weeks after the attack FRC: Volume of air remaining in lungs at end of a resting tidal volume Chest x-ray, high-resolution computed tomography (for chronic symptoms), skin testing, pulse oximetry, arterial blood gases, ECG, serum IgE.

87d51ab0-cd43-499d-945d-02fc63a1e43e,"Most kids and teens with asthma have symptoms when they exercise. But some people (including those who don't have asthma) have asthma symptoms during or after exercise. This is known as exercise-induced asthma (EIA) (also called exercise-induced bronchoconstriction, or EIB). Symptoms of exercise-induced asthma include wheezing, tightness or pain in the chest, coughing, and in some cases, lasting shortness of breath. get winded or tired easily during or after exercise cough after coming inside from being active outdoors not be able to run for more than a few minutes without stopping Kids with EIA often begin having symptoms 5–10 minutes after starting to exercise (though some kids only get them after they stop being active). Symptoms usually peak 5–10 minutes after stopping the activity and may take an hour or longer to end. Of course, there's a difference between someone with exercise-induced asthma and someone who's out of shape and winded. It takes much longer for someone with EIA to recover. And temperature extremes, especially cold weather, can make it even worse. Inhaling cold, dry air during exercise is thought to be the main cause of EIA symptoms. When kids exercise or play hard, they tend to breathe quickly, shallowly, and through the mouth. So the air reaching their lungs misses the warming and humidifying effects that happen when they breathe more slowly through the nose. The cool, dry air makes the airways in the lungs narrower, which blocks the flow of air and makes it harder to breathe. This is called . It's important to remember that staying fit and exercising regularly can actually help to reduce asthma symptoms. So kids and teens with asthma should exercise as much as they can. A doctor will ask about the family's asthma and allergy history and about the symptoms and what has triggered them in the past. After taking a and doing a physical exam, the doctor may ask your child to take a breathing test after exercising. This can be done in the office on a treadmill, after your child runs outside for 6 to 8 minutes, or after doing an activity that's triggered flare-ups in the past. Doctors sometimes recommend pretreatment for EIA. This means taking medicine before exercising or being very active. The medicine often is the same quick-relief medicine (also called rescue or fast-acting medicine) used during flare-ups. Taking it before exercise can help prevent the airway narrowing triggered by exercise. If pretreatment doesn't control symptoms, the doctor may recommend using long-term control medicine (also called controller or maintenance medicine). This asthma medicine is usually taken regularly over time to reduce airway inflammation. If your child still has breathing trouble during exercise, let the doctor know. The medicine dosages may need to be adjusted for better control. Exercise is a great idea for everyone, including kids with exercise-induced asthma. Besides keeping kids fit, exercise can improve lung function by strengthening the breathing muscles in the chest. Encourage your child to be active while also keeping asthma symptoms under control by following the asthma action plan. Ask your doctor which exercises, sports, and activities are safe for your child. These activities usually are OK for people with EIA: Endurance sports (long-distance running, cycling, etc.) and those requiring extended energy output (like soccer and basketball) can be more challenging. So can cold-weather sports, like cross-country skiing and ice hockey. But that doesn't mean kids can't play these sports if they enjoy them. In fact, many athletes with asthma have found that with proper training and medicine, they can do any sport they choose. For the most part, kids with exercise-induced asthma can do anything their peers can do. But be sure to follow the suggestions given by your child's doctor. If symptoms start, don't exercise until they stop. Warm up before exercise to prevent chest tightening. (Warm-up exercises can include 5–10 minutes of walking or any other light activity, plus stretching or flexibility exercises.) Take quick-relief medicine as close to the start of exercise as possible. Take brief rests during exercise and use quick-relief medicine, as prescribed, if symptoms start. Cool down after exercise to help slow the change of air temperature in the lungs. It's also best not to exercise outside during very cold weather. If your child plays outside when it's cold, wearing a ski mask or a scarf over the mouth and nose should help. If air pollution or pollen are triggers, your child may want to exercise indoors when air quality is poor or pollen counts are high. And kids shouldn't exercise when they have a or other upper respiratory infection. Kids should always have access to their quick-relief medicine. Keep extras on hand and be sure to check all supplies so your child isn't carrying an empty inhaler. Note: All information is for educational purposes only.

305e6fbb-58f9-4218-9630-dd9c440358ae,"New Treatments for Severe Asthma: What’s on the Horizon? — — Asthma is a disease in which the airways swell up and tighten, making it hard to catch your breath. Symptoms include: Symptoms can be more severe in some people and less so in others. You might only have symptoms at certain times — like when you exercise. Or you could have frequent asthma attacks that affect your quality of life. Asthma isn’t curable, but it is controllable. Today’s treatments are more effective than ever before at preventing asthma attacks — and at stopping symptoms if they do start. Yet of people with asthma don’t respond to standard treatments like inhaled corticosteroids. For those with severe and stubborn symptoms, a new generation of therapies — and certain treatments on the horizon — might finally offer some relief. provide long-term control medications to prevent symptoms before they start To control severe asthma, you may need to take higher doses of medications or use more than one drug. You and your doctor can create an asthma action plan to personalize your treatment strategy based on your symptoms and disease severity. The main treatment for severe asthma is long-term control medications that help prevent asthma symptoms. These include: Then you can take quick-relief medications when you have an asthma attack to relieve symptoms. These include: a combination of an inhaled short-acting anticholinergic and inhaled short-acting beta-agonist A few newer treatments have made severe asthma easier to control. Biologic drugs work with your immune system to treat asthma. They block the activity of immune system chemicals that make your airways swell up. These drugs can prevent you from getting asthma attacks and make the attacks you do have much milder. Four monoclonal antibodies are currently approved to treat severe asthma: Omalizumab treats severe asthma that’s triggered by allergies. Mepolizumab, reslizumab, and benralizumab treat severe asthma that’s caused by a type of white blood cell called an eosinophil (eosinophilic asthma). You take these drugs by injection or through an IV into a vein. New monoclonal antibodies such as tezepelumab are under investigation. This inhaled medication has been used to treat chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) for more than a decade. In 2015, the FDA also approved it for the treatment of asthma. show that tiotropium improves asthma control when added to high doses of inhaled corticosteroids plus short-acting beta-agonists. One group of asthma drugs works by blocking the action of leukotriene. This chemical tightens and narrows your airways during an allergy-induced asthma attack. Three leukotriene modifiers are approved to treat asthma: You take these medications by mouth to prevent or treat asthma attacks. Bronchial thermoplasty is a surgical technique used for severe asthma that hasn’t improved with other treatments. During this technique, radiofrequency energy is applied to the airway. The heat that’s generated destroys some of the smooth muscle lining the airway. This prevents the muscle from constricting and narrowing the opening. Bronchial thermoplasty is delivered in three sessions, each given three weeks apart. Although it isn’t a cure for asthma, shows it does reduce symptoms. Researchers are still searching for new drugs that will be able to prevent and relieve asthma symptoms. One drug that has generated a lot of excitement is Fevipiprant (QAW039). Though still in development, this experimental drug reduced symptoms and in people with allergic asthma that inhaled corticosteroids couldn’t control. If Fevipiprant is approved, it would be the first new oral asthma drug to be introduced in 20 years. Other studies are investigating the factors that play a role in asthma development. Identifying the triggers that set off asthma symptoms could one day enable researchers to stop those processes and prevent asthma before it starts. — — Albuterol is a rescue medication that people with asthma use to stop flare-ups.

Medical Author: Medical Editor: is a chronic (long-term, ongoing) inflammation of the breathing passages () of the . The inflammation irritates the , causing breathing problems. Most people with have sudden attacks or periods of bothersome or severe symptoms separated by periods of mild symptoms or no symptoms at all. is an inflammatory reaction that is triggered by external factors or specific situations. When a person with asthma is exposed to one of his or her triggers, the inflammation worsens and symptoms ensue. Occupational asthma is a breathing (respiratory) disease caused by exposure to a trigger in the workplace. A trigger is an external factor or condition in the body that causes the asthma to occur or worsen. The list of known triggers is long and varied. Occupational asthma can occur in almost any line of work or any work environment, including offices, stores, hospitals, and medical facilities. Triggers of asthma include contaminants in the air, such as smoke, chemicals, vapors (gases), fumes, dust, or other particles; respiratory infections, such as and (); allergens in the air, such as molds, animal dander, and pollen; extremes of temperature or humidity; and emotional excitement or . Aggravation of preexisting asthma: This is by far the most common type. Over time, with regular exposure, you develop hypersensitivity to the trigger. With this underlying asthma, continued exposure to the trigger causes attacks. Immunologic asthma is characterized by a delay in the onset of symptoms. Nonimmunologic asthma seems to occur after single or multiple exposures to irritant material. Mixed forms can include components of the three other mechanisms described above. Once the attack is triggered, the airways begin to swell and tighten (bronchospasm) and secrete large amounts of mucus. The swelling and extra mucus partially block, or obstruct, the airways. This makes it more difficult to push air out of your lungs (exhale). If this occurs for a period of time, the inflammation can result in abnormal airflow obstruction even when not having an attack. When lung function no longer returns to normal after years of chronic inflammation, asthma evolves into a new class of lung disease referred to as (). Asthma cannot be cured, but it can be controlled by medication. You have a better chance of controlling your asthma if it is diagnosed early and treatment begun right away. With proper treatment, you can have fewer and less severe attacks. Without treatment, you will have more frequent and more severe attacks. You can even die from a severe . Early recognition and avoidance of the asthma trigger is particularly important in occupational asthma. Because people spend so much time at work, they tend to have extensive exposure to their trigger by the time the cause of the symptoms is recognized as asthma. The more time you spend exposed to your trigger, the more likely you are to have permanent lung inflammation and airway hypersensitivity. Occupational asthma is the most common work-related lung disease in developed countries. In some people with asthma in the United States, the condition is at least partly related to their work. Asthma has two components: the underlying chronic inflammation and the periodic attacks. We do not know for certain what causes the underlying inflammation. What we do know is that the tendency to have asthma runs in families and that some people are born with the tendency. We do know what causes asthma attacks: exposure to a trigger. The attack is similar in many ways to an . An is a response by the body's immune system to an ""invader."" That invader can be a substance or anything that the body senses as ""different."" When the cells of the immune system sense an invader, they set off a series of reactions that help fight off the invader. It is this series of reactions that causes the production of mucus and bronchospasms. These responses cause the symptoms of an asthma attack. In occupational asthma, the trigger is a substance or condition in the workplace that causes asthma symptoms. Most of these substances and conditions are very common and are not normally considered hazardous. Although these substances and conditions can be encountered in almost any workplace, occupational asthma is most common in workers in the following industries and jobs: Triggers that are often associated with a delay in the onset of symptoms (latency period) come in two groups (characterized by the size of the molecules involved). These are either high molecular weight or low molecular weight agents. The high molecular weight agents tend to be proteins, and polysaccharides. Examples of these agents include a variety of enzymes (used in the baking and food industry), cereals (also seen in the baking industries), animal waste and shellfish (found in laboratory technicians, farmers, food processors), and latex (found in health-care workers). Low molecular agents often have a shorter onset of symptoms and usually do not include nasal and eye irritation. Some examples of these agents include anhydrides (often used in plastics, dyes, and epoxy), metals (used in refineries, electroplating, welding), diisocyanates (found in plastics, spray paints, foundries), specific wood dusts like red cedar (found in wood carvers, furniture makers, sawmill workers), and cleaning agents (found in maintenance workers health-care professionals). Not everyone exposed to these conditions will develop asthma. Some people are more susceptible to asthma than others. Also, exposure to some of these substances can produce chronic lung diseases other than asthma. Risk factors for occupational asthma include the following: If asthma is not treated, the airways gradually develop a pattern of overreacting, hence, the alternative term for asthma, reactive airways disease. Common, everyday conditions, such as smoke or air, may cause asthma symptoms. In fact, it is part of the normal human condition for a small degree of bronchospasm to occur when the airways are exposed to cold or dry air. Normally, the body's upper airway warms and moistens the air to prevent this from occurring. In most people with occupational asthma, the symptoms appear a short time after beginning work and subside after leaving work. Many have no symptoms or milder symptoms on days they do not work. The symptoms return when they return to work. In some, the symptoms worsen gradually over the work week, go away over the weekend, and return when the new work week starts. In others, the symptoms are slow to develop and may not be noticed until after leaving work for the day. This pattern makes it difficult to recognize a workplace trigger. In the later stages of the disease, after long-term regular exposure, symptoms may not go away after you leave the workplace. These are the most common symptoms of occupational asthma. Most people do not have all these symptoms. symptoms that occur at work but get better away from work also may be a sign of irritants in the air that could provoke asthma symptoms. The following symptoms could occur: If you have asthma symptoms at work that get better away from work, make an appointment with your health-care provider promptly. If you have occupational asthma, you should have an action plan worked out in advance with your health-care provider. This plan should include instructions on what to do when an asthma attack occurs, when to call the health-care provider, and when to go to a hospital emergency department. Although asthma is a reversible disease, and treatments are available, people can die from a severe asthma attack. If you are having an asthma attack and have severe shortness of breath or are unable to reach your health-care provider in a short period of time, you must go to the nearest hospital emergency department. Do not drive yourself to the hospital. Have a friend or family member drive. If you are alone, call 911 immediately for emergency medical transport. If you have had asthma symptoms and are seeking medical care afterward, your health-care provider will ask questions and perform tests to pinpoint the cause of the symptoms. Proper diagnosis is essential to ensure that the most appropriate treatment is given. Your health-care provider should confirm and document that you have asthma before beginning treatment. You should undergo breathing tests to determine the condition of your airways. Spirometry: The spirometer is a device that measures how much air you can exhale and how forcefully you can breathe out. Spirometry is a good way to see how much your breathing is impaired during an attack. This test must be done in the medical office; you may on a treadmill or stationary bicycle or perform the tests before and after using an inhaled medication. Peak flow meter: This is another way of measuring how forcefully you can breathe out during an attack. This device is small and portable and can be used ""in the field."" This device can be very helpful. It is inexpensive and monitoring can be done at various times of the day to help detect any patterns associated with the reactive airways process. These tests may be done at the workplace to determine how your airways react to the work environment. The tests are performed before you go to the workplace and then after you have been in the workplace for some time, and the results are compared. Many employers have a health worker at the workplace who can carry out these tests. The company's representative often will work with you and your health-care provider to determine what is causing your symptoms. The company should cooperate in evaluating workplace exposures as possible triggers of asthma. There is no blood test than can pinpoint the cause of asthma. Your blood may be checked for signs of an infection that might be contributing to the symptoms. In severe attacks, it may be necessary to sample blood from an artery to determine exactly how much oxygen and carbon dioxide are present in your body. A may also be taken. This is mostly to rule out other conditions that can cause similar symptoms. Asthma Pictures: Inflammatory Disorder of the Airways Treatment in occupational asthma depends on how severe the asthma is. Prevention is always the first choice of treatment. If your asthma is not very severe, prevention may be enough to avoid symptoms. For some people, just avoiding exposure to the trigger is possible and is enough to prevent symptoms; for others, a combination of avoiding the trigger and medication can prevent symptoms. People with severe occupational asthma may need to consider changing to a different job or a different line of work. To have as few medication side effects as possible Work with your health-care provider to develop an action plan. Follow your treatment plan closely to avoid asthma attacks. If you do have an asthma attack, the action plan will help you control the attack and make the decision about when to seek medical care. Since occupational asthma is a chronic disease, you will probably require treatment for a very long time, maybe even for the rest of your life. The best way to improve your condition and live your life on your terms is to learn all you can about your asthma and what you can do to make it better. Become a partner with your health-care provider and his or her support staff. Use the resources they can offer - information, education, and expertise - to help yourself. Follow the treatment recommendations of your health-care provider. Understand your treatment. If you are taking medication, know what each drug does and how it is used. Promptly report any changes or worsening of your symptoms. Report any side effects you are having with your medications. Precautions that may help reduce your chance of having an asthma attack include the following: Avoid the trigger. In many cases, this doesn't mean you have to quit your job or change your occupation, although you may want to consider that. Most employers will work with you to reduce or remove your exposure to the trigger in the workplace. If you should have an asthma attack, move to the next step of your action plan. Keep the following tips in mind: Take only the medications your health care provider has prescribed for your asthma. Take them as directed. If the medication is not working, do not take more than you have been directed to take. Overusing can be dangerous. Do not take medicine. These medicines do not help asthma and may cause unwanted side effects. Do not use nonprescription inhalers. These contain a very short-acting inhaler that may not last long enough to relieve an asthma attack and may cause unwanted side effects. These contain a very short-acting inhaler that may not last long enough to relieve an asthma attack and may cause unwanted side effects. (Bayer) and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, such as (), can cause asthma to worsen in certain individuals. These medications should not be taken without the advice of your health-care provider. Do not take any nonprescription preparations, herbs, or , even if they are completely ""natural,"" without talking to your health-care provider first. Some of these may have unwanted side effects or interfere with your medications. Be prepared to go on to the next step of your action plan if necessary. If you think your medication is not working, let your health-care provider know right away. The most important part of treating occupational asthma is avoiding the trigger. Most people assume that means quitting their job and changing their occupation, but this is not always the case. Many employers will work with you to reduce or stop your exposure. This may mean changing the way things are done in the workplace overall or it may mean providing extra protection for you. It may mean moving you to a different location in the workplace. Because acceptable solutions often can be found, many asthma specialists recommend not quitting your job until all possibilities have been exhausted. If your asthma is very severe or cannot be controlled in the workplace, however, you may have to leave your job right away. Once the diagnosis of asthma has been confirmed, you may be started on a regimen of medications. Asthma medications are of the following two types: Controller medications: These are for long-term control of persistent asthma. They help to keep airways open and reduce the inflammation in the lungs that underlies asthma attacks. You take these every day whether you are having symptoms or not. Rescue medications: These are for short-term control of asthma attacks. You take these only when you are having symptoms or are more likely to have an attack; for example, when you have an infection in your respiratory tract. Your treatment plan will also include the following: Awareness of your trigger and avoiding the trigger as much as possible Recommendations for coping with asthma in your daily life Regular follow-up visits to your health-care provider to monitor your condition, whether you are on medication or not Together, you and your health-care practitioner will develop an action plan for you in case of asthma attack. The action plan will include the following: What to do if the rescue medication does not work right away When to go directly to a hospital emergency department Your health-care practitioner may want you to use a peak flow meter regularly, at least at first, to monitor how being at work affects your airway. The peak flow meter is a simple, inexpensive device that measures how forcefully you are able to exhale. This is a good way to help you and your health-care provider assess the severity of your asthma. Ask your health-care practitioner or an assistant to show you how to use the peak flow meter. He or she should watch you use it until you can do it correctly. Keep a record of the results. Over time, your health-care practitioner may be able to use this record to improve your medications, reducing dose or side effects. Peak flow measures fall just before an asthma attack. If you use your peak flow meter regularly, you may be able to predict when you are going to have an attack. It can also be used to check your response to rescue medications. Controller medications are for long-term control of persistent asthma. They help to keep airways open and reduce the inflammation in the lungs that underlies asthma attacks. Controller medications include long-acting beta-agonists and anti-inflammatory medicines. Long-acting beta-antagonists: This class of drugs is chemically related to adrenaline, a hormone produced by the adrenal glands. Inhaled long-acting beta-agonists work to keep breathing passages open for 12 hours or longer. They relax the muscles of the breathing passages, dilating the passages and decreasing the resistance to exhaled airflow, making it easier to breathe. They also may help to reduce inflammation, but they have no effect on the underlying cause of the asthma attack. Side effects include rapid heartbeat and shakiness. (Serevent) and (Foradil) are long-acting beta-agonists. Anti-inflammatory medicines minimize the inflammation that underlies an acute asthma attack. Generally these medications do not help during an attack, but you should continue to take them during an attack. Inhaled corticosteroids are the main class of medications in this group. The inhaled act locally by concentrating their effects directly within the breathing passages, with very few side effects outside of the lungs. Beclomethasone (Vancenase, Beclovent), fluticasone (Flovent), (Pulmicort), and triamcinolone (Azmacort) are examples of inhaled corticosteroids. Other anti-inflammatory drugs used to treat asthma include oral steroids, leukotriene inhibitors, methylxanthines, and . For more information about these medications, see Asthma and Understanding Asthma Medications. Rescue medications are bronchodilators. They quickly open the airways closed off by swelling, bronchospasm, and mucus. These are taken after an asthma attack has already begun. These do not take the place of anti-inflammatory drugs. Do not stop taking your anti-inflammatory drug(s) during an asthma attack. Short-acting beta2-agonists are the most commonly used rescue medications. This class of drugs is chemically related to adrenaline, a hormone produced by the adrenal glands. Inhaled beta2-agonists work rapidly (within minutes) to open the breathing passages. They relax the muscles of the breathing passages, dilating the passages and decreasing the resistance to exhaled airflow, making it easier to breathe. They do not reduce inflammation and have no effect on the underlying cause of the asthma attack. Side effects include and shakiness. (, , ProAir) is the most frequently used beta2-agonist medication. Anticholinergics are another class of drugs useful as rescue medications during asthma attacks. Inhaled anticholinergic drugs open the breathing passages, similar to the action of the beta2-agonists. Inhaled anticholinergics take slightly longer than beta2-agonists to achieve their effect, but they last longer than the beta2-agonists. An anticholinergic drug is often used together with a beta2-agonist drug to produce a greater effect than either drug can achieve by itself. bromide (Atrovent) is the inhaled anticholinergic drug currently used as a rescue asthma medication. Tiotropium (), a long-acting anticholinergic, is now also being used as a maintenance medicine in more severe cases of asthma. Combination therapy which includes a long-acting beta2 agonist and inhaled corticosteroid available in a single inhaler is now commonly used in asthma (for example, Advair, , Dulera). Asthma is a long-term disease, but it can be managed. Your active involvement in treating this disease is vitally important. See your health-care practitioner regularly according to the recommended schedule. By following these steps, you can help minimize the frequency and severity of your asthma attacks. At your follow-up visits, your health-care practitioner will review how you have been doing. He or she will ask you about frequency and severity of attacks, use of rescue medications, and peak flow measurements. Lung functions tests will be done to see how your lungs are responding to your treatment. This is a good time to discuss medication side effects or any problems you are having with your treatment. Treatment in occupational asthma is focused on preventing or minimizing asthma attacks. The main strategy for doing this is reducing or stopping exposure to the trigger. Work with your employer to ""clean up"" the workplace. You or your health-care provider should be able to arrange for measurement of air quality in the workplace. Your employer should provide protective gear, such as masks or respirators, to avoid exposure to the trigger. Careless use or spills of respiratory irritants, inappropriate ventilation, and improper protective gear contribute to the occurrence of asthma in the workplace. These problems can be remedied. If these measures don't reduce your symptoms, talk to your employer about retraining for a different position that would not involve exposure to your trigger. Most people with occupational asthma are able to control their condition if they work together with a health-care provider and follow their treatment regimen carefully. People who do not seek medical care or do not follow an appropriate treatment plan are likely to experience worsening of their asthma and deterioration in their ability to function normally. Asthma is a disease that affects the breathing passages, or airways, of the lungs. Asthma is a chronic (ongoing, long-term) inflammatory disease that causes difficulty breathing. When an exacerbation or ""attack"" of asthma takes place, the inflammation in the airways causes the lining of the breathing passages to swell. This swelling narrows the diameter of the airway, eventually to a point where it is hard to exchange enough air to breathe comfortably. This is when coughing, wheezing, and the sensation of distress start. Medically reviewed by James E.

Does Asthma Increase Your Risk for Severe Coronavirus Symptoms? How to prepare for and deal with an asthma attack in the world of COVID-19. There is still a lot left to learn about the —not to mention about asthma and the coronavirus. One source of confusion for patients has been whether or not having asthma is a risk factor for more serious symptoms of COVID-19, if they do develop the infection. We don’t have a ton of research looking at patients with asthma and this particular new coronavirus. But experts tell us that those with asthma need to be aware that this virus, like other viral illnesses, may cause a flare in their asthma symptoms. And it’s very likely that those with asthma—especially severe or uncontrolled asthma—are more likely to develop severe COVID-19 symptoms if infected. Here’s what those with asthma need to know about their health risks right now and how to stay as safe and healthy as possible. Having COVID-19 may trigger asthma symptoms and asthma attacks. Asthma is a chronic condition in which your airways narrow, produce mucus, and swell with inflammation, the . While some people may notice some level of symptoms all the time, many people with asthma also suffer attacks in which their symptoms become much, much worse. During an asthma attack, you might cough a lot, wheeze, experience chest discomfort, and generally have trouble breathing. If the symptoms of an asthma attack don’t get better after using rescue medication (an inhaler) then you might need emergency medical care. And here’s the key: Asthma attacks like these are usually triggered by something else that causes inflammation, J. Allen Meadows, M.D., president of the American College of Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology, tells SELF. Essentially, the immune system overreacts to the trigger, leading to the excessive inflammation that causes the airways to narrow. Common asthma triggers include things like allergens, exercise, and illnesses like . So it makes sense that the coronavirus might also be a trigger for asthma. That alone makes the coronavirus an especially scary thought for those with asthma. But experts tell us that the overreactivity that’s characteristic of asthma may also lead to more severe symptoms of the infection, which can include asthma-like symptoms such as coughing, shortness of breath, and . Does having asthma make you high risk for COVID-19 complications? Because our understanding of the virus is still developing, there isn’t a ton of research about whether or not asthma is associated with worse outcomes from COVID-19, the illness caused by the coronavirus. In a published in recently, researchers looked at 140 patients infected with the novel coronavirus in Wuhan, China. They identified several underlying illnesses in many of the patients, including eosinopenia and lymphopenia (types of ). But asthma wasn’t one of those conditions, suggesting that having asthma doesn’t make it more likely that you’ll become infected. But what if you do become infected? So far, the data is limited but suggests that asthma isn’t a major risk factor for hospitalization. A recent published in looked at 201 patients in Wuhan with confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia. Of those, 66 patients had other comorbid chronic illnesses, including five with chronic lung illnesses. An even larger demographic of over 1,000 patients in the makes no mention of asthma or chronic lung diseases as potentially worrying underlying conditions. In a in The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice, the authors note that “there are relatively few data at this time to demonstrate a specific increased risk for COVID-19 from asthma, or an increased disease pathology in patients with asthma infected with [the new coronavirus].” However, they continue, this association could evolve. Ultimately, the authors recommend that those with asthma prioritize getting and keeping their asthma under control right now to help prevent a flare associated with the coronavirus. But even with limited research, experts tell us that asthma should be considered a high-risk condition based on what we know about it and how viral illnesses generally affect those with asthma. And, according to the (CDC), those with moderate to severe asthma may still be at a higher risk for developing severe COVID-19 symptoms if they do get infected. “You can think of the COVID-19 disease process as a major insult to the respiratory status,” Enid Rose Neptune, M.D., pulmonologist and associate professor of medicine at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, tells SELF. Most people who don’t have an underlying condition like asthma have a “tremendous amount of respiratory reserve,” she says, meaning their lungs can handle more stress. So even if they develop a serious condition like severe pneumonia or anaphylaxis, they are more likely to recover than those with chronic respiratory conditions. But “any disorder that reduces your respiratory or ventilatory reserve [including asthma] would make you at higher risk of having an adverse outcome if you happen to develop [a COVID-19] infection,” Dr. Neptune says. However, asthma can present in many, many different ways. It can be mild, moderate, or severe. It can be well controlled or uncontrolled. Someone can have many triggers or only a few, very specific triggers. Whether or not everyone with asthma—regardless of the individual’s specific symptoms—would have an equally increased risk for severe COVID-19 symptoms remains to be seen. So far, the biggest worry is for those who have severe or uncontrolled asthma, Dr. Meadows says. “People with mild asthma are at some risk, but certainly those with severe asthma are at a higher risk,” he says. “These people can land in the E.R. with a common cold.” Additionally, those who have frequent flare-ups or frequently need to increase their medication usage should be considered high-risk as well, Dr. Neptune says, which are signs that their asthma may not be well controlled. Unfortunately, if you have severe asthma you should consider yourself to be very high-risk for severe COVID-19 symptoms—even if it’s well-controlled. “We see asthmatics in our clinics that are on the correct medications, who know how to manage their disorder well, they monitor themselves very closely, they understand what their triggers are,” Dr. Neptune says. “In those cases one would like to assume they are protected from the worst outcomes with this pandemic, but unfortunately those are still people who are at higher risk of having adverse outcomes, being much more symptomatic, and needing more support in the event they have an infection.” We need to also pay attention to racial disparities in asthma. Additionally, we know that there is a distinct racial disparity when it comes to asthma prevalence and complications. People of color—particularly black people—have higher rates of prevalence, emergency department admission, and deaths related to asthma than white people, according to . This, unfortunately, mirrors the racial disparity we are beginning to see in for those infected with COVID-19. The disparities seen in asthma outcomes and COVID-19 outcomes “are very much in alignment,” Dr. Neptune says. “If you have an underlying respiratory or cardiorespiratory disorder and you're not getting optimal treatment, you're clearly going to have a much greater likelihood of becoming much more symptomatic and much more impaired if you develop a COVID-19 infection.” Although we don’t know the exact mechanisms underlying these differences, they likely stem from similar systemic issues. Asthma’s disproportionate burden on black and Puerto Rican individuals is , and it can be attributed to a variety of factors—from barriers to accessing care, to a lack of asthma education and management programs in certain communities, to socioeconomic and behavioral causes. Environmental injustice , one that may also lead to racial disparities in COVID-19 outcomes. Minority groups are more likely to live in areas with increased pollution than non-Hispanic whites are, and that pollution can , leading to higher rates of asthma and other health conditions. A (currently in preprint) conducted by researchers at Harvard University T.H. Chan School of Public Health found higher death rates from the new coronavirus in areas with higher levels of pollution. While this just shows a statistically significant link (not a cause-and-effect relationship), it underscores how certain communities are being disproportionately impacted by this virus. Ultimately, the goal for those with asthma is to be able to control their symptoms as much as possible at home without having to go to urgent care or the E.R. for treatment, Dr. Meadows explains. Avoiding this would help keep you safe from any illnesses you might be exposed to in the hospital and help reduce the burden on our health care system so it can continue to focus on treating the coronavirus pandemic. Some people do rely on the E.R. for their asthma care and those in minority groups are more likely to do so, . So this could be a significant factor in addressing the racial disparities in COVID-19 outcomes. Here’s how our experts suggest keeping yourself safe and healthy right now: We know that those with more severe asthma—even if it’s controlled—are most likely to have serious issues. But we don’t have enough information to tease out for sure whether or not those with mild symptoms are also at a higher risk right now, so even if your asthma is mild or well-controlled, Dr. Neptune recommends recognizing and “cloaking” yourself in your high-risk status. That will help reinforce the need for you to take other precautions, including sticking to social distancing guidelines and absolutely getting medical input if you develop any of the hallmark symptoms of COVID-19. If you’ve been diagnosed with asthma, you hopefully already have a in place. But if you don’t or you’re finding that your usual plan isn’t working as well as it used to, now is absolutely the time to check in with your doctor or asthma specialist—many of whom are taking telemedicine visits right now—to get on track. Continue taking your usual medications—including steroids. There has been some discussion about whether or not some steroid medications that are used to help control asthma symptoms are still safe to take. The issue stems from that corticosteroid medications, which work by dampening the immune system’s inflammatory response to infection, may make it harder for the body to fight a COVID-19 infection. But Dr. Meadows says the most important thing right now is to make sure your asthma stays controlled, even if that’s through the use of steroid medications. So keep taking your usual medications. And if you have any questions about specific medications, talk to your doctor about whether or not it’s okay for you to keep taking them. Consider getting a three-month supply of medications. If you can, Dr. Neptune recommends getting a three-month supply of your asthma medications rather than just getting them one month at a time. You may need to work with your doctor, pharmacist, or insurance company to get that sorted out, but it will be worth it to avoid the need to run out to pick up your prescription. It will also help you avoid the effects of a potential medication shortage that some areas of the country are already experiencing, she says. There is some worry that using nebulizers, devices that deliver medication as a vapor or mist that you can inhale, can actually . When you exhale what’s in your lungs, Dr. Neptune says, that raises the possibility of spreading droplets containing the virus. So if you think you may have COVID-19 or you’ve tested positive, consider using an inhaler instead if possible, she advises. But that doesn’t mean you can’t use a nebulizer if you really need it, Dr. Meadows says. It just means that you have to be careful to limit the number of people around you when you use these devices. Ideally, you should go out on a patio or into your garage to use them, he says. Like many health care providers right now, allergists, asthma specialists, and primary care providers are beginning to offer telemedicine visits. In addition to making sure your asthma is under control, these visits allow doctors to evaluate patients who may be experiencing a worsening of their symptoms before they , Dr. Meadows says, thus relieving some of the burden on the health care system and keeping those with asthma away from a potential exposure to the coronavirus. “If asthma is well controlled, everything will be better for everyone personally and societally,” he says. Also, if you haven’t checked in with your asthma specialist or primary care doctor recently, now is the time to do so, Dr. Neptune says. “They very likely have specific recommendations for what you’re supposed to do if you have a flare-up or in the event that you experience a new symptom,” she explains, recommending that everyone with asthma check in now even if they’re asymptomatic so they know exactly what to do if that changes. If you do experience a flare, it may be tempting to assume you know what’s going on and just deal with it on your own like you would any other flare-up. But you won’t necessarily be able to tell if it’s due to the coronavirus or another trigger, Dr. Neptune says. So it’s very important to check in with your doctor rather than trying to just wait it out and treat yourself. “The flare-up can be very similar to what you experience with [other triggers, especially viruses], but in this case you’re not going to manage that yourself,” she says. “If you’re developing a flare-up and you have underlying asthma in the COVID-19 universe we’re all living in now, you need to alert your health care provider and get information about testing for the virus and what you need to do in terms of next steps.” Here's How to Manage Asthma If You Usually Rely on the E.R. for Care What Needs to Happen to Fix Race-Based Asthma Health Disparities?

Most children with asthma have symptoms while they exercise or right after they exercise. Children with asthma symptoms only with exercise may have exercise-induced asthma. ​ The cause of asthma is unknown.

Asthma is also more common in children with allergies. However, some children with allergies do not have asthma and some children with asthma do not have allergies. Exposure to secondhand cigarette smoke ​or pollutants makes children more likely to develop asthma. The symptoms of asthma are caused by narrowing of the small bronchial tubes in the lung. The narrowing is caused by inflammation and swelling within these tubes and by spasm of the muscles in the bronchial walls. It is unknown why exercise causes airways to narrow. In general, exercise-induced asthma is most likely to occur with endurance exercise in cool, dry air. However, there are exceptions, including exercising in warm, humid air with a lot of pollutants or swimming in a poorly ventilated space with strong chlorine fumes. The first thing to do to prevent asthma symptoms with exercise is to make sure that the asthma unrelated to exercise is well controlled. For many children this means the regular use of and use of medicines before exercise. Ask your child's doctor about what medicine is best for your child and make sure your child learns the proper technique for using an inhaler. If the asthma is well controlled but your child still has problems during or after exercise, let your child's doctor know. Here are some other ways to help prevent exercise-induced asthma: When exercising in the cold, wrap a scarf or mask around the face to warm up and humidify the air. Avoid exercise in the early morning or try exercising inside. Increase fitness level (exercise-induced asthma symptoms improve as fitness improves). ​Do a short warm-up exercise before the main exercise session. If a child still has symptoms even with treatment, exercise should be stopped. Asthma can be life-threatening if the athlete tries to play through the symptoms. Once the symptoms are controlled, the child can return to exercise. Probably the most common situation that is mistaken for exercise-induced asthma is that a child is not in very good athletic shape.

Preventers are used daily to prevent asthma symptoms, whereas reliever medicines are used when necessary to relieve symptoms. Most are taken or ""puffers"". Some medications are in tablet form, including prednisone, which is usually only used to treat severe asthma flare-ups. You may need to use one or more asthma medications to manage your asthma. Asthma inhalers are hand-held portable devices that deliver medication to your lungs. Most asthma medications are taken using an inhaler (puffer) device. Relievers are fast-acting asthma medications. They provide quick relief from the symptoms of asthma – wheeze, chest tightness, cough and shortness of breath. Also called ‘bronchodilators’, relievers relax the airway muscles and open your airways, making it easier for you to breathe. They work within minutes, with the effects lasting for up to 4 hours. Anyone with asthma should always carry a reliever. Relievers usually come in a blue or grey inhaler (puffer) device. A well-known reliever is Ventolin (). Relievers can have side effects such as a fast heartbeat (), shaking hands and or nervousness. Preventers help to control asthma symptoms and prevent attacks. They reduce the inflammation (redness and swelling) in your airways, making them less sensitive. Many adults with asthma take a preventer - usually as an inhaler which delivers a low dose of corticosteroid to the lungs. Corticosteroid preventers are usually prescribed for an adult who: has had asthma symptoms twice or more in the last month has had a flare-up requiring an urgent visit to a GP or emergency department in the last 12 months Combination medications are preventers that also contain a second medication, a 'long-acting bronchodilator', as well as the corticosteroid. The long-acting bronchodilator helps to relax the tightened airway muscles, allowing the airways to open and more air to reach your lungs. Preventers take several days or even weeks to work (so they’re not for the quick relief of symptoms). To work properly, preventers need to be used every day, even when you have no symptoms. Preventers can have side effects such as , hoarse voice and . Most of the asthma medicines come in an inhaler (puffer) device. To help achieve the best control of your asthma, inhalers must be used properly. If you are using a puffer, you should always use a spacer – a plastic container with a mouthpiece or mask at one end – to ensure the asthma medication gets into your lungs. Other asthma medicines come in the form of a dry powder or fine spray that is only released when you breathe in. Sometimes, medicine can be breathed in as a vapour through a nebuliser. It is very important to follow your doctor’s or pharmacist’s advice on using these medicines. If you’re unsure of the correct inhaler technique, take a look at the 'How to' videos on , or ask your doctor or pharmacist for a demonstration. , , , Learn more here about the development and quality assurance of healthdirect content.

03605a41-0336-4560-8504-27c0d5203c02,"Manage asthma by staying organized. Here's help creating an adult asthma action plan. Maintaining good day-to-day asthma control is the key to keeping symptoms at bay and preventing asthma attacks. Using a written asthma action plan makes it easier for you to measure whether your asthma is under control — and it lets you know exactly what steps to take when it isn't. An asthma action plan is especially important if you have moderate to severe asthma or you've had a serious asthma attack in the past. Here's how to get started. Because asthma varies from person to person, you'll need to work with your doctor to develop a plan that's customized for you. Your action plan may include keeping a diary, and can help you: The plan will help you keep tabs on asthma signs and symptoms and record when your symptoms interfere with daily activities, such as work, exercise or sleep. You may also want to track how often you use a quick-acting inhaler, such as albuterol (ProAir HFA, Proventil HFA, Ventolin HFA, others), to ease symptoms. You may use a peak flow meter to track your asthma day to day. This simple hand-held device tests how well the lungs are working. Measurements that are lower than usual indicate that the lungs aren't working as well as they should be. This is often the first sign that asthma is getting worse. The action plan will give you a system for making sense of the information you record. Many asthma plans use a ""traffic light"" system of green, yellow and red zones that correspond to worsening symptoms. This system can help you quickly determine asthma severity and identify signs of an asthma attack. Some asthma plans use a symptoms questionnaire called the Asthma Control Test (ACT) to measure asthma severity over the past month. Your plan should say when you need to make medication adjustments based on the severity of your asthma symptoms. Asthma medications usually include long-term control medications, such as inhaled corticosteroids, and, as-needed, quick-acting medications, such as inhaled albuterol. Make sure you understand what medications to use when, how to use them and what to expect. Tracking symptoms daily and adjusting treatment accordingly improves asthma control and reduces the risk of having an asthma attack. But if symptoms do start to get worse quickly, follow the action plan's instructions for using quick-acting medications or other steps to get your symptoms under control. Some asthma attacks can't be managed at home. Use the action plan to recognize the signs of rapidly worsening asthma. If you use a peak flow meter, the action plan will also tell you when low peak flow readings signal that an asthma attack has become an emergency. The action plan may have a place for you to list your asthma triggers and notes on how to avoid them. These vary from person to person — examples include exercise, cold air, pollen, dust mites, mold, pet dander, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), respiratory infections and smoke, including secondhand tobacco smoke. Once you and your doctor have developed your asthma action plan, keep it handy in case you have an asthma flare-up. Share your plan with a family member or friend who can help you in case of an emergency. Keep a copy in your wallet or purse in case an asthma attack occurs away from home. List your doctor's phone number, emergency phone numbers and the location of the nearest emergency room on your asthma plan. Always carry a rescue inhaler with you as well. Keep a second one at home as backup. Work with your doctor to keep your asthma action plan current. Asthma changes over time, so your plan may need periodic adjustments. Review your asthma action plan at every doctor visit. Tell your doctor about any problems you're having sticking with the plan. These checkups are also a good time to double-check that you're tracking asthma symptoms accurately and using your medications properly. If you're following the action plan but symptoms still aren't under control, a treatment change may be needed. On the other hand, if your asthma is well-controlled all of the time, your doctor may be able to reduce the amount of medication you take. If you have any questions or you're simply concerned about your asthma signs and symptoms, call your doctor or schedule an appointment. Your doctor may recommend that you get a regular flu shot. Having asthma shouldn't limit activities, interrupt sleep or leave you constantly worrying about having an asthma attack. By carefully following a written plan, you can keep your asthma well-controlled — and minimize the disruptions it causes.

Both lung cancers and asthma can have symptoms of and shortness of breath; wheezing usually is associated with asthma, while and up blood is more associated with lung cancers. About 90% of lung cancers are associated with , while causes or triggers of asthma vary from individual to individual (for example, , chemical – induced asthma, and many others). The exact cause of asthma is not known. Many asthma attacks can self-resolve or resolve with medication (inhalers); lung cancers do not resolve and require extensive medical treatments and/or surgery. Severe lung cancers (especially those that metastasize or are stages III and IV) can be fatal. The main risk factor for developing lung is . In contrast, the risk factors for developing asthma include any (for example, or ) and genetic disposition (family members with asthma). Life expectancy is reduced in individuals with late-stage lung cancers. Depending upon the type of lung , about 15% may survive five or more years after diagnosis. Patients with mild to moderate asthma attacks, on the other hand, usually have a normal life expectancy with treatment. Lung cancer is a group of diseases characterized by abnormal growths (cancers) that started in the lungs. Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths in women and men both in the United States and throughout the world. Lung cancer has surpassed as the leading cause of cancer deaths in women for the past 25 years. In the United States, there are more deaths due to lung cancer than the number of deaths from and rectal, , and combined. If lung cancer is found at an early stage, at least half of such patients will be alive and free of recurrent cancer five years later. Once lung cancer has metastasized, that is, spread to other distant organs, the five-year overall survival is less than 5%. Cancer occurs when normal cells undergo a transformation that causes them to grow abnormally and multiply without control and potentially spread to other parts of the body. The cells form a mass or that differs from the surrounding tissues from which it arises. Cancers are also called tumors. Such tumors are dangerous because they take oxygen, nutrients, and space from healthy cells and because they invade and destroy or reduce the ability of normal tissues to function. Most lung tumors are malignant. This means that they invade and destroy the healthy tissues around them and can spread throughout the body. The lung is a bad place for a cancer to arise because it contains a very rich network of both blood vessels and lymphatic channels through which cancer cells can spread. The specific types of primary lung cancers are as follows: (an NSCLC) is the most common type of lung cancer, making up 30% to 40% of all cases. A subtype of adenocarcinoma is called bronchoalveolar cell , which creates a -like appearance on chest X-rays. (an NSCLC) is the second most common type of lung cancer, making up about 30% of all cases. Large cell cancer (another NSCLC) makes up 10% of all cases. Asthma is a disease that affects the breathing passages of the lungs (bronchioles). Asthma is caused by chronic (ongoing, long-term) inflammation of these passages. This makes the breathing tubes, or airways, of the person with asthma highly sensitive to various ""triggers."" When the inflammation is ""triggered"" by any number of external and internal factors, the walls of the passages swell, and the openings fill with mucus. Muscles within the breathing passages contract (bronchospasm), causing even further narrowing of the airways. This narrowing makes it difficult for air to be breathed out (exhaled) from the lungs. This resistance to exhaling leads to the typical symptoms of an . Because asthma causes resistance, or obstruction, to exhaled air, it is called an obstructive lung disease. The medical term for such lung conditions is or . COPD is actually a group of diseases that includes not only asthma but also and . Some people with asthma do not have COPD. These are the individuals whose lung function returns to normal when they are not having an attack. Others will have a process of lung remodeling from chronic, long-standing inflammation, usually untreated. This results in permanent abnormalities of their lung function with symptoms of obstructive lung disease occurring all the time. These people are categorized as having one of the class of diseases known as COPD. Like any other chronic disease, asthma is a condition you live with every day of your life. You can have an attack any time you are exposed to one of your triggers. Unlike other chronic obstructive lung diseases, asthma is reversible. Up to one-fourth of all people with lung cancer may have no symptoms when the cancer is diagnosed. These cancers usually are identified incidentally when a is performed for another reason. The majority of people, however, develop symptoms. The symptoms are due to direct effects of the , to effects of metastatic tumors in other parts of the body, or to disturbances of hormones, blood, or other systems caused by the cancer. Symptoms of primary lung cancers include , coughing up blood, chest pain, and shortness of breath. A new cough in a smoker or a former smoker should raise concern for lung cancer. A cough that does not go away or gets worse over time should be evaluated by a health care professional. Coughing up blood () occurs in a significant number of people who have lung cancer. Any amount of coughed-up blood is cause for concern. Chest pain is a symptom in about one-fourth of people with lung cancer. The pain is dull, aching, and persistent. Shortness of breath usually results from a blockage to the flow of air in part of the lung, collection of fluid around the lung (), or the spread of tumor throughout the lungs. Wheezing or may signal blockage or inflammation in the lungs that may go along with cancer. Repeated respiratory infections, such as or , can be a sign of lung cancer. Symptoms of metastatic lung tumors depend on the location and size. About 30% to 40% of people with lung cancer have some symptoms or signs of metastatic disease. Lung cancer most often spreads to the liver, the adrenal glands, the bones, and the brain. Metastatic lung cancer in the liver may cause a loss of appetite, feeling full early on while eating, and otherwise unexplained . Metastatic lung cancer in the adrenal glands also typically causes no symptoms. to the bones is most common with small cell cancers but also occurs with other lung cancer types. Lung cancer that has metastasized to the bone causes bone pain, usually in the backbone (vertebrae), the large bones of the thigh (the femurs), the pelvic bones, and the ribs. Lung cancer that spreads to the brain can cause difficulties with vision, weakness on one side of the body, and/or . Paraneoplastic syndromes are the remote, indirect effects of cancer not related to direct invasion of an organ by tumor cells. Often they are caused by chemicals released from the cancers. Symptoms include the following: Clubbing of fingers -- the depositing of extra tissue under the fingernails New bone formation -- along the lower legs or arms Increased risk of in the arms, legs, or lungs Degenerative conditions of the otherwise unexplained. When the breathing passages become irritated or infected, an attack is triggered. The attack may come on suddenly or develop slowly over several days or hours. The main symptoms that signal an attack are as follows: Symptoms may occur during the day or at night. If they happen at night, they may disturb your . Wheezing is the most common symptom of an asthma attack. Wheezing is a musical, whistling, or hissing sound with breathing. Wheezes are most often heard during exhalation, but they can occur during breathing in (inhaling). Not all asthmatics wheeze, and not all people who wheeze are asthmatics. Current guidelines for the care of people with asthma include classifying the severity of asthma symptoms, as follows: Mild intermittent: This includes attacks no more than twice a week and nighttime attacks no more than twice a month. Attacks last no more than a few hours to days. Severity of attacks varies, but there are no symptoms between attacks. Mild persistent: This includes attacks more than twice a week, but not every day, and nighttime symptoms more than twice a month. Attacks are sometimes severe enough to interrupt regular activities. Moderate persistent: This includes daily attacks and nighttime symptoms more than once a week. More severe attacks occur at least twice a week and may last for days. Attacks require daily use of quick-relief (rescue) medication and changes in daily activities. Severe persistent: This includes frequent severe attacks, continual daytime symptoms, and frequent nighttime symptoms. Symptoms require limits on daily activities. Just because a person has mild or moderate asthma does not mean that he or she cannot have a severe attack. The severity of asthma can change over time, either for better or for worse. is the most important cause of lung cancer. Research as far back as the 1950s clearly established this relationship. smoke contains more than 4,000 chemicals, many of which have been identified as causing cancer. A person who smokes more than one pack of cigarettes per day has a 20-25 times greater risk of developing lung cancer than someone who has never smoked. Once a person quits smoking, his or her risk for lung cancer gradually decreases. About 15 years after quitting, the risk for lung cancer decreases to the level of someone who never smoked. and pipe smoking increases the risk of lung cancer but not as much as smoking cigarettes. About 90% of lung cancers arise due to use. The risk of developing lung cancer is related to the following factors: How long a person has smoked (or had smoked before quitting) Other causes of lung cancer, including causes of lung cancer in nonsmokers, include the following: , or , presents another risk for lung cancer. An estimated 3,000 lung cancer deaths occur each year in the U.S. that are attributable to passive smoking. Air pollution from motor vehicles, factories, and other sources probably increase the risk for lung cancer, and many experts believe that prolonged exposure to polluted air is similar to prolonged exposure to passive smoking in terms of risk for developing lung cancer. Asbestos exposure increases the risk of lung cancer nine times. A combination of asbestos exposure and smoking raises the risk to as much as 50 times. Another cancer known as (a type of cancer of the inner lining of the chest cavity and the outer lining of the lung called the pleura, or of the lining of the abdominal cavity called the peritoneum) is also strongly associated with exposure to asbestos. Lung diseases, such as (TB) and (COPD), also create a risk for lung cancer. A person with COPD has a four to six times greater risk of lung cancer even when the effect of cigarette smoking is excluded. Radon exposure poses another risk. Radon is a byproduct of naturally occurring radium, which is a product of uranium. The risk for lung cancer increases with significant long-term exposure to radon, although no one knows the exact risk. An estimated 12% of lung cancer deaths are attributable to radon , or about 21,000 lung cancer-related deaths annually in the U.S. Radon gas is the second leading cause of lung cancer in the United States after cigarette smoking. As with asbestos exposure, smoking greatly increases the risk of lung cancer with radon exposure. Certain occupations where exposure to arsenic, chromium, nickel, aromatic hydrocarbons, and ethers occurs may increase the risk of lung cancer. A person who has had lung cancer is more likely to develop a second lung cancer than the average person is to develop a first lung cancer. What all people with asthma have in common is chronic airway inflammation and excessive airway sensitivity to various triggers. Research has focused on why some people develop asthma while others do not. Some people are born with the tendency to have asthma, while others are not. Scientists are trying to find the genes that cause this tendency. The environment you live in and the way you live partly determine whether you have asthma attacks. An asthma attack is a reaction to a trigger. It is similar in many ways to an . An is a response by the body's immune system to an ""invader."" When the cells of the immune system sense an invader, they set off a series of reactions that help fight off the invader. It is this series of reactions that results in inflammation of the lining of the air passages. This can result in a modification of the cell types lining these airways. More glandular-type cells develop, which can cause the production of mucus. This mucus, along with irritation to muscle receptors in the airways, can cause bronchospasm. These responses cause the symptoms of an asthma attack. In asthma, the ""invaders"" are the triggers listed below. Triggers vary among individuals. Because asthma is a type of allergic reaction, it is sometimes called reactive airway disease. Each person with asthma has his or her own unique set of triggers. Most triggers cause attacks in some people with asthma and not in others. Common triggers of asthma attacks include inhaling other respiratory irritants such as perfumes or cleaning products; breathing in -causing substances (allergens) such as molds, dust, or animal dander; an , such as a , , , or ; reflux of stomach acid known as , or ; . (In some, not all, women, asthma symptoms are closely tied to the .) hay (allergic rhinitis) and other (This is the single biggest risk factor.), (another type of affecting the skin), and genetic predisposition (a parent, brother, or sister also has asthma). Treatment decisions in lung cancer depend first on whether SCLC or NSCLC is present. Treatment also depends on tumor stage. In NSCLC, the performance status of the patient is a key determinant of the likelihood of benefit from treatment. Performance status compares the patient's functional status -- how well they are doing as compared to their pre-illness levels of day to day activity. Risk of side effects and complications increase and chance of benefit decreases with declining performance status. In SCLC, a rapid response to treatment occurs often enough to overcome this issue. The most commonly used treatments today for lung cancer involve surgery, therapy, , and targeted therapies. In SCLC (), patients with limited disease at presentation (disease confined to one lung and its regional ) are distinguished from those with extensive stage disease, which includes all cases not classified as limited. Limited stage disease, treated with radiation and chemotherapy (including prophylactic, or preventative, brain radiation therapy), will frequently have all evidence of disease disappear for a time and are said to enter remission. About 80% will relapse within 2 years, but as many as 10% to 15% may survive 5 or more years. In extensive stage SCLC, response to chemotherapy and palliative radiation occurs less frequently, and survival beyond 2 years is rare. Median survival is about 13 months. In NSCLC, , those patients deemed medically inoperable may be treated with curative intent with radiation therapy with 5-year survival in early stage disease from 10% to 25%. In advanced stage, inoperable stages IIIB and IV NSCLC, treatment remains non-curative, but palliative radiation therapy and chemotherapy can provide meaningful symptom improvement and prolongation of life as compared to only supportive care. The use of targeted therapies in NSCLC has been of increasing importance especially in adenocarcinoma of the lung. Agents with lower levels of toxicity and efficacy at least as good as chemotherapy have been identified which can be utilized in patients whose cancer cells show mutations in specific genes. In addition, the use of agents targeted to other features of lung cancer, such as tumor factors to recruit blood vessels to support their growth, have been developed and have proven advantageous in the palliative treatment of NSCLC. Side effects of radiation therapy vary with the area being treated, the dose being given, and the type of radiation technique and equipment being used. Side effects of chemotherapy again vary with the drug being given, the dose being used, and the patient's unique sensitivity to the type of chemotherapy selected. There are a wide variety of both chemotherapies and targeted agents that may be tried in these cases. Finally, preventive or , has been utilized in operable stages of NSCLC in an attempt to eradicate microscopic, hidden deposits of lung cancer that may have escaped prior to surgery, and remain undetectable for now but will cause relapse later if not killed. While not of proven use in stage I NSCLC, it does appear to be of potential benefit in stages II and IIIA disease. Surgery is the preferred treatment for patients with early stage NSCLC. Unfortunately, a majority of patients have advanced or metastatic disease and are not suitable candidates for surgery after completing their staging evaluation. People who have NSCLC that has not spread can tolerate surgery provided they have adequate lung function. A portion of a lobe, a full lobe, or an entire lung may be removed. The extent of removal depends on the size of the tumor, its location, and how far it has spread. Cure rates for small cancers at the edges of the lung are around 80%. Despite complete surgical removal, many patients with early stage cancer have a recurrence of the cancer and die from it either due to local recurrence, distant metastases, or both. Surgery is not widely used in SCLC. Because SCLC spreads widely and rapidly through the body, removing it all by surgery usually is impossible. An operation for lung cancer is major surgery. Many people experience pain, weakness, , and shortness of breath after surgery. Most have problems moving around, coughing, and breathing deeply. The recovery period can be several weeks or even months. Since asthma is a chronic disease, treatment goes on for a very long time. Some people have to stay on treatment for the rest of their lives. The best way to improve your condition and live your life on your terms is to learn all you can about your asthma and what you can do to make it better. Become a partner with your health-care provider and his or her support staff. Use the resources they can offer -- information, education, and expertise -- to help yourself. Become aware of your asthma triggers and do what you can to avoid them. Follow the treatment recommendations of your health-care provider. Understand your treatment. Know what each drug does and how it is used. Report any changes or worsening of your symptoms promptly. Report any side effects you are having with your medications. prevent attacks severe enough to require a visit to your provider or an emergency department or hospitalization; have as few side effects of medication as possible.

c544fae2-f1ba-42a0-a9ff-db451c9545cc,"— — Allergies and asthma are two of the most common chronic diseases in the United States. Asthma is a respiratory condition that causes the airway to narrow and makes breathing difficult. It affects. A wide range of factors can trigger symptoms for the Americans who live with indoor and outdoor allergies. What many people may not realize is that there is a link between the two conditions, which often occur together. If you experience either condition, you can benefit from learning about how they are related. Doing so will help you limit your exposure to triggers and treat your symptoms. Both allergies and asthma can cause respiratory symptoms, such as coughing and airway congestion. However, there are also symptoms unique to each disease. Allergies may cause: Asthma usually does not cause those symptoms. Instead, people with asthma more often experience: Many people experience one condition without the other, but allergies can either worsen asthma or trigger it. When these conditions are so closely related, it’s known as allergy-induced, or allergic, asthma. It is the most common type of asthma diagnosed in the United States. It affects . Many of the same substances that trigger allergies can also affect people with asthma. Pollen, spores, dust mites, and pet dander are examples of common allergens. When people with allergies come into contact with allergens, their immune systems attack the allergens the same way they would a bacteria or a virus. This often leads to watery eyes, runny nose, and coughing. It can also cause a flare-up of asthma symptoms. Therefore, it can be helpful for people with asthma to closely watch the pollen count, limit time spent outside on dry and windy days, and be mindful of other allergens that may induce an asthmatic reaction. Family history affects a person’s chances of developing allergies or asthma. If one or both parents have allergies, it’s much more likely that their children will have allergies. Having allergies such as hay fever increases your risk of developing asthma. Most treatments target either asthma or allergies. Some methods specifically treat symptoms related to allergic asthma. Montelukast (Singulair) is a medication primarily prescribed for asthma that can help with both allergy and asthma symptoms. It’s taken as a daily pill and helps to control your body’s immune reaction. Allergy shots work by introducing small amounts of the allergen into your body. This allows your immune system to build up tolerance. This approach is also called immunotherapy. It usually requires a series of regular injections over several years. The optimal number of years has not been determined, but most people receive injections for at least three years. Anti-immunoglobulin E (IgE) immunotherapy targets the chemical signals that cause the allergic reaction in the first place. It’s usually only recommended for people with moderate to severe persistent asthma, for whom standard therapy has not worked. An example of anti-IgE therapy is omalizumab (Xolair). It’s important to note that while there is a strong connection between allergies and asthma, there are many other possible asthma triggers to be aware of. Some of the most common nonallergenic triggers are cold air, exercise, and other respiratory infections. Many people with asthma have more than one trigger. It’s good to be aware of different triggers when you’re trying to manage your symptoms. The best defense against allergies and asthma is to pay attention to your own triggers, as they can change over time. By being informed, consulting with a physician, and taking steps to limit exposure, even people with both asthma and allergies can effectively manage both conditions. — — Finding the Right Specialist for Allergic Asthma - Learn the Difference Allergic Asthma and Your Lifestyle: Assess the Impact Allergic Asthma Attack: When Do You Need to Go to the Hospital?

Performed when your symptoms and spirometry do not convincingly diagnose asthmaMethacholine is an agent that, when inhaled, causes the airways to spasm (contract involuntarily) and narrow if asthma is present – to identify any allergies that trigger asthma symptoms. Skin tests and blood tests help in detecting allergens. How can my Asthma be treated? What is the treatment for Status Asthmaticus? The aim of asthma treatment is to avoid the substances that trigger your symptoms and control airway inflammation. There are two basic kinds of medication for treating asthma: – to prevent attacks. They control your symptoms. You must take them every day for them to work. They are administered orally or by inhalation. The most common and effective way to deliver asthma drugs to the lungs are. (MDI) and (Rotacaps) are the most widely used method. Have a warm drink or water after using MDI to get rid of unpleasant aftertaste of the medicine. Combination asthma inhalers contain two different medications: an inhaled steroid and a long-acting bronchodilator. They are popular due to their convenience. The medications last for at least 12 hours. If it is difficult to use small inhalers, your doctor may prescribe an , a breathing machine. The nebulizer changes asthma medications from a liquid to a mist which is more easily inhaled into the lungs. The asthma nebulizer with a mask is typically used for infants, small children and elderly adults. the most important treatment for most people with asthma, particularly the inhaled steroids. They prevent asthma attacks by reducing swelling and mucus production in the airways which cause the airways to be less sensitive and less likely to react to asthma triggers.E.g. Asmanex, Alvesco, Qvar AeroBid, Flovent, Pulmicort.For severe asthma (status asthmaticus), injections of drugs such as epinephrine and prednisone are often necessary. . Prednisone is the most potent and effective anti-inflammatory asthma medication available. – often combined with inhaled steroids for long-term control of asthma symptoms or when you have asthma symptoms daily despite treatment with a daily inhaled steroid alone. Long-acting bronchodilators are never used alone for long-term therapy. Other control drugs that may be used are (such as Singulair and Accolate), (Intal) or (Tilade), (Xolair), Aminophylline or theophylline (rarely used anymore). – for use during attacks. inhalers are used to quickly relieve the cough, wheeze, chest tightness, and shortness of breath caused by asthma Bronchodilators relieve the symptoms of asthma by dilating or widen the bronchial tubes. They should not be used daily in the treatment of asthma. The most commonly used short-acting bronchodilator is albuterol. A severe asthma attack () may not respond quickly to routine treatment with asthma inhalers. Continuous use of an asthma nebulizer and injections of drugs such as epinephrine and prednisone for asthma are often necessary. Other therapies may include terbutaline injections, magnesium sulfate (induces smooth muscle relaxation of the airways) and leukotriene inhibitors, which are anti-inflammatory drugs. During a severe asthma attack that does not respond to asthma drugs, a mechanical ventilator may be needed to assist the lungs and respiratory muscles. A facemask is applied or a breathing tube is inserted in the nose or mouth for this asthma treatment. These breathing aids are temporary and are removed once the attack has subsided and the lungs have recovered sufficiently to resume the work of breathing on their own. A short hospital stay in an intensive care unit may be necessary with an acute attack. Please do note that all of the above mentioned drugs require a prescription from your asthma doctor. Homeopathy aims at strengthening your immune system so that gradually you will need decreased asthma medication and eventually you may not need any.Some of the popular remedies are: : for spasmodic symptoms. Anxiety, sudden wheezing, difficulty breathing and a feeling of suffocation, which worsens if you move. : for chronic asthma. It is used if you are older and the attacks occur during midnight, when you are awakened with soreness and pain in the chest and heat in the head which improves with warmth.

34c51c85-7bb0-44d9-8b52-aef2ed73d28c,"Ask the Expert: 9 Tips for Perfecting Your Asthma Action Plan — 1. What tips do you have for identifying asthma triggers? Keeping an asthma diary, checking your peak flow measurements, and getting tested for allergies can help you identify triggers. An asthma diary can help you keep track of symptoms, as well as where you are or what you’re around when you experience symptoms. This can help you identify patterns and narrow down possible triggers. You can also measure your peak flow regularly and record the measurements in your asthma diary. This can help identify triggers that don’t cause symptoms immediately, but still narrow your airways. Lastly, allergens are a common asthma trigger, so ask your doctor about blood or skin tests to identify potential allergens. 2. How do I know if I need to switch my medication or increase the dose? you experience symptoms less than three days a week you wake up at night less than three times a month you use your short-term relief inhaler less than three times a week your symptoms don’t interfere with your normal activities You may need to switch your medication or increase the dose if you’re having symptoms or nighttime awakenings more frequently. Also, if you need to use your short-term relief inhaler more frequently or you’re having more difficulty performing your normal activities, talk to your doctor about modifying your treatment. 3. How can I be better prepared for an asthma attack? Develop an asthma action plan with your doctor so you can prepare for and prevent asthma attacks. An action plan documents steps to take and when to take them to keep your asthma from getting worse. symptoms or peak flow measurements that indicate your asthma is getting worse how to change the frequency or dose of your medications based on your symptoms or peak flow measurements when to seek urgent medical attention and what to do in an emergency you notice your lips or fingernails become bluish or gray You should also seek emergency care if your symptoms don’t improve within 15 to 20 minutes after using your short-term relief inhaler, or if they return again quickly. 5. What are some of the best ways to reduce the frequency of asthma attacks? The best ways to prevent asthma attacks include avoiding your known triggers and taking your asthma medications as prescribed. You should also develop an asthma action plan with your doctor if you haven’t already. This plan specifies your medications, as well as instructions for what to do routinely and when you have symptoms. Following your plan can keep your asthma under control and prevent it from getting worse. 6. Do you have any tips for remembering my action plan when I’m on the go? If you have a smartphone, you can take pictures of your asthma action plan. There are also asthma apps you can download on your phone that let you document your action plan. Share your action plan with your loved ones, and keep copies of the plan at home, at work, and in your car. 7. What tips do you have for tracking my asthma symptoms and triggers? The best tip is to use an asthma diary and write in it daily. You can download templates for asthma diaries from the internet, such as . If you prefer to use your smartphone, you can download asthma apps to help you track your symptoms and triggers. 8. How often should I update my asthma action plan? You should review your action plan with your doctor at least once a year and update it if needed. You’ll also need to update it whenever your asthma medications change. Other reasons to update your plan include any exacerbations that lead to an emergency room visit or if you notice a change in your usual asthma control. 9. What do the different “zones” mean in an action plan? The green zone is where you want to be. It means you’re not having any asthma symptoms and you should continue to use your daily controller medications prescribed by your doctor. The yellow zone means you’re having mild-to-moderate symptoms. The red zone means you’re having severe symptoms or an asthma flare-up. In both cases, you should follow the steps in your action plan. If you’re in the yellow zone, call your doctor. If you’re in the red zone, seek urgent medical attention if your symptoms don’t improve.

What happens during an acute exacerbation of asthma? Asthma is a chronic lung disease. It causes inflammation and narrowing of your airways. This can affect your airflow. The symptoms of asthma come and go. When symptoms flare up and get progressively worse, it can be called: Your airways become swollen during an acute exacerbation. Your muscles contract and your narrow. Breathing normally becomes more and more . Even if you’ve had exacerbations before and know what to do, it’s still a good idea to contact your doctor. An acute exacerbation of is serious and can even become life-threatening. That’s why it’s important to recognize the symptoms early and to take appropriate action. It’s important to develop an “asthma plan” for how to treat your symptoms. Work with your doctor to come up with a method for what to do when your symptoms flare up. What are the symptoms of an acute exacerbation of asthma? The vary. You may not have any symptoms between exacerbations. The symptoms can range from mild to . They may include: An exacerbation can pass quickly with or without medication. It can also last for many hours. The longer it goes on, the more likely it is to affect your ability to breathe. The signs and symptoms of an acute exacerbation or attack of asthma include: These signs and symptoms should be considered a medical emergency. Call your doctor immediately if any of them occur. Acute exacerbations can be by a variety of things. Some of the more common triggers are: It may be a combination of factors that set off the chain reaction. Since there are so many potential triggers, it’s not always possible to identify the exact cause. Anyone who has asthma is at risk of having an acute exacerbation. That risk is greater if you’ve had one before, especially if it was serious enough for an emergency room visit. Other risk factors include: having asthma exacerbations, or attacks, that come on suddenly having a , , or another respiratory infection One showed that women tend to have more asthma exacerbations than men. Also, African-American and Hispanic people with asthma are admitted to the hospital for exacerbations at a higher rate than Caucasians. If you’ve had an acute exacerbation before, you’ll probably recognize the symptoms. Your doctor will be able to make a quick diagnosis. If it’s your first acute exacerbation, your doctor will need to know your medical history, particularly your history of asthma. To make a proper diagnosis, your doctor will likely perform a and a test of your . There are several tests that may be used to see how well your lungs are working: A measures how fast you can exhale. To get a reading, you blow into a mouthpiece as hard as you can. You can also use a peak flow meter at home. Your doctor may also use a . This machine can measure how fast you’re able to breathe in and out. It also determines how much air your lungs can hold. To get these measurements, you have to breathe into a special hose that’s connected to a meter. This test involves breathing into a mouthpiece that measures the amount of nitric oxide in your breath. A high level means your bronchial tubes are inflamed. During a severe asthma attack, it may be necessary to check the in your blood. This can be done using a . A pulse oximeter is a small device that’s placed on the end of your finger. The test takes a few seconds to complete and can even be performed at home. Most of the time, asthma exacerbations can be managed or with a visit to your doctor. The asthma plan you developed with your doctor can help you manage your symptoms and acute attacks. However, acute exacerbations often result in a trip to the emergency room. Emergency treatment may include: inhaled beta-2 agonists, such as (ProAir HFA, Ventolin HFA) corticosteroids, such as fluticasone (Flovent Diskus, Flovent HFA) An acute exacerbation requires close monitoring. Your doctor may repeat diagnostic tests several times. You won’t be discharged until your lungs are functioning adequately. If your breathing continues to be labored, you may have to be admitted for a few days until you recover. You may need to take corticosteroids for several days following the exacerbation. Your doctor may also recommend follow-up care. Most people with asthma are able to manage symptoms and maintain a good quality of life. An acute exacerbation of asthma can be a life-threatening event. However, you should be able to resume your normal activities once it’s under control. Of course, you’ll want to avoid known triggers and follow your doctor’s advice for management of your asthma. If you have asthma, you should have an action plan in place. Work with your doctor to come up with a plan so you’ll know what to do when symptoms flare up. Is there any way to prevent an acute exacerbation of asthma? Make sure you have an adequate supply of your medications and follow instructions carefully. Tell your doctor if your medications aren’t working. The dosage can be adjusted or you can try another medication. The goal is to keep inflammation to a minimum. Remember that treating an asthma attack without delay is essential. Any delays could be life-threatening. Pay attention to symptoms if you have a or . Get medical help right away if you think you’re having an acute exacerbation. It’s not easy, but if you can identify triggers for your exacerbations, you can try to in the future. It’s important to learn how to manage your asthma. By keeping it under control as much as possible, you’ll lower the chances of having an acute exacerbation.

64cf97c0-ae0e-4373-ac55-b82e0d00b29c,"Prevalence of asthma symptoms, diagnosis, and treatment in 12–14 year old children across Great Britain (international study of asthma and allergies in childhood, ISAAC UK) Prevalence of asthma symptoms, diagnosis, and treatment in 12–14 year old children across Great Britain (international study of asthma and allergies in childhood, ISAAC UK) ; , , , , Department of Public Health Sciences, St George's Hospital Medical School, London SW17 0RE Highland Communities NHS Trust, Child Health Department, Royal Northern Infirmary, Inverness IV3 5SF Centre for Applied Public Health Medicine, Temple of Peace and Health, Cathays Park, Cardiff CF1 3NW Southampton General Hospital, Southampton S016 6YD To investigate variations in the prevalence of self reported symptoms, diagnosis, and treatment of asthma in 12–14 year old children. All pupils aged 12–14 years in a stratified cluster sample of 93 large mixed secondary schools in 1995. Self reported prevalence of symptoms, diagnosis, and treatment of asthma at four geographical levels. 27 507 questionnaires were completed (85.9% response rate). The national 12 month prevalence of any wheezing, speech limiting wheeze, four or more attacks of wheeze, and frequent night waking with wheeze was 33.3% (n=9155), 8.8% (2427), 9.6% (2634), and 3.7% (1023) respectively. The prevalence of ever having had a diagnosis of asthma was 20.9% (5736). In total, 19.8% (5438/27 507) of pupils reported treatment with anti-asthma drugs in the past year, but, of pupils reporting frequent nocturnal wheeze in the past year, 33.8% (342/1012) had no diagnosis of asthma and 38.6% (395/1023) denied receiving inhaler therapy. The 12 month prevalence of wheeze was highest in Scotland (36.7%, 1633/4444), but in England and Wales there was no discernible north-south or east-west gradient. Wheeze prevalence was slightly higher in non-metropolitan areas (35.0%, 6155/17 605) than in metropolitan areas (30.3%, 3000/9902). The prevalence of self reported asthma diagnosis and inhaler use showed no discernible national, regional, north-south, or east-west geographical pattern but was higher in non-metropolitan areas. Prevalence of self reported symptoms, diagnosis, and treatment of asthma was high among 12–14 year olds throughout Great Britain with little geographical or urban-rural variation. Underdiagnosis and undertreatment were substantial. We investigated the prevalence of self reported symptoms, diagnosis, and treatment of asthma in 12–14 year old children in Great Britain A third of subjects reported wheezing in the past year, and a fifth reported ever having had a diagnosis of asthma—higher prevalences than reported previously Prevalences of symptoms generally varied by a factor of 1.3 or less across Great Britain but, in contrast to previous reports, were significantly higher in Scotland than England and in non-metropolitan areas than metropolitan ones Asthma may still be undiagnosed and undertreated—4% of pupils reported having had a diagnosis of asthma but were still experiencing moderate or greater disruption of their lives, while 1-3.4% reported moderate to severe symptoms but were undiagnosed and untreated The limited geographical variation in prevalences of symptoms and diagnosis of asthma suggests that the causes of asthma are widely distributed in Great Britain and that factors which do vary geographically—such as climate, diet, and outdoor environment—are not the main determinants of prevalence. In Britain asthma is the commonest chronic childhood disease. Time trends show that the prevalence of childhood asthma and wheeze, however defined, has risen over the past few decades. The size of the increase varies, but cohort studies indicate a rise of 70% in the prevalence of wheezing illness at age 16 between 1974 and 1986. Despite speculation about which environmental and medical factors may account for this trend, the aetiology of asthma and wheeze remains unknown. The international study of asthma and allergies in childhood (ISAAC) has established a standardised methodology to compare the prevalence and severity of asthma and atopic diseases in children, both within and between countries. The study aims to describe the prevalence of these diseases and their symptoms, to provide a baseline for assessing future trends, and to identify whether there is sufficient variation in prevalence of symptoms to allow efficient testing of aetiological hypotheses either within or between countries. As part of this worldwide collaboration, we investigated geographical variations in the current prevalence and severity of asthma symptoms, diagnosis, and treatment across Great Britain. In accordance with the ISAAC protocol, we obtained secondary school lists from departments of education in England, Wales, and Scotland. School years 8–9 in England and Wales and S2-S3 in Scotland contained most 13–14 year old pupils. We prepared sampling frames of mixed sex, state schools with over 100 pupils in each school year for every county (region in Scotland) and for four randomly sampled districts from the six metropolitan counties—West Midlands, Merseyside, Greater Manchester, South Yorkshire, West Yorkshire, and Tyne and Wear. We also prepared separate sampling frames for Glasgow, Edinburgh, and eight randomly sampled inner and outer London boroughs. We randomly selected one school from each sampling frame and repeated this process until a school from each area agreed to participate (93 schools). We obtained approval for the study from each relevant local research ethics committee. In the selected schools all pupils in school years 8–9 or S2-S3 were eligible, including those aged 12. We sent an explanatory letter to the children's parents, with a reply slip to return if they did not wish their child to participate. Pupils completed their confidential, anonymous questionnaire, supervised by a researcher or teacher with scripted instructions and answers, and then sealed it in an envelope for collection. The questionnaire contained standard ISAAC questions for self completion about symptoms of wheeze and asthma, and these were supplemented by questions on coughs, colds, indoor environment, smoking, demography, and birthplace (see Appendix 1. for respiratory questions). We explored the geographical patterns of prevalence at four levels—national, metropolitan versus non-metropolitan areas, quadrants of England and Wales, and NHS regions of England (as identified in 1993). Metropolitan areas consisted of London, Glasgow, Edinburgh, and the six English metropolitan counties. Quadrants of England and Wales were identified by marking an east-west line at the latitude of the Wash and a north-south line extending from the Pennines southwards. We analysed the data using SAS, Clinstat, and StatXact statistics packages. In accordance with ISAAC policy, we included “missing” or inapplicable responses in denominators for univariate analyses but excluded them from subsequent bivariate analyses. We calculated prevalence figures and differences in prevalence using data at both individual level (χ test) and school level (Student's tests) to assess the effect of cluster sampling. The prevalence results and differences by age, sex, and birth abroad are based on individual level analyses, as cluster sampling had little effect. Cluster sampling had a greater impact on differences in prevalence between areas, however, which we therefore assessed by more conservative two sample tests on school level prevalences, unadjusted for school size. The shows the distribution of the schools across Great Britain. The response rate from schools (78.2%) and pupils (85.9%) did not differ significantly between areas (table ). The ratio of girls to boys was similar across areas, but respondents in Scotland were older than those in England and Wales, and in Scotland and non-metropolitan areas fewer children were born overseas. Location of the 93 schools that took part in study Response and characteristics of participants (values are numbers (percentages) unless stated otherwise There were few missing answers (table ), but there were some inconsistent ones. For example, 4% (1091/27 507) reported that they had experienced wheeze with or without colds in the past 12 months (responded yes to questions 9 or 10), but they had previously answered no to question 2, stating that they had not had any wheeze in the past 12 months. Much fewer showed inconsistency in their answers to questions 3–5 (1.9%, 520/27 507), 6 (1.2%, 336/27 507), and 7–8 (2.4%, 668/27 507) compared with question 2 and in their answer to question 2 compared with question 1(0.4%, 95/27 507). Prevalence figures were not adjusted for these inconsistencies. Geographical distribution of self reported wheeze and asthma in schoolchildren aged 12–14 years in Great Britain Cluster sampling had little impact on prevalence estimates but produced wider confidence intervals and fewer statistically significant tests. For example, the overall prevalence of wheeze in the past 12 months was 33.3% (9155/27 507) (95% confidence interval 32.7% to 33.8%) using individual level prevalences compared with 33.1% (n=93) (31.9% to 34.4%) using the mean school level prevalences. Nearly half of all respondents (49%) had ever experienced wheezing, and a third reported wheezing in the past 12 months (table ). This compares with one in five recalling a diagnosis of asthma at any time. Within the past 12 months 9.6% of all respondents had experienced four or more attacks of wheeze, 8.8% had speech limiting wheeze, and 3.7% had frequent nocturnal wheeze. One in 20 (5.1%) reported that wheeze symptoms interfered with their daily activities to a moderate or greater degree. Wheeze in the past 12 months was more common in pupils aged >13 (odds ratio 1.15 (95% confidence interval 1.09 to 1.22)) and in girls (1.14 (1.08 to 1.20)) and less common in pupils born outside Great Britain (0.66 (0.57 to 0.77)). Ever having had asthma, in contrast, did not vary with age (odds ratio for age >13 1.04 (0.98 to 1.11)) and was less common in girls (0.79 (0.75 to 0.84) and again less common in pupils born abroad (0.57 (0.47 to 0.68)). Most asthma symptoms and diagnosis of asthma showed a less than 1.3-fold variation from minimum to maximum at any geographical level. The prevalence of four or more attacks of wheeze in the past 12 months did vary across regions to a greater extent, from 7% to 11%. At a national level, Scotland had slightly higher levels of wheeze than England, differences that were often statistically significant (36.9% 32.3% for prevalence of wheeze in past 12 months, P<0.001). The higher prevalence persisted after adjusting for the older age of Scottish pupils. The prevalence of ever having had asthma did not differ between the two countries (P=0.75), but levels of cough or phlegm in the absence of colds were lower in Scotland than in England (table ). Non-metropolitan areas had higher prevalences of most wheeze symptoms and diagnosis of asthma than did metropolitan areas but lower prevalences of cough and phlegm in the absence of colds. These differences, though small, were significant (table ) and were not accounted for by differences in the distribution of pupils born outside Great Britain. There was no north-south or east-west geographical gradient in the prevalence of asthma symptoms or diagnosis within England and Wales. Table shows the percentage of pupils reporting wheeze symptoms who reported ever having a diagnosis of asthma. A diagnosis of asthma was reported by half of pupils reporting wheeze in the past 12 months and over three quarters of pupils who had wheeze causing a moderate or greater interference with daily activities. However, 33.8% (342/1012) of pupils reporting frequent nocturnal wheeze in the past 12 months had no diagnosis of asthma. Geographical distribution of self reported wheeze and cough in schoolchildren aged 12–14 years in Great Britain who reported ever having had a diagnosis of asthma Of the 5736 (21%) of pupils who had ever had asthma, 75.7% (4341) were symptomatic in the past 12 months, with 25.7% (1475) recalling speech limiting wheeze, 11.7% (670) having weekly disturbances of sleep by wheeze, and 18.5% (1058) experiencing moderate or greater interference with daily activities—3.9% (1058/27507) of the total sample. Overall, 19.8% (5438/27 507) of pupils had received drug treatment for wheezing and asthma in the past 12 months and 15.8% (4353) had used inhalers. About 75% (4259/5736) of pupils who had ever had a diagnosis of asthma had used an inhaler in the past 12 months (table ), but 38.6% (395/1023) of those who reported frequent nocturnal wheeze and 35.2% (927/2634) of those reporting four or more attacks of wheezing had not (1.4% and 3.4% of total sample respectively). Geographical distribution of self reported wheeze and cough in schoolchildren aged 12–14 years in Great Britain who reported using an inhaler within the past 12 months Levels of diagnosis of asthma (table ) and use of inhalers (table ) in symptomatic pupils were consistently higher in non-metropolitan areas, but variations between other geographical areas were less consistent. At a national level, Wales showed higher levels of asthma diagnosis and inhaler use in pupils with most wheeze symptoms but not those with symptoms of cough and phlegm. At a regional level, the proportion of pupils with any wheeze in the past 12 months who had used an inhaler in that time showed little variation, from 38.9% in North East and Yorkshire to 45% in East Anglia and Oxford. The prevalence of asthma symptoms (33.3% for wheezing in the past 12 months), ever having had a diagnosis of asthma (20.9%), and current use of an inhaler (15.8%) reported by 12–14 year old schoolchildren was high throughout Great Britain. The levels were higher than in previous studies in younger children or broader age groups based on parental reports. The levels were also slightly higher than those found in the 1991 ISAAC pilot study in 13–14 year olds in west Sussex, where the prevalence of wheezing in the previous 12 months was 29%. However, the geographical variation of most symptoms and diagnosis of asthma varied by a factor of 1.3 or less across Great Britain. This variation is small compared with the global variation, within which the British prevalences are among the highest. The ISAAC questionnaire has been tested and validated. Its validity and repeatability have been confirmed in relation to bronchial hyperreactivity and doctor diagnosed asthma and are similar to those of questionnaires for adults. In relation to clinically confirmed asthma, an Australian study found that consistent responses to the first two questions (any wheezing ever and any wheeze within the past 12 months) had a sensitivity of 85%, specificity of 91%, and positive and negative predictive values of 61% and 94% respectively. Within Great Britain, Scotland has a higher prevalence of wheeze symptoms but not of diagnosis of asthma than England; though the difference was small, it was significant. This contrasts with previous national studies, which found the lowest symptom prevalences in Scotland, but is consistent with levels found more recently in the Highlands and Aberdeen. The higher prevalence in Scotland is not explained by the older age of Scottish pupils. A non-response bias might have occurred, as Scotland had the lowest response rates at school level. However, these schools cited involvement in other studies as the reason for refusal, which was unrelated to our research question. Pupil response rates at the levels of region, quadrant, metropolitan area, and country were similar. Non-response bias could have resulted in an underestimate of prevalence if absence rates among children with asthma were higher and varied by region or area. The higher prevalence of both wheeze and diagnosis of asthma in non-metropolitan areas than in metropolitan areas, while significant, was also small. This is consistent with the findings of the only other nationwide survey to analyse prevalence in this way, but it does not preclude the existence of higher prevalence in inner urban areas as reported by the national study of health and growth. The higher prevalence of symptoms in non-metropolitan schools was not due to differences in response rates or the distribution of pupils born abroad, though questionnaire bias might have operated if there were differences in reading and language ability between the two areas. The lack of any regional variation of wheeze and asthma prevalence within England and Wales is consistent with previous national studies showing little variation at age 11 and in 5–17 year olds. Tables and indicate the potential unmet need for asthma treatment at various levels, including NHS regions: 4% of pupils reported having had a diagnosis of asthma but were still experiencing moderate or greater disruption of their lives, while a further 1-3.4%—that is, up to 6–7 pupils aged 12–14 at each large secondary school—reported moderate to severe symptoms but were undiagnosed and untreated. Symptomatic pupils were more likely to have had asthma diagnosed and treated with inhalers if they lived in non-metropolitan areas compared with metropolitan areas. In non-metropolitan areas three out of 10 pupils who had experienced four or more asthma attacks or weekly disturbance of sleep by wheeze over the past year were undiagnosed, compared with four out of 10 in metropolitan areas. This may reflect better quality of care in non-metropolitan areas. It remains a concern that, even allowing for misclassification by the questionnaire, a substantial proportion of adolescents with asthma symptoms that interfered with their daily lives were not treated for the disease. The lack of substantial geographical variation in prevalence of asthma symptoms in this age group suggests that the causes of asthma are already widely distributed in Great Britain. This makes it difficult to investigate causes by exploiting geographical variation, as epidemiological studies of disease aetiology require a distribution of exposures in the study base that lead to a varying distribution of disease. Furthermore, it suggests that factors which do vary geographically in Great Britain—such as climate, diet, and outdoor environment—are not the main determinants of prevalence. The lower prevalence of asthma symptoms in children born outside, but currently living in, Great Britain does suggest a role for the environment in early life, which could be investigated in new migrant populations. The causes of asthma may, however, be more readily identified by exploring the greater global variation, in which Great Britain shows some of the highest levels of asthma and wheeze.

2c1021fc-a1ea-4cb3-81c6-2487d45d934a,"Medically reviewed by — — If you have asthma, you may find that your symptoms are affected by the seasons. When the temperature dips, going outside can make breathing more of a chore. And exercising in the cold can bring on symptoms such as coughing and wheezing even faster. Here’s a look at what causes cold-induced asthma and how to prevent attacks during the winter months. What’s the connection between cold weather and asthma? When you have your airways () swell up and become inflamed in response to certain . Swollen airways are narrower and can’t take in as much air. That’s why people with asthma often have trouble catching their breath. Winter is an especially hard time for people with asthma. A found that hospital admissions for asthma increased during the winter months. And in the cold climate of the north of Finland, up to of people with asthma experienced shortness of breath when they exercised in cold weather. When you work out, your body needs more oxygen, so your breathing speeds up. Often, you breathe through your mouth to take in more air. While your nose has blood vessels that warm and humidify the air before it reaches your lungs, air that travels directly through your mouth remains cold and dry. Exercising outdoors in cold weather delivers cold air rapidly to your airways. It also appears to increase your likelihood of having an asthma attack. What is it about the cold air that triggers asthma symptoms? Cold air is hard on for several reasons. Your airways are lined with a thin layer of fluid. When you breathe in dry air, that fluid evaporates faster than it can be replaced. Dry airways become irritated and swollen, which worsens asthma symptoms. Cold air also causes your airways to produce a substance called histamine, which is the same chemical your body makes during an . Histamine triggers and other asthma symptoms. Your airways are also lined with a layer of protective mucus, which helps remove unhealthy particles. In cold weather, your body produces more mucus, but it’s thicker and stickier than normal. The extra mucus makes you more likely to catch a cold or other infection. You’re more likely to get sick or be indoors when it’s cold , , and other respiratory infections tend to circulate during the winter months. These infections are also known to set off asthma symptoms. Cold air can also drive you indoors, where , , and flourish. These allergens trigger asthma symptoms in some people. Make sure your asthma is under control before winter arrives. See your doctor to develop an asthma action plan and then take the your doctor prescribes. You may take medicine every day (for long-term control) or just when you need it (for quick relief). Long-term controller medicines are drugs you take every day to manage your asthma symptoms. They include: inhaled corticosteroids, such as fluticasone (Flovent Diskus, Flovent HFA) long-acting beta-agonists, such as salmeterol (Serevent Diskus) , such as (Singulair) Note: Long-acting beta-agonists are always used alongside inhaled corticosteroids. Quick-relief medicines are drugs that you only take when you need them, such as before exercising in the cold. Short-acting bronchodilators and are examples of these drugs. To , try to stay indoors when the temperature dips very low, especially if it’s below 10°F (-12.2°C). If you do have to go outside, cover your nose and mouth with a scarf to warm the air before you breathe it in. Drink extra fluids in the winter. This can keep the mucus in your lungs thinner and therefore easier for your body to remove. Vacuum and dust your home often to remove indoor allergens. Wash your sheets and blankets every week in hot water to get rid of dust mites. Here are some ways to prevent asthma attacks when you exercise outdoors in cold weather: Use your inhaler 15 to 30 minutes before you exercise. This opens up your airways so you can breathe easier. Carry an inhaler with you in case you have an asthma attack. Warm up for at least 10 to 15 minutes before you work out. Wear a mask or scarf over your face to warm the air you breathe in. Cold is just one of many asthma triggers. Other things that can set off your symptoms include: such as , mold, dust mites, and animal dander You know you’re having an asthma attack because of symptoms such as: What can you do if you’re having an asthma attack? If you start to wheeze or feel short of breath, refer to the asthma action plan you wrote up with your doctor. If your symptoms are so that you can’t speak, take your quick-acting medicine and . You may need to stay under observation until your breathing stabilizes. Here are some other general guidelines for what to do if you have an asthma attack: Take two to six puffs from a quick-acting rescue inhaler. The medicine should open up your airways and help you breathe easier. You may also be able to use a instead of an inhaler. A nebulizer is a machine that turns your medicine into a fine mist that you breathe in. If your symptoms aren’t severe but they don’t improve with the first few puffs from your inhaler, wait 20 minutes and then take another dose. Once you feel better, call your doctor. You may need to keep taking your quick-acting medicine every few hours for a day or two. Your asthma attack should subside once you’ve come in out of the cold and taken your medicine. If your symptoms don’t improve or they seem to get worse whenever you’re out in the cold, you may need to see your doctor to review your asthma action plan. They may recommend changing medicines or coming up with other strategies for managing your condition.

ABSTRACT: Cardiac asthma is a condition secondary to heart failure that is marked by dyspnea, wheezing, cough, frothy or bloody sputum, and rales. These symptoms usually occur at night and are more prevalent in the elderly population. Because its symptoms are similar to those of bronchial asthma, cardiac asthma is often misdiagnosed. However, an accurate diagnosis is imperative because treatments for the two conditions differ, and incorrect treatment can exacerbate cardiac asthma. IV furosemide, nitroglycerin, and morphine are used for the acute treatment of cardiac asthma. If the patient is hypoxic, supplemental oxygen also may be used. Outpatient medication regimens focus on treating heart failure. In 1833, the physician James Hope coined the term to describe the inadequate oxygenation of blood and the sensation of wanting breath resulting from it. Since then, cardiac asthma has been better defined, but there is still much confusion surrounding its diagnosis. In fact, cardiac asthma is commonly mistaken for bronchial asthma since both conditions have similar symptoms and timing. However, the primary mechanisms that cause these symptoms are dissimilar. By focusing on the subtle differences in symptoms and test results, providers can more easily differentiate the disorders. Cardiac asthma involves paroxysms of dyspnea (breathlessness) and wheezing that often occur during the night as a result of congestion in the lungs secondary to heart failure (HF). In bronchial asthma, symptoms are due to an inflammatory process, rather than a cardiac process. It is important to correctly identify the etiology of the patient’s symptoms because treatment differs for these disorders, and incorrect treatment of cardiac asthma may exacerbate the condition. Since cardiac asthma and bronchial asthma have differing etiologies, it is pertinent to discuss epidemiological differences because the disease processes dictate the populations most affected. It makes sense that HF would be more prevalent in the elderly, given the disease progression. The American Heart Association’s 2011 update reported that HF has an incidence of 10 per 1,000 population in people older than 65 years, and the incidence of new HF events is at least 15 per 1,000. The incidence of new HF events can exceed 65 per 1,000 population in people older than 85 years, supporting a direct relationship between HF and age. Prevalence rates of HF in patients aged 20 to 30 years and those aged 80 years and older (0.3% and 11.5%, respectively) also support this relationship. The incidence and prevalence of cardiac asthma are unclear, owing to insufficient data from published studies. In a 2007 study, the incidence of cardiac asthma in elderly patients was 35%, versus the 10% to 15% incidence seen in younger patients in earlier studies. Trends noted in the cardiac asthma group (in the 2007 study) were increased use of tobacco products and diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. One factor not considered in this study was whether the wheezing was cardiac or pulmonary in origin, a distinction that could affect incidence results. Asthma is more prevalent in children than in adults. According to the 2009 CDC National Health Statistics report, 9.6% of children and 7.7% of adults had asthma. Boys were found to have a higher prevalence than girls, whereas in adulthood the opposite was true. In patients aged 85 years, asthma prevalence was approximately 5% in both men and women. The epidemiological differences between cardiac asthma and bronchial asthma reveal that cardiac asthma is more likely to occur in an older adult population, whereas bronchial asthma is more likely in children. Nevertheless, more research is necessary to clarify the incidence and prevalence of cardiac asthma. In congestive heart failure (CHF), the heart’s inability to pump blood out of the left ventricle results in excess fluid in the pulmonary circulation. Pulmonary congestion is the consequence of fluid being pushed into the alveolar lumen. Cardiac asthma may be associated with bronchiolar pathology, rather than simply the accumulation of alveolar fluid. Not only does the presence of fluid in the lungs make breathing difficult, it can cause asthmalike symptoms as well. The wheezing experienced by CHF patients may be due to a narrowing or obstruction of the bronchioles rather than simply to pulmonary congestion. Various studies have identified bronchial hyperreactivity as the mechanism behind cardiac asthma. Patients in these studies inhaled either acetylcholine or methacholine (cholinergic agonists). Compared with patients without cardiac asthma symptoms, those with symptoms demonstrated greater airway narrowing in response to the inhaled drug. The mechanism by which this narrowing occurs is not fully understood. Another study suggested that downregulation of beta receptors resulting from excessive adrenergic stimulation might cause bronchoconstriction in HF patients. Either mechanism is detrimental and undesirable in patients already experiencing pulmonary congestion. Cardiac asthma may be better attributed to bronchial anatomy. The bronchial blood supply involves a separate vascular system from that which supplies the alveoli. Similar to the mechanism of fluid buildup in the alveoli, the blood supply to the bronchioles may exhibit fluid buildup. Two hypotheses exist regarding the pathophysiology behind this: theory A and theory B (). Theory A hypothesizes that an increase in blood flow to the bronchial circulation may produce edema in the interstitial space, thereby squeezing the bronchiolar lumen. Conversely, theory B posits that certain pathological changes in HF, including pulmonary edema (PE), may compete for interthoracic space, compressing the entire airway structure and the bronchiole wall. The pathologic cause of cardiac asthma is not definitively explained. Reflex bronchoconstriction involving the vagus nerve has been suggested. Increased pulmonary vascular pressure may stimulate afferent nerve endings, causing reflex narrowing of large and small airways. Reflex bronchoconstriction, in addition to edema and hyperreactivity, can exponentially reduce breathing capability in CHF patients. The pathophysiology of cardiac asthma may incorporate a combination of mechanisms, creating a number of treatment challenges. The absence of inflammation is the major difference between cardiac asthma and bronchial asthma, even though the symptoms are similar. As noted earlier, cardiac asthma involves symptoms of airflow obstruction that are due to HF. In most cases, the clinical presentation includes severe dyspnea, cough, frothy or watery sputum, and rales, but the most significant symptom indicative of cardiac asthma is wheezing. These symptoms are more prevalent in elderly patients. Cardiac asthma often is characterized by abrupt waking from sleep caused by sudden, severe episodes of dyspnea. In a typical attack, the symptoms generally subside after the patient sits upright for 20 to 30 minutes, after which he or she may be able to return to bed without needing medication. In severe cases, the patient may experience recurrent episodes in a single night and have cyanosis (blue or purple discoloration of the skin), cold sweats, blood-tinged sputum, and fluid buildup in the lungs. Cardiac asthma is difficult to diagnose because its symptoms are similar to those of bronchial asthma. compares symptoms and diagnosing strategies for asthma, HF, and cardiac asthma. There are a few subtle differences between cardiac asthma and true asthma. Asthma often is triggered by allergens or some other precipitating factor (), and symptoms tend to worsen at night; cardiac asthma attacks occur almost exclusively at night when the patient is lying in bed. Because of preexisting heart disease, cardiac asthma patients usually have an enlarged heart (cardiomegaly) that can be seen upon chest x-ray, whereas asthma patients have a normal-sized heart. Severe cardiac asthma typically involves PE, which causes dyspnea, coughing, and wheezing. Unlike asthma, however, cardiac asthma responds poorly to bronchodilators. Another distinction between the two disorders is circulation time (how long it takes for blood to flow from one part of the body to another). In the past, circulation time typically was measured by injecting sodium dehydrocholate into an arm vein and measuring how long it took to produce a bitter taste on the tongue (arm-to-tongue circulation). However, this test’s unreliability caused it to be replaced by other techniques, including radionuclide angiocardiography, CT, and MRI. Circulation time is believed to be prolonged in HF patients; therefore, measurement may provide crucial information for differentiating between pulmonary and cardiac disorders. Since cardiac asthma stems from a heart problem, it can be difficult to distinguish its symptoms from those of HF. The three cardinal symptoms of HF are dyspnea, fatigue, and fluid retention; the presence of wheezing is diagnostic of cardiac asthma. Chronic HF often is associated with decreased forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV); however, in one study, cardiac asthma patients (defined as having CHF and wheezing) exhibited lower FEV values than patients with CHF alone. Chest x-ray is useful for confirming the presence of pulmonary congestion as well as for identifying cardiomegaly, which also indicates a heart disorder. Cardiomegaly often occurs in cardiac asthma patients, but not to the same degree as in strictly HF patients. Physical examination and lung auscultation may reveal rales, which are attributable to PE, but the best way to diagnose HF is to obtain a two-dimensional echocardiogram with Doppler, which can identify structural abnormalities and reduced ejection fraction (EF). Currently, no well-defined treatment plans exist for cardiac asthma in the acute or chronic setting. Discussions of cardiac asthma management target the pathophysiology of the underlying condition (i.e., PE and HF). The use and efficacy of bronchodilators such as albuterol and ipratropium, which are used to relieve symptoms of bronchial asthma, have not been established in cardiac asthma. Traditional medications used in the acute treatment of cardiac asthma include furosemide, morphine, and nitrates (). Supplemental oxygen, noninvasive ventilation (NIV), and proper positioning of the patient also are important. Each treatment has a unique benefit and may work synergistically with other treatments. Because patients presenting with an acute episode of cardiac asthma usually are hypoxic, the initial use of oxygen and/or NIV is recommended and has been shown to decrease mortality. If the patient shows no signs of hypoxia, oxygen and NIV are not recommended. As mentioned previously, a patient who awakens at night with dyspnea may alleviate symptoms by remaining awake for 20 to 30 minutes. Proper positioning, in which the patient stands erect or sits upright with feet hanging off the side of the bed, will result in decreased venous return. The amount of blood to the bronchioles is thereby lessened, interstitial-space edema is reduced, and the squeezing effect of the bronchiolar lumen described in theory A is diminished. Patients experiencing an acute cardiac asthma episode likely will require fluid removal. In such cases, gradual diuresis using a loop diuretic is warranted. Furosemide, which acts at the ascending portion of the loop of Henle and at the distal tubule, inhibits the reabsorption of sodium and chloride and causes diuresis. This improves symptoms by reducing preload in the heart. Symptomatic improvement in patients with pulmonary congestion is seen with an initial recommended furosemide dosage of 40 mg IV. The dose may be increased based on clinical response but must remain gradual to avoid hypotension, electrolyte disturbances, gout exacerbations, hearing loss (reversible), and worsening renal function. Some patients may exhibit persistent pulmonary congestion despite aggressive diuresis. In these instances, an IV nitrate (e.g., nitroglycerin) may be used adjunctively in both hypertensive and normotensive patients. Acting as a venodilator, nitroglycerin will lessen the pressure in the left ventricle, thereby reducing pulmonary congestion. Nitroglycerin should be started at a dosage of 5 mcg/min; it may be titrated to 200 mcg/min. Nitroglycerin dosing beyond 200 mcg/min is not recommended, and the patient requiring it should be considered a nonresponder. Some side effects associated with nitroglycerin use are hypotension, headache, and abdominal pain. IV morphine ameliorates symptoms in patients with pulmonary congestion. Morphine used in the setting of cardiac asthma enables easier breathing and reduces a patient’s anxiety level during the episode. The mechanism by which easier breathing occurs is believed to involve venodilation and reduction in preload. The morphine dosage commonly used is 1 to 3 mg IV every 5 minutes until relief occurs without inducing respiratory depression. Once the acute cardiac asthma episode is resolved, HF therapy should be initiated or optimized to prevent future occurrences. The use of ACE inhibitors and beta-blockers in HF patients is recommended to decrease morbidity and mortality rates. The continuance of diuretics postepisode will help maintain a normal volume status in this patient population and prevent future cardiac asthma occurrences. Digoxin, although not shown to reduce mortality, may be used to improve congestive symptoms in patients with HF. Additional information about chronic HF management, including anticoagulation, amiodarone use, alternative treatments, dosing, and so on, may be found in current HF practice guidelines. The incidence of cardiac asthma will likely increase as knowledge about diagnosis and treatment improves. Current management of cardiac asthma focuses on controlling the underlying HF and PE. Recognition of cardiac asthma and recommendations concerning appropriate treatment can greatly reduce disease occurrence and significantly improve the patient’s quality of life. Pharmacists can make a significant impact on the diagnosis and progression of this little-known disease. Counseling patients who are at risk for cardiac asthma and who present with related issues will enhance proper diagnosis. Pharmacists familiar with treatment options and optimization of therapy for concomitant diseases can better manage their patients’ symptoms, improve quality of life, and help slow the progression of this disorder. 1.

7d2e12ab-d7dd-4c85-9d08-15fe55e0dc31,"Allergic Asthma Attack: When Do You Need to Go to the Hospital? Medically reviewed by — — Asthma attacks can be life-threatening. If you have allergic asthma, it means that your symptoms are triggered by exposure to certain allergens, such as pollen, pet dander, or tobacco smoke. Read on to learn about the symptoms of a severe asthma attack, basic first-aid steps, and when you need to go to the hospital. When to go to the hospital for an allergic asthma attack The first step in treating an allergic asthma attack is to use a rescue inhaler or other rescue medication. You should also move away from any source of allergens that might be triggering the attack. If symptoms don’t improve after using rescue medications, or you have severe symptoms, call for emergency medical help. In the United States, that means dialing 911 to call for an ambulance. Severe asthma attacks share many symptoms with mild to moderate asthma attacks. The key difference is that the symptoms of a severe allergic asthma attack don’t improve after taking rescue medication. You might wonder how you can tell the difference between symptoms of a severe attack that requires emergency treatment versus a mild attack that you can treat on your own. Always seek emergency medical attention if your rescue medication doesn’t seem to be working. You should go to the hospital if you notice any of these symptoms: intense shortness of breath and difficulty speaking If you use a peak flow meter — a device that measures your peak airflow — you should go to the hospital if your readings are low and aren’t improving. In a life-threatening asthma attack, a coughing or wheezing symptom may disappear as the attack worsens. If you can’t speak a full sentence or you experience other breathing difficulties, seek medical attention. If your symptoms respond quickly to your rescue medication, and you can walk and talk comfortably, you may not need to go to the hospital. What to do during a severe allergic asthma attack Everyone who lives with allergic asthma can help protect their health by learning the basics of asthma first-aid. A good preventive step is to create an asthma action plan with your doctor. Here’s an example to create an asthma action plan, provided by the American Lung Association. An asthma action plan can help you be prepared if your symptoms flare up. If you’re having an allergic asthma attack, address your symptoms right away. If your symptoms are mild, take your quick-relief medication. You should feel better after 20 to 60 minutes. If you get worse or don’t improve, then you should get help now. Call for emergency medical help and take these steps while you wait for help to arrive. As soon as you notice symptoms of an asthma attack, such as wheezing or chest tightness, take your rescue inhaler. Pay attention to whether you may have been exposed to allergens that trigger your asthma, such as pets or cigarette smoke. Move away from any source of allergens. It’s risky to be alone if you’re having an asthma attack. Let someone in your immediate area know what’s happening. Ask them to stay with you until your symptoms improve or emergency help arrives. During an asthma attack, it’s best to be in an upright posture. Don’t lie down. It also helps to try to stay calm, since panic may worsen your symptoms. Try to take slow, steady breaths. If your symptoms are severe, use your rescue medication while you wait for help. Follow the instructions that your doctor or pharmacist provided for using your rescue medication in an emergency. The maximum dosage will vary based on the medication. Don’t hesitate to call for emergency help if you’re experiencing asthma symptoms. An asthma attack can worsen quickly, especially in children. Allergic asthma attacks are triggered by exposure to allergens. The symptoms can sometimes be confused with anaphylaxis, another potentially life-threatening condition. Anaphylaxis is a severe allergic reaction to allergens such as: shortness of breath, wheezing, and difficulty breathing or talking Developing these symptoms after you’re exposed to an allergen usually suggests anaphylaxis, according to the . If you’re unsure if you’re having a severe allergic asthma attack or anaphylaxis and you have injectable epinephrine with you, take it. Dial 911 to call for an ambulance immediately. Epinephrine will help alleviate the symptoms of both allergic asthma and anaphylaxis until you can get to the hospital. Severe allergic asthma attacks and anaphylaxis can be fatal, so it’s important to seek care at the first sign of symptoms. Treatment at the hospital for an allergic asthma attack If you’re admitted to a hospital emergency room with an allergic asthma attack, the most common treatments may include: short-acting beta-agonists, the same medications used in a rescue inhaler oral, inhaled, or injected corticosteroids to reduce inflammation in the lungs and airways intubation to help pump oxygen into the lungs in severe cases Even after your symptoms stabilize, your doctor may want to observe you for several hours to ensure there isn’t a subsequent asthma attack. Recovery from a severe allergic asthma attack can take anywhere from a few hours to several days. It depends on the severity of the attack. If there was damage to the lungs, ongoing treatment may be needed. Most cases of allergic asthma are triggered by inhaled allergens. For example, the most common triggers are: Less commonly, some foods and medications can trigger asthma symptoms, including: You can manage allergic asthma and help prevent asthma attacks by avoiding triggers and taking your medication as prescribed. If you’re still experiencing symptoms on a regular basis, talk to your doctor. You may need a change to your treatment plan or more guidance about avoiding triggers. Sticking to your treatment plan can help prevent your asthma symptoms from worsening. If you’re taking multiple treatments but still experiencing symptoms, you may need more help managing your condition. Asthma is considered severe when it’s uncontrolled or only partially controlled, even if the person takes multiple treatments, such as inhaled corticosteroids, oral corticosteroids, or inhaled beta-agonists. A number of factors may contribute to asthma symptoms worsening, including: chronic inflammation of the upper respiratory tract If you have severe allergic asthma, your doctor may recommend a combination of prescription medications, complementary therapies, and lifestyle changes. These options may help you manage the condition more effectively. A severe allergic asthma attack can be life-threatening. It’s important to seek emergency help as soon as your symptoms start. If you’re experiencing asthma symptoms on a regular basis, your doctor may suggest making a change to your treatment plan to help you better manage your condition.

The intensity, duration, and recurrence of the symptoms vary from person to person. Even in the same person, the symptoms may vary from episode to episode. Some people with asthma may have extended symptom-free periods, interrupted by periodic asthma episodes, while others may have some symptoms every day. Very often some people with asthma have symptoms only during exercise, or when they are exposed to allergens or viral respiratory tract infections. Wheezing. It is a whistling sound when you breathe. Based on symptoms, asthma is divided into four levels of severity are:  you have episodes of asthma symptoms twice a week or less, between episodes, however, you have no symptoms and your lung function is normal.  you have asthma symptoms more than twice a week, but no more than once in a single day. You are bothered by symptoms at night more than twice a month.  you have asthma symptoms every day, and you are bothered by nighttime symptoms more than once a week.  you have symptoms throughout the day on most days, and you are bothered by symptoms more often at night or early morning.

(PIN: 41120) visited our Life Force’s Pimpri branch for the treatment of Asthma on 10th September 2019. His complaints started in 2017 when he was 5 years old. The child was suffering from severe asthma associated with difficulty in b..... I started homeopathic treatment for Asthma because I was not getting any relief with allopathic treatment which I had taken right since the beginning of my Asthma 4 years back. After taking homoeopathy for about 7-8 months there has been significant improvement in the Asthma. I don't get the attacks of cough and wheezing as often as before and I am off all the allopathic medication at present. It does not worry me anymore that when I may get another attack of Asthma. I'm glad I found homeopathy at the right time to rescue me from Asthma. Vignesh had been diagnosed as having Asthmatic bronchitis and he would require nebulisation and antibiotics to control the attacks. But after starting homoeopathic treatment, his attacks of Asthma have been under good control and he did not require nebulisation anymore. It's been more than a year now that he has not had any acute attack of Asthma and he is doing very well. Even his tendency to develop recurrent colds is much better now. Thanks to homeopathy and Dr Shah's treatment for Asthma, he can now lead a normal life. Kewal had Asthmatic Bronchitis for 8 years (since the age of 2 years) and he was constantly on inhalers and other allopathic medication. Inspite of this he would get episodes of breathlessness and cough almost everyday. He would be well for barely 15 days in 6 months. It was very disturbing to see such a small child suffering like this with Asthma, inspite of giving him all the possible treatment. Then we were suggested to go in for homeopathic treatment by one of our family friends. 6 months of homeopathic treatment at Dr Shah's Lifeforce Center and we were so surprised by his response to the homeopathic treatment. He was completely off all the inhalers and allopathic treatment and was leading an almost normal life. Gradually his immunity improved and he would not get these attacks of cough and wheezing as before. We are indeed very grateful that we found the right kind of treatment for Asthma at the right time. Asthma treatment was very good. Compared to what I had come here with, my condition today is very good. When I came here, I had lots of problem in breathing - asthma and now I feel I am breathing like a normal person. I feel the air around me now. The homeopathic medicines have cured me of Asthma. I had Asthma for last 10 years and was constantly wheezing inspite of being on high dosage of allopathic medicines and inhalers round the clock. The least exertion would trigger off a severe attack of breathlessness that I would dread. I had tried all other kinds of treatment for Asthma but nothing would relieve me. Then finally on the advise of one friend of mine, I opted for Dr Shah's homeopathic treatment. It was really surprising that I felt better with homeopathic treatment, for the first time in so many years. My cough and wheezing had settled to the minimum and the dosage of inhalers was also gradually reduced. This was the first time in so many years that I was able to be on a reduced dose of inhalers and was able to stop the other allopathic medicines. Now the attacks of Asthma are not as frequent and as severe as before and I am able to lead a near-normal life again, thanks to homeopathy. Role of Homeopathy for Asthma in Children Explained by Dr Shah Homeopathy treats the diseases at a root-level so the results are long-lasting. Homeopathy is one of the most rational sciences with respect to its concepts of health, disease, and cure. Homeopathy originated in Germany in 1796 and is very popular in most of the European countries. Homeopathy treats the diseases at a root-level so the results are long-lasting.

b08dc715-2a0b-4f58-a9aa-affe2906774a,"Triggers are the things to which your airways are very sensitive — things that cause irritation or allergic reactions. These same things may not even bother other people. Contact with triggers can cause reactions that may intensify enough to set off an asthma attack when symptoms flare up. These triggers can cause you to react when the carpet is vacuumed, when you are around pets, or even when you go from a warm room into cold air. One of the best ways to understand how triggers work is to think of a line of dominoes. Imagine that the dominoes are upright, in line, quiet, and still. This domino line is similar to airways with asthma. The same way that airways with asthma are more reactive, these dominoes are not steady and can be easily tipped with even the slightest bump. Triggers set off reactions. They are like the bump that starts the cascade of dominoes knocking each other over. The type and amount of triggers that cause a reaction in the airways are different for everyone with asthma. Triggers start an all-or-nothing effect. One trigger exposure can irritate airways and activate symptoms. The next trigger exposure causes symptoms to get even worse, and so on. Just like when one domino falls, the next one is knocked over, and it continues down the line. Quick-relief medicines help stop the domino effect and put the dominoes back up in line. In other words, they can stop the tightening that causes symptoms to flare up. To keep your domino line from being knocked over, you want to avoid triggers to prevent even the very first domino from falling. Follow your doctor's treatment plan and take your control medicines that help stabilize your airways. Identify and avoid triggers. The best way to avoid problems with triggers is to identify irritants, allergens, and conditions that cause asthma symptoms and take steps to avoid or minimize exposure to them. After a flare-up of asthma symptoms or an asthma attack, think about possible triggers and make a plan to avoid or reduce contact with these triggers. Take medicine as directed. Another important way to prevent asthma attacks is to use long-term control medicines, as recommended by your doctor, to make your airways less reactive. Knowing your triggers is important to controlling your asthma and avoiding asthma attacks. Triggers and symptoms have a cause-and-effect relationship. Asthma symptoms increase in response to specific triggers. When you find a pattern to your symptoms, you can begin to identify and learn more about your triggers. Many people with asthma also have allergies. Allergy symptoms are caused by an immune system reaction to things that do not affect people without allergies. Examples of an allergic reaction are skin rash, itching, sneezing, runny nose, watery eyes, digestive problems, coughing, breathing difficulty, wheezing, and other symptoms similar to asthma. Allergens are the things that trigger an allergic reaction. Common allergens that bother some people include pet dander, dust mites, cockroaches, indoor and outdoor mold, certain foods, and pollen. Allergic reactions are common. In people with asthma, allergic reactions can sometimes progress into an asthma attack. When you have allergies that are not controlled, asthma symptoms usually occur immediately and taper off when you are away from the allergen. Even if you have been away from the allergen for several hours, symptoms sometimes reappear. This is called a ""late-phase reaction."" Controlling your allergies is important and can improve your asthma symptoms. Both allergens and irritants can trigger asthma. Irritants are substances (such as smoke, pollution, and strong smells) that irritate the airways but do not involve the immune system response that an allergen causes. When the bronchial tubes are inflamed, they become especially sensitive to these irritants. People come into contact with irritants or allergens in many places: home, school, daycare, public places, the workplace, and just about anywhere they go. Symptoms often start many hours after contact with irritating substances such as gas, dust, smoke, perfumes, chemicals, or other fumes. Air quality may be responsible for some of these triggers. When you suspect that exposure to something is a trigger, consider the following: Other people in the same environment report reactions, even if their reactions do not trigger asthma symptoms. When you are away from the area, symptoms clear up. Many other things can trigger asthma: sinus infections, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), sensitivity to aspirin and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), foods with sulfites (a food additive), beta-blocker medication, weather changes, menstruation, exercise, strong emotions, and respiratory viral infections such as colds.

In fact, asthma is the most common long-term childhood disease, according to the Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America. Find out more about this condition by taking the following quiz. 1. Asthma is a common disease among children and adults in the U.S. Asthma is a common disease among children and adults in the U.S., and it is increasing. Asthma is not an emotional or mental disease. But strong emotions can sometimes make asthma worse or trigger an asthma attack. People with asthma are more likely to have depression and anxiety than people who don't have asthma. 3. Asthma flare-ups may cause breathing problems but aren't dangerous. Asthma flare-ups can be very dangerous. A person having a flare-up may need to be treated at the emergency department or in the hospital. Flare-ups are also life-threatening. They can cause death. 4. Asthma flare-ups usually occur suddenly without warning. Sometimes an asthma flare-up may come on quite quickly. But early symptoms are usually present. People with asthma can learn to recognize their triggers and early symptoms of a flare-up. This knowledge helps in successfully manage the disease over the long term. 5. Many different things can cause an asthma flare-up. For most people with asthma, flare-ups may be triggered by many things. Some of these things are pollen from trees or grasses; molds or house dust; weather changes; strong odors; and cigarette smoke. Other triggers include being upset; laughing or crying hard; exercise; exposure to cold air; having a cold or the flu; or being near furry or feathered animals. 6. Asthma can't be cured, but it can be controlled. There is no cure yet for asthma. But people with asthma can control it by: Learning to notice early signs of an asthma flare-up and to start treatment right away. Staying away from triggers or things that cause asthma flare-ups. Knowing when to get medical help with severe flare-ups. 7. Different types of medicine are available to control asthma. Several types of medicines are available to control asthma. Some people with mild asthma need to take medicine only when they have symptoms. But most people need to take medicine every day to prevent symptoms and different medicine when symptoms do occur. 8. People with asthma have no way to monitor how well their lungs are working. One way people with asthma can monitor how well their lungs are working is with a peak flow meter. This small device can be used at home, work, or school. The peak flow meter may show that the asthma is getting worse before symptoms appear. Both children and adults can have asthma. Sometimes, but not always, symptoms will go away as children get older. But many people who had asthma as children continue to have asthma symptoms throughout adulthood. In some cases, asthma doesn't occur until a person is an adult. 10. Tobacco smoke can make an asthma flare-up worse. Smoke from cigarettes, cigars, and pipes can cause an asthma flare-up. And tobacco smoke can worsen a flare-up caused by other triggers. People with asthma should exercise. When asthma is under control, people with asthma are able to play most sports. Many people with asthma take medicine before exercising to prevent flare-ups.",112,symptoms of asthma,-8.243734359741211,109
6e4fde87-859f-4767-a597-12d7ff39ad07,"When to Consider a New Treatment for Allergic Asthma Medically reviewed by — If you have allergic asthma, a main focus of your treatment will be preventing and treating your allergic response. Your treatment will also likely include medication to help treat asthma symptoms. But if you’re still experiencing frequent asthma symptoms despite taking medication, it may be time to consider a change to your treatment plan. Here are some signs that it might be worth trying a new treatment to better manage your symptoms. If your asthma symptoms worsen or increase, it’s time to talk to your doctor. Increasing frequency or intensity of symptoms is a clear indication that your current treatment plan isn’t working well enough. A new treatment might help you better manage the condition. Lifestyle changes, such as avoiding allergens that trigger symptoms, can also make a significant difference. There are several medications available to help treat and prevent allergic asthma flares. If you notice your symptoms getting worse despite taking your prescribed medications, talk to your doctor. Some medications address both allergies and asthma. Your doctor may suggest: allergy shots to help reduce the immune system’s response to allergens anti-immunoglobulin E (IgE) therapy or other biologic medications, which help reduce allergic responses in the body that lead to an asthma attack leukotriene modifiers, another medication option that helps prevent allergic responses that trigger asthma attacks If allergic asthma is starting to interfere with your daily routine, talk to your doctor. If you find it difficult to go to work, school, the gym, or to take part in other activities you used to enjoy, you need to find new options to manage your condition. When asthma is well managed with the right treatment plan, it shouldn’t interfere so much with your day-to-day life. If you have allergic asthma, you likely have a fast-acting rescue inhaler to help manage asthma symptoms at the first sign of an attack. But if you need to use your rescue inhaler more than twice a week, it’s time to see your allergist to discuss a change in treatment, says the . Using a rescue inhaler that often is a sign that your condition needs to be better managed. If you regularly take any other asthma or allergy medications, it’s best to stick to the recommended dose and frequency. If you find you’re exceeding that dose or frequency, talk to your doctor about whether the medication is working well enough. Anytime you take a medication, there’s always a small risk of side effects. In most cases, the side effects are mild. Common side effects to asthma medications are: But if the side effects become more severe or cause you to miss out on regular activities, talk to your doctor about switching medications. There may be other medications that work better for you with fewer or less severe side effects. Allergic asthma can change over time. It’s possible that you could develop new allergies as you get older. If you do develop new allergies, your triggers for an allergic asthma attack could change. This means you need to stay aware of your allergies and note when a new substance causes a reaction. It may be difficult or even impossible to self-diagnose new allergies. It’s best to see an allergist to test what triggers your symptoms. This type of doctor specializes in allergies and asthma. From there, you may need to update your treatment plan to better address your new allergies. Most people don’t outgrow allergic asthma. According to the , some people may outgrow their asthma symptoms if they were caused by viral infections. But if allergies cause you to have sensitive airways, you’re less likely to outgrow the condition. Still, you may find that your symptoms start to improve and you need less intervention over time. If this is the case, you can talk to your doctor about potentially reducing your medications. Always seek medical advice before making a change to your treatment plan. With allergic asthma, your body’s allergic response to an allergen triggers asthma symptoms. You may also experience additional allergy symptoms, such as: Some medications address these types of allergy symptoms. If allergy symptoms are increasing in intensity or interfering with your daily activities, talk to your doctor. They can advise you about treatments to better manage the symptoms and help you feel better. Allergic asthma can change over time. It’s important to recognize the allergens that trigger your symptoms and take steps to avoid them. If you notice your symptoms increasing in severity or frequency, talk to your doctor about whether you might benefit from making a change to your treatment plan. When asthma is effectively managed, it’s less likely that asthma symptoms will interfere with your daily life.

Retrieved Jan 16 2021 from https://www.thefreelibrary.com/Identify+and+successfully+manage+adult-onset+asthma%3a+avoid+permanent...-a0441490802 Asthma, a chronic lung disease that causes inflammation in and narrowing of airways, is often thought of as a child's disease. But, adults can develop asthma--a condition known as adult-onset asthma--in their 50s, 60s, and beyond. ""I do see adult-onset asthma in older women, especially if they have chronic sinusitis,"" says Elizabeth Jacobson, MD, an asthma and allergy specialist at Weill Cornell's Iris Cantor Women's Health Center. Causes and symptoms Many factors may contribute to asthma in a woman's older years, such as obesity, aspirin sensitivity, and changes in hormones. The most common causes are allergies, chronic sinusitis (inflamed, swollen sinus cavities that can cause mucus build-up and inhibit sinus drainage), nasal polyps (growths in the sinuses), and a bad respiratory infection. ""A family history also may play a part in developing asthma,"" says Dr. Jacobson. ""If your parents had it, you may be at a higher risk for developing it."" Adult-onset asthma symptoms include a feeling of tightness in the chest, difficulty breathing, coughing, and wheezing--a whistling sound when you take a breath. Diagnosis Unlike childhood asthma, which may flare up occasionally, adult-onset asthma can be a daily challenge. Symptoms may interfere with everyday activities, such as exercise or stair climbing, and recreational activities, such as tennis or dancing. Asthma may cause permanent narrowing of the bronchial tubes, and severe asthma attacks may require visits to the emergency room and/or hospitalization. That's why it's important to get it treated as soon as possible. Diagnosing asthma usually involves a physical exam, an allergy test, and tests of lung function. Your doctor will ask you for a full medical history and will try to rule out potential underlying causes, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (chronic bronchitis and/or emphysema), hiatal hernia, stomach problems, or rheumatoid arthritis, all of which may produce symptoms that mimic asthma. Medications While asthma isn't curable, it is treatable. The first step is using medications to control symptoms, delivered in sprayed doses that you inhale through your mouth. The delivery system is called an inhaler. Two main types of mediations treat asthma. One is a corticosteroid, such as fluticasone (Flovent), which reduces the inflammation of asthma in the bronchial tubes. The other is a bronchodilator, which opens the airways. Bronchodilators are available in long-acting forms, such as salmeterol (Serevent), and short-acting forms, such as albuterol (Proventil). ""And, there are medications that combine corticosteroids and bronchodilators, to make it easier for patients,"" says Dr. Jacobson. Usually, inhalers are used once or twice daily, but dosage and frequency must be tailored to each person's needs. Managing asthma Beyond medications, you can treat asthma by avoiding triggers. For example, if flare-ups are caused by cold, dry air, wear a scarf over your nose and mouth when you go outside into cold weather. If asthma flare-ups are caused by allergies, it's time to get allergies under control. That may involve allergy medications or shots and avoiding allergy triggers. Strategies include ridding your home of dust and mold, staying inside when pollen levels are high, and avoiding exposure to air pollutants, such as cigarette smoke, cleaning or workplace chemicals, and hairsprays and other sprayed chemicals. ""If you can't avoid the things that cause allergic reactions, then get rapid treatment after any exposure to potential triggers. This should help you control symptoms,"" says Dr. Jacobson. A word of caution People with asthma who get the flu are at high risk for developing pneumonia. Dr. Jacobson urges everyone with asthma to get a flu shot, as well as the pneumococcal vaccine to protect against pneumonia. WHAT YOU SHOULD KNOW Proper technique in using inhalers is essential for delivering the correct amount of the prescribed drug. The design of different inhaler devices may vary, so read the directions carefully before using an inhaler for the first time. If you have any questions about your inhaler, consult your doctor or pharmacist. GENERAL DIRECTIONS FOR INHALER USE: 1. Remove the cap from the inhaler and shake the inhaler. 2. Exhale completely, place the mouthpiece of the inhaler in your mouth, and seal your lips around it. 3. Press down on the top of the canister while inhaling slowly and deeply; hold your breath for 10 seconds, and then exhale. 4. If you need to take another dose of medicine, wait one minute, and then repeat the steps described above. 5. If the medication is an inhaled steroid, rinse out your mouth. Spit the water out; do not swallow it. 6. Replace the cap on the inhaler.

Roughly 34 million Americans now have asthma, about 7 million to 8 million of which are children. () Asthma is behind 12.8 million missed school days and 10.1 million missed work days in the U.S every single year. In addition, asthma costs the U.S. about $14.7 billion a year in medical costs, prescription drugs and lost productivity — leading many people to search for home remedies for asthma. Here’s something that might surprise you: Although asthma medications can help control symptoms in the case of an emergency attack, they can actually sometimes make long term. Most asthma medications also have a host of side effects due to how they affect the endocrine system and the immune system. Research shows some asthma drugs might contribute to problems including mood changes, acne, yeast growth and weight gain — plus over time they might hinder normal immune functions that make allergic and asthmatic reactions more frequent. () What are some effective, holistic ways of treating asthma that can help prevent attacks instead? Home remedies for asthma that don’t require taking prescription medications or even using inhalers include limiting irritant exposure, , improving gut health, supplementing with vitamin D or getting more naturally from the sun, and maintaining a healthy weight. Asthma is a condition characterized by difficulty breathing and narrowing of the airways leading to the lungs (including the nose, nasal passageways, mouth and larynx). In people who have asthma or allergies, the blocked or inflamed airways that cause asthma symptoms can usually be cleared with help from certain lifestyle changes and treatments.  Asthma is a type of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease () and is also related to allergies, whether seasonal/environmental or food-related. A characteristic of asthma is that symptoms tend to occur suddenly in response to stimuli that irritate the immune system and air passageways, which is described as having an asthma “attack.” Following are home remedies for asthma that can help treat this often inhibiting condition. Eating a healthy diet supplies asthma sufferers with antioxidants and nutrients to combat environmental toxins, control inflammatory responses and reduce dietary triggers. Eating a wide variety of foods can ensure that you or your child gets all the nutrients needed to support strong immunity. There have been numerous studies that show consuming the right foods can be the one of the best home remedies for asthma. Some of the most beneficial foods to include in your asthma diet plan are: Brightly coloredcarotenoidfoods: This compound gives fruit and vegetables their orange or red color and can help reduce asthma attacks.  are the basis of vitamin A, which is involved in the maintenance of healthy mucous membranes that line the air passageways. Severity of asthma correlates with low vitamin A, so increase your intake of things like root veggies, sweet potatoes, carrots, leafy greens and berries. A study of 68,000 women showed that those who ate more tomatoes, carrots and leafy greens had much lower rates of asthma and that people prone to asthma tended to have low levels of circulating carotenoids in their blood. () Foods with folate (vitamin B9): Folate reduces allergic reactions and inflammation. It might be capable of lowering wheezing by regulating inflammatory processes as well. () High-folate foods include green leafy vegetables, beans and nuts. Vitamin E and vitamin C foods: Vitamin C is a powerful antioxidant and helps detoxify the body, which is why some research suggests that consuming more vitamin C reduces wheezing and inflammation. Vitamin C is found is leafy greens, citrus fruits, cruciferous veggies and berries. Vitamin E is another powerful antioxidant found in nuts, seeds and healthy plant oils. Foods with magnesium: are associated with increased risk of developing asthma, and increasing magnesium has been shown to reduce severity of asthma attacks and symptoms like muscle-spasming anxiety. It’s been found that magnesium can induce bronchial smooth muscle relaxation and allow air to get into and out of the lungs more easily. () Sources include greens, nuts, seeds, beans, cocoa and certain ancient grains. Broccoli, broccoli sprouts, Brussels sprouts and other cruciferous vegetables: These contain many antioxidants and a key compound called sulforaphane. Researchers from UCLA state, “A major advantage of sulforaphane is that it appears to increase a broad array of antioxidant enzymes, which may help the compound’s effectiveness in blocking the harmful effects of air pollution. We found a two-to-three-fold increase in antioxidant enzymes in the nasal airway cells of study participants who had eaten a preparation of broccoli sprouts. This strategy may offer protection against inflammatory processes and could lead to potential treatments for a variety of respiratory conditions.” () Garlic, onions and mustard seeds: All are considered natural antimicrobials. They may help to fight bacterial infections and improve overall immune health. They also contain the antioxidant called , which inhibits inflammation. Raw milk and cultured dairy: Raw dairy seems to protect children from developing asthma and hay fever symptoms. () The healthy probiotics in raw milk strengthen the immune system, and research shows that  improve digestion and help stop allergic reactions that occur as proteins and other allergens pass through the digestive lining.. Mothers can prevent their children from developing asthma if they ingest probiotics while pregnant or breast-feeding. and high-fiber foods: These plant fibers help us eliminate toxins and feed healthy probiotic bacteria. Whole grains, nuts, beans, seeds and raw vegetables are loaded with prebiotic materials and are great sources of fiber. Omega-3 foods: Omega-3 is mostly found in oily fish, such as mackerel, sardines, orange roughy, salmon, trout and tuna. Nuts and seeds can also provide a good dose. Omega-3s help lower the incidence of asthma significantly because they reduce airway inflammation and immune system reactivity. () Foods with vitamin B5 (or pantothenic acid): It’s needed in larger quantities by asthmatics because they seem unable to utilize this vitamin correctly. It’s also been found that , a drug used to treat asthma, causes vitamin B5 deficiency. Pantothenic acid is also involved in adrenal function, and stress plays a large role in asthma. There are many ways in which processed and refined foods contribute to asthma. Lack of fiber reduces probiotic bacteria, depletes stomach acid and hinders proper digestion. The lack of nutrients in these foods stresses the entire body and makes it less able to neutralize toxins. The lack of fresh fruit and vegetables in the Western diet contributes to high levels of inflammation, deficiencies and overall poor nutrition. Foods to reduce or eliminate from your diet include conventional dairy, added sugar, trans fats or refined oils, gluten, and processed carbohydrates. Here’s why avoiding these foods should be utilized along with other home remedies for asthma: Children who eat foods fried in refined/processed vegetable oils and consume hydrogenated fats are much more likely to have asthma. These trans fats contribute to the presence of dangerous free radicals in the body. Children who are bottle-fed with powdered and pasteurized infant formulas are significantly more at risk of developing asthma and allergies than those who are breast-fed. The high sugar content in many processed foods contributes to the overgrowth of yeast or candida albicans. Yeast can be a trigger itself, but worse, it steals valuable nutrients from the digestive tract. Hidden food allergies are often triggers for asthma attacks. The most common food allergies are to pasteurized milk products, gluten, soy, eggs and nuts. Wheat gluten and soy are present in a wide variety of foods. They hide on labels as hydrolyzed vegetable protein, lecithin, starch and vegetable oil. Food preservatives and food coloring can trigger asthma attacks. Avoid MSG, tartrazine (yellow food dye), sulfites and sulfur dioxide, to name just a few. Avoid animal products treated with hormones and antibiotics as well as pasteurized foods and drinks. Farm-raised fish is laden with these chemicals and has high mercury levels that correlate with increased incidence of asthma. Another rising star in home remedies for asthma is vitamin Dwhich seems to slow declining lung function and supports immune health. It also stops lung “remodeling,” the narrowing of breathing passages over time. , the form of vitamin D we make in the body, is a natural anti-inflammatory, yet many people are chronically due to spending less time outside and eating low-nutrient diets. The daily recommended dose is about 600 international units for adults, which can be obtained through a combination of sun exposure and a healthy diet. Recently, a study published in the , which tested 435 children and 658 adults with mild to moderate asthma, found that those taking vitamin D supplements experienced fewer severe asthma attacks, required less use of oral steroids for treatment and also reduced their risk of needing to be hospitalized for acute asthma attacks. () Other supplements that can help lower attacks and symptoms include: Vitamins C: Increases immunity and acts like an antioxidant, and inflammation. B vitamins: Help support cognitive functions and immune health. Vitamin B3 and vitamin B12have been found to be low in asthma patients but are nutrients that lower antihistamine levels and reduce wheezing. Zinc: Supports adrenal health and aids the body in coping with stress, which has been tied to worsened asthma symptoms. Magnesium: Can help reduce asthma symptom severity, including pain, anxiety and emotional stress. Many people with asthma frequently , wheeze and have trouble breathing, all of which essential oils — particularly — can help manage. As mucus (phlegm or sputum) or other substances accumulate in the airways, these symptoms kick in as reflexive actions that try to facilitate unobstructed breathing. Try making a with eucalyptus oil and peppermint oil to open up airways.Frankincense oil can be used to lower inflammation and swollen lymph nodes, and lavender can be used to help mitigate symptoms, such as anxiety and mood changes. There might not be much you can do about pollution outdoors, but can greatly lessen susceptibility to outdoor asthma attacks. Believe it or not, the Environmental Protection Agency tells us our indoor environments are  than our outdoor environments! Here are tips to help you remove many sources of irritants that are likely found in your home: Try to keep a window open even during the winter to bring fresh air in. If you can afford it, use a heat recovery ventilator (air-to-air heat exchanger) to bring outside air in. Avoid secondhand smoke from wood-burning stoves and cigarettes. Switch to or use baking soda, lavender oil and vinegar to make your own. There are many simple recipes available online that can keep added chemicals out of your home and save you a bundle of money. Avoid aerosols and petroleum-based ingredients in your health and beauty products. Instead use natural products made from essential oils. Use a dehumidifier in damp areas, and fix water leaks to reduce mold. Buy a water filter to remove chlorine from your tap water. Install flooring or carpets that you can vacuum beneath to reduce dust mites. Wash bedding weekly, and keep upholstery and carpets regularly vacuumed. Use sheets and pillow cases that are non-allergenic and don’t contain down or feathers. Keep furry friends out of the bedroom to limit the amount of pet hair you’re exposed to. Clean and brush pets regularly to remove some of their fur that can wind up around your home. Cockroaches are another asthma trigger, so speak with a professional exterminator if you suspect you might have some in your home. Asthma has also been linked to a condition known as . FHP occurs when your head shifts out in front of your body, and as a result the nerves in the lower part of your neck and upper part of your back from vertebrae T1-T4 become compressed and compromise lung function. To correct FHP, I recommend you seek the assistance of a corrective care chiropractic physician who can help improve your posture through and spinal rehabilitation exercises. By retraining the spine and moving it back into its ideal alignment, pressure is taken off the nerves reaching out to the lungs. The Western lifestyle includes high degrees of emotional stress, and studies show that stress management techniques help reduce asthma severity. It’s well-known that stress increases the severity and frequency of asthmatic attacks because it hinders immune function and raises inflammation. In fact, studies show that roughly67 percent or more of asthmatics have diminished adrenal capacity, increased anxiety and other mood disorders related to stress. Mood disorders are considered “adaptive diseases” — that is, they result from a person’s inability to deal with stress. Try natural , including massage, deep abdominal breathing, progressive muscle relaxation, guided imagery and art therapies. These can all help reduce stress and give asthmatics the tools to modulate their stress responses. This lowers susceptibility to future attacks and lessens reliance on asthma drugs. The British Guideline on the Management of Asthma recommends Buteyko and pranayama yoga (forms of deep breathing) for asthma management. A review of seven studies found that these breathing exercises reduce the severity and length of asthma attacks. () A growing body of literature indicates that lifestyle changes in recent decades, specifically decreased physical activity and dietary changes, are key contributing factors causing an increase in asthma prevalence and severity. Obesity is linked to higher risk for asthma and other breathing problems, including . Although vigorous exercise can sometimes cause symptoms in people who already have asthma, staying active is generally very beneficial for improving immune function, preventing obesity, dealing with stress and lowering inflammation. () Wheezing, including sounds emanating from your chest as you try to breath During attacks it’s possible to show signs of poor circulation and oxygen, including having blue- or purple-colored toes and fingers or skin changes Symptoms of anxiety, such as sweating and rapid heartbeats Symptoms similar to those caused by allergies, such as watery and red eyes, itchy throat, or a runny nose — some people can look inside their throats or noses and see redness and swelling Swollen glands and puffy lymph nodes in the neck — sometimes people with asthma even feel like they’re choking Dry mouth, especially if you begin breathing through the mouth more often instead of the nose There are many different theories about what causes asthma, but toxins and irritants (both from the environment and spending lots of time outdoors) are now recognized as primary root causes. Other factors that contribute to asthma development include poor nutrition, pollution, antibiotic abuse, autoimmune disorders, other medical disorders that affect the lungs, genetic susceptibility and high amounts of stress. For some adults, asthma symptoms are caused by exposure to chemicals and pollution during work (dust, debris, etc.), known as “occupational asthma.” This accounts for about 15 percent of all asthma cases. () The Western lifestyle correlates with increased numbers of asthma sufferers, which is not surprising considering the poor diet quality and high-stress environment. Asthma is rare in remote areas of Asia and Africa but much more common in industrialized, Western nations where people commonly eat inflammatory, low-nutrient diets. Spending lots of time indoors: This can reduce someone’s ability to effectively build the immune system and also increases exposure to certain allergens or irritants that can accumulate indoors (like dust mites, mold spurs, pet hair and other microbes). Obesity, allergies and other medical conditions that affect the lungs and cause low immunity Sometimes childhood infections can affect lung tissue and cause the airways to narrow or become inflamed. Genetics: Studies show that asthma tends to run in families, although it usually isn’t completely genetically acquired. Poor posture: Compression of the lungs caused from poor posture might also contribute to symptoms. Exposure to environmental toxins: This can include fumes, pollution and chemicals released from construction sites. Doctors use medications like anti-inflammatory drugs, steroids, “anti-IgE” drugs and inhalers (bronchodilators) to help control asthma attacks and prevent emergencies or complications. Most of these drugs can help open up the airways very quickly but have serious drawbacks as well. Some research even suggests that inhalant albuterol medications can alter genes in children and make future asthma attacks up to 30 percent more likely. () Dr. John Mills, chief of infectious diseases at San Francisco General, said, “Conventional drugs used for treating asthma, particularly steroids, can impair immune function and lead to more serious health problems. Doctors tell you that steroids (cortisone, prednisone) only cause side effects after many years. But new research shows that permanent damage is immediate and devastating. Studies show that steroids cause permanent, debilitating effects after a single dosage. Steroids are probably the most sleazy of modern day medications.” () Here’s the good news: You can help treat asthma naturally by lowering environmental and dietary toxin intake, eating more nutrient-rich foods, addressing the nervous system’s role in lung functioning, and learning to better manage stress. All these home remedies for asthma come with little to no serious adverse side effects as well. If during an attack asthma medications aren’t able to help someone experience improvements immediately, then it’s important to visit the ER or call an ambulance right away. Although it’s rare, asthma attacks can sometimes become fatal, so being cautious is always best. Signs of a severe asthma attack that requires immediate intervention include a pale face, sweating, blue lips, very rapid heartbeat and inability to exhale. If asthma symptoms ever start recurring multiple times per day, make sure to see your doctor. Also mention to your doctor if symptoms ever become frequent or severe enough to interrupt sleep, work, school or other normal day-to-day activities. Keep an eye out for side effects of medications or other signs of allergies, which might make asthma symptoms worse, including a very dry mouth, stuffy nose, dizziness, pains and a swollen tongue. Asthma is a condition that affects breathing, which is caused by narrowed airways (bronchospasm), a swollen or inflamed respiratory system, and abnormal immune system reactions. Common symptoms of asthma include coughing, wheezing, chest tightness, shortness of breath, and pain or pressure in the chest. Risk factors and underlying contributors of asthma include an inflammatory/poor diet, low immune function, food or , and exposure to household or environmental irritants. Eliminating food allergies, spending more time outdoors, and avoiding exposure to pollution or irritants found inside the home are all home remedies for asthma symptoms.

This food may up the risk of asthma or other respiratory issues in children Dietary habits established earlier in life may be linked to potentially the future development of asthma as new research has found that substances present in cooked meats are associated with increased wheezing in children. By: | Tags:          Higher meat consumption may increase your chance of childhood asthma The development of respiratory issues in children is a growing concern for parents these days. Fear of future of asthma is also a cause of constant worry. While we blame polluted air for these problems, a new study cites meat as one of the culprits. Surprised? Well, it is quite strange. A study has found that substances present in cooked meats are associated with increased wheezing in children. Also Read - Here’s how you can manage your child’s respiratory health during winters Their study, published in the journal Thorax, highlights pro-inflammatory compounds called advanced glycation end-products (AGEs) as an example of early dietary risk factors that may have broad clinical and public health implications for the prevention of inflammatory airway disease. Also Read - Winter diet for asthma patients: Know what to eat and what to avoid Asthma is a lung disorder that obstructs breathing. It is a condition wherein a person experiences chronic inflammation leading to narrowing of the airway that causes recurrent asthma attacks. In such circumstances, airflow to the lungs is obstructed. Some of the common symptoms include shortness of breath, coughing, and tightness in the chest. It is also known as bronchial asthma or reactive airway disease. Also Read - Birth control pills may reduce the risk of severe asthma The link between – Childhood DIETARY habits and development of ASTHMA The study analysts have stated that the research identifying dietary factors that influence respiratory symptoms in children is important, as these risks are potentially modifiable and can help guide health recommendations. “Our findings will hopefully inform future longitudinal studies to further investigate whether these specific dietary components play a role in childhood airways such as asthma,” he said. The researchers examined 4,388 children between 2 and 17 years of age from the 2003-2006 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), a program of the National Center for Health Statistics, which is part of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. It is designed to evaluate the health and nutritional status of adults and children in the United States through interviews and physical examinations. The researchers used NHANES survey data to evaluate associations between dietary advanced glycation end-products and meat consumption frequencies, and . They found that higher advanced glycation end-products intake was significantly associated with increased odds of wheezing, importantly including wheezing that disrupted sleep and exercise, and that required prescription medication. Similarly, a higher intake of non-seafood meats was associated with wheeze-disrupted sleep and wheezing that required prescription medication. According to the reports, they have found that higher consumption of dietary advanced glycation end-products, which are largely derived from intake of non-seafood meats, was associated with increased risk of wheezing in children, regardless of overall diet quality or an established diagnosis of asthma. Most people with asthma experience symptoms intermittently. The time gap between asthma flare-ups could be weeks or months. The symptoms generally worsen in the night or early in the morning. Other factors that can manifestations are breathing in cold air, strenuous physical exercise, and heartburn. The tell-tale signs of this condition include: #Chest tightness: Pulling in of the skin between the ribs when breathing #Wheezing: A musical, whistling, or hissing sound with breathing. Apart from these, there are other manifestations of this condition which demand immediate address by the doctor #Decreased level of alertness, such as severe drowsiness or confusion According to a study published in the Journal of Human Nutrition and Dietetics, eating a Mediterranean diet can significantly reduce bronchial inflammation and help kids with asthma. As inflammation is a culprit behind asthma flare-ups, targeting it through foods can be helpful. Though asthma triggers differ from child to child, most commonly, children with this condition have been found to be allergic to gluten, dairy products, and eggs.

Only your doctor can determine your specific asthma classification and the asthma treatment for you. How much medicine you take and when to take it needs to be clearly written in your Asthma Action Plan. There are different types of long-term control medicines. They can calm your airways and prevent asthma symptoms. Other names for long-term control medicine are: Long-term control medicines work to prevent or stop the overreactive immune system response that causes inflammation and tightening in your airways. Long-term control medicine works in your body to help prevent or control everyday symptoms of asthma by: These medicines are taken every day on a long-term basis. Long-term control medicines work best when a certain level is maintained in your bloodstream.

111d7b91-e1e3-402f-b03c-73939e90fe82,"Most people with asthma need two kinds of medicines: 1. Quick-relief medicines, to be taken when you need them, for immediate relief of your symptoms, and 2. Long-term control medicines, to be taken daily, for a long time, to stop and control the inflammation in your airways and thereby prevent symptoms and attacks. Everyone with asthma needs a quick-relief or rescue medicine to stop asthma symptoms before they get worse. An inhaled short-acting beta2-agonist is the preferred quick-relief medicine. It acts quickly to relax tightened muscles around your airways so that your airways can open up and allow more air to flow through. You should take your quick-relief medicine at the first sign of any asthma symptoms. Your doctor may recommend that you take this medicine at other times, as well-for example, before exercise. Quick-relief medicines are very good at stopping asthma symptoms, but they do nothing to control the inflammation in your airways that produces these symptoms. If you need to use more quick-relief medicine than usual or if you need to use it every day, it may be a sign that you also need to take a long-term control medicine to reduce the inflammation in your airways. Discuss this with your doctor as soon as possible. Long-term control medicines are used to prevent asthma symptoms from coming on in the first place. These medicines work more slowly than quick-relief medicines, and you may need to take them for several weeks before you feel their effects. Once your asthma is under control, you may be able to cut back on some of these medicines. The most effective long-term control medicines are anti-inflammatory medicines. They reduce the inflammation in your airways, making the airways less irritable and less likely to react to your asthma triggers. Anti-inflammatory medicines are usually most effective when you take them every day, even when you don't have any symptoms. The most effective anti-inflammatory medicines for most people are inhaled corticosteroids. Some people don't like the idea of taking steroids. But the inhaled corticosteroids used to treat asthma have been studied over the years in large groups of adults and children as young as 2 years old and have been found to be generally safe when taken as directed by your doctor. They also are very different from the illegal anabolic steroids taken by some athletes. They are not habit-forming-even if you take them every day for many years. And, because they are inhaled, the medicine goes right to your lungs where it is needed. Like many other medicines, inhaled corticosteroids can have side effects. But most doctors agree that the benefits of taking them and preventing attacks far outweigh the risks of side effects.. Take inhaled corticosteroids as your doctor prescribes and use a spacer or holding chamber with your inhaler to make sure the medicine goes directly to your lungs. It's also a good idea to rinse your mouth out with water after taking these medicines. Other long-term control medicines available to treat asthma include: . These are bronchodilators that can help prevent symptoms when taken with inhaled corticosteroids. These medicines should not be used alone. They also should not be used to treat serious symptoms or an attack. A two-in-one medicine containing corticosteroids and longacting beta2-agonists is now available. is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medicine that can be used to treat mild persistent asthma, especially in children. It's not as effective as inhaled corticosteroids. Leukotriene modifiers, or anti-leukotriene medicines, are a newer class of long-term control medicines that block the action of chemicals in your airways. If not blocked, certain chemicals, called leukotrienes, increase the inflammation in your lungs . Anti-leukotriene medicines, which are available in pill form, are used alone to treat persistent asthma or with inhaled corticosteroids to treat moderate asthma. They are not as effective as inhaled corticosteroids for most patients. , also available in pill form, acts as a bronchodilator to relax and open the airways. It can help prevent nighttime symptoms. It is sometimes used alone to treat mild persistent asthma, but most of the time it is used with inhaled steroids. If you take theophylline, you need to have your blood levels checked regularly to make sure the dose is right for you. Many asthma medicines-both quick-relief and long-term control medicines-come as sprays and powders in an inhaler. An inhaler is a hand-held device that delivers the medication right to the airways in your lungs where it is needed. There are several kinds of inhalers. The metered dose inhaler (MDI) is a small canister that delivers a measured dose of medicine through your mouth to your airways. Some MDIs use a chemical to push the medicine out of the inhaler. Inhalers that use the chemical chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) are gradually being replaced. A breath-activated inhaler from which you simply breathe in by mouth, and the medicine comes out in a soft spray, It is important for you to learn how to use your inhaler correctly. Read the instructions that come with it. Also ask your health care provider or pharmacist to show you how to use it. Then try it yourself and ask him or her to make sure you are using it the right way. A spacer or holding chamber can make using an MDI a lot easier. It is an especially good idea to use a spacer with corticosteroid MDIs as it decreases the amount of medicine that lands on your tongue or in the back of your mouth. This reduces irritation to your throat and increases the amount of medicine that gets down into your lungs where it belongs. There are many kinds of spacers. Some have a mouth piece. Some have a face mask that comes in different sizes to fit both children and adults. Many spacers fit on the end of an inhaler; for some, the canister of medication fits into the device. Some MDIs come with builtin spacers. Most spacers also come with instructions on how to use them. It's important to ask your health care provider to show you how to use a spacer with your MDI. Then try it yourself and ask him or her to make sure you're doing it correctly. A is another device that makes it easier to take inhaled medicines. It provides the medicine in a fine mist, rather than a spray. Using a nebulizer is usually easy; you simply breathe in and out normally through a mask or mouthpiece connected to the nebulizer. But it takes more time to use than an inhaler. It also is more expensive and requires more maintenance. Instructions for using different nebulizers vary, so follow the instructions on the package insert. Nebulized asthma medication may be especially useful for infants, young children, and adults who have trouble using an inhaler. Regardless of which of these devices you use, you have to use them the right way, or you won't get all the medicine into your lungs. The best way to learn to use these devices correctly is to ask your doctor or a nurse, pharmacist, or respiratory therapist to show you how. Then demonstrate it back to him or her to make sure you have it right. High levels of steroids put asthma patients at greater risk of serious side-effects Wildfire smoke more harmful than other types of air pollution for people with asthma Children with asthma having fewer attacks amid the coronavirus pandemic, study says Doctors usually decide which medicines and how much of each to prescribe, based on your lung function and your pattern of symptoms-how many days and nights you have them, as shown on the chart below. Usually, if you have symptoms no more than 2 days a week or 2 nights a month, they will consider your asthma to be mild and intermittent and prescribe only quick-relief medicines to be used when you have symptoms. If you have more frequent symptoms, you probably need daily long-term control medicines to prevent symptoms. It may take several visits before the doctor finds exactly the right medicines and doses for you. 3 days or more a week but no more than one bout of symptoms on any 1 day Now that you know more about asthma medicines and what they do, ask your doctor to write on your asthma action plan: The name of each of your quick-relief and long-term control medicines, Allergy shots (immunotherapy) may help if you have allergies that can't be easily controlled by avoiding your triggers and taking medicine. Older people with asthma should have pneumococcal (pneumonia) vaccinations. Antibiotics are not recommended for either routine or emergency treatment of asthma, except, as needed, for a bacterial infection, such as pneumonia or suspected bacterial sinusitis. Avoiding the things that bring on your asthma symptoms-your asthma triggers-is another important part of your asthma action plan. Some of the most common things that bring on asthma symptoms are allergens, irritants, viral infections, and exercise. Allergens are substances that can cause you to have an allergic reaction. That is, in some people, the immune system sees them as ""foreign"" or ""dangerous"" and reacts in an exaggerated way to protect the body against them. Put a favorite picture of yourself or a loved one on the refrigerator with a note that says, ""Remember To Take Your Asthma Medicine."" Keep your medicine on the night stand next to your side of the bed. Take your asthma medicine right after you brush your teeth and keep it with your toothbrush as a reminder, or put it next to your cereal box and take it with breakfast. Put ""sticky"" notes in visible places to remind yourself to take your asthma medicine, i.e., on the refrigerator, on the cabinet where you keep your favorite morning mug (You might even keep the medicine bottle inside the mug.), on the bathroom mirror, on the front door. If you use the telephone company's voice mail service, record a reminder for yourself, and the service can automatically call you every day at the same time. Establish a buddy system with a friend who also is on daily medication and arrange to call each other every day with a reminder to ""take your medicine."" Ask one or more of your children or grandchildren to call you every day with a quick reminder. It's a great way to stay in touch, and little ones love to help the grownups. Place your medicine in a weekly pill box, available at most pharmacies. If you have a personal computer, program a start-up reminder to take your asthma medicine or sign up with one of the free services that will send you reminder e-mail every day. If you have a watch with an alarm, program it to beep and remind you to take your asthma medicine. Remember to refill your prescription. Each time you pick up a refill, make a note on your calendar to order and pick up the next refill one week before the medicine is due to run out. Some of the most common allergens for people with asthma are: Animal dander - scales or dried saliva from the hair, skin, or feathers of animals Dust mites - tiny bugs that thrive in mattresses, upholstered furniture, carpets, and stuffed animals Irritants are things in the environment that may irritate your lungs. Some of the most common lung irritants are: Cold air or changes in weather like freezing temperatures, high humidity, and thunderstorms Strong odors or sprays, such as perfumes, household cleaners, cooking fumes - especially from frying - paints, or varnishes Other things that bring on asthma symptoms in some people include: Respiratory infections, such as colds or . Also sinusitis and rhinitis. Medicines, such as aspirin or other nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) like ibuprofen, and beta-blockers, which are used in high blood pressure and glaucoma medicines Sulfites in food (dried fruit, processed potatoes, or shrimp) or beverages (wine or beer) Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), a medical condition that causes heartburn Strong expressions of emotion (including laughing hard or crying) This is not a complete list of all the things that can bring on your asthma symptoms. It is important for you to learn what causes problems for you.

However, it’s a highly treatable disease. In fact, some doctors say today’s asthma treatments are so effective, many people have near-complete control of their symptoms. People with asthma have highly individual triggers and responses. Some doctors believe there are actually many asthmas, each with its own causes, risks, and treatments. If you have asthma, your doctor will work with you to create an asthma action plan that focuses on your own symptoms and the things that seem to trigger them.Asthma. (n.d.). The plan will probably include changes to your environment and activities, along with medicine to help you manage your symptoms. Asthma treatment serves two main purposes: long-term control and short-term symptom relief. Here are some of the your doctor could include in your asthma action plan: These portable devices deliver a premeasured dose of asthma medicine into your lungs. You hold the J-shaped pumps to your mouth and press down on the canister. The pump sends out a mist or powder that you inhale. Some inhalers contain corticosteroids that control swelling and irritation in your airways. These inhalers are for daily or seasonal use. Other inhalers contain fast-acting drugs (such as bronchodilators, beta2-agonists, or anticholinergics) that can open your airways quickly if you’re having an asthma flare-up. Some inhalers may contain a combination of medicines to control your precise reactions. These freestanding devices turn liquid medicine into a mist you can breathe. The drugs used in nebulizers reduce swelling and irritation in the airways. Your long-term action plan may also include oral medications. Oral asthma drugs include leukotriene modulators (which reduce inflammation) and theophylline (which has mostly been replaced with safer, more effective medications) which opens your airways. Both are taken in pill form. Oral corticosteroid pills are also sometimes prescribed. . You may have an injection of a biologic medication once or twice a month. These medicines are also called immunomodulators because they reduce certain white blood cells in your blood or reduce your sensitivity to allergens in your environment. They’re only used for certain types of severe asthma. Your doctor may prescribe one or more of these drugs to help control your asthma and relieve symptoms.

Some inhalers combine corticosteroids and LABA medicines: Fluticasone and salmeterol (Advair Diskus, Advair HFA) is a bronchodilator that you take in pill form. Sometimes sold under the name Theo-24, this medication is rarely prescribed now. If you experience severe asthma, your doctor could add oral corticosteroids like prednisone to your asthma action plan. If your flare-ups seem to be triggered by allergens, your doctor might recommend immunotherapy (allergy shots) or antihistamines and decongestants. There are many to consider.

Lung and Respiratory Health: Reasons You're Short of Breath Your airways suddenly narrow and swell. You may struggle for air, cough up mucus, or hear whistling when you breathe. It's not clear why this happens to some people, but lots of things could trigger an attack, including pollen, dust, smoke, exercise, freezing air, a cold, and stress. Your doctor can help you figure out what causes yours. They might prescribe medication for you to inhale during an attack to help you breathe more easily. Pollen, dust, pet dander, and other things you breathe in can cause allergies. Sometimes the allergic reaction causes asthma. But it's not always something in the air. It could start with something you touch, or some food you eat. Talk with your doctor about how best to manage your asthma and allergies. Make sure to check in when your symptoms change, too. You may breathe harder when you're scared or worried. It's usually not a big deal, but it can be serious if you already have lung problems like COPD. Sudden stress, like a car accident, could trigger an attack if you have asthma. Even if you're otherwise healthy, anxiety might cause you to breathe fast enough to get lightheaded and pass out. It's a colorless, odorless gas that can come from furnaces, fireplaces, water heaters, dryers, and car fumes. If it isn't sent out the right way, it can build up in the air, and you could breathe too much of it. That makes it hard for your red blood cells to send oxygen through your body. You may be short of breath, dizzy, confused, weak, and nauseated. Your vision could blur, and you could pass out. It could be life-threatening. It happens thanks to a virus that causes a runny nose, sneezing, and sometimes fever. It may irritate your lungs and airway, and bring a cough that can make it hard to breathe. There's no cure, but it usually gets better on its own in a week or so. See your doctor if you have a fever higher than 102 F, if you're wheezing, or if it's hard to catch your breath. A blockage, or clot, often in your leg, breaks loose, and a piece goes to your lung and blocks blood flow. That can make it hard or painful to breathe. You could feel faint, and your heart might race. Some people cough up blood. You may have swelling, warmth, and soreness where the clot started. If any of this happens to you, get to the hospital, as it can be life-threatening. Your doctor may use blood thinners, other drugs, or surgery. It's a condition when breathing stops repeatedly during sleep, so a person may not realize anything is happening. But you might be tired, groggy, and moody the next day. It could lead to high blood pressure and make you more likely to have heart disease and a stroke. Extra weight is a risk. It may help to lose weight, but not all people with sleep apnea are overweight. A virus, bacteria, or fungus infects the air sacs inside your lungs. Then those sacs fill with fluid. This makes it harder to breathe. You also could have chills and fever, and you might cough up a thick, colored mucus. Check in regularly with your doctor. They might prescribe antibiotics if your pneumonia is caused by bacteria. Other types are harder to treat, but rest, fluids, and over-the-counter meds can make you feel better. Some people call it ""chronic bronchitis"" or emphysema. Smoking causes it most often. It stretches out the air sacs in your lungs, making it hard for the lungs to move air. This makes it tougher to breathe. You might feel tightness in your chest and have a cough, sometimes with wheezing, that doesn't go away. Your doctor can help you manage this serious condition. If you smoke, the most important step you can take is to quit smoking. It doesn't mean your heart has ""failed,"" just that it's not as strong at pumping blood as it should be. That makes it harder to get oxygen where it needs to go. Blood backs up in your lungs. That can make you short of breath. Simple things -- when you climb stairs, walk a long way, or carry groceries -- might tire you out. When your body doesn't have enough healthy red blood cells, you can't get enough oxygen to your tissues. That can make you weak and tired, and sometimes short of breath. It can also make you dizzy and pale, with cold hands and feet, and a fast heartbeat. Lots of things cause it, so treatment depends on what's causing yours. Talk to your doctor if you're tired and can't figure out why. Doctors sometimes call it pneumothorax. It happens when an injury or disease causes air to leak from your lungs to the space between your lungs and the wall of your chest. The air pushes on the lung, making it fold in on itself. You could have chest pain and be short of breath. Your doctor may put a needle or small tube into the area to remove the air, or you may need surgery. But if it's minor, it might get better on its own. Kids between 6 months and 6 years of age can sometimes have moments when they stop breathing while crying or when they become startled. This sometimes triggers a ""cyanotic spell,"" an uncontrolled response that makes them faint. The child may turn blue and pass out for about a minute. They could seem groggy afterward. Though it can be scary at first, it's nothing to worry about, and it might happen again and again. It's a ""neuromuscular"" disease that makes it harder for muscles and nerves to talk to each other. You might notice weakness when you move your arms and legs. It can also affect automatic movements like breathing. The disease could change the way you chew, swallow, blink, and smile. It's usually worse if you exert yourself and better after you rest. Your doctor can help you manage your symptoms. In some cases, people go into remission. It's a real thing. There's even a name for it: broken heart syndrome. Sudden, intense emotion -- a lost loved one or ended romance, for example -- affects the heart, causing sharp chest pain and making it hard to breathe. The heart doesn't pump as well for a while. Unlike a heart attack, it doesn't happen because your arteries are blocked. Most people get better within a few days or weeks.

Abstract Abstract The prevalence of childhood asthma has risen significantly over the past four decades. A family history of atopic disease is associated with an increased likelihood of developing asthma, and environmental triggers such as tobacco smoke significantly increase the severity of daily asthma symptoms and the frequency of acute exacerbations. The goal of asthma therapy is to control symptoms, optimize lung function, and minimize days lost from school. Acute care of an asthma exacerbation involves the use of inhaled beta agonists delivered by a metered-dose inhaler with a spacer, or a nebulizer, supplemented by anticholinergics in more severe exacerbations. The use of systemic and inhaled corticosteroids early in an asthma attack may decrease the rate of hospitalization. Chronic care focuses on controlling asthma by treating the underlying airway inflammation. Inhaled corticosteroids are the agent of choice in preventive care, but leukotriene inhibitors and nedocromil also can be used as prophylactic therapy. Long-acting beta agonists may be added to one of the anti-inflammatory medications to improve control of asthma symptoms. Education programs for caregivers and self-management training for children with asthma improve outcomes. Although the control of allergens has not been demonstrated to work as monotherapy, immunotherapy as an adjunct to standard medical therapy can improve asthma control. Sublingual immunotherapy is a newer, more convenient option than injectable immunotherapy, but it requires further study. Omalizumab, a newer medication for prevention and control of moderate to severe asthma, is an expensive option. Asthma is a chronic lung disease characterized by recurrent cough and wheeze that is increasing in prevalence among children. More than 5 percent of the U.S. population younger than 18 years—nearly 5 million children—is affected by this disorder. It is found more often in patients with a personal or family history of atopy. This article summarizes the treatment of asthma in children, with an emphasis on new modalities and the results of recent studies. Abstract The development of asthma in children is thought to be the final step in a disease process described as the “allergic march.” The allergic march may begin in infancy with food allergy–associated gastrointestinal disorders and dermatitis. Allergic rhinoconjunctivitis follows in early childhood, and asthma often completes the picture. Early atopic dermatitis and elevated serum IgE antibodies against food allergens within the first two years of life, combined with family history, can be used to predict aeroallergen sensitization at five years of age. Recent data from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have suggested that early use of some antihistamines or immunotherapy may reduce the number of children who progress from rhinoconjunctivitis to asthma. A spacer with a metered-dose inhaler is as effective as a nebulizer for delivery of a bronchodilator in the treatment of an acute asthma exacerbation and for the delivery of chronic prophylactic medications. Physicians should consider adding inhaled ipratropium bromide (Atrovent) with each inhalation of a beta agonist, particularly in the treatment of a more severe asthma exacerbation. If possible, oral corticosteroids should be administered within 45 minutes of the onset of symptoms in an acute asthma exacerbation. Modest doses of an inhaled corticosteroid are more effective than inhaled long-acting beta agonists, inhaled nedocromil (Tilade), and leukotriene inhibitors in improving asthma symptoms and lung function in children with moderate persistent asthma and are recommended as the first-line treatment. Parents and caregivers of children with asthma, particularly those with moderate to severe disease, should be taught to recognize and avoid triggers and to understand the use of prescribed medications and inhalation devices, and the importance of compliance and monitoring.

Abstract Asthma causes airway hyperresponsiveness, airflow limitation, and persistent respiratory symptoms such as wheezing, coughing, chest tightness, and shortness of breath. The majority of children with asthma develop symptoms before five years of age. Because the symptoms vary extensively, asthma must be distinguished from other causes of respiratory illness. Demonstrating reversible airway obstruction in children old enough to perform peak flow measurements or spirometry provides an objective means of confirming the diagnosis. Once a child is diagnosed with asthma, the goal of therapy is to reduce wheeze and cough, reduce the risk and number of acute exacerbations, and minimize adverse effects of treatments, sleep disturbances, and absences from school. Treatment is tailored to the severity of asthma. The standard classification of asthma severity from the National Institutes of Health consensus guideline is shown in .

Abstract In an acute asthma exacerbation, inhaled beta agonists are a mainstay of treatment . Administration of an inhaled beta agonist via a metered-dose inhaler with a spacer device is equally as effective as nebulized therapy. There is no evidence to support the use of oral or intravenous beta agonists in the treatment of acute asthma. There is some evidence that high-dose nebulized beta agonists (0.15 mg per kg per dose, approximately six puffs for a 35-kg [77-lb] child) administered every 20 minutes for six doses may be more effective than low-dose beta agonists (0.05 mg per kg per dose, approximately two puffs for a 35-kg child) in treating severe acute asthma in children. Levalbuterol (Xopenex), the nebulized levo-isomer of albuterol (Proventil), was compared with nebulized albuterol in one RCT; it showed a decrease in rate of hospitalization but no decrease in the length of hospital stay. Nebulizer solution: 5 mg per mL (0.5 percent), 3.5 mg per 3 mL, 1.25 mg per 3 mL, 0.63 mg per 3 mL 0.05 mg per kg (minimum 1.25 mg, maximum 2.5 mg) in 3 mL of saline every 4 to 6 hours.

Despite the absence of RCT data, it is common practice to use supplemental oxygen in children with acute asthma exacerbations treated in the emergency department. Low oxygen saturation measured with pulse oximetry has been correlated inversely with the rate of hospitalization. However, poor sensitivity and specificity limit the use of oxygen saturation as a single indicator to determine the need for hospitalization. The addition of inhaled ipratropium bromide (Atrovent) to each inhalation of a beta agonist is more effective than the beta agonist alone in children with an acute asthma exacerbation. A systematic review of the evidence showed that one hospitalization is prevented for every 12 children treated with this therapy and one for every seven children with a severe exacerbation. Oral corticosteroids given early during an acute asthma exacerbation (i.e., within 45 minutes of the onset of symptoms) reduce the likelihood of hospital admission. In addition, oral corticosteroids are more effective than inhaled or nebulized corticosteroids in children hospitalized with severe acute asthma. Repeated short courses of oral corticosteroids, at a dose of 1 mg per kg per day, in the treatment of acute flares of asthma do not appear to cause any lasting changes in bone metabolism, bone mineralization, or adrenal function. There is no evidence that intravenous corticosteroids are any more effective than oral corticosteroids in children with an intact and functioning digestive tract. A systematic review of additional studies in the emergency department—including three pediatric studies—demonstrated that inhaled corticosteroids in high doses reduce hospital admission rates in patients with acute asthma. However, there is insufficient evidence that inhaled corticosteroids alone are as effective as systemic steroids. Although theophylline is not widely used in the treatment of childhood asthma, there is some improvement of symptoms and lung function with the use of intravenous theophylline in children hospitalized with a severe asthma attack. However, this therapy does not reduce the length of stay or the need for additional bronchodilator treatment, and it is not recommended for routine use. Abstract Inhaled corticosteroids are a standard part of maintenance therapy for asthma . Studies have shown that, as a single agent, inhaled corticosteroids in a medium dosage are more effective than inhaled long-acting beta agonists, inhaled nedocromil (Tilade), and leukotriene inhibitors in improving asthma symptoms and lung function in children with mild to moderate asthma. There also is less use of bronchodilators and oral corticosteroids in patients using maintenance inhaled corticosteroids. Some short-term studies have found reduced growth velocity in children using inhaled corticosteroids regularly. However, multiple studies have found no evidence that children treated prophylactically with inhaled corticosteroids fail to reach their full adult height.

Unlike adults, children whose asthma is inadequately controlled with standard dosages of inhaled corticosteroids have not been shown to benefit from the addition of a long-acting beta agonist or from an increase in the dosage of inhaled corticosteroids. In two RCTs, benefit was demonstrated at three months with the addition of long-acting beta agonists, but 12-month follow-up in one of these studies found no difference in objective measures of lung function, symptom scores, or exacerbation rate. One study found that doubling the dosage of beclomethasone did not change objective measures of lung function or symptom scores but did result in a significant reduction of growth velocity. Some benefit can be achieved with the addition of oral theophylline, but long-term effects have not been assessed. A brief, four-week study of oral montelukast (Singulair) added to standard dosages of inhaled budesonide (Rhinocort Aqua) in children whose asthma was not adequately controlled demonstrated improved lung function and a reduction in the number of days with asthma exacerbations. Retrospective observational studies have shown that optimizing the dosage of inhaled corticosteroids provides better control of asthma than oral montelukast. However, one open-label, prospective, observational study of children with mild asthma found that, in real-world conditions, montelukast and inhaled corticosteroids were equally effective, possibly because of significantly better adherence with oral montelukast therapy. Compared with placebo, oral montelukast reduces total daily use of beta agonists, the need for rescue oral corticosteroids, and daytime symptom scores. In children, inhaled nedocromil reduces asthma symptom scores, asthma severity, and bronchodilator use and improves lung function compared with placebo. However, it is not as effective as inhaled corticosteroids. There is insufficient evidence to recommend prophylactic treatment with inhaled cromolyn (Intal) in children. Although it has been studied for use in children with asthma, it is less effective than inhaled corticosteroids in improving symptoms and lung function. Compared with placebo, salmeterol (Serevent) produces improved lung function in children, but there is conflicting evidence about whether it reduces the use of rescue or short-acting beta agonists. It was associated with a significant increase in bronchial hyperreactivity compared with inhaled corticosteroids. It is not recommended for use as monotherapy in children with asthma. However, limited evidence from a single three-month study with 210 patients shows that the combination of a long-acting beta agonist and inhaled corticosteroids may increase the number of symptom-free days. Oral theophylline initially seemed promising in the prophylactic treatment of childhood asthma. When compared with placebo, it significantly increased the mean morning peak expiratory flow rate and reduced the mean number of acute nighttime attacks and doses of bronchodilator used. However, it proved to be less promising when its use over one year was compared with the use of inhaled corticosteroids. Although there was no significant difference between theophylline and inhaled corticosteroids in reduction of asthma symptoms, there was an increased use of short-acting beta agonists and oral corticosteroids in children receiving theophylline. In summary, its use in children cannot be recommended because of the potential for serious side effects, such as cardiac arrhythmias or convulsions, if therapeutic blood levels are exceeded. Immunotherapy can be used as an adjunct to standard drug therapy in allergic asthmatic children. Sublingual (allergy drops) and injectable (allergy shots) therapies have been shown to reduce the presence of asthma and the overall use of asthma medication. Standard immunotherapy has a 1.7 to 15 percent reported range of adverse effects, but between 1985 and 1989, there were 17 standard immunotherapy-related deaths reported in the United States. Abstract Educating parents and caregivers of children with asthma to recognize and avoid triggers, and to understand the use of prescribed medications, the proper use of inhalation devices, and the importance of compliance and monitoring, has been shown to improve lung function and decrease school absenteeism and visits to the emergency department. Educational programs for the self-management of asthma by children and adolescents have similar outcomes. Children with moderate to severe asthma receive the most benefit from educational programs. The relative effectiveness of the various components of these programs has not been compared directly. However, education for children who have received emergency department care for asthma does not reduce subsequent emergency department care, hospitalizations, or unscheduled doctor visits. Asthma triggers include allergens (i.e., dust, mites, pollen), irritants(i.e., smoke, perfumes), physical environment (i.e., exercise, cold air), physiologic triggers (i.e., viral infections), and pharmacologic therapies (i.e., beta blockers). Environmental controls such as removal of carpeting in the child’s bedroom, and the use of pillow and mattress covers and air filtration systems have been suggested as ways to reduce asthma symptoms. However, recent evidence from better quality studies has shown that dust-mite avoidance measures (using impermeable mattress and pillow covers) did not improve symptoms or reduce medication use in adults with moderate to severe asthma. A similar study of children with allergic rhinitis showed no improvement in rhinitis symptoms using impermeable mattress and pillow covers compared with conventional covers. The role of avoidance measures as an adjunct to pharmacotherapy or immunotherapy has not been well studied. There is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against the use of air filtration units to reduce allergen levels in an effort to improve asthma symptoms. The use of a spacer with a metered-dose inhaler for delivery of the bronchodilator has been studied in inpatient, emergency department, and community settings in children as young as 10 months. Metered-dose inhaler delivery of short-acting beta agonists has been documented to be as effective as nebulizer delivery in the treatment of an acute asthma exacerbation and at a significantly lower cost. In addition, children using a metered-dose inhaler plus a spacer have shorter stays in the emergency department and lower pulse rates than those using a nebulizer. When a commercial spacer is unavailable, a device made from a 150-mL paper cup or a 500-mL plastic water bottle has been shown to be just as effective. The dosage required for an acute exacerbation has not been well defined and, in studies of children, has ranged from three sprays administered separately to 10 puffs per dose sprayed all at once into the spacer. Abstract Several new therapies have been introduced for the treatment of allergic asthma in children. Omalizumab (Xolair) is a recombinant DNA-derived humanized IgG monoclonal antibody that selectively binds to human immunoglobulin E (IgE). It inhibits the binding of IgE to the high-affinity IgE receptor on the surface of mast cells and basophils, limiting release of allergic mediators. Omalizumab is approved for use in children 12 years and older with moderate to severe persistent asthma who have a positive skin test or in vitro reactivity to a perennial aeroallergen and whose symptoms are inadequately controlled with inhaled corticosteroids. In children with moderate to severe asthma, omalizumab reduces the rate of serious asthma exacerbations and the need for physician or emergency department visits and hospitalizations, and improves asthma quality-of-life scores. Although this new agent seems promising, its use is likely to be limited because it has an estimated cost of $10,000 per patient per year. Its use may be cost-effective if limited to allergic asthmatics who are poorly controlled on maximal therapy and who are hospitalized five or more times (or for 20 days or longer) per year. Sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT) improves asthma symptoms and reduces medication use compared with placebo in children with asthma who are allergic to house dust mites and in children with allergic rhinitis that is related to a variety of common inhalant allergens. It appears to be safe, with unwanted effects being as low as 9.6 percent and no life-threatening adverse effects reported. However, SLIT has not been compared directly with standard immunotherapy. While SLIT is a procedure and therefore is not regulated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the extracts used for SLIT are FDA-approved for diagnosis and injectable immunotherapy only. Use of FDA-approved allergic extracts for SLIT is an off-label use. Health insurers consider SLIT investigational and do not cover its use.

f8e66fbc-8879-4494-8e14-a16f3e953cc4,"> > > > symptomviewer Trouble breathing is a reason to see a doctor right away. Here are symptoms to watch for: Tight breathing so that your child can barely speak or cry. Ribs are pulling in with each breath (called retractions). Trouble breathing is the most common type of pediatric emergency. Trouble breathing is the most common reason for getting admitted to the hospital. The first year of life is the most dangerous time to have trouble breathing. Reason: lung infections cause swelling of the airways. Babies have narrow airways to begin with. Small airways can close off quickly. Trouble breathing comes from problems in the lower throat, voice box, windpipe, or lung airways. Here are the common ones: (severe allergic reaction). Suspect when there is a sudden onset of trouble breathing and widespread hives. Common causes are bee stings or food allergies such as peanuts. . Symptoms of an asthma attack are wheezing, a cough, and trouble breathing. . A viral infection of the smallest airways in the lungs. Wheezing during the first 2 years of life is often caused by bronchiolitis. Main symptoms are fast breathing and wheezing. A viral infection of the voice box and windpipe. Main symptoms are a barky cough and hoarse voice. Some children with severe croup get a harsh, tight sound while breathing in. This is called stridor. . Suspect when there is a sudden onset of coughing and choking. Common objects are peanuts and seeds. Peak age is 1 to 4 years. . Main symptoms are a fever with a runny nose, sore throat, and bad cough. The flu virus can also cause complications such as pneumonia. Vaccine may prevent the disease. . An infection of the part of the lungs that supplies oxygen to the blood. Having pneumonia may lower blood oxygen levels and cause trouble breathing. Many bacterial causes can be prevented by vaccine. . A bacterial infection of the airway. Main symptoms are long coughing spells and choking. Very serious in infants. Can be prevented by vaccine. Severe trouble breathing (struggling for each breath, can barely speak or cry) Choked on a small object that could be caught in the throat Trouble breathing started suddenly after bee sting, new medicine or an allergic food You think your child has a life-threatening emergency Ribs are pulling in with each breath (called retractions) Trouble breathing and loud wheezing (tight sound with breathing out) Trouble breathing and stridor (harsh sound with breathing in) Nonstop coughing and not able to sleep or do normal activity You think your child needs to be seen, and the problem is urgent The causes of trouble breathing are often serious. In young children, trouble breathing can get worse quickly. Sometimes, you might not be sure if your child is having trouble breathing. If you are worried, call your child's doctor now. Here is some care advice that may help until you talk with your doctor. Breathe warm mist (such as with shower running in a closed bathroom). Reason: Relax the airway and loosen up any phlegm. Your baby can't breastfeed or drink from a bottle if the nose is blocked. Suction alone can't remove dry or sticky mucus. Use saline (salt water) nose drops or spray to loosen up the dried mucus. If you don't have saline, you can use a few drops of bottled water or clean tap water. If less than 1 year old, use bottled water or boiled tap water that has cooled. Step 1: Put 3 drops in each nostril. If age less than 1 year old, use 1 drop. Step 2: Suction each nostril out while closing off the other nostril. Then, do the other side. Step 3: Repeat nose drops and suctioning until the discharge is clear. How often: Do saline nose drops when your child can't breathe through the nose. Limit: No more than 4 times per day. Saline nose drops or spray can be bought in any drugstore. No prescription is needed. Tobacco smoke makes coughing and trouble breathing much worse. You have not heard back from a doctor or nurse within 30 minutes after placing your call Ribs start pulling in with each breath (retractions) And remember, contact your doctor if your child develops any of the 'Call Your Doctor' symptoms.

It is usually managed easily and should be included in your child’s asthma action plan. Having is not a reason for children to avoid sport. It is important that children who have asthma continue to exercise to help them stay fit and healthy. can be triggered by breathing in cold, dry air. But if your child’s asthma is properly controlled, they should be able to do as much exercise as they like. If your child gets asthma symptoms when they exercise, check that if they are taking a they are taking it correctly every day. It is worth checking with your doctor to see whether they need to start or to use a different preventer; to have their dosage changed; and that they are using the medicine correctly. Some people experience asthma symptoms after vigorous exercise. This is called exercise-induced asthma or exercised-induced bronchoconstriction. It occurs when the airways in the lung cool down and dry out after heavy breathing. This causes the small airways to become inflamed, swollen, and blocked by mucus, making it more difficult to breathe. It can also be triggered by exercising where there is pollution or pollen in the air, or by viruses. Exercise-induced asthma can happen to anyone, whether they have asthma or not. About 1 in 4 school children experience exercise-induced asthma. If they have asthma, exercise can be one of their triggers and having symptoms after exercising might mean their asthma is not properly under control. Symptoms of exercise-induced asthma often appear 5 to 10 minutes after your child has stopped exercising. After an attack, symptoms may not appear again for 2 or 3 hours, even if your child does more exercise. Exercise-induced asthma can be prevented by taking the following steps: Tell your child to take their reliever medication 15 minutes before warming up, if this is part of their asthma action plan, or if they or you are concerned they may need it. Watch for asthma symptoms during exercise and give your child reliever medication if symptoms appear. They should return to exercise only when the symptoms have stopped. If symptoms reappear, give them more reliever and don't let them return to exercise. Remember that asthma symptoms can occur up to 30 minutes after your child has stopped exercising. Have the reliever medication on hand. Children can forget to take their medication. Make sure you remind them and tell any adults who are supervising that your child may need reliever medication while they are playing sport. If your child does not respond to reliever medication after 4 minutes, they may be having a severe asthma attack: Sit your child down comfortably and reassure them. Give them 4 puffs of reliever medication, preferably through a spacer. If there is still no improvement after 4 minutes, call an ambulance immediately. Keep giving 4 puffs of reliever every 4 minutes until the ambulance arrives. Children should not have more reliever than this. Every child with asthma should have a written asthma action plan. This contains information on how to recognise asthma symptoms and what to do if they appear. Your doctor will develop the asthma plan with you. Tell them if your child will be playing sport so they can include relevant information in the asthma action plan. Tell your child’s coach or trainer about the child's asthma and give them a copy of the asthma action plan so they know what to do if your child develops symptoms.

5dfd7d49-2a25-450a-9883-e0584e60e2fd,"What to Expect at the Hospital After a Severe Asthma Attack Medically reviewed by — It’s often possible to manage an asthma attack at home with treatment. Usually, this means taking your rescue inhaler. Follow the that you and your doctor put together and take your medications as directed. If your symptoms don’t improve, you may need to seek emergency medical care. Seek emergency care for an asthma attack if you: experience worsening or no improvement in your symptoms after using your rescue inhaler If you experience any of the above symptoms, don’t hesitate to go to the hospital right away. At the hospital, healthcare providers can often treat an asthma attack and discharge you on the same day. In 2016, nearly adults and children visited the emergency department for asthma. In some cases, a severe asthma attack may require hospital admission. If you have persistent signs and symptoms of a severe asthma attack after of ongoing treatment in the emergency department, it’s likely you’ll be admitted to the hospital for additional treatment and monitoring. You may be nervous about going to the hospital for emergency asthma treatment, but knowing what to expect can help ease your worries. Once you arrive at the emergency room, you’ll need to receive treatment right away depending on the severity of the attack. You may receive one of the following treatments: These are the same types of medication as your rescue inhaler, but at the hospital, you may be able to take them with a nebulizer. You’ll wear a mask to breathe the medication deep into your lungs for quick relief. You can take these in pill form, or they may be given intravenously in severe cases. Corticosteroids will help decrease inflammation in your lungs. It often takes several hours for corticosteroids to start working. This medication is a bronchodilator that is sometimes used to open your airways if albuterol isn’t effective at getting asthma symptoms under control. In life threatening circumstances, you may need a breathing tube and oxygen in the hospital. This only occurs if other treatments haven’t worked and your symptoms continue to get worse. The amount of time you spend in the hospital will depend on how your symptoms respond to emergency treatments. Once your symptoms improve, your doctor will likely monitor you for a few hours to make sure you don’t experience another attack. Once your symptoms are under control, they can send you home. But if your symptoms don’t improve after emergency treatment, you may be admitted to the hospital and stay overnight, or for a few days. In severe, life threatening cases, a person with asthma may need to stay in the intensive care unit (ICU). Your doctors will continuously monitor your progress, giving you medications and checking your peak flow levels as needed. Doctors may also perform blood tests and X-rays to check your lungs. Once your doctors determine you’re healthy enough to return home, they’ll supply you with a discharge plan. This plan typically includes instructions on what medications you need to use and how to use them. You may also receive instructions to help you better recognize your symptoms and know what steps to take if you experience another asthma attack. If you have any questions about your symptoms or treatments, this is a good time to ask. Within a day or two after leaving the hospital, it’s important to see your doctor for a follow-up appointment. Hospitalization for asthma attacks often means that your usual asthma medications aren’t working effectively for you anymore. Even if you feel fine, it’s important to see your doctor to discuss adjusting your asthma treatments and your asthma action plan. In an older from 2009, the authors found that it’s better to see an asthma specialist (allergist or pulmonologist) or go to an asthma clinic after hospitalization rather than a primary care provider. Seeing specialized healthcare providers reduces the likelihood that you’ll need emergency care in the future. You may be mentally and physically exhausted after you return home from the hospital. After a potentially life threatening experience, it can take days or weeks to recover fully. Take your time getting back to your normal routine. Rest at home for as long as you can and avoid as many asthma triggers as possible. Ask friends and family to help you with household chores and tasks until you feel better. It may also be helpful to reach out to an asthma support group. An asthma attack that requires hospitalization can be emotionally draining. It helps to hear from and talk to others who’ve gone through similar situations. Asthma attacks can be life threatening, so it’s important to know when to head to a hospital for treatment. Knowing the first signs of an asthma attack can help you get the treatment you need sooner. You and your doctor can also adjust your treatment plan to keep your asthma under control and prevent future attacks.

Abstract Abstract The prevalence of asthma in children has increased 160 percent since 1980, and the disease currently affects nearly 5 million children in the United States. The National Asthma Education and Prevention Program provides guidelines for improved asthma care. The goals of this program are to limit the frequency, severity and costliness of asthma exacerbations through extensive education of physicians, children and caregivers. The four components of asthma management include regular assessment and monitoring, control of factors that contribute to or aggravate symptoms, pharmacologic therapy and education of children and their caregivers. The guidelines recommend a stepwise approach to pharmacologic treatment, starting with aggressive therapy to achieve control and followed by a “step down” to the minimal therapy that will maintain control. Quick relief of symptoms can be achieved preferentially by the use of short-acting beta2 agonists. Medications for long-term control should be considered for use in children with persistent symptoms. Inhaled corticosteroids are the most potent long-term anti-inflammatory medications. Other options include long-acting beta agonists, cromolyn sodium and nedocromil, antileukotriene agents and theophylline. All have advantages and disadvantages in individual situations. Asthma currently affects nearly 5 million children in the United States—more than 5 percent of the population younger than 18 years. In children four years or younger, the prevalence increased 160 percent from 1980 to 1994, and from 1980 to 1993, the death rate from asthma nearly doubled among persons five to 24 years. Asthma is 26 percent more prevalent and results in more severe disability and more frequent hospitalizations in black children than in white children, and black children are four to six times more likely to die of asthma. In children younger than 15 years, asthma accounts for 3 million physician visits, 570,000 emergency department visits, 164,000 hospital stays, 8.7 million prescriptions and 10 million missed school days per year. These statistics highlight the need to aggressively manage this disease and its symptoms. Unfortunately, anti-inflammatory agents such as inhaled corticosteroids are not yet prescribed for all patients with persistent asthma and, even when these medications are prescribed, they may be underutilized because parents fear the possibility of adverse side effects or children have difficulty using metered-dose inhalers (MDIs). New therapeutic options are available and with aggressive, appropriate therapy, physicians can prescribe an asthma management regimen to ameliorate symptoms, control disease and allow normal activity even in children as young as one to two years. Abstract Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disorder that produces airway hyper-responsiveness, airflow limitation and persistent respiratory symptoms, such as wheezing, coughing, chest tightness and shortness of breath. Airflow limitation is produced by acute bronchoconstriction, airway edema, mucous plug formation and airway remodeling. Asthma has immediate and delayed inflammatory responses. During the early phase, mast cells release mediators (e.g., histamine, leukotrienes, prostaglandins and thromboxanes) that lead to vasodilation, edema and bronchoconstriction. Leukotrienes, recently recognized as key culprits in asthma, are approximately 1,000 times more potent than histamines in mediating an inflammatory response. Their powerful chemotactic effect on neutrophils, monocytes and lymphocytes enhances the inflammatory response. During the late phase, cytokines are released that prolong inflammation and activate eosinophils, basophils, lymphocytes and mast cells. Chronic inflammation may result in smooth muscle hyperplasia, bronchial hyper-responsiveness and increased collagen deposition beneath the basement membrane, which further narrows the airway. Abstract Fifty to 80 percent of children with asthma develop symptoms before five years of age. Asthma symptoms vary widely and may mimic other childhood diseases (e.g., upper respiratory infections). When parents report episodic or persistent coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, rapid breathing or chest tightness, and if these symptoms are worse during the evening or early morning hours, or are associated with triggers (e.g., exercise, allergen exposure), the physician should suspect asthma. Alternative diagnoses should be excluded. Wheezing is not present in all patients with asthma and is not a sign exclusive to asthma. Wheezing may be caused by respiratory infections, rhinitis, sinusitis or vocal cord dysfunction. Before a definitive diagnosis of asthma is reached, consideration should be given to other factors, such as foreign body aspiration, or to other diseases, such as cystic fibrosis or heart disease, that may be causing the patient's symptoms. Obtaining a medical history is essential to establishing the diagnosis of asthma. Factors associated with the onset of asthma symptoms include allergy, family history of asthma or allergy, perinatal exposure to tobacco smoke, viral respiratory infections, male gender and low birth weight. Young children who develop persistent asthma are likely to have increased serum IgE levels at nine months of age, atopic dermatitis and rhinitis (unrelated to upper respiratory infection) during their first year, severe lower respiratory infections requiring hospitalization and diminished airway function by six years of age. Identification of symptom patterns, severity of symptoms and precipitating factors will support the diagnosis of asthma: “How often and when do episodes occur?” “What is their duration?” “Do symptoms occur or worsen during the night, with exercise or with an infection?” “Are they precipitated or aggravated by specific triggers?” “Do they interfere with sleep or daily activities, or require emergency department or hospital visits?” “How often are short-acting bronchodilators used?” “Are symptoms temporarily relieved by bronchodilators?” Pulmonary function tests should be, and allergy tests may be conducted to confirm the diagnosis. Spirometry performed before and 15 to 20 minutes after the child inhales a short-acting bronchodilator assesses airflow obstruction and determines its reversibility. Pulmonary function results consistent with asthma include variable airflow obstruction (20 percent or more) with serial spirometry or peak expiratory flow (PEF) measurements, and an increase in forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV) of 12 percent or more after bronchodilator therapy. Unfortunately, routine pulmonary function testing is unreliable in infants and many preschool children. These tests may be a more reliable indicator in children who are three to four years of age, but considerable variation exists because of poor technique and the use of adult-sized equipment. In most children, the primary diagnostic tool is clinical assessment. However, pulmonary function tests should be performed as soon as possible. A significant percentage of patients (75 to 85 percent) with asthma have positive immediate hypersensitivity skin tests (IgE), indicating the vital role that allergy plays in pediatric asthma. Atopy is the strongest predictor for wheezing progressing to asthma; therefore, a history of allergies is significant. Abstract Treatment should include patient education, trigger avoidance and drug therapy regimens that enable patients to function without limitations from asthma symptoms. summarizes the standard diagnosis and treatment parameters and provides a list of commonly used medications.

Rochester, N.Y.: American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology, 1999. Education for patients and caregivers should focus on the identification and avoidance of triggers, understanding the uses of prescribed medications and the importance of compliance and monitoring, as well as the proper use of inhalation devices. Daily self-management plans provide guidance for patients in peak flow monitoring, medication usage and symptom reporting. Emergency action plans help identify an exacerbation and delineate the actions to take. These plans should be developed in consultation with caregivers and patients, and provided to them in writing. Excellent examples of these plans are provided in the asthma guidelines from the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute. (The guidelines are available on the Web at:). Asthma triggers include allergens from dust mites or mold spores, animal dander, cockroaches, pollen, indoor and outdoor pollutants, irritants (e.g., tobacco smoke, smoke from wood-burning stoves or fireplaces, perfumes, cleaning agents), pharmacologic triggers (e.g., aspirin or other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, beta blockers and sulfites), physical triggers (e.g., exercise, hyper-ventilation, cold air) and physiologic factors (e.g., stress, gastroesophageal reflux, respiratory infection [viral, bacterial] and rhinitis). Environmental control measures include removing carpets from the patient's bedroom and living areas, weekly washing of bedding and clothing in water hotter than 55° C (130°F), the use of specially designed mattress and pillow covers, removing stuffed animals and similar objects that are likely to harbor allergens, keeping pets outdoors and using special furnace filters to remove airborne allergens. The Web site of the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology () is an excellent source of valuable, scientifically based information and specialized products for persons with asthma. Up to 80 percent of asthmatic children have allergic rhinitis. If specific IgE hypersensitivity has been identified by radioallergosorbent test (RAST) or skin testing, the triggers to be avoided can be specified. Consultation with an allergist can define the optimal regimen to reduce sensitivity to specific allergens. Because exposure to tobacco smoke is a major cause of respiratory problems in children who are predisposed to or already have asthma, exposure should be strictly avoided. Poor compliance is a major problem in pediatric asthma management, and several factors play a role in this. These include the route of administration (oral therapy is preferred to inhaled medication), frequency of dosing (once- or twice-daily regimens are preferred), medication effects (a slow onset of action and long duration on discontinuance have poor adherence rates) and the risk or concern of side effects. Many children cannot master proper MDI use even after repeated training, and when children succeed in mastering the proper MDI technique, only 10 to 15 percent of the medication reaches the lungs. Spacers make MDIs easier to use and are essential in many children younger than six years. MDIs with facemasks or nebulizers may be necessary in children up to five years, particularly during an asthma emergency. Dry powder inhalers (DPIs) can be used by children if they can demonstrate adequate inhalation velocity using a training whistle. Asthma is classified into four levels according to its severity: mild intermittent, mild persistent, moderate persistent or severe persistent. Treatment is based on the frequency and severity of exacerbations and the degree of lung function impairment, generally assessed by the variability in such objective measurements as FEV1 and PEF, as shown in . FEV = forced expiatory volume in one second; PEF = peak expiratory flow. —Standard symptoms are wheezing, coughing, dyspnea and chest tightness.

The National Asthma Education and Prevention Program guidelines recommend a stepwise approach to pharmacologic treatment starting with the most aggressive therapy necessary to achieve control, followed by a “step down” to the minimal therapy that will maintain control. The goals of pharmacologic therapy are to minimize daytime and nocturnal symptoms, the number of asthma episodes and the use of short-acting beta agonists, to improve PEF to 80 percent or more of personal best and to allow the child to maintain normal activities without producing adverse medication side effects. acute symptoms and before exercise to prevent exercise-induced bronchospasm. These drugs, including short-acting inhaled or oral beta agonists, short-course oral corticosteroids or ipratropium (Atrovent), are taken as needed for immediate relief of acute symptoms and before exercise to prevent exercise-induced bronchospasm. Short-acting beta agonists rapidly relax bronchial smooth muscle and are the therapy of choice to relieve acute symptoms and prevent exercise-induced bronchospasm. Beta agonists relieve symptoms but do not affect the underlying disease. These agents have a good safety record but are subject to overuse because they provide rapid relief and have a short duration of effect. Overuse reduces their efficacy and has been associated with increased bronchial hyper-reactivity, central nervous system overstimulation, worsening asthma and death. Overuse indicates that asthma is not controlled and requires increased anti-inflammatory treatment. Therefore, refills of reliever medications should be closely monitored. Most MDIs hold 120 two-spray doses and should last one month if used four times daily. With well-controlled asthma, one inhaler ideally should last for one year. Oral corticosteroids have broad anti-inflammatory effects and may be used in a limited, short course (three to 10 days) to gain initial control of the asthma and speed resolution of moderate-persistent or severe-persistent exacerbations. The anticholinergic drug ipratropium (in the orally inhaled formulation) is not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of asthma in children 12 years or younger. However, it has been prescribed for off-label use in children with asthma and may be helpful in those rare children who do not tolerate inhaled beta agonists, or it may be added to a beta agonist such as albuterol (Ventolin) to treat acute asthma exacerbations. Medications for long-term control should be taken daily to maintain control of asthma and prevent exacerbations. Inhaled corticosteroids are the most potent and effective long-term anti-inflammatory medications. They reduce inflammation in airways, improve pulmonary function to a greater degree than any other medication, reduce bronchial hyperre-sponsiveness and may reduce some aspects of airway remodeling, thus modifying disease progression. Some corticosteroids are effective in once- or twice-daily dosing regimens and may be used in all patient groups and for all levels of disease severity. The FDA recently approved budesonide inhalation suspension (Pulmicort Respules), the only nebulizable corticosteroid for children one to eight years. It is available in unit doses of 0.25 mg and 0.50 mg for once- or twice-daily dosing. Nonetheless, the improper use of inhaled corticosteroids does raise some concerns. Long-term use at high doses may inhibit growth velocity; therefore, children's growth should be monitored regularly, and the dosage should not exceed the recommended level unless other options, such as the addition of an antileukotriene agent or a long-acting beta agonist, have proved unsuccessful. Furthermore, inhaled corticosteroids do not provide immediate relief, and some patients may overuse bronchodilators and omit their anti-inflammatory therapy. Fear of adverse side effects (e.g., oropharyngeal candidiasis or inhibited growth) resulting from inhaled corticosteroids may discourage compliance. Patient education is essential to relieve these fears, and alternate therapies should be available for use in patients who are resistant to inhaled corticosteroids and those who cannot master the proper use of inhaler devices. A summary of comparative daily doses of inhaled corticosteroids can be accessed athttp://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/prof/lung/asthma/practgde/adult.pdf. Long-acting beta agonists are not as effective as inhaled corticosteroids in reducing airway hyper-responsiveness or controlling the inflammation of asthma. However, long-acting beta agonists are effective bronchodilators and may be used as add-on therapy with inhaled corticosteroids to reduce nocturnal asthma symptoms and prevent exercise-induced bronchospasm. They are not a substitute for anti-inflammatory medications and should not be used to treat patients with acute symptoms or exacerbations. The FDA approved a long-acting beta agonist, salmeterol (Serevent), for treatment of asthma in children 12 years and older. It may provide 24-hour bronchodilation with twice-daily dosing and may reduce nocturnal asthma symptoms and prevent exercise-induced bronchospasm. There is evidence that long-acting beta agonists used with inhaled corticosteroids have additive effects. In August of 2000, the FDA approved a combination of almeterol and flu-ticasone (Advair diskus) that should be released in the United States in April of 2001 in a formulation for children 12 years and older. The dosage is one inhalation twice daily. Theophylline produces mild-to-moderate bronchodilation and may be used as add-on therapy with anti-inflammatory medications. However, theophylline has a narrow therapeutic index, variable clearance rates, drug interactions and serious side effects; therefore, monitoring of blood levels is required. Theophylline is reserved for the treatment of patients with severe asthma, when polypharmacy is necessary. Cromolyn sodium (Intal) and nedocromil (Tilade) are first-line, daily anti-inflammatory inhaled agents that inhibit early- and late-phase bronchoconstriction, with virtually no serious side effects and no known drug interactions. These medications are available in MDI and nebulizer formulations; however, frequent administration is required (up to four doses daily), which may discourage compliance. Furthermore, these agents are less effective than corticosteroids in many patients. Nedocromil's bitter taste may discourage compliance in some children. Antileukotriene agents were developed to inhibit the effects of leukotrienes. This class of drugs represents the first new approach to asthma therapy in 25 years. The leukotriene receptor antagonists montelukast (Singulair) and zafirlukast (Accolate), and the 5-lipoxyge-nase inhibitor zileuton (Zyflo) are unique in their ability to target specific components of asthmatic inflammation. Montelukast is available for the treatment of children with asthma who are six to 14 years of age, at a dosage of 5 mg once daily at bedtime. A 10-mg tablet is approved for use in children older than 15 years, and the FDA recently approved a 4- or 5-mg chewable tablet for children two to five years. Zafirlukast is also FDA-labeled for the treatment of children with asthma who are older than seven years, at a dosage of 10 mg twice daily. Although zileuton is FDA-labeled for pediatric treatment, it is prescribed infrequently because it has a four-times daily dosing regimen and a risk of hepatotoxicity that requires monitoring. Although the role of these drugs continues to evolve, the antileukotrienes have demonstrated efficacy against exercise- and allergen-induced bronchoconstriction, and an additive benefit in the treatment of patients with symptomatic, moderate asthma who are taking maintenance inhaled corticosteroids. They reduce the need for rescue medication in patients with mild asthma and are appropriate as long-term therapy in patients who require more than an occasional treatment with beta-agonist bronchodilators. Data on the safety of montelukast and zafirlukast are excellent, with an adverse event profile similar to that of placebo. Churg-Strauss syndrome (an eosinophil-associated vasculitis) has reportedly been associated (rarely) with corticosteroid withdrawal and may represent an unmasking of a previously unrecognized condition.

d8d30444-a275-40a2-8e69-a4fce941fa6d,"Medically reviewed by — Dairy is thought to be linked to asthma. Drinking or eating dairy products doesn’t cause asthma. However, if you have a dairy allergy, it may trigger symptoms that are similar to asthma. Also, if you have asthma and a dairy allergy, dairy may worsen your asthma symptoms. About of children with asthma also have dairy and other food allergies. Children with food allergies are up to more likely to have asthma or other allergic conditions than children without a food allergy. Both asthma and food allergies are set off by the same reactions. The immune system goes into overdrive because it mistakes a food or other allergen as an attacker. Here’s how dairy can trigger asthma symptoms and some of the milk myths that exist. Asthma is a condition that makes the airways narrow and inflamed or irritated. Your airways or breathing tubes pass from the mouth, nose, and throat into the lungs. Almost of people have asthma. Both children and adults can have this lung disease. can be a long-lasting and life-threatening condition. Asthma makes it difficult to breathe because it makes airways swollen and inflamed. They may also fill with mucus or fluid. Additionally, the round muscles that circle your airways may tighten. This makes your breathing tubes even more narrow. Milk and other dairy products won’t cause asthma. This is true whether you have a dairy allergy or not. Similarly, if you have asthma but not a dairy allergy, you can safely eat dairy. It won’t trigger your asthma symptoms or make them worse. Medical research confirms that dairy isn’t related to worsening asthma symptoms. A study on 30 adults with asthma showed that drinking cow’s milk didn’t make their symptoms worse. Additionally, a 2015 study found that mothers who ate a high amount of dairy products during pregnancy had babies with a lower risk of asthma and other allergy disorders, such as eczema. The percentage of people with a dairy allergy is low. About of have a dairy allergy. Almost of children grow out of this food allergy during childhood or the teenage years. Adults can also develop a dairy allergy. A dairy allergy can cause breathing, stomach, and skin reactions. Some of these are similar to asthma symptoms, and include: If these allergy symptoms happen at the same time as an asthma attack, they make it more difficult to breathe. Milk allergy symptoms also include: In serious cases, an allergic reaction to dairy can cause anaphylaxis. This leads to swelling in the throat and narrowing of the breathing tubes. Anaphylaxis can lead to low blood pressure and shock and requires immediate medical attention. One reason that dairy may be linked to asthma is because it’s thought to cause more mucus in your body. People with asthma can get too much mucus in their lungs. The points out that milk and dairy don’t cause your body to produce more mucus. In some people with a dairy allergy or sensitivity, milk may thicken saliva in the mouth. A dairy or milk allergy happens when your immune system goes into overdrive and thinks milk and dairy products are harmful. Most people with a dairy allergy are allergic to cow’s milk. Some people may also have a reaction against milk from other animals such as goats, sheep, and buffalo. If you have a dairy allergy, your body is reacting against the proteins found in milk. Dairy contains two types of proteins: Casein makes up of milk protein. It’s found in the solid part of milk. Whey protein makes up 20 percent of milk. It is found in the liquid part. You may be allergic to both types of milk protein or just one. to dairy cows may also be linked to milk allergies. Avoid all milk and dairy products if you have a dairy allergy. Read food labels carefully. Milk proteins are added to a surprising number of packaged and processed foods, including: A milk or dairy allergy isn’t the same as . Lactose intolerance is a food sensitivity or intolerance. Unlike milk or food allergies, it’s not linked to your immune system. Adults and children who are lactose intolerant can’t digest lactose, or milk sugar, properly. This happens because they don’t have enough of an enzyme called lactase. Lactose can only be broken down by lactase. Lactose intolerance mainly causes digestive effects, not respiratory ones. Some symptoms are similar to those that happen in a milk allergy: See your doctor if you have any kind of symptoms after drinking milk or eating dairy foods. An allergy specialist can do a skin test and other testing to find out if you have an allergy or dairy intolerance. Blood tests can also show if you have other food allergies. Your doctor will also look at your medical history and your symptoms. Sometimes a test may not show that you have a food allergy. It may be useful to keep a food journal. Another option is to try an . This diet removes dairy for a few weeks then slowly adds it back in. Record all symptoms and let your doctor know. Dairy and other food allergies are treated by avoiding the food completely. Keep an epinephrine injection pen in your home, at school, or where you work. This is very important if you’re at risk of anaphylaxis. Asthma is treated with prescription medications. You’ll likely need more than one kind of drug. These include: These open up the airways to prevent or treat an asthma attack. These medications help balance the immune system and prevent asthma symptoms. You can find delicious alternatives to dairy. Here are the nine best non-dairy substitutes for milk. Asthma can be a life-threatening condition. See your doctor if you have any asthma or allergy symptoms. Attend all follow-up appointments and let your doctor know if you have any changes in your symptoms. Dairy products don’t seem to worsen asthma in those without a dairy allergy. If you think you may have a dairy or other food allergy, tell your doctor immediately. Allergic reactions can trigger or worsen asthma symptoms in some people. Talk to your doctor or nutritionist about the best for your asthma and allergies. Carry extra asthma medication and prescriptions with you at all times. A bronchodilator inhaler or an epinephrine injection pen can save your life if you have a serious reaction.

Our general interest e-newsletter keeps you up to date on a wide variety of health topics. Confused about your asthma medications? Here's what you need to know to sort out the main classes and numerous subtypes of asthma drugs. The types and doses of asthma medications you need depend on your age, your symptoms, the severity of your asthma and medication side effects. Because your asthma can change over time, work closely with your doctor to track your symptoms and adjust your asthma medications, if needed. Taken regularly to control chronic symptoms and prevent asthma attacks — the most important type of treatment for most people with asthma Combination inhalers that contain both a corticosteroid and a Taken as needed for rapid, short-term relief of symptoms — used to prevent or treat an asthma attack Oral and intravenous corticosteroids (for serious asthma attacks) Taken regularly or as needed to reduce your body's sensitivity to a particular allergy-causing substance (allergen) Taken with control medications to stop underlying biological responses causing inflammation in the lungs — used to better manage severe asthma symptoms Many people with asthma need to take long-term control medications daily, even when they don't have symptoms. There are several types of long-term control medications, including the following. These anti-inflammatory drugs are the most effective and commonly used long-term control medications for asthma. They reduce swelling and tightening in your airways. You may need to use these medications for several months before you get their maximum benefit. In children, long-term use of inhaled corticosteroids can delay growth slightly, but the benefits of using these medications to maintain good asthma control generally outweigh the risks. Regular use of inhaled corticosteroids helps keep asthma attacks and other problems linked to poorly controlled asthma in check. Inhaled corticosteroids don't generally cause serious side effects. When side effects occur, they can include mouth and throat irritation and oral yeast infections. If you're using a metered dose inhaler, use a spacer and rinse your mouth with water after each use to reduce the amount of drug remaining in your mouth. These medications block the effects of leukotrienes, immune system chemicals that cause asthma symptoms. Leukotriene modifiers can help prevent symptoms for up to 24 hours. Examples include: In rare cases, montelukast is linked to psychological reactions, such as agitation, aggression, hallucinations, depression and suicidal thinking. See your doctor right away if you have any unusual reactions. These bronchodilator (brong-koh-DIE-lay-tur) medications open airways and reduce swelling for at least 12 hours. They're used on a regular schedule to control moderate to severe asthma and to prevent nighttime symptoms. Although they're effective, they've been linked to severe asthma attacks. For this reason, are taken only in combination with an inhaled corticosteroid. The most commonly used for asthma is salmeterol (Serevent). You take this bronchodilator daily in pill form to treat mild asthma. Theophylline (Theo-24, others) relaxes the airways and decreases the lungs' response to irritants. It can be helpful for nighttime asthma symptoms. You might need regular blood tests to make sure you're getting the correct dose. Potential side effects of theophylline include insomnia and gastroesophageal reflux. Combination inhalers: Corticosteroids and long-acting beta agonists Some inhaled asthma medication combinations contain both a corticosteroid and a bronchodilator: These asthma medications open the lungs by relaxing airway muscles. Often called rescue medications, they can ease worsening symptoms or stop an asthma attack in progress. They begin working within minutes and are effective for four to six hours. They're not for daily use. Some people use a quick-relief inhaler before exercise to help prevent shortness of breath and other asthma symptoms. Possible side effects include jitteriness and palpitations. If your symptoms are minor and infrequent or if you have exercise-induced asthma, you might manage your symptoms with one of these medications alone. However, most people with persistent asthma also need an inhaled corticosteroid or other long-term control medication. If you need to use your inhaler more often than your doctor recommends, your asthma is not under control — and you may be increasing your risk of a serious asthma attack. Ipratropium (Atrovent HFA) is a short-acting bronchodilator that's usually prescribed for emphysema or chronic bronchitis, but is sometimes used to treat asthma attacks. It may be used either with or as an alternative to short-acting beta agonists. These medications may be taken to treat severe asthma attacks. They can cause bothersome short-term side effects and more-serious side effects if they're taken for a long period. Examples include: Long-term use of these medications can cause side effects including cataracts, thinning bones (osteoporosis), muscle weakness, decreased resistance to infection, high blood pressure and reduced growth in children. Medications that focus on treating allergy triggers include: Allergy shots (immunotherapy) may be an option if you have allergic asthma that can't be controlled by avoiding triggers. You'll begin with skin tests to determine which allergens trigger your asthma symptoms. Then you'll get a series of injections containing small doses of those allergens. You generally receive injections once a week for a few months, and then once a month for three to five years. In some cases, immunotherapy can be done more quickly. Over time, you should lose your sensitivity to the allergens. These include oral and nasal spray antihistamines and decongestants, as well as corticosteroid and cromolyn nasal sprays. Allergy medications are available over-the-counter and in prescription form. They can help with allergic rhinitis but aren't substitutes for asthma medications. Corticosteroid nasal spray helps reduce inflammation without causing the rebound effect sometimes caused by nonprescription sprays. Because it has few, if any, side effects, cromolyn is safe to use over long periods of time. Your doctor may recommend treatment with biologics if you have severe asthma with symptoms not easily managed by control medications. Omalizumab (Xolair) is sometimes used to treat asthma triggered by airborne allergens. If you have allergies, your immune system produces allergy-causing antibodies to attack substances that generally cause no harm, such as pollen, dust mites and pet dander. Omalizumab blocks the action of these antibodies, reducing the immune system reaction that causes allergy and asthma symptoms. Omalizumab is given by injection every two to four weeks. It isn't generally recommended for children under 12. In rare cases, this medication has triggered a life-threatening allergic reaction (anaphylaxis). In addition, the FDA has issued a warning about a slightly increased risk of heart and brain blood vessel problems while taking this drug. Anyone who gets an injection of this drug should be monitored closely by health professionals in case of a severe reaction. A newer class of biologic drugs has been developed to target specific substances secreted by certain immune system cells. For some people, certain white blood cells, called eosinophils, build up within body tissues. Eosinophils secrete substances, called cytokines, which cause inflammation. These biological drugs target eosinophils and cytokines, reducing their numbers within the body and lowering inflammation. Taken together with other asthma medications, biologics help people with more severe forms of asthma achieve greater symptom control. These medications include: Tracking symptoms and side effects and adjusting your treatment accordingly is key to keeping your asthma symptoms under control. With your doctor or other health care providers, write a detailed plan for taking long-term control medications and for managing an asthma attack. Then follow your plan. Know when to adjust your medications, when to see your doctor and how to recognize an asthma emergency. If your doctor has prescribed a peak flow meter to measure how well your lungs are working, use it according to your plan. Even if you feel well, take your medications as prescribed and track your symptoms until you talk to your doctor. Fanta C, et al.

eecb5627-49a1-4713-80eb-5fcac99b012e,"4 Debunked Myths About Living with Asthma During Cold and Flu Season Cold and flu season can be particularly challenging for people who have asthma. A number of myths and false claims about how best to treat asthma during this time continue to persist. Properly managed asthma can help with symptoms brought on by the cold and flu. Cold and flu season can take a toll on anyone, but for those living with asthma, this time of year can be particularly challenging. “When people come into the hospital for asthma exacerbation around this time of year, it’s generally in the setting of a viral upper respiratory tract infection or influenza. That tends to be the provoking factor,” , a pulmonologist at Northwestern Medicine Regional Medical Group in Winfield, Illinois, told Healthline. As common as colds and flus are, he says many misunderstandings about how the conditions relate to asthma still exist. Here’s the truth about four common myths that continue to confuse people about asthma and the flu. Seides says this myth is based on the misconception that the flu vaccine will cause asthma to flare up. However, he says there’s no evidence to support this claim. “If you have asthma, you absolutely need the flu vaccine more than the average person, because people with asthma and other chronic lung disease, such as emphysema, can have a very severe course with influenza that is rather exaggerated relative to someone who has otherwise healthy lungs,” Seides said. Cheryl Nickerson, a respiratory specialist and clinical product manager at , agrees. She says the only people who shouldn’t get the flu shot are those who’ve had a severe allergic reaction to the shot in the past that was diagnosed by a doctor. “Some people think they’ve had a reaction to the flu shot, but it was something else that coincided at the same time. Unless a doctor told them specifically that they shouldn’t get it, everyone with asthma should get the flu shot,” Nickerson said. 2. If you have well-managed asthma, a cold or the flu won’t cause issues A person who’s properly managing their asthma with medication and other measures won’t experience as severe cold or flu symptoms compared to someone with unmanaged asthma. However, Nickerson says a cold or flu is what makes someone who has well-managed asthma have an exacerbation. “Before you know you’re exposed to a cold or flu, the immune system knows and is planning an attack because it doesn’t want that virus to settle in the body. Most people recognize symptoms of cold and flu as watery eyes, runny nose, and coughing and sneezing, but that’s all associated with the stage of the cold and flu that’s called inflammation. Inflammation is just the body trying to keep it from getting deeper into your lungs,” she said. Even with well-managed asthma, when the immune system recognizes a cold or flu, Nickerson says it creates more inflammatory cells. “That can trigger a person with well-controlled asthma to develop more asthma symptoms,” she said. Seides adds it’s important to stay on medications even if you’re not feeling any symptoms. “Sometimes if people have well-controlled asthma, they want to get off their meds, but it’s well controlled because of the medications. If asthma is left untreated, even if it’s quiet, it causes changes in your airways, something called remodeling, which is likely to make you more prone to more severe asthma later, and severe asthma is more resistant to treatment,” he said. 3. Allergens are the most common cause for increased asthma symptoms Seides says asthma that’s provoked by certain allergens is a small subset of asthma. “Asthma is a complex disease with a common thread that has to do with airway hyperactivity and a certain characteristic and appearance on pulmonary function tests, but the kind of asthma that is specifically related to certain allergens is a small subset of that,” he said. The reason for this misconception comes from a logical place, Nickerson says. “As an asthma educator, one of the biggest things I talk about with people who have asthma is how to manage triggers, and of course allergens is a big trigger. We talk about eradicating the allergens from the house by removing carpet and stuffed animals and other things that could carry the allergens, but in reality it’s not the allergens that are the number one trigger. The number one trigger is cold and flu viruses,” she said. She points out that in children, cold and flu viruses trigger 80 percent of asthma exacerbations. “Even if they manage those allergens, they could still come down with asthma exacerbation from cold and flu,” she said. 4. Children with asthma get more colds than kids without it All children — with or without asthma — get about the same number of colds per year, Nickerson says. “Most children have six to eight colds per year, but for children with asthma, when they get a cold it seems to hit them harder and the symptoms are worse. Also, [the cold or virus] may keep the airways reactive, so even if the virus goes away, the child may still be having symptoms, such as coughing,” she said. How can I avoid asthma exacerbations during cold and flu season? Seides reiterates that the flu shot is the best defense during this time of year. “The reason we doctors are so concerned about influenza virus — though it varies from year to year — is because it can cause very severe disease and kills many people every year. We also talk so much about it because we have a vaccine that can either prevent or significantly reduce the severity of imprecation in people,” he said. While there are other respiratory viruses that can be problematic for people with asthma, he says doctors can only help people manage them symptomatically and supportively. To best guard yourself against other colds and viruses, Nickerson says to keep the following in mind: Try not to share food and drinks, as well as objects that can harbor germs, such as cellphones. If you have asthma, ensure that your nebulizers are clean, properly working, and have been replaced within the last 6 months. “And make sure you have an up-to-date asthma action plan. This is a plan that you’ve worked out with your doctor to monitor symptoms and to know how to take your medications correctly if you experience an increase in symptoms,” Nickerson said. “You can’t avoid all colds and the flu, but being prepared is the best way to face them,” she added.

cb74cd9f-0fea-4e91-9aa1-b92c3496d5f4,"— — You’ll notice your breathing getting heavier whenever you exercise or climb a flight of stairs. You breathe harder because your body’s need for oxygen increases with exertion. Heavy breathing when you’re not moving is a sign that your body has to work harder to get enough oxygen. This may be because less air is getting in through your nose and mouth, or too little oxygen is making its way into your bloodstream. Anything from a stuffed nose to a lung disorder, like , can make your breathing more labored. Read on to learn more about causes of heavy breathing and how to treat this symptom. To understand what causes heavy breathing, you need to know how breathing works. Breathing is a coordinated effort that involves your nose, mouth, and lungs. When you inhale, air enters through your nose and mouth, and makes its way into your lungs. It enters the balloon-like air sacs, called alveoli. From there, oxygen moves into your bloodstream to be transported to your body. Following are some possible causes for heavy breathing. Viruses and bacteria can clog your nasal passages, making it harder to draw enough oxygen into your airways. Colds increase the amount of mucus your body produces. cause inflammation in the sinuses, the air-filled spaces behind your nose and cheeks. Infections caused by viruses will clear up on their own over time. Sinus infections caused by bacteria are treated with antibiotics. Allergies are an overreaction by your immune system to normally harmless substances in your environment, like pollen, grass, or pet dander. When your immune system reacts, it triggers your body to release the chemical histamine. If you’re unfamiliar with the symptoms of an allergy, you may think you’re coming down with a cold. An allergic reaction causes symptoms like these: The most serious kind of allergic reaction is called . It can cause your throat and mouth to swell up, making it hard to breathe.

If you have a BMI of 30 or higher, the definition of obesity, you might have more trouble breathing, especially when you exercise. Weight loss, ideally with diet and exercise, is the best way to combat health issues related to obesity. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a group of lung diseases, including , , and , that make it harder to breathe. It’s often caused by smoking-related lung damage. Medicines, pulmonary rehabilitation, and supplemental oxygen can help you manage these symptoms. You can get when a condition like coronary artery disease or a heart attack damages your heart to the point where it can’t effectively pump blood out to your body. Shortness of breath is caused by blood backing up in the blood vessels and fluid leaking into your lungs. Medicines, implantable devices, and surgery are all treatments for heart failure. Trouble breathing and shortness of breath can be symptoms of , especially in the late stages of the disease. How treatable the cancer is depends on its stage, which is determined by the size of the tumor and whether it has spread. What causes heavy breathing while you’re sleeping?

This blockage repeatedly stops your breathing throughout the night. One of the main treatments for sleep apnea is . It uses a device consisting of a mask that blows air into your airway while you sleep. You can also try an oral appliance to hold your jaw in the correct position at night. Other causes of heavy breathing while you sleep include: nasal congestion from a cold or respiratory infection See your doctor if your breathing becomes heavy and doesn’t go away on its own within a week or two. Call right away for help if you have these symptoms, which could indicate a medical emergency: swelling of your mouth or tightness in your throat Treatment for heavy breathing depends on what caused it. For lung conditions like asthma and , treatments include: medicines such as bronchodilators and corticosteroids to bring down inflammation and open up the airways pulmonary rehabilitation, which is a program that combines exercise therapy, nutritional advice, and education For colds, sinus infections, and respiratory infections, treatments include: antibiotics, if bacteria caused the infection (These drugs won’t help with viral infections.) nasal decongestants or steroid sprays to shrink swollen nasal passages antihistamines to bring down inflammation in the nasal passages medicines such as diuretics, vasodilators, beta-blockers, and ACE inhibitors pacemaker, implantable cardioverter defibrillator, left ventricular assist device, and other implantable devices coronary artery bypass grafting, valve surgery, and other procedures Some causes of heavy breathing, like obesity and sleep apnea, may be preventable. Other causes, like infections, may be harder for you to control. Here are a few things you can do to prevent heavy breathing: Wash your hands throughout the day and avoid anyone who’s sick, so you don’t catch an infection.

Scichilone Asthma is a complex inflammatory disorder of the airways characterized by airway hyper-responsiveness and variable, reversible, airflow obstruction. Bronchial thermoplasty (BT) is a new modality for treating asthma. It targets airway smooth muscles (ASM) by delivering a controlled specific amount of thermal energy (radiofrequency ablation) to the airway wall through a dedicated catheter. The use of bronchial thermoplasty has been widely discussed for its potential in the treatment of asthma, since it seems to be able to reduce the symptoms of asthma. The definitive study for BT (AIR2 trial) employed a randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled design and enrolled 288 subjects with severe persistent asthma from 30 US and international centers. The results of the AIR2 trial demonstrated clinically significant benefits of BT compared with the sham group at one year post-treatment, including an improvement in asthma-related quality of life, 32% reduction in severe exacerbations, 84% reduction in emergency department visits for asthma symptoms, and a 66% reduction in time lost from work/school/other daily activities because of asthma symptoms. Preclinical work showed that ASM is reduced after BT by at least 3 years after treatment. The recent article from the ARI2 trial study group analyses the long-term safety and effectiveness of BT in patients with severe persistent asthma and demonstrates the 5-year durability of the benefits of BT in the control of symptoms and safety. It supports the evidence that reduction in asthma attacks, ER visits, and hospitalizations for respiratory symptoms are maintained for at least 5 years. There is a pressing need to understand the underlying mechanism(s) of BT and how the delivered heat is translated into clinical benefit.

The recommends that adults engage in a minimum of 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity (or 75 minutes of vigorous exercise) every week. However, for some people, physical activity and sports can trigger asthma symptoms, such as: In turn, these symptoms make it difficult, and potentially dangerous, to exercise. Taking proper precautions and developing a symptom management strategy can help you enjoy the benefits of exercise while minimizing potential discomfort. Here’s what you need to know about exercising safely if you have allergic asthma. Asthma affects more than in the United States. The most common type is allergic asthma, which is triggered or worsened by certain allergens, including: Whether you’re working out or simply engaging in everyday activities, avoiding these common allergens can help you keep allergic asthma symptoms at bay. Exercise itself can also trigger asthma symptoms. This is known as exercise-induced asthma. The Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America estimates that up to of people who are diagnosed with asthma experience exercise-induced asthma while engaging in physical activity. Asthma symptoms may begin while you’re exercising and often worsen 5 to 10 minutes after ending your workout. Depending on the severity of symptoms, you may need to take your rescue inhaler. In some people, symptoms may resolve on their own within a half hour. However, even if symptoms go away without medication, in some cases people may get a second wave of asthma symptoms anywhere from 4 to 12 hours later. These late-phase symptoms usually aren’t severe and may resolve within a day. If symptoms are severe, don’t hesitate to take your rescue medication. If you think you may have exercise-induced asthma, talk to your doctor about getting tested to confirm a diagnosis and develop a plan to manage your symptoms. Your doctor can check your breathing before, during, and after physical activity to see how your lungs are functioning and determine if exercise is triggering your asthma. If you’re diagnosed with exercise-induced asthma, you should also work with your physician to create an . That way, you’ll know what to do in an emergency and have a list of medications on hand. Engaging in regular physical activity is important for your health, even if you have allergic asthma. Here are some tips to help you exercise and engage in sports more safely: can be taken preventively to help you avoid symptoms of exercise-induced asthma. Your doctor may recommend taking a short-acting beta-agonist (or bronchodilator) 10 to 15 minutes before a workout or a long-acting bronchodilator up to an hour before exercise. In very rare cases, your doctor might recommend mast cell stabilizers. Cold environments can provoke symptoms of allergic asthma. If you must exercise outdoors in the winter, may help you prevent symptoms. Hot, humid environments are a breeding ground for allergens like mold and dust mites. If you must exercise outdoors in the summer, schedule workouts in the mornings or evenings, when there are generally lower temperatures and humidity levels. Avoid exercising outdoors on high-allergen and high-pollution days, which can increase your chances of triggering allergic asthma. Choose activities that involve “short bursts of exercise,” such as volleyball, baseball, gymnastics, walking, and leisurely bike rides. These activities may be less likely to trigger symptoms than those that require long periods of constant activity, like soccer, running, or basketball. Exercise equipment such as bikes, jump ropes, weights, and mats, may collect pollen or get moldy if left outdoors. Store your gear inside to avoid unnecessary exposure to asthma-inducing allergens. . Stretching before and after your workout may lessen exercise-related symptoms of asthma. Schedule time for a warm-up before you get going and a cool-down after each activity. If your doctor prescribed an inhaler to help you manage exercise-induced asthma, make sure you have it on hand during your workout. Using it can help reverse certain symptoms if they do occur. Some mild symptoms of allergic asthma that occur while exercising may resolve on their own. More severe reactions could require medical attention. Seek emergency medical help right away if you experience: an asthma attack that doesn’t improve after using your rescue inhaler an inability to say more than a few words at a time due to shortness of breath Asthma symptoms shouldn’t prevent you from having an active lifestyle. Avoiding your triggers, taking prescribed medication, and choosing the right kind of activity can help you exercise safely and prevent symptoms. Stay aware of how your body is responding to physical activity and always have an asthma action plan in place in case you need it. — Finding the Right Specialist for Allergic Asthma - Learn the Difference Allergic Asthma and Your Lifestyle: Assess the Impact Allergic Asthma Attack: When Do You Need to Go to the Hospital?

Asthma during Pregnancy Symptoms, Safe Medications, and Triggers Medical Editor: Facts about and Definition of Asthma during Pregnancy What Should I Do If I'm Pregnant and Have a Severe Asthma Attack? Which Asthma Medications Are Safe to Use During Pregnancy? Which Medications Should Not Be Used during Pregnancy? Which Medications Treat and Manage Asthma during Pregnancy? Which Vaccines Are Recommended to Decrease Severe Asthma Attacks during Pregnancy? What Are the Negative Effects of Asthma Attacks on Pregnancy and Fetal Outcome? Facts about and Definition of Asthma during Pregnancy is an exciting time in a woman's life. Changes in your body may be matched by changes in your emotions. You don't know what to expect from day to day. You may feel tired, uncomfortable, or cranky one day and energetic, healthy, and happy the next. The last thing you need is an . is one of the most common medical conditions in the U.S. and other developed countries. If you have , you know what it means to have an exacerbation (attack). You may wheeze, , or have difficulty breathing. Remember that the fetus (developing baby) in your uterus (womb) depends on the air you breathe for its oxygen. When you have an attack, the fetus may not get enough oxygen. This can put the fetus in great danger. If you took medication for your asthma before you became , especially if your asthma was well controlled, you may be tempted to stop taking your medication out of fear that it might harm the fetus. That would be a mistake without the advice of your health-care provider. The risk to the fetus from most is tiny compared to the risk from a severe asthma attack. Moreover, women with asthma that is uncontrolled are more likely to have complications during pregnancy. Their are more likely to be born preterm (premature), to be small or underweight at birth, and to require longer hospitalization after birth. Also, uncontrolled asthma can place your health at risk since you are more likely to experience or . Both of these conditions can place your baby at risk, as well. The more severe the asthma, the greater the risk to the fetus. In rare cases, the fetus can even die from oxygen deprivation. How pregnancy may affect your asthma is unpredictable. About one-third of women with asthma experience improvement while they are pregnant, about one-third get worse, and the other third stay about the same. The milder your asthma was before pregnancy, and the better it is controlled during pregnancy, the better your chances of having few or no asthma symptoms during pregnancy. If asthma control deteriorates during pregnancy, the symptoms tend to be at their worst during weeks 24-36 (months six through eight). Most women experience the same level of symptoms in all their pregnancies. Although it is rare to have an asthma attack during delivery, some of the medications used during or immediately after delivery can worsen asthma. Now, as throughout your pregnancy, it is important to let health-care professionals know that you have asthma. In most cases, symptoms return to ""normal"" within three months after delivery. The important thing to remember is that your asthma can be controlled during pregnancy. If your asthma is controlled, you have just as much chance of a healthy, normal pregnancy and delivery as a woman who does not have asthma. In pregnancy, just as before you were pregnant, you need an action plan for your asthma. Let your health-care provider know as soon as you know you are pregnant. Together, the two of you should review your current action plan and make changes if necessary. You may find that your symptoms have changed or that your sensitivity to certain triggers is different. Be sure to tell him or her all the medications you are taking, not just your asthma medications. Symptoms of asthma during pregnancy are the same as those of asthma at any other time. However, each woman with asthma responds differently to pregnancy. You may have milder symptoms or more severe symptoms, or your symptoms may be pretty much what they are when you aren't pregnant. In general, asthma triggers are the same during pregnancy as at any other time. Like the situation with asthma symptoms, during pregnancy sensitivity to triggers may be increased, decreased, or stay about the same. These differences are attributed to changes in hormones during pregnancy. Common triggers of asthma attacks include the following: Respiratory infections such as a , , , and : Both bacterial and viral infections can trigger an asthma attack. (), or regurgitation of stomach contents up the or ""food pipe"" Allergic rhinitis ( or seasonal ) to irritants, such as dust/dust mites, molds, feathers, pet dander, etc. What Should I Do If I'm Pregnant and Have a Severe Asthma Attack? If you have asthma and are pregnant, you should be extra vigilant about your symptoms. Keep in mind that your symptoms may be worse than usual. You may have an attack that is more severe than you are used to. Don't go by how your asthma has been in the past, go by your symptoms now. If you are having chest tightness or difficulty catching your breath, go to the nearest hospital emergency department. There you can be given oxygen and ""rescue"" medications that are safe for you and your baby. Do not plan to travel to remote areas with difficult access to health-care facilities. The best way to treat asthma is to avoid having an attack in the first place. Avoid exposure to your asthma triggers. This might improve your symptoms and reduce the amount of medication you have to take. If you smoke, quit. can harm you and your fetus. Avoid being around others who are ; can trigger an asthma attack. Secondhand smoke also can cause asthma and other health problems in your children. If you have symptoms of (for example, ), avoid eating large meals or lying down after eating. Stay away from people who have a cold, the flu, or other infection. Avoid your known personal triggers (cat dander, , whatever sets you off). Which Asthma Medications Are Safe to Use During Pregnancy? Asthma medications usually are taken in the same stepwise sequence you would take them in before pregnancy. When your health-care provider considers your use of a drug during pregnancy, he or she reflects on the following questions: What information is available to assess the effect of the drug on the fetus? What is the effect of the drug on the pregnancy, including labor, delivery, and ? Does the dose or dosing interval of the drug need to be altered because of the pregnancy? We lack information on the effects of many drugs on the fetus. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) classifies drugs for use in pregnancy according to these categories: B: Usually safe but benefits must outweigh the risks C: Safety for use during pregnancy has not been established A host of medications are listed in category C because there is not significant study data about the medication in pregnancy. Several medications listed as category C are generally regarded as safe, or safe during certain . You may need to discuss your medications and any concerns about them with your health-care provider. Which Medications Should Not Be Used during Pregnancy? These medications are used to relieve stuffy, runny, or itchy nose, itchy or watery eyes, and other minor symptoms. Although some decongestants might carry a small risk of birth defects when used early in pregnancy, their safety in pregnancy has not been fully studied. If possible, avoid regular use of epinephrine and other related medication (alpha-adrenergics) as they may pose a higher risk to the fetus. Epinephrine may be given as an injection to treat a severe asthma attack or a life-threatening allergic response. If this situation occurs, treating your reaction effectively and quickly is important to decrease the risk of oxygen deprivation to the fetus. and other nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs): These medications are used to relieve , muscle pain, inflammation, and . They are not recommended during late-term pregnancy. Heartburn and gastroesophageal reflux disease () are common in pregnancy. They can often be treated without medications by elevating the head of the bed, avoiding overeating, avoiding food triggers, and not eating within two to three hours before bedtime. If medications are needed to control heartburn and GERD, avoid regular use of antacids that contain bicarbonate and magnesium. Which Medications Treat and Manage Asthma during Pregnancy? Most people with asthma take at least two medications: one for long-term prevention and control of asthma symptoms and one for quick ""rescue"" in case of an attack. The long-term medications are taken daily, even if there are no symptoms. During pregnancy, inhaled corticosteroids are the mainstay for long-term control. Long-term medications are sometimes combined into single preparations, such as an inhaled steroid and a long-acting beta-agonist. Rescue medications are taken only when symptoms appear. Inhaled short-acting beta-agonists are usually the first choice for fast relief of symptoms. Inhaled corticosteroids: Corticosteroids prevent symptoms by preventing the swelling and mucus secretion that go along with inflammation. They help prevent severe asthma attacks. They are the most popular long-acting asthma drugs for pregnant women because they work well and are considered to be safe in pregnancy. They cause few side effects. Examples include (Pulmicort) and beclomethasone (Vanceril, Beclovent, and ). Leukotriene inhibitors: These drugs work by blocking a substance that is produced by cells in your body (leukotrienes) that causes swelling and spasm of airways. These drugs are considered safe during pregnancy, but in general they do not work for as many people as inhaled . Examples are (), (), and (Zyflo). Long-acting beta-agonist inhalers: These medications often are used in combination with inhaled steroids for severe or nighttime symptoms. They also are used to prevent . Since their action is delayed, they are not used for rescue treatment (see short-acting beta-agonists below). Examples of long-acting beta-agonists include (Serevent) and (Foradil). Methylxanthines: These medications relax the walls. They have been linked to preterm labor, but in general they are thought to be safe in pregnancy. They are not used as much as the other long-term medications because they don't work for as many people. The most widely used example is (Slo-bid, ). Because pregnancy can change the concentration of this medication in the bloodstream, checking levels of theophylline may be required, even if you were taking it before. Others: These medicines prevent swelling in the airway. They are used mostly to prevent attacks triggered by exercise, cold air, or allergies. They are considered safe in pregnancy, but they do not work in as many people as other long-term control medications. Examples include cromolyn () and nedocromil (Tilade). Short-acting beta-agonist inhalers: These inhaled medications quickly dilate the airways, relieving tightness, wheezing, and shortness of breath. They are relatively safe in pregnancy because only small quantities are absorbed into the bloodstream. These drugs generally have little negative effect on the fetus. An example is (, ). Oral corticosteroids (taken as a pill): These medications are taken only for a short time until other medications begin to work and asthma is controlled. Their use during pregnancy is controversial, but most evidence points to their being safe. Although there may be a very small risk of cleft lip or palate when used during the , a severe asthma attack in the mother can put the life of the fetus at risk. Examples include (Deltasone) and (). Anticholinergic agents: In inhaled form, these drugs are used in addition to a beta-agonist (or instead of a beta-agonist in people who cannot take beta-agonists) to relieve severe symptoms. An example is bromide (Atrovent, ). Which Vaccines Are Recommended to Decrease Severe Asthma Attacks during Pregnancy? : Also called the vaccine, this shot can help prevent you getting the flu. The risk of severe asthma attack is very high if you get the flu. Because a severe asthma attack can deprive the fetus of oxygen, the shot is recommended in the second and third of pregnancy. (Its safety during the first trimester is more questionable.) : If you took shots before you became pregnant and had no severe reaction to the shots, you should continue the shots during pregnancy. However, you should not start allergy shots during pregnancy. What Are the Negative Effects of Asthma Attacks on Pregnancy and Fetal Outcome? Asthma attacks can have a number of negative effects on pregnancy outcome. Poor asthma control is linked to preterm birth, low birth weight, and stillbirths in the fetus and in pregnant women. Women who become pregnant while being treated for asthma should not stop using their medication unless they are specifically told to do so by their health-care provider. This graph shows asthma consensus guidelines used to manage chronic asthma. These guidelines are also generally used to treat pregnant patients with asthma. List of Common Asthma Medications and Side Effects The main goals in asthma treatment are to prevent asthma attacks and to control the disease. Avoiding triggers that induce or aggravate asthma attacks is an important aspect of prevention. Medications used to prevent asthma attacks (controller medications) focus on decreasing the airway inflammation that causes attacks. Rescue medications help open up your airway and are used for quick relief when asthma symptoms occur despite the use of controller medications.

5ef2f687-68d3-4308-a337-8d1d7bc9cf14,"Most Asthma Drugs Safe for Moms-to-Be Not controlling the condition can result in smaller and premature babies THURSDAY, Oct. 2, 2003 (HealthDayNews) -- Pregnant women with asthma can breathe easy about using mild or moderate medications to control their symptoms -- doing so isn't likely to harm your baby. In fact, new research shows that leaving your asthma untreated is more likely to cause both you and your newborn harm. However, the study also finds women who use more powerful asthma drugs during pregnancy -- such as oral steroids -- risk giving birth prematurely. In the study in the October issue of , Yale researchers found women who didn't report or treat their asthma symptoms during pregnancy were at increased risk for intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR) -- a problem that contributes to smaller, underdeveloped babies. The more severe the asthma symptoms, the more severe the problems were for their baby. ""There is definitely a group of women who are not being diagnosed and not being managed properly and they are running into an increased risk in terms of their babies -- more so than if they were taking medication,"" says study author Michael Bracken, a professor of epidemiology at Yale University School of Medicine. Those women who did control their asthma symptoms using mild-to-moderate drugs known as beta 2 agonists did not share that risk. These treatments include inhaled medications such as albuterol, isoproterenol and terbutaline. ""There was concern expressed about the safety of beta 2 agonists, so this study is reassuring in that respect,"" Bracken adds. But, the study also showed that women who used more potent asthma drugs during pregnancy, such as oral steroids or theophylline, were at increased risk for pre-term delivery. ""These drugs should only be used to manage the most severe symptoms. And when that is the case, the risks may outweigh the benefits,"" Bracken says. Asthma expert Dr. Jonathan D. Field, who was not involved in the research, says this study is important because it gives doctors a window into not only the effects of certain asthma medications on pregnancy, but also the effects of skipping treatment altogether. ""Women are often concerned about taking medication during their pregnancy, because of any perceived dangers to their baby. But there are rarely any studies to show the dangers linked to not treating a particular problem during pregnancy, such as asthma. And this study does just that,"" says Field, director of Pediatric Allergy and Asthma Clinic at New York University Medical Center. As a result, he says, the study offers women some comforting news about not only the safety of certain asthma drugs, but also the safety of treating versus not treating your asthma during pregnancy. ""It really gives us a strong comparison -- using a large group of women -- and I think it will help reduce many fears that women may have about using medications to control their symptoms,"" Field says. The study included 873 pregnant women with a history of asthma. Of this group, 778 women reported asthma symptoms during their pregnancies and took various types of medications. A comparison group consisted of 1,333 pregnant women with no history of asthma symptoms, including 884 women who were not diagnosed with asthma and reported no symptoms, and 449 women with asthma symptoms, but no previous diagnosis of the condition. After comparing the pregnancy outcomes of both groups, the researchers concluded that premature birth -- a problem once thought to be associated with asthma -- was not linked to the condition. More specifically, the researchers found that neither the severity of asthmatic symptoms, nor the symptoms themselves, played any part in pre-term birth. But the researchers did find women who used oral steroids, or the asthma treatment known as theophylline, experienced an increase in premature birth. For those using oral steroids, babies were born 2.22 weeks early; for those using theophylline, babies were born 1.11 weeks early. In addition, the researchers found that in women who were not taking medication for asthma, there was a 24 percent increased risk for IUGR. The worse the asthma symptoms, the greater the risk for IUGR. Risks were greatest in women who had asthma symptoms but were never diagnosed with the condition. ""Our observations support the current guidelines for treating asthma during pregnancy, and actually present better evidence for those guidelines than was there before they were developed,"" Bracken says. Bracken suggests women and their doctors be on the lookout for symptoms of asthma, particularly if the problem has not been previously diagnosed. ""We should be trying to find these women, diagnose them and medicate them properly. And part of the workup now, for pregnant women, should be to inquire about asthma symptoms and then act accordingly,"" he says. For Field, the study is a reliable validation of the need to treat asthma symptoms during pregnancy. ""I think the real message here is that pregnant women should not be afraid to treat their asthma symptoms with some of the most commonly used drugs. And they should also report any symptoms of asthma to their doctor during pregnancy, even if they have never been diagnosed before,"" he says. Common asthma symptoms include difficulty breathing, shortness of breath, wheezing, and coughing while exercising, or directly after you stop. To learn more about asthma symptoms, visit the .

If you would like more specific information about peanut allergy, see the topic . When you have a food allergy, your body thinks certain foods are trying to harm you. Your body fights back by setting off an allergic reaction. In most cases, the symptoms are mild—a rash or an upset stomach. A mild reaction is no fun, but it isn't dangerous. A serious reaction can be deadly. But quick treatment can stop a dangerous reaction. Allergies tend to run in families. You are more likely to have a food allergy if other people in your family have allergies like hay fever, asthma, or eczema (). Food allergies are more common in children than in adults. Children sometimes outgrow their food allergies, especially allergies to milk, eggs, or soy. But if you develop a food allergy as an adult, you will most likely have it for life. are much more common than food allergies. True food allergies are a reaction to food or food additives by your body's immune system. Many people think they have a food allergy, but in fact they have a food intolerance. Food intolerance is much more common. It can cause some of the same symptoms as a mild food allergy, like an upset stomach. But a food intolerance does not cause an allergic reaction. A food intolerance can make you feel bad, but it is not dangerous. A serious food allergy can be dangerous. Food allergies can cause many different symptoms. They can range from mild to serious. If you eat a food you are allergic to: Your mouth may tingle, and your lips may swell as you start to eat the food. You may have a stuffy nose, wheeze, or be short of breath when the allergens reach your mouth and lungs. You may have cramps, an upset stomach, or diarrhea as the food is digested. You may feel dizzy or lightheaded if your blood pressure drops as the allergens circulate through your bloodstream. You may have itchy skin with red, raised bumps called as the allergens reach your skin. Kids usually have the same symptoms as adults. But sometimes a small child just cries a lot, vomits, has diarrhea, or does not grow as expected. If your child has these symptoms, see your doctor. Some people have symptoms after eating even a tiny bit of a problem food. As a rule, the sooner the reaction begins, the worse it will be. The most severe reaction is called anaphylaxis (say ""ANN-uh-fuh-LAK-suss""). It affects your whole body. Anaphylaxis can start within a few minutes to a few hours after you eat the food. And the symptoms can go away and come back hours later. If you have anaphylaxis: You may suddenly start wheezing or have trouble breathing. Anaphylaxis can be deadly. If you have (or see someone having) any of these symptoms, . A few foods cause most allergies. The protein in a food that causes an allergy is called a food . Milk, eggs, peanuts, tree nuts, fish, shellfish, wheat, and soy cause most problems in children. Milk, peanuts, tree nuts, fish, and shellfish cause most problems in adults. If you are allergic to one food, you may also be allergic to other foods like it. So if you are allergic to shrimp, you may also be allergic to lobster or crab. Your doctor will ask questions about your medical history and any family food allergies. And he or she will do a physical exam. Your doctor will also ask what symptoms you have. He or she may want you to write down everything you eat and any reactions you have. Your doctor will consider other possibilities that could be confused with food allergies, such as a food intolerance. Because food allergies can be confused with other problems, it is important for your doctor to do a test to confirm that you have a food allergy. Your doctor may first start out with either skin testing or a blood test to determine what you are allergic to. But an oral food challenge is the best way to diagnose a food allergy. In an oral food challenge, you will eat a variety of foods that may or may not cause an allergic reaction. Your doctor watches to see if and when a reaction occurs. A skin prick test can help to find out which foods will cause a reaction. The doctor will put a little bit of liquid on your skin and then prick your skin. The liquid has some of the possible food allergen in it. If your skin swells up like a mosquito bite, your doctor knows that you are allergic to that food. Your doctor may also do blood tests to look for the chemicals in your blood that cause an allergic reaction. The best treatment is to never eat the foods you are allergic to. Learn to read food labels and spot other names for problem foods. For example, milk may be listed as ""caseinate,"" wheat as ""gluten,"" and peanuts as ""hydrolyzed vegetable protein."" When you eat out or at other people's houses, ask about the foods you are served. If you have a history of severe food allergies, your doctor will prescribe (say ""eh-puh-NEH-fren""). An epinephrine shot can slow down or stop an allergic reaction. Your doctor can teach you how to give yourself the shot if you need it. You can have symptoms again even after you give yourself a shot. So go to the emergency room every time you have a severe reaction. You will need to be watched for several hours after the reaction. If you have had a serious reaction in the past, your chance of having another one is high. Be prepared. Wear a to let others know about your food allergy. Check the expiration date on the epinephrine. Replace it as needed. If your child has a food allergy, what else should you think about? Talk to your child's teachers and caregivers. They should know how to keep problem foods away from your child. Teach them what to do if your child eats one of these foods by mistake. If your child has ever had a severe reaction, keep epinephrine nearby at all times. Some kids carry it in a fanny pack. Have your child wear a medical alert bracelet. Teach all caregivers to act quickly. They should: Health Tools help you make wise health decisions or take action to improve your health. Actionsets are designed to help people take an active role in managing a health condition. Allergies in Children: Giving an Epinephrine Shot to a Child Food allergies occur when the body's immune system overreacts to substances in food you have eaten, triggering an allergic reaction. Food allergies are more common in young children than in adults. Milk, eggs, peanuts, tree nuts, fish, shellfish, wheat, and soy cause most problems in children. Some babies are so sensitive to these foods that if the offending food is eaten by the mother, drinking her breast milk can cause a reaction. Most children outgrow allergies to eggs, milk, wheat, and soy. Peanuts, tree nuts, fish, and shellfish cause most of the allergic reactions in teens and adults. Adults typically remain allergic to the food for life. Food allergies are most common in people who are , meaning they have an inherited tendency to have allergic conditions. These people are more likely to have asthma, various allergies, and a skin condition called atopic dermatitis. Asthma can make the reaction to a food more severe. If you are highly sensitive to a certain food, you may have an allergic reaction simply by being near where the food was prepared or served. is an abnormal immune system reaction to gluten, a protein found in grains like wheat and rye. It damages the small intestine so that it can't do a good job of absorbing nutrients from your food. For more information, see the topic . Many people, but not all people, are allergic to foods that are similar or somehow related. This is called cross-reactivity. For example, if you are allergic to shrimp, you may also be allergic to other shellfish, like crab or lobster. If you are allergic to peanuts, you may be allergic to other members of the legume family, such as peas and beans. You don't need to stop eating a cross-reactive food if you show no signs of an allergic reaction to it. is a type of cross-reactivity. With this syndrome, people who have pollen allergies (such as a grass allergy) may develop itching, redness, and swelling of the lips and mouth when they eat fruits or vegetables that contain a protein that reacts with the pollen. These symptoms usually resolve quickly and do not involve other parts of the body. Oral allergy syndrome usually involves a reaction to fresh fruits and raw vegetables: If you are allergic to ragweed, your mouth may itch when you eat melons, especially cantaloupe. If you are allergic to birch pollen, you may react to apple peels. A growing number of people, especially health care workers, are discovering that they have an allergy to . Latex is the natural sap of the rubber tree. It is used in making surgical gloves, condoms, balloons, and other products. If you have a latex allergy, you may also have allergies to bananas, avocados, kiwi, and chestnuts. Some people have allergic reactions to food after they exercise. This is called exercise-induced food allergy. As a person's body temperature rises with exercise, symptoms such as itching and lightheadedness start, sometimes leading to hives and even , which can be deadly. To avoid exercise-induced food allergy, do not eat for a few hours before you exercise or right after exercising. Symptoms of food allergy can affect many parts of your body, including your: Symptoms include stomach cramps, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, itching in the mouth and throat, and rectal bleeding (rare in adults). These symptoms occur more often in children than in adults. Symptoms include or welts, swelling, itching, redness, and . Skin reactions are common in children. If your baby has atopic dermatitis, you may help prevent peanut allergies by introducing peanut products early. Symptoms include coughing; wheezing; an itchy, stuffy, runny nose; sneezing; and trouble breathing. Children usually have the same symptoms as adults. Symptoms of milk or soy allergies in children may include . Sometimes the only symptoms are extreme crying, vomiting, blood in the stool, diarrhea, constipation, or poor growth. Symptoms vary from mild to life-threatening and can appear from within minutes to days of eating a food. The most severe reaction is , which affects many body systems and can be deadly. Anaphylaxis can start within a few minutes to a few hours after you eat the food. And the symptoms can go away and come back hours later. Common triggers for anaphylaxis are peanuts, nuts, and seafood. In children, peanuts cause anaphylaxis more often than other foods. Aspirin, exercise, or alcohol can increase the risk for anaphylaxis. There are many other conditions with similar symptoms, such as and . The first time you eat a food that triggers an allergic reaction, your body's immune system recognizes the food as a foreign substance (allergen). Your body reacts by developing against the food. When you eat the offending food again, the antibodies attack the allergen, releasing histamine and other chemicals that cause the symptoms of an allergic reaction. To learn more, see the and sections of this topic. You have a greater chance of developing food allergies if you: Have a family history of allergy. If both of your parents have allergies, you are more likely to have allergies. Have another allergic condition such as atopic dermatitis or asthma. Are young. Infants and children have more food allergies than adults. Have a medical condition that makes it easier for allergens to pass through the walls of the stomach and intestines and enter the bloodstream. These conditions include gastrointestinal disease, malnutrition, prematurity, and diseases that , such as eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE). You have a greater risk for a life-threatening allergic reaction (anaphylaxis) from food allergy if you: Develop allergy symptoms within minutes of eating the food. If you or your child has a severe food allergy, always carry epinephrine and know how to use it. You should also wear a medical alert bracelet at all times. Being prepared to immediately deal with a severe allergic reaction reduces the risk of death. You think you are having a severe allergic reaction. You have symptoms in more than one body area, such as mild nausea and an itchy mouth. After giving an epinephrine shot call , even if you feel better. Trouble breathing, wheezing, or deep cough; a pale face or blue lips or earlobes Signs of shock, including: Lightheadedness or a feeling that you are about to pass out Restlessness, confusion, or a sense of impending doom Been given an epinephrine shot, even if you feel better. If you witness a severe allergic reaction and the person becomes unconscious, . If your food allergy symptoms are getting worse, call your doctor. It is important to know which foods are to blame so that you can avoid them. If your food allergy symptoms do not get worse or are not too severe or bothersome, you can try eliminating suspect foods from your diet to see whether symptoms disappear. The following health professionals may evaluate and treat mild food allergies: You need to identify the foods that trigger allergic reactions. Your work or school performance or quality of life is affected because of allergy symptoms or medicine side effects. You have other medical conditions, such as recurrent asthma. You may also be referred to other specialists, such as a: , when moderate or severe asthma is also present. A can help you keep a balanced diet even when you can't eat some foods. A dietitian can also help you learn how to avoid hidden allergens in foods and give you ideas about how to make substitutions in recipes. To diagnose a food allergy, your doctor will start with a medical history and a physical exam. Your doctor may ask: It's important to find out whether you have a food allergy or food intolerance. Your doctor may ask you to keep a record of all the foods you eat and any reactions you have to them. Your doctor will also consider if your reaction could have been caused by things like allergies to medicines or insect stings, food poisoning, irritants in foods, or exposure to skin irritants. Your doctor may ask you to try an elimination diet, an oral food allergy challenge, or both. In an , you avoid eating foods that may be causing an allergic reaction and see if your symptoms go away. If symptoms come back when you eat the food again, your doctor can confirm your food allergy. The elimination diet can last from 2 to 8 weeks. In an , you eat a variety of foods that may or may not cause an allergic reaction. Your doctor watches to see if and when a reaction occurs. This test is considered the best way to diagnose a food allergy. After you have been diagnosed with a food allergy, you may also have , such as skin tests or blood tests, to find out which foods you are allergic to. The best treatment for food allergies is to avoid the food that causes the allergy. When that isn't possible, you can use medicines such as for mild reactions and for serious reactions. Talk to your doctor about an Anaphylaxis Action Plan. Start by telling your family, friends, and coworkers that you have a food allergy, and ask them to help you avoid the food. Read all food labels, and learn the other names that may be used for food allergens. If your baby has a milk or soy allergy, your doctor may suggest either that you change the formula or that you feed your baby only breast milk. Specially prepared formulas are available for infants who have soy and milk allergies. If you have a , your first treatment may be done in an emergency room or by emergency personnel. You will be given a shot of epinephrine to stop the further release of histamine and to relax the muscles that help you breathe. If your doctor has prescribed epinephrine, always keep it with you. It's important to give the epinephrine shot right away. Your doctor or pharmacist will teach you how to give yourself a shot if you need it. Be sure to check the expiration dates on the medicines, and replace the medicines as needed. For step-by-step instructions on how to give the shot, see: Allergies in Children: Giving an Epinephrine Shot to a Child. You should also wear a medical alert bracelet or other jewelry that lists your food allergies. You can order medical alert jewelry through most drugstores or on the Internet. Food oral immunotherapy (OIT) is being studied as a way to help treat food allergies. Under close supervision, a person takes in small daily doses of a food allergen by mouth or under the tongue. The goal is to try to make the immune system tolerate the allergen so that the body won't react as badly to it. This is called desensitization. Talk to your doctor if you want to know more about for this and other new treatments being studied. It's important to take special care with children who have food allergies. A child with severe food allergies may have a life-threatening to even a tiny amount of a food allergen. Your child should always wear a medical alert bracelet. Talk to your doctor about an Anaphylaxis Action Plan. Make sure that all caregivers (school administrators, teachers, friends, coaches, and babysitters): Know where the epinephrine shot is kept and how to use it. Children may have only mild symptoms in the first few minutes after they eat the food allergen, but they may have severe symptoms in 10 to 60 minutes. Children always should be observed in a hospital for several hours after a reaction. Always carries epinephrine. Children at risk of severe allergic reactions should keep their epinephrine at school or day care and at home. Older, mature children should be taught to give themselves the shot. Although your child needs to avoid certain foods, he or she still needs to eat healthy foods. A can tell you which foods are important for your child's health. Food allergies often occur in people who have a family history of asthma, atopic dermatitis, or allergies to pollen, mold, or other substances. In most cases, allergies cannot be prevented in people who have a family history of allergic conditions. There isn't enough proof to recommend that people who are at risk for allergies should avoid common foods that cause allergies like milk, eggs, peanuts, tree nuts, soy, wheat, fish, shellfish, and sulphites. Avoiding these foods doesn't seem to prevent allergies. If your doctor thinks your baby might be at risk for a peanut allergy, ask him or her about introducing peanut products. There may be a way to prevent peanut allergies. If you are a woman with a food allergy who is planning on a pregnancy and breastfeeding, talk to your doctor about what foods to avoid while pregnant or nursing. But if you don't have food allergies, avoiding certain foods during your pregnancy isn't recommended as a way to prevent the baby from having food allergies. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that all babies be breastfed for the first year of life or longer. For babies with family members who have food allergies, ask whether and how to start foods that might cause allergies. Most allergic reactions in children are caused by eggs, milk, wheat, soy, and peanuts. Breastfeeding only for at least 4 months may help prevent allergies to milk. If your baby is at high risk for allergies and you can't breastfeed, try a hydrolyzed milk formula. The milk protein in hydrolyzed formulas is changed to try to prevent allergies. There is no proof that giving your baby soy formula instead of cow's milk formula will prevent a food allergy in children at risk for food allergies. Tobacco smoke can make allergies worse, so it is important to have a smoke-free environment. Knowing which foods trigger food allergies and avoiding those foods is the best way to prevent allergic reactions. Unfortunately, food allergens are often hidden in sauces, ice creams, baked goods, and other items. If you have food allergies, read food labels carefully. Sometimes products are recalled when food ingredients are missing from food labels. For a list of recalled products, see the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's Recalls, Market Withdrawals, and Safety Alerts page at www.fda.gov/opacom/7alerts.html. Eating out can be dangerous for people with severe food allergies. Bring safe substitutes from home. For example, bring soy milk to have with cereal. Be aware of possible cross-contamination. For example, an ice cream scoop may have been used for Rocky Road ice cream, which contains peanuts, and then used for your vanilla ice cream. Alert the wait staff to the possibility of a severe food reaction. Carefully question them about ingredients. If they are not sure, ask to speak to kitchen staff. Always wear medical alert jewelry that lists your food allergies. Medical alert jewelry can be ordered through most drugstores or on the Internet. If you or your child has ever had a , always carry an epinephrine shot. Allergies in Children: Giving an Epinephrine Shot to a Child If you are traveling to another country, learn the words for the foods that trigger your allergy so that you can ask in restaurants and read food labels. Call airlines, tour operators, and restaurants ahead of time to explain your food allergy and request safe meals. Prepare your own food when possible. Discuss your travel plans with your doctor. For mild allergic reactions, people often try nonprescription medicines first. You can try prescription medicines if over-the-counter medicines fail to control allergy symptoms or if they cause drowsiness or other bothersome side effects. Medicines used to treat a allergic reaction include: . Epinephrine is given as a shot. It acts quickly to relax the muscles that help you breathe. Sometimes more than one shot is needed if symptoms do not go away. Epinephrine is the medicine used to treat anaphylaxis. . Antihistamines block the action of histamine during an allergic reaction and help improve symptoms such as itching and sneezing. . These medicines help reduce inflammation. Medicines used to relieve food allergy symptoms include: Antihistamines and corticosteroids for hives, gastrointestinal symptoms, or sneezing and a runny nose. for asthma symptoms.

0ceb8673-fc10-45f9-81e4-b80438f8ae39,"— — Experiencing breathing difficulty describes discomfort when breathing and feeling as if you can’t draw a complete breath. This can develop gradually or come on suddenly. Mild breathing problems, such as fatigue after an aerobics class, don’t fall into this category. Breathing difficulties can be caused by many different conditions. They can also develop as a result of stress and anxiety. It’s important to note that frequent episodes of shortness of breath or sudden, intense breathing difficulty may be signs of a serious health issue that needs medical attention. You should discuss any breathing concerns with your doctor. Lung conditions that can cause breathing difficulty There are a number of lung conditions that can cause you to experience difficulty breathing. is an inflammation and narrowing of the airways that can cause: Asthma is a common condition that can range in severity. is a lung infection that can cause inflammation and a buildup of fluid and pus in the lung. Most types are contagious. Pneumonia can be a life-threatening condition, so prompt treatment is important. refers to a group of diseases that lead to poor lung function. Other signs and symptoms include: , often caused by years of , is in this category of diseases. A is a blockage in one or more of the arteries leading to the lungs. This is often the result of a blood clot from elsewhere in the body, like the leg or pelvis, traveling up to a lung. This can be life-threatening and it requires immediate medical attention. is high blood pressure that affects the arteries in the lungs. This condition is often due to the narrowing or hardening of these arteries and can lead to . Symptoms of this condition often start with: Later on, symptoms can be very similar to those of a pulmonary embolism. Most people with this condition will notice worsening shortness of breath over time. Chest pain, shortness of breath, or loss of consciousness are symptoms that require emergency medical attention. is a respiratory condition caused by an acute viral infection. It’s known for causing a distinctive barking cough. Make an appointment with your doctor if you or your child has symptoms of croup. Children between are most susceptible to this condition. is a swelling of the tissue that covers your windpipe, due to infection. This is a potentially life-threatening disease that requires immediate medical attention. One common cause of epiglottis may be prevented by a haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) vaccination. This vaccine is generally only given to children under the age of five, as adults are less likely to get a Hib infection. Heart conditions that can cause breathing difficulty You may notice yourself feeling out of breath more often if you have a heart condition. This is because your heart is struggling to pump oxygen-rich blood to the rest of your body. There are a variety of possible conditions that can cause this problem: is a disease that causes the arteries that supply blood to the heart to narrow and harden. This condition leads to decreased blood flow to the heart, which can permanently damage the heart muscle. Signs and symptoms also include: A , sometimes called congenital heart defects, refers to inherited problems with the structure and function of the heart. These problems can lead to: are types of irregular heartbeats, affecting the heart rhythm or heart rate, causing a heart to beat too fast or too slow. People with preexisting heart conditions are at higher risk for developing an arrhythmia. occurs when the heart muscle becomes weak and unable to pump blood efficiently throughout the body. This often leads to a buildup of fluid in and around the lungs. Other heart conditions that could lead to breathing difficulty include: Environmental factors can also affect breathing, such as: blocked air passages from a stuffy nose or throat phlegm from climbing to a high altitude A occurs when the upper part of the stomach protrudes through the diaphragm into the chest. People with large hiatal hernias may also experience: Medication and lifestyle changes can often treat small hiatal hernias. Larger hernias or smaller ones that don’t respond to treatment may require surgery. You’re at greater risk for breathing problems if you: Obesity also increases the risk of breathing difficulties. Extreme physical exertion can also put you at risk for breathing problems, particularly when you exercise in intense spurts or at high altitudes. The primary symptom of breathing problems is feeling as though you can’t breathe in enough oxygen. Some specific signs include: Contact emergency services if your breathing difficulty comes on suddenly. Seek immediate medical attention for anyone whose breathing appears to have slowed considerably or stopped. After you have called 911, perform if you know how to do so. Some symptoms, along with breathing difficulty, can indicate a serious problem. These problems may indicate an angina attack, a lack of oxygen, or a heart attack. Symptoms to be aware of include: shortness of breath that requires you to sit up constantly shortness of breath that wakes you up during the night Babies and young children often have breathing difficulties when they have respiratory viruses. Breathing symptoms often occur because small children don’t know how to clear their noses and throats. There are several conditions that can lead to more severe breathing difficulties. Most children recover from these conditions with proper treatment. is a respiratory illness usually caused by a virus. Children between the age of are considered the most likely to get croup, but it can develop in older children. It usually begins with symptoms similar to a cold. The main symptom of the illness is a loud, barking cough. Breathing difficulties can result from the frequent coughing. This often occurs at night, with the first and second nights of coughing usually the worst. Most cases of croup resolve within a week. Some more serious cases may require emergency medical attention. is a viral lung infection that often affects babies younger than 6 months old. is the most common cause of this problem. The illness may appear like the common cold at first, but in a few days it may be followed by: Oxygen levels can become quite low and can require treatment in the hospital. In most cases, babies get well in 7 to 10 days. have retractions, when the skin of the chest between the ribs and the neck sinks in with each breath If your child has heart disease or was born prematurely, you should seek medical attention as soon as you notice they’re having difficulty breathing. Your doctor will need to determine the underlying cause of your breathing difficulties. They’ll ask you how long you’ve had the problem, whether it’s mild or intense, and whether physical exertion makes it worse. After reviewing your medical history, your doctor will examine your airway passages, lungs, and heart. Depending on the findings of your physical exam, your doctor might recommend one or more diagnostic tests, including: Your doctor may also have you perform to see how your heart and lungs react to physical exertion. Treatments for breathing difficulties will depend on the underlying cause. If having a stuffy nose, exercising too hard, or hiking at high altitudes causes your symptoms, your breathing is likely to return to normal if you’re otherwise healthy. The temporary symptoms will resolve once your cold goes away, you stop exercising, or you return to a lower altitude. If is causing your breathing problems, you can by developing coping mechanisms. Just a few ways to relieve stress include: Listening to relaxing music or talking to a friend can also help you reset and refocus. If you’re concerned about your breathing problems and don’t already have a primary care provider, you can view doctors in your area through the . Some breathing difficulties are symptoms of serious heart and lung illnesses. In these cases, your doctor will prescribe medication and other treatments. If you have asthma, for example, you may need to use an inhaler immediately after experiencing breathing problems. If you have allergies, your doctor may prescribe an to reduce your body’s allergic reaction. Your doctor may also recommend avoiding allergy triggers like dust or pollen. In extreme cases, you may need , a breathing machine, or other treatment and monitoring at a hospital. If your child is experiencing mild breathing difficulties, you may want to try some soothing alongside treatment from a doctor. Cool or moist air can help, so take your child outside into the night air or into a steamy bathroom. You can also try running a cool mist humidifier while your child is sleeping.

Reviewed by Asthma, like all chronic conditions of childhood, affects not only the child but the entire family. For children with mild asthma, the impact on the family may be minimal — but with more severe disease, parents may have issues in several areas. As children get older, they are able to take more responsibility for their daily activities, including management of their disease. As your child takes on more responsibility, it should be appropriate for the age and abilities. It may be difficult to find the right balance of support and responsibility at times. A preschooler’s tasks often include learning to cooperate with inhaled medications and the adult takes the leading role in asthma management. A school age child is learning to take more responsibility with the adult still taking the leading role. The adolescent can gradually assume more responsibility and the adult will move into more of a guidance role. It is important for the adult to routinely monitor medication technique and supplies. Family meetings can help identify how the daily medications and activities and the asthma action plan are going. A variety of issues may arise in connection with school. Fortunately, there are steps you can take to address these issues. Arrange a School Conference Before the School Year Begins This conference should include your child’s teachers, physical education teachers, school nurse and teacher aides. It is important for them to have an understanding of your child’s asthma. You can give a brief asthma education lesson — discussing what can make asthma worse in the school environment, your child’s daily treatment including exercise pre-treatment if needed, techniques to inhale medication, asthma symptoms, peak flow zones and the school Asthma Action Plan. This school should include what makes your child’s asthma worse, long-term control medication, especially those taken at school, asthma symptoms, peak flow zones, quick-relief medications to be taken for peak flows in the yellow and red zone or asthma symptoms, and emergency telephone numbers. Immediate access to quick-relief medication is important. When approved by the doctor, parent and school personnel, it is helpful if the child with asthma can carry the quick-relief medication for immediate access. Ask your child’s doctor to work with you and the school if further arrangements are needed. A written asthma action plan is always useful. Talk with your child and the school staff regularly to assure your child’s asthma action plan is working. Some children have difficulty keeping up with their school work because of missed school days. When asthma is severe enough to require hospitalization, school days may be missed. However, it is usually not necessary to miss school because of mild asthma symptoms, which can be handled at school. Monitoring your child’s asthma symptoms and peak flows at home and at school can be very helpful. These steps will help address school issues related to your child and asthma so your child can have a positive and enjoyable school experience. Parents are sometimes hesitant to punish children with asthma for fear punishment will cause an attack.  While it is true that children who are upset by restrictions (or any frustrating situation) may develop asthma symptoms, the harm done by letting a child always have his or her own way because of asthma is much greater, even if some asthma symptoms occur with discipline. Follow your child’s action plan if asthma symptoms occur. Also, if there are other children in the family, they may resent what they see as special treatment. Asthma is not a psychosomatic illness. However, as a result of prolonged asthma, behavior problems can arise. When a child has self-destructive behavior — such as using asthma to avoid school or manipulate the family, or deliberately missing medication to cause an episode — a referral to a psychologist or psychiatrist may be helpful. Asthma, like any chronic illness, may sometimes magnify other family problems. Family stresses which may be tolerable when the child is healthy may become major problems when the child is ill. Sometimes a cycle is set up in which asthma and other family problems aggravate each other. Individual counseling for your child may not be sufficient, and family counseling may be recommended. Children with asthma have the same nutritional requirements as other children. Aside from avoiding specific foods that you know cause symptoms, no special kind of diet has been shown to be beneficial for asthma. Extra vitamins, over and above normal daily requirements, typically are not needed. Some children need extra calcium and vitamin D because of long-term steroid (pills or syrups) therapy.

Wheezing is a high-pitched purring or whistling sound. You can hear it best when your child is breathing out. Rapid breathing at a rate of over 40 breaths per minute. Tight breathing (having to work hard to push air out). Fever and a runny nose often start before the breathing problems. The average age for getting bronchiolitis is 6 months (range: birth to 2 years). About 30% of children with bronchiolitis later do develop asthma. This is more likely if they have close family members with asthma. Also likely if they have bronchiolitis more than 2 times. A narrowing of the smallest airways in the lung (bronchioles) causes wheezing. This narrowing results from swelling caused by a virus. The respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) causes most bronchiolitis. RSV occurs in epidemics almost every winter. People do not develop life-long immunity to the RSV virus. This means they can be infected many times. Trouble breathing is a reason to see a doctor right away. Respiratory distress is the medical name for trouble breathing. Here are symptoms to worry about: Tight breathing so that your child can barely speak or cry. Ribs are pulling in with each breath (called retractions). A doctor can diagnose bronchiolitis by listening to the chest with a stethoscope. Cover the nose and mouth with a tissue when coughing or sneezing. Wash hands often. After coughing or sneezing are important times. Severe trouble breathing (struggling for each breath, can barely speak or cry) You think your child has a life-threatening emergency Your child looks like they did when hospitalized before with bronchiolitis Ribs are pulling in with each breath (called retractions) Lips or face have turned bluish, but only during coughing New harsh sound with breathing in (called stridor) Wheezing (purring or whistling sound) is worse than when seen Dehydration suspected. No urine in more than 8 hours, dark urine, very dry mouth, no tears. High-risk child (such as chronic lung disease) and getting worse Age less than 12 weeks old with fever. Caution: do NOT give your baby any fever medicine before being seen. You think your child needs to be seen, and the problem is urgent You think your child needs to be seen, but the problem is not urgent Bronchiolitis is common during the first 2 years of life. Most children just have coughing and fast breathing. Some develop wheezing. This means the lower airway is getting tight. If you were given a follow-up appointment, be sure to keep it. Some children with bronchiolitis are helped by asthma-type medicines. Most children are not helped by these medicines. If one has been prescribed for your child, give it as instructed. Keep giving the medicine until your child's wheezing is gone for 24 hours. Breathe warm mist (such as with shower running in a closed bathroom). Give warm clear fluids to drink. Examples are apple juice and lemonade. Amount. If 3 - 12 months of age, give 1 ounce (30 mL) each time. Limit to 4 times per day. If over 1 year of age, give as much as needed. Reason: Both relax the airway and loosen up any phlegm. Do not give any over-the-counter cough medicine to children with wheezing. Instead, treat the cough using these tips: Age 3 months to 1 year: Give warm clear fluids to treat the cough. Examples are apple juice and lemonade. Amount: Use a dose of 1-3 teaspoons (5-15 mL). Give 4 times per day when coughing. Caution: Do not use honey until 1 year old. Age 1 year and older: Use honey ½ to 1 teaspoon (2-5 mL) as needed. It works as a homemade cough medicine. It can thin the mucus and loosen the cough. If you don't have any honey, you can use corn syrup. Your baby can't nurse or drink from a bottle if the nose is blocked. Suction alone can't remove dry or sticky mucus. Use saline (salt water) nose drops or spray to loosen up the dried mucus. If you don't have saline, you can use a few drops of bottled water or clean tap water. If under 1 year old, use bottled water or boiled tap water. Step 1: Put 3 drops in each nostril. (If age under 1 year old, use 1 drop). Step 2: Suction each nostril out while closing off the other nostril. Then, do the other side. Step 3: Repeat nose drops and suctioning until the discharge is clear. How often: Do nasal saline when your child can't breathe through the nose. Limit: No more than 4 times per day. Saline nose drops or spray can be bought in any drugstore. No prescription is needed. Other option: use a warm shower to loosen mucus. Breathe in the moist air, then suction. If the air in your home is dry, use a humidifier. Reason: Dry air makes coughs worse. Use small, frequent feedings whenever your child has the energy to drink. Reason: Children with wheezing don't have enough energy for long feedings. Tobacco smoke makes coughs and wheezing much worse. Wheezing and rapid breathing most often improve over 2 or 3 days. Some children (2%) with bronchiolitis need to be in the hospital. These children need oxygen or fluids given through a vein. Your child can return to child care after the wheezing and fever are gone.

Keep giving the medicine until your child's wheezing is gone for 24 hours. Breathe warm mist (such as with shower running in a closed bathroom). Give warm clear fluids to drink. Examples are apple juice and lemonade. Amount. If 3 - 12 months of age, give 1 ounce (30 mL) each time. Limit to 4 times per day. If over 1 year of age, give as much as needed. Reason: Both relax the airway and loosen up any phlegm. Do not give any over-the-counter cough medicine to children with wheezing. Instead, treat the cough using these tips: Age 3 months to 1 year: Give warm clear fluids to treat the cough. Examples are apple juice and lemonade. Amount: Use a dose of 1-3 teaspoons (5-15 mL). Give 4 times per day when coughing. Caution: Do not use honey until 1 year old. Age 1 year and older: Use honey ½ to 1 teaspoon (2-5 mL) as needed. It works as a homemade cough medicine. It can thin the mucus and loosen the cough. If you don't have any honey, you can use corn syrup. Your baby can't nurse or drink from a bottle if the nose is blocked. Suction alone can't remove dry or sticky mucus. Use saline (salt water) nose drops or spray to loosen up the dried mucus. If you don't have saline, you can use a few drops of bottled water or clean tap water. If under 1 year old, use bottled water or boiled tap water. Step 1: Put 3 drops in each nostril. (If age under 1 year old, use 1 drop). Step 2: Suction each nostril out while closing off the other nostril. Then, do the other side. Step 3: Repeat nose drops and suctioning until the discharge is clear. How often: Do nasal saline when your child can't breathe through the nose. Limit: No more than 4 times per day. Saline nose drops or spray can be bought in any drugstore. No prescription is needed. Other option: use a warm shower to loosen mucus. Breathe in the moist air, then suction. If the air in your home is dry, use a humidifier. Reason: Dry air makes coughs worse. Use small, frequent feedings whenever your child has the energy to drink. Reason: Children with wheezing don't have enough energy for long feedings. Tobacco smoke makes coughs and wheezing much worse. Wheezing and rapid breathing most often improve over 2 or 3 days. Some children (2%) with bronchiolitis need to be in the hospital. These children need oxygen or fluids given through a vein. Your child can return to child care after the wheezing and fever are gone.

The medical name is viral bronchitis. The bronchi are the lower part of the airway that go to the lungs. Bronchitis in children is always caused by a virus. This includes cold viruses, influenza and croup. Bacteria do not cause bronchitis in healthy children. The exact mechanism of the cough is unknown. It may be that post-nasal drip irritates the lower throat. Or pressure within the sinus may trigger the cough reflex. Some children get a cough from breathing in an allergic substance. Examples are pollens or cats. Allergic coughs can be controlled with allergy medicines, such as Benadryl. Asthma with wheezing is the most common cause of chronic coughs in children. In adults, it's smoking. 25% of children with asthma only cough and never wheeze. The coughing spells have the same triggers as asthma attacks. Fumes of any kind can irritate the airway and cause a cough. Tobacco smoke is the most common example. Others are auto exhaust, smog and paint fumes. Running will make most coughs worse. If the air is cold or polluted, coughing is even more likely. Pneumonia, bronchiolitis, whooping cough and airway foreign object Trouble breathing is a reason to see a doctor right away. Respiratory distress is the medical name for trouble breathing. Here are symptoms to worry about: Tight breathing so that your child can barely speak or cry Ribs are pulling in with each breath (called retractions) Yellow or green phlegm is a normal part of the healing of viral bronchitis. This means the lining of the trachea (windpipe) was damaged by the virus. It's part of the phlegm your child coughs up. Bacteria do not cause bronchitis in healthy children. Antibiotics are not helpful for the yellow or green phlegm seen with colds. The main treatment of a cough with phlegm is to drink lots of fluids. Also, if the air is dry, using a humidifier will help. Sipping warm clear fluids will also help coughing fits. Severe trouble breathing (struggling for each breath, can barely speak or cry) You think your child has a life-threatening emergency Choked on a small object that could be caught in the throat Ribs are pulling in with each breath (called retractions) Wheezing (high-pitched purring or whistling sound when breathing out) Weak immune system. Examples are: sickle cell disease, HIV, cancer, organ transplant, taking oral steroids. High-risk child (such as cystic fibrosis or other chronic lung disease) Age less than 12 weeks old with fever. Caution: do NOT give your baby any fever medicine before being seen. You think your child needs to be seen, and the problem is urgent Sinus pain (not just congestion) around cheekbone or eyes You think your child needs to be seen, but the problem is not urgent Coughing has kept home from school for 3 or more days Allergy symptoms (such as runny nose and itchy eyes) also present Coughing up mucus is very important. It helps protect the lungs from pneumonia. A cough can be a good thing. We don't want to fully turn off your child's ability to cough. Goal: Decrease the irritation or tickle in the throat that causes a dry cough. Age 3 months to 1 year: Give warm clear fluids to treat the cough. Examples are apple juice and lemonade. Amount: Use a dose of 1-3 teaspoons (5-15 mL). Give 4 times per day when coughing. Caution: Do not use honey until 1 year old. Age 1 year and older: Use Honey ½ to 1 teaspoon (2-5 mL) as needed. It works as a homemade cough medicine. It can thin the secretions and loosen the cough. If you don't have any honey, you can use corn syrup. You can also buy cough products that have honey in them at drug stores. They do not work better than plain honey and cost much more. Age 6 years and older: Use Cough Drops to decrease the tickle in the throat. If you don't have any, you can use hard candy. Avoid cough drops before 6 years. Reason: risk of choking. Non-prescription cough medicines are not advised. Reason: No proven benefit for children and not approved under 6 years old. (FDA) Honey has been shown to work better for coughs. Caution: Do not use honey until 1 year old. If age 6 years or older, you might decide to use a cough medicine. Choose one with dextromethorphan (DM), such as Robitussin Cough syrup. DM is present in most non-prescription cough syrups. When to Use: Give only for severe coughs that interfere with sleep or school. Breathe warm mist, such as with shower running in a closed bathroom. Give warm clear fluids to drink. Examples are apple juice and lemonade. Age 3 - 12 months of age. Give 1 ounce (30 mL) each time. Limit to 4 times per day. Reason: Both relax the airway and loosen up any phlegm. For vomiting that occurs with hard coughing, give smaller amounts per feeding. Reason: Vomiting from coughing is more common with a full stomach. It also loosens up any phlegm in the lungs. Then it's easier to cough up. It also will thin out the mucus discharge from the nose. If the air in your home is dry, use a humidifier. Reason: Dry air makes coughs worse. For fevers above 102° F (39° C), give an acetaminophen product (such as Tylenol). Another choice is an ibuprofen product (such as Advil). Note: Fevers less than 102° F (39° C) are important for fighting infections. For all fevers: Keep your child well hydrated. Give lots of cold fluids. Your child can go back to school after the fever is gone. Your child should also feel well enough to join in normal activities. For practical purposes, the spread of coughs and colds cannot be prevented. Extra Advice- Allergy Medicine for Allergic Cough: Allergy medicine can bring an allergic cough under control within 1 hour. The same is true for nasal allergy symptoms. A short-acting allergy medicine (such as Benadryl) is helpful. No prescription is needed. Sometimes, your child will cough up lots of phlegm (mucus). The mucus can normally be grey, yellow or green.

Wheezing is a high-pitched purring or whistling sound. You can hear it best when your child is breathing out. Rapid breathing at a rate of over 40 breaths per minute. Tight breathing (having to work hard to push air out). Fever and a runny nose often start before the breathing problems. The average age for getting bronchiolitis is 6 months (range: birth to 2 years). About 30% of children with bronchiolitis later do develop asthma. This is more likely if they have close family members with asthma. Also likely if they have bronchiolitis more than 2 times. A narrowing of the smallest airways in the lung (bronchioles) causes wheezing. This narrowing results from swelling caused by a virus. The respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) causes most bronchiolitis. RSV occurs in epidemics almost every winter. People do not develop life-long immunity to the RSV virus. This means they can be infected many times.

What Happens When an Asthma Patient Experiences COVID-19 Symptoms? COVID-19 has been the scariest thing ever in this whole year of 2020. It has been proven to be more contagious, and positive cases are increasing day by day all over the world. It has been transmitted through the nasopharyngeal secretions of affected individuals, and it is a primary disease of the respiratory system in human beings. However, it also affects the gastrointestinal and nervous system, though the accurate pathophysiology has not been established yet. Also, it has proven that the primary target of COVID-19 is people with a low immune system. They are termed as the immunocompromised group of people. These immunocompromised people fall particularly into two age groups: The youngest human beings who are children less than 14 years. They still do not have a well established immune system. The other group is the elderly, who are 55, 60, and above. They have deteriorating immune systems. But, specific individuals who are not in these age groups have a low immune system due to the presence of severe diseases like HIV, cancer, etc. Asthma is not a life-threatening disease, but it is an easy situation in which infection can occur easily. This pandemic has made even healthy individuals fear for their health. But, people with other comorbid conditions, especially when it is a respiratory condition, could be even fatal. is one of the most common respiratory conditions, which causes dyspnea in the affected person. It causes difficulty in respiration. Asthma is usually caused due to several reasons. It might be transferred through families that fall under the genetic cause of the disease. It most commonly occurs due to an allergic trigger. It causes the immune system to start a hypersensitivity reaction. The allergic triggers might be dust, pollen grains, seasonal changes, mites, pets, and chemicals. When a hypersensitivity reaction is started, immune cells are released, and it someway causes the smooth muscle aided severe bronchoconstriction of the respiratory system. This will lead to symptoms like cough, wheezing, chest retractions, etc. The episodes of asthma are referred to as asthma attacks. Asthma attacks in any individual might be acute or even chronic, depending upon the occurrence. Immediate medical care and attention are often needed. However, in people who have recurrent episodes of asthma, patients are provided with handy inhalers to take puffs adequately as prophylaxis and for acute treatment of asthma under uncertain conditions. The medicines that are used in the treatment of asthma are short-acting and long-acting bronchodilators like Salbutamol, Salmeterol, corticosteroids also can be used in acutely severe cases. Nebulizers and intravenous Theophylline can also be used. In the case of co-infections, intravenous, and oral antibiotics can be given. Any comorbid health condition increases the risk of getting infected by a . As said earlier, if the comorbid condition is related to the respiratory system, the risk is actually doubled. There are no proven studies or research that state and proves that asthma increases the risk of infection. However, practicing doctors in this COVID-19 crisis suggest that a history of asthma in patients increases the risk of getting a severe form of the infection. Asthma is already a disease that limits respiration, and it can also aid in the development of co-infections. So, an asthmatic patient who gets acute or chronic attacks of asthma, when they come in contact with the coronavirus due to any reasons, can develop a co-infection with the virus. During the infected phase, if the patient gets an asthma attack, as we know, coronavirus already makes breathing a difficult task, asthma attack adds to the severity of the condition. So, the affected individual will experience severe difficulty in breathing, which might aggravate the disease. The established hypersensitivity reaction by the immune system might also interfere with the immune-mediated responses during the coronavirus infection. All the above factors might be a severe risk factor in an asthmatic patient during coronavirus infection. How to Prevent Asthmatic Attacks Over the Pandemic? Since everything about asthma and COVID-19 infection is still uncertain and not proven in any studies, the only easy and vital activity that a person with asthma history can do is prevent asthmatic attacks. Asthmatic attacks can be prevented by avoiding asthma triggers, reducing the amount of dust in the living area, limiting travel to dusty environments, when necessary a travel person should compulsorily wear masks. Regular intake of prophylactic asthmatic medicines like inhalers and most important medicines should be carried handily to prevent acute attacks of asthma. Avoiding or skipping a controller or prophylactic medication will lead to a situation called asthmatic exacerbation. Asthmatic exacerbation needs emergency medical care at the hospital, where the risk of being exposed to coronavirus is quite high. The regular practice of washing hands with soap is very mandatory and the most basic one. People with asthma, who work in office environments where washing hands often is not possible should carry a pocket hand sanitizer and disinfect their hands at regular intervals. Contact surfaces at the homes of asthmatics should also be regularly cleaned. Above all, smoking is a risk factor to both asthmas as well as COVID-19. Thus it is essential to quit smoking during this pandemic, especially asthmatics. There are a few common symptoms in both COVID 19 and asthma. The common symptoms are cough, difficulty breathing, and fever. However, a patient who has recurrent asthma attacks can recognize the difference between an asthmatic attack and any other common flu-like symptoms easily. The main symptom that distinguishes asthma from COVID-19 is wheezing. Wheezing does not occur more commonly in coronavirus infection. Because COVID-19 presents commonly with flu-like symptoms that are sore throat, cough, fever, , fatigue, it might also present digestive symptoms like diarrhea that are not usually significant with asthmatic attacks. What Happens When an Asthma Patient Experiences COVID-19 Symptoms? When an asthmatic patient experiences COVID-19 like symptoms, the first step the patient has to do is self-isolate himself or herself from the rest of the family members. Next, if the person should consult with a doctor regularly, or if the person has a family doctor who knows the patient’s history thoroughly well, the patient can contact the doctor and explain the symptoms experienced by the patient and seek medical advice and follow accordingly. If the symptoms feel more like an asthma attack, short-acting bronchodilators like inhalers can be taken, and corticosteroids can also be tried if the doctor advises so. If there is acute asthma exacerbation like symptoms along with flu-like symptoms, immediate treatment or management at the hospital might be needed. Something even more important than that is the patient or the family members accompanying the patient to the hospital is responsible for providing an adequate history of the person’s comorbid conditions, especially the history of asthma, and the treatment history must be informed to the hospital. Thus, this is how patients with a history of acute or chronic asthma can prevent, protect, and manage themselves during this coronavirus pandemic.

Even people who have never had asthma before can be affected. If symptoms become severe or life-threatening, call triple zero (000) and ask for an ambulance – say it is an asthma emergency. However, there are also ways to reduce your chances of experiencing thunderstorm asthma. Thunderstorm is triggered by a combination of grass pollen in the air and certain thunderstorm conditions. It can occur when pollen grains are drawn up into the clouds as a thunderstorm forms. The pollen grains absorb water, swell and burst open. Particles containing pollen allergens are released and are so small that they can be breathed into the lungs. The weather conditions can push these tiny particles down to ground level then along the ground in the winds that come ahead of the rain. Thunderstorm asthma usually affects people in the windy period before the rain starts. It usually occurs in spring and early summer. Thunderstorm asthma can affect people of any age. You are more likely to be affected if you: get seasonal that is triggered by pollens (this is also known as allergic rhinitis) have undiagnosed asthma or are affected by pollen without being aware of it The risk of thunderstorm asthma is highest in adults who are sensitive to grass pollen and have seasonal hay fever (with or without known asthma). If you have thunderstorm asthma, a thunderstorm might trigger one or more of these : The symptoms of thunderstorm asthma can get worse very quickly. If breathing becomes difficult, seek treatment immediately. If you are experiencing thunderstorm asthma, follow these instructions. If the symptoms are moderate or mild, begin using your . Also, if you have , such as intranasal corticosteroid sprays or combined intranasal/antihistamine sprays, take as directed. If the breathing problems are severe, call triple zero (000) and ask for an ambulance — say it is an asthma emergency — and begin using your asthma reliever inhaler. You should also call triple zero if you’re experiencing thunderstorm asthma and you don’t have an inhaler. If you are with someone who is experiencing asthma symptoms, sit the person upright, stay with them and be calm and reassuring. Follow the instructions above. If you have or have had asthma or hay fever, you can help protect yourself from thunderstorm asthma by managing those conditions well and planning for emergency situations. See your doctor for a diagnosis and to develop a personalised asthma action plan or hay fever treatment plan. Your plan should include what preventive medications you can take to manage your condition and what you should do in an asthma emergency. You should review your plan regularly with your doctor. It’s a good idea to check pollen counts and weather forecasts with these sources: the or the the , which shares pollen count in some cities both online and via an app the , which links your symptoms to environmental conditions, including pollen counts, and can notify you of triggers If a thunderstorm is approaching on a high pollen count day, it is a good idea to: make sure you have your reliever medication with you stay inside a building or a car, especially during the wind gusts before the rain if an air conditioner is on, set it to recirculate air Face masks don’t protect against the tiny particles that cause thunderstorm asthma.

Abstract Abstract Chronic asthma is a major health concern for children and adults worldwide. The goal of treatment is to prevent symptoms by reducing airway inflammation and hyperreactivity. Step-up therapy for symptom control involves initiation with low-dose treatment and increasing intensity at subsequent visits if control is not achieved. Step-down therapy starts with a high-dose regimen, reducing intensity as control is achieved. Multiple randomized controlled trials have shown that inhaled corticosteroids are the most effective monotherapy. Other agents may be added to inhaled corticosteroids if optimal symptom control is not initially attained. Long-acting beta agonists are the most effective addition, but they are not recommended as monotherapy because of questions regarding their safety. Leukotriene receptor antagonists can be used in addition to inhaled corticosteroids, but they are not as effective as adding a long-acting beta agonist. Patients with mild persistent asthma who prefer not to use inhaled corticosteroids may use leukotriene receptor antagonists as monotherapy, but they are less effective. Because of their high cost and a risk of anaphylaxis, monoclonal antibodies should be reserved for patients with severe symptoms not controlled by other agents. Immunotherapy should be considered in persons with asthma triggered by confirmed allergies if they are experiencing adverse effects with medication or have other comorbid allergic conditions. Many patients with asthma use complementary and alternative agents, most of which lack data regarding their safety or effectiveness. Approximately 25.7 million persons in the United States, including 7 million children, had the diagnosis of asthma as of 2010. It is reported that 4.1 million children experienced at least one asthma exacerbation in 2011. Between 1995 and 2010, exacerbations accounted for one-third of all hospital admissions for children younger than 15 years. Asthma caused 3,345 U.S. deaths in 2011, and it accounts for $50.1 billion annually in direct health care costs. The management of asthma involves care plans, chronic medications, and monitoring and self-care for acute exacerbations. Therapeutic agents used in the chronic management of asthma aim to prevent symptoms by controlling airway inflammation and hyperreactivity. This article reviews the currently available medications and complementary agents for chronic asthma management. A previous article in discussed the management of acute exacerbations.  Enlarge     Print Inhaled corticosteroids improve asthma control and quality of life and reduce asthma symptom severity, systemic steroid use, emergency department visits and hospitalizations, and deaths.

Abstract To provide appropriate long-term medication, physicians should assess asthma severity and symptom control at diagnosis and at each subsequent visit using one of several validated tools, such as the Asthma Control Test (https://www.asthma.com/additional-resources/asthma-control-test.html). The 2007 National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute/National Asthma Education and Prevention Program Expert Panel Report 3 (EPR-3) recommends classifying disease severity based on level of impairment and risk of adverse events (, ). Once disease severity is determined, the physician must then decide on medication and self-care management options.       Classifying Asthma Severity in Children 12 Years and Older and Adults Classifying asthma severity in children 12 years and older and adults.

Abstract Two general approaches when choosing asthma medication regimens are step-up and step-down therapy (, ). Step-up therapy involves initiating treatment at a low dose and assessing symptom control at subsequent visits (every two to four weeks), increasing the intensity of therapy as needed if control is not initially achieved. Step-down therapy starts with patients receiving a high-dose regimen, the intensity of which is reduced as control is achieved. The latter approach could be preferred, for example, to obtain rapid control in a patient who has significant symptoms at the time of diagnosis. Steps 4 and 5 within the EPR-3 Stepwise Approaches, which recommend the use of a medium- or high-dose inhaled corticosteroid plus a long-acting beta agonist (LABA), are common starting points in step-down therapy.       Stepwise Approach for Managing Asthma in Children 12 Years and Older and Adults Stepwise approach for managing asthma in children 12 years and older and adults.

A small randomized trial found that patients with moderate persistent asthma who were started on a high-dose corticosteroid followed by the step-down approach experienced a more prompt improvement in respiratory function and asthma symptoms, as well as a lower maintenance dose of inhaled corticosteroids, compared with patients treated with a step-up approach. The EPR-3 guidelines advise that treatment generally be maintained at a high-dose level with patients experiencing good symptom control for three months before stepping down in intensity; reliable patients with well-controlled asthma may be able to step down earlier. Physicians should monitor symptom control in the period after a step down in therapy because patients may have increased symptoms, particularly when an LABA is discontinued.  Medications commonly used in these two approaches are listed in , with additional information on dosing and adverse effects for these drugs available in .  Enlarge     Print . .  Enlarge     Print Age > 11 years: 180 mcg every 4 to 6 hours as needed Age 4 to 11 years: 180 mcg every 4 to 6 hours as needed Age > 11 years: 180 mcg every 4 to 6 hours as needed Age < 2 years: 0.05 to 0.15 mg per kg every 1 to 6 hours as needed, max 1.25 mg per dose Age 2 to 5 years: 0.1 to 0.15 mg per kg every 4 to 6 hours as needed, max 2.5 mg per dose Age 5 to 11 years: 2.5 mg every 4 to 6 hours as needed, max 10 mg per day Age > 11 years: 2.5 to 10 mg every 1 to 4 hours as needed Angina, arrhythmia, bad taste, cough, dizziness, headache, hyperglycemia, hypertension, hypokalemia, nausea, nervousness, palpitations, tachycardia, throat irritation, tremor Age < 13 years: 80 mcg/400 mcg to 160 mcg/800 mcg every 20 minutes as needed for up to 3 hours Age ≥ 13 years: 160 mcg/800 mcg every 20 minutes as needed for up to 3 hours Age < 13 years: 0.25 mg/1.25 mg to 0.5 mg/2.5 mg every 20 minutes for three doses, then as needed for up to 3 hours Age ≥ 13 years: 0.5 mg/2.5 mg every 20 minutes for 3 doses, then as needed for up to 3 hours Angina, arrhythmia, cardiac arrest, glaucoma, hyperglycemia, hyperlactatemia, hypertension, hypokalemia, hypotension, pharyngitis Age 4 to 11 years: 90 mcg every 4 to 6 hours as needed, max 540 mcg per day Age > 11 years: 90 mcg every 4 to 6 hours as needed, max 540 mcg per day Age 6 to 11 years: 0.31 to 0.63 mg three times a day as needed, max dose 0.63 mg Age > 11 years: 0.63 to 1.25 mg three times a day as needed Adrenal suppression, cataracts, cough, dysmenorrhea, dysphonia, eosinophilia, glaucoma, hypercorticism, growth suppression, Churg-Strauss syndrome, oral candidiasis, osteoporosis Age > 11 years: 320 mcg/18 mcg to 640 mcg/18 mcg per day Adrenal suppression, angina, arrhythmia, cardiac arrest, cataracts, cough, dysmenorrhea, dysphonia, eosinophilia, glaucoma, growth suppression, hypercorticism, hyperglycemia, hypertension, hypokalemia, hypotension, oral candidiasis, osteoporosis, palpitations, Churg-Strauss syndrome, tremor Age > 11 years: 200 mcg/100 mcg to 1,000 mcg/100 mcg per day Age > 11 years: 180 mcg/84 mcg to 920 mcg/84 mcg per day Age ≥ 18 years: 100 mcg/25 mcg to 200 mcg/25 mcg per day Cough, dyspepsia, fatigue, gastroenteritis, headache, nasal congestion, Churg-Strauss syndrome, rare elevations of LFTs, rash Diarrhea, headache, nausea, Churg-Strauss syndrome, rare elevations of LFTs Abdominal pain, dyspepsia, headache, myalgia, nausea; rare sleep disorders and behavior changes Serum level < 20 mg per L (111 μmol per L): Headache, insomnia, nausea, vomiting Serum level > 20 mg per L: Arrhythmias, seizures Cough, nasal congestion, nausea, sneezing, wheezing Age > 12 years: 150 to 375 mg subcutaneously every 2 to 4 weeks Headache, injection site reaction, pharyngitis, sinusitis, upper respiratory tract infection, viral infections DPI = dry powder inhaler; HFA = hydrofluoroalkane; LFT = liver function tests.

Abstract Inhaled corticosteroids are the most effective long-term medication for asthma. They have been shown to reduce symptom severity, systemic steroid use, emergency department visits, hospitalizations, and deaths caused by asthma, and improve asthma control, quality of life, and objective measures of lung function. Adverse effects of inhaled corticosteroids are limited, with only a slight effect on linear growth of approximately 0.5 cm per year noted in children. The effect on linear growth lessens after the first year of medication use and seems to be independent of patient age or the type of corticosteroid, dose, or delivery mechanism. It is unclear if inhaled corticosteroid use has an impact on final adult height. Other adverse effects, such as dysphonia, are generally self-limited or may be improved by changing the delivery mechanism of the inhaled corticosteroid. There are clinically significant differences in patient response to corticosteroids that are associated with age, race, and risk factors such as smoking. Black children and smokers have an increased risk of corticosteroid insensitivity. In general, delivery mechanism and type of steroid have little impact on the clinical effectiveness of corticosteroids, with the notable exception of a spacer device, which can result in a 20% to 30% increase in the amount of medication that is deposited in the lungs. Dosing of inhaled corticosteroids should be managed in a step-up or step-down fashion based on an assessment of symptom control and severity , , . Whereas abrupt cessation of inhaled corticosteroids predisposes patients to acute asthma exacerbations, changing the dosage of an inhaled corticosteroid does not increase exacerbation risk. Abstract LABAs are effective for the control of persistent asthma symptoms. They initially have an action of more than 12 to 24 hours. Available non-combination LABAs include salmeterol (Serevent) and formoterol (Foradil). Duration of action decreases to less than five hours with chronic regular use of LABAs, excluding those that contain vilanterol which currently lack data regarding duration of action decrease. The addition of an LABA to inhaled corticosteroid therapy is superior to the addition of leukotriene receptor antagonists (LTRAs) to inhaled corticosteroids in reducing asthma exacerbations requiring oral corticosteroid use, as well as improving quality-of-life measures and the effects and frequency of rescue inhaler use. Current evidence shows no clear difference in the risk of fatal adverse events between LABA monotherapy and combination therapy with inhaled corticosteroids. The risk of nonfatal adverse events is increased with salmeterol monotherapy, but it is not significantly increased with either formoterol monotherapy or combination therapy with inhaled corticosteroids and either LABA option. Current recommendations discourage the use of LABA monotherapy for long-term control of asthma. Abstract The combination of an inhaled corticosteroid and an LABA is considered a preferred therapy by the EPR-3 for the control of moderate persistent asthma in children five to 11 years of age and those 12 years and older. Combination therapy offers the best prevention of severe asthma exacerbations. A 2013 study confirmed the overall safety of combination inhaled corticosteroid and LABA therapy, especially compared with LABA monotherapy. Combination therapy dosing should be managed in a step-up or step-down approach similar to the management of inhaled corticosteroid therapy. Slight differences in when to start combination therapy are noted between the EPR-3 and Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) guidelines. For example, according to step 3 of the EPR-3 stepwise approach for patients 12 years and older, either a low-dose inhaled corticosteroid plus an LABA, or a medium-dose inhaled corticosteroid alone is appropriate . The GINA guidelines recommend a low-dose inhaled corticosteroid plus an LABA as the preferred selection in this age group, with a medium-dose inhaled corticosteroid considered the secondary option. Abstract Leukotriene modifiers include LTRAs and leukotriene inhibitors, which both act as anti-inflammatory medications. LTRAs block leukotriene receptors, whereas leukotriene inhibitors block the production of 5-lipoxygenase. The two LTRAs licensed in the United States are montelukast (Singulair) and zafirlukast (Accolate). LTRAs may be used as monotherapy for mild persistent asthma, but are considered second-line agents based on the EPR-3 and GINA guidelines. For mild to moderate asthma, the risk of exacerbation is approximately 50% less in patients prescribed an inhaled corticosteroid compared with those prescribed an LTRA. A 2014 Cochrane review found an LABA plus inhaled corticosteroid to be modestly superior to an LTRA plus inhaled corticosteroid in adults with inadequately controlled asthma. LTRAs are best used to improve pulmonary function in patients with aspirin-sensitive asthma and to decrease symptoms in exercise-induced bronchospasm. They should also be considered in patients with mild persistent asthma who prefer not to use inhaled corticosteroids. Although LTRAs generally have few adverse effects, physicians should be aware of rare case reports of eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Churg-Strauss syndrome), psychiatric symptoms, hypertriglyceridemia, angioedema, urticaria, and glomerulonephritis. Leukotriene inhibitors, such as zileuton (Zyflo), are a more recent addition to the treatment of asthma. Limited data show some improvement in peak flows with zileuton compared with montelukast. However, zileuton is extremely expensive and has not been shown to improve symptom scores. Abstract Theophylline, the most commonly used methylxanthine in asthma patients, acts as a bronchodilator at high serum concentrations (10 to 20 mcg per L [56 to 111 μmol per L]), but has an anti-inflammatory effect at lower serum concentrations (5 to 10 mcg per L [28 to 56 μmol per L]). Theophylline administered with inhaled corticosteroids decreases exacerbations, but it has similar effects to increasing the dosage of the inhaled corticosteroid. The EPR-3 specifies that theophylline is a nonpreferred alternative to inhaled corticosteroid. The GINA guidelines recommend a trial of increased dosage of inhaled corticosteroid before considering theophylline, unless steroid sparing is necessary, such as in patients with severe glaucoma or active tuberculosis infection. Patients in developing countries are more likely to use low-dose theophylline than inhaled corticosteroids because it is a cheaper option. Although theophylline is considered safer at lower serum concentrations, care of patients who use theophylline should be comanaged with an asthma subspecialist because of the narrow therapeutic range of this drug and the risk of death from an overdose.  Theophylline is metabolized in the liver and is susceptible to drug-drug interactions through cytochrome P450 1A2 .  Enlarge     Print Approximate effect on serum levels of theophylline Approximate effect on serum levels of theophylline Abstract Cromolyn decreases bronchospasm through an anti-inflammatory effect. A 2008 Cochrane review found insufficient evidence of benefit of cromolyn over placebo. Because cromolyn is less effective and less cost-effective than an inhaled corticosteroid, its use should be limited to patients who cannot tolerate inhaled corticosteroids. Cromolyn is beneficial for exercise-induced bronchospasm but is considered second-line therapy. Abstract Omalizumab (Xolair) is currently the only monoclonal anti-immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibody with a U.S. Food and Drug Administration indication for asthma. It binds the free IgE antibodies, decreasing the release of inflammatory mediators from mast cells. In a randomized trial, omalizumab reduced the rate of exacerbations in inner-city children from 48.8% to 30.3%, resulting in decreased reliance on an inhaled corticosteroid. A 2014 Cochrane review found omalizumab effective in reducing exacerbations, decreasing the dosage of inhaled corticosteroid used, and improving health-related quality of life. Because of its high cost and the risk of anaphylaxis, omalizumab should be considered only for adults and children 12 years and older with confirmed IgE-dependent allergic asthma that is uncontrolled with conventional medications. Abstract Subcutaneous and sublingual immunotherapies involve repeated patient exposure to antigens to desensitize the patient to the antigen. Immunotherapy is effective in reducing exacerbations, need for medication use, and overall cost of care in patients with allergic asthma. A 2010 Cochrane review found a number needed to treat of 4 to avoid one deterioration in asthma symptoms, but it could not determine the size of effect compared with other therapies. Immunotherapy should be considered in patients with asthma triggered by confirmed allergies who are experiencing adverse effects from medication or have other comorbid allergic conditions. Abstract The rate of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) use in children and adolescents with asthma is as high as 71% to 84%, but 54% of parents do not disclose the use of these methods. CAM use is more common among children with poorly controlled asthma and those with barriers to treatment. However, data indicate that CAM treatment is typically not used as a substitute for conventional medicine.  Patients who are receiving CAM substances should be cautioned that there is little regulation to ensure the consistency and purity of the contents and that CAM is never a substitute for rescue medication.

Dust mites are mostly found in the house and commonly trigger symptoms in people with , allergic rhinitis () or , who are allergic to them. There are ways you can help to reduce the number of dust mites and their allergen (the substance they produce that causes allergy), as well as to control . Dust mites belong to the same family as spiders and are so tiny you can’t see them without a microscope. They feed on discarded human skin, house dust, and other microscopic food sources such as pollen and fungal spores. Dust mites don’t bite or sting. However, their bodies contain a strong allergen, and they also shed droppings and skin.  Dust mites are mostly found in homes with higher humidity levels and constant warm temperatures, so they are more common in coastal areas of Australia than in inland, dry areas.  In the house, they live in layers of dust that have settled, particularly in high traffic areas. Because they feed on discarded skin cells, they are also commonly found in the bed and bedroom. When you are making your bed, they can become airborne and settle in other areas of the house. They also like to live in soft furnishings such as couches, curtains, and deep carpet.  There tend to be more dust mites during changes in the seasons, when people are often spring-cleaning their houses. This can affect people who are allergic to them. Many people who have asthma, eczema, allergic rhinitis or other allergies are allergic to dust mites. The allergen created by dust mites can trigger symptoms of their condition. If you suspect that you are allergic to dust mites, it is important to confirm that dust mites are a trigger for your asthma or allergy.  such as a skin prick test or specific blood tests will help to determine this. However, a positive test does not mean that the dust mite will trigger your symptoms. Talking to your doctor and understanding the times and seasons your symptoms are triggered will help you know if dust mites affect your asthma or allergy.  The allergen is present both in the mites as well as in their droppings and discarded skin cases. So, it is important to try to reduce all of these. Unfortunately, it’s not possible to completely remove dust mites from the house, and you will need to do more than one thing to reduce their numbers and effect.  Wash sheets and pillow cases every week in water hotter than 60 degrees Celsius (60°C). This will kill the dust mites and remove the allergen. If you can’t use hot water, try a commercial washing product containing tea tree or eucalyptus oils, which kills dust mites and can be used in cold water.  Open the curtains and allow sunshine into your room and, if possible, your bed. Dust mites don’t like bright light. Put dust mite-resistant protective covers on your mattress, doona and pillows. These need to be washed every 8 weeks.  If you don’t have protective covers, wash blankets and doonas every 3 months.  Remove pillows and soft toys from the bedroom or wash them every week. Soft toys can be put into the freezer to kill the dust mites, but this will not remove the allergen.  Replace fabric curtains with venetian blinds or shutters to make them easier to clean. If you can’t do this, wash curtains regularly, if possible.  Vacuuming will not completely remove all dust mites or allergens because mites burrow deep into thick carpet. However, it will reduce their numbers so it should be done weekly. It is more effective to vacuum dust mites and droppings from hard surface floors. High efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter vacuum cleaners may remove more allergen than a standard vacuum cleaner. As vacuuming lifts and swirls the mites and allergens around the room, someone else may need to do this and you should avoid entering the room for 20 minutes afterwards. Reducing the overall humidity of the house and increasing air circulation may help to keep dust mites at a lower level. Use a damp or electrostatic cloth to dust hard surfaces.  If possible, use vinyl or leather lounges rather than fabric.  If you have a diagnosed allergy to dust mites, your symptoms will depend on whether your condition is asthma, eczema, hay fever or another allergic condition. Your doctor will work with you to help manage your symptoms, which may involve asthma or allergy medicine, as well as avoiding the dust mites. In some cases, your doctor may prescribe immunotherapy, which involves gradually increasing doses of the dust mite allergen to help reduce the severity of symptoms. This can take 3 to 5 years of treatment to be effective.  For more information about dust mite or other allergies, visit the Australasian Society of Clinical Immunology and Allergy (ASCIA) website.

PULMICORT FLEXHALER is indicated for the maintenance treatment of asthma as prophylactic therapy in patients six years of age or older. PULMICORT FLEXHALER is NOT indicated for the relief of acute bronchospasm. PULMICORT FLEXHALER should be administered twice daily by the orally inhaled route only. After inhalation, the patient should rinse the mouth with water without swallowing [see]. Patients should be instructed to prime PULMICORT FLEXHALER prior to its initial use, and instructed to inhale deeply and forcefully each time the device is used. The safety and efficacy of PULMICORT FLEXHALER when administered in excess of recommended doses have not been established. After asthma stability has been achieved, it is desirable to titrate to the lowest effective dosage to reduce the possibility of side effects. For patients who do not respond adequately to the starting dose after 1-2 weeks of therapy with PULMICORT FLEXHALER, increasing the dose may provide additional asthma control. If asthma symptoms arise in the period between doses, an inhaled, short-acting beta-agonist should be taken for immediate relief. Patients 18 Years of Age and Older: For patients 18 years of age and older, the recommended starting dosage is 360 mcg twice daily. In some adult patients, a starting dose of 180 mcg twice daily may be adequate. The maximum dosage should not exceed 720 mcg twice daily. Patients 6 to 17 Years of Age: The recommended starting dosage is 180 mcg twice daily. In some pediatric patients, a starting dose of 360 mcg twice daily may be appropriate. The maximum dosage should not exceed 360 mcg twice daily. For all patients, it is desirable to titrate to the lowest effective dose after adequate asthma stability is achieved. Improvement in asthma control following inhaled administration of budesonide can occur within 24 hours of initiation of treatment, although maximum benefit may not be achieved for 1 to 2 weeks, or longer. Individual patients will experience a variable onset and degree of symptom relief. If a previously effective dosage regimen of PULMICORT FLEXHALER fails to provide adequate control of asthma, the therapeutic regimen should be re-evaluated and additional therapeutic options (e.g. replacing the lower strength of PULMICORT FLEXHALER with the higher strength or initiating oral corticosteroids) should be considered. PULMICORT FLEXHALER is available as a dry powder for inhalation containing budesonide in the following 2 strengths: 90 mcg and 180 mcg. Each inhaler contains 60 or 120 actuations. The use of PULMICORT FLEXHALER is contraindicated in the following conditions: Primary treatment of status asthmaticus or other acute episodes of asthma where intensive measures are required. Severe hypersensitivity to milk proteins or any ingredients of PULMICORT FLEXHALER [see]. In clinical studies, the development of localized infections of the mouth and pharynx with has occurred in patients treated with PULMICORT FLEXHALER. When such an infection develops, it should be treated with appropriate local or systemic (i.e. oral antifungal) therapy while treatment with PULMICORT FLEXHALER continues, but at times, therapy with PULMICORT FLEXHALER may need to be interrupted. Patients should rinse the mouth after inhalation of PULMICORT FLEXHALER. PULMICORT FLEXHALER is not a bronchodilator and is not indicated for the rapid relief of bronchospasm or other acute episodes of asthma. Patients should be instructed to contact their physician immediately if episodes of asthma not responsive to their usual doses of bronchodilators occur during the course of treatment with PULMICORT FLEXHALER. During such episodes, patients may require therapy with oral corticosteroids. An inhaled short acting beta-agonist, not PULMICORT FLEXHALER, should be used to relieve acute symptoms such as shortness of breath. When prescribing PULMICORT FLEXHALER, the physician must also provide the patient with an inhaled, short-acting beta-agonist (e.g. albuterol) for treatment of acute symptoms, despite regular twice-daily (morning and evening) use of PULMICORT FLEXHALER. 5.3 Hypersensitivity Reactions Including Anaphylaxis Hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis, rash, contact dermatitis, urticaria, angioedema, and bronchospasm have been reported with use of PULMICORT FLEXHALER. Discontinue PULMICORT FLEXHALER if such reactions occur [see]. PULMICORT FLEXHALER contains small amounts of lactose, which contains trace levels of milk proteins. It is possible that cough, wheezing, or bronchospasm may occur in patients who have a severe milk protein allergy [seeand Adverse Reactions, Post-marketing Experience (6.2)]. Patients who are on drugs that suppress the immune system are more susceptible to infection than healthy individuals. Chicken pox and measles, for example, can have a more serious or even fatal course in susceptible children or adults using corticosteroids. In children or adults who have not had these diseases or been properly immunized, particular care should be taken to avoid exposure. How the dose, route, and duration of corticosteroid administration affects the risk of developing a disseminated infection is not known. The contribution of the underlying disease and/or prior corticosteroid treatment to the risk is also not known. If exposed to chicken pox, therapy with varicella zoster immune globulin (VZIG) or pooled intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), as appropriate, may be indicated. If exposed to measles, prophylaxis with pooled intramuscular immunoglobulin (IG) may be indicated. (See the respective package inserts for complete VZIG and IG prescribing information.) If chicken pox develops, treatment with antiviral agents may be considered. The immune responsiveness to varicella vaccine was evaluated in pediatric patients with asthma ages 12 months to 8 years with budesonide inhalation suspension. An open-label, nonrandomized clinical study examined the immune responsiveness to varicella vaccine in 243 asthma patients 12 months to 8 years of age who were treated with budesonide inhalation suspension 0.25 mg to 1 mg daily (n=151) or non-corticosteroid asthma therapy (n=92) (i.e., beta-agonists, leukotriene receptor antagonists, cromones). The percentage of patients developing a seroprotective antibody titer of ≥5.0 (gpELISA value) in response to the vaccination was similar in patients treated with budesonide inhalation suspension (85%), compared to patients treated with non-corticosteroid asthma therapy (90%). No patient treated with budesonide inhalation suspension developed chicken pox as a result of vaccination. Inhaled corticosteroids should be used with caution, if at all, in patients with active or quiescent tuberculosis infection of the respiratory tract, untreated systemic fungal, bacterial, viral or parasitic infections, or ocular herpes simplex. 5.5 Transferring Patients from Systemic Corticosteroid Therapy Particular care is needed for patients who are transferred from systemically active corticosteroids to PULMICORT FLEXHALER because deaths due to adrenal insufficiency have occurred in asthmatic patients during and after transfer from systemic corticosteroids to less systemically available inhaled corticosteroids. After withdrawal from systemic corticosteroids, a number of months are required for recovery of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) function. Patients who have been previously maintained on 20 mg or more per day of prednisone (or its equivalent) may be most susceptible, particularly when their systemic corticosteroids have been almost completely withdrawn. During this period of HPA suppression, patients may exhibit signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency when exposed to trauma, surgery, or infection (particularly gastroenteritis) or other conditions associated with severe electrolyte loss. Although PULMICORT FLEXHALER may provide control of asthma symptoms during these episodes, in recommended doses it supplies less than normal physiological amounts of glucocorticoid systemically and does NOT provide the mineralocorticoid activity that is necessary for coping with these emergencies. During periods of stress or a severe asthma attack, patients who have been withdrawn from systemic corticosteroids should be instructed to resume oral corticosteroids (in large doses) immediately and to contact their physicians for further instruction. These patients should also be instructed to carry a medical identification card indicating that they may need supplementary systemic corticosteroids during periods of stress or a severe asthma attack. Patients requiring oral corticosteroids should be weaned slowly from systemic corticosteroid use after transferring to PULMICORT FLEXHALER. Prednisone reduction can be accomplished by reducing the daily prednisone dose by 2.5 mg on a weekly basis during therapy with PULMICORT FLEXHALER. Lung function (mean forced expiratory volume in 1 second [FEV] or morning peak expiratory flow [PEF]), beta-agonist use, and asthma symptoms should be carefully monitored during withdrawal of oral corticosteroids. In addition to monitoring asthma signs and symptoms, patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency such as fatigue, lassitude, weakness, nausea and vomiting, and hypotension. Transfer of patients from systemic corticosteroid therapy to PULMICORT FLEXHALER may unmask allergic conditions previously suppressed by the systemic corticosteroid therapy, (e.g., rhinitis, conjunctivitis, eczema, arthritis, eosinophilic conditions). Some patients may experience symptoms of systemically active corticosteroid withdrawal (e.g., joint and/or muscular pain, lassitude, depression) despite maintenance or even improvement of respiratory function. PULMICORT FLEXHALER will often help control asthma symptoms with less suppression of HPA function than therapeutically equivalent oral doses of prednisone. Since budesonide is absorbed into the circulation and can be systemically active at higher doses, the beneficial effects of PULMICORT FLEXHALER in minimizing HPA dysfunction may be expected only when recommended dosages are not exceeded and individual patients are titrated to the lowest effective dose. Since individual sensitivity to effects on cortisol production exists, physicians should consider this information when prescribing PULMICORT FLEXHALER. Because of the possibility of systemic absorption of inhaled corticosteroids, patients treated with PULMICORT FLEXHALER should be observed carefully for any evidence of systemic corticosteroid effects. Particular care should be taken in observing patients postoperatively or during periods of stress for evidence of inadequate adrenal response. It is possible that systemic corticosteroid effects such as hypercorticism and adrenal suppression (including adrenal crisis) may appear in a small number of patients, particularly when budesonide is administered at higher than recommended doses over prolonged periods of time. If such effects occur, the dosage of PULMICORT FLEXHALER should be reduced slowly, consistent with accepted procedures for reducing systemic corticosteroids and for management of asthma symptoms. 5.7 Interactions with Strong Cytochrome P450 3A4 Inhibitors Caution should be exercised when considering the co-administration of PULMICORT FLEXHALER with ketoconazole, and other known strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. ritonavir, atazanavir, clarithromycin, indinavir, itraconazole, nefazodone, nelfinavir, saquinavir, telithromycin) because adverse effects related to increased systemic exposure to budesonide may occur [ee]. Decreases in bone mineral density (BMD) have been observed with long-term administration of products containing inhaled corticosteroids. The clinical significance of small changes in BMD with regard to long-term consequences such as fracture is unknown. Patients with major risk factors for decreased bone mineral content, such as prolonged immobilization, family history of osteoporosis, post menopausal status, tobacco use, advance age, poor nutrition, or chronic use of drugs that can reduce bone mass (e.g, anticonvulsants, oral corticosteroids) should be monitored and treated with established standards of care. Orally inhaled corticosteroids, including budesonide, may cause a reduction in growth velocity when administered to pediatric patients. Monitor the growth of pediatric patients receiving PULMICORT FLEXHALER routinely (e.g., via stadiometry). To minimize the systemic effects of orally inhaled corticosteroids, including PULMICORT FLEXHALER, titrate each patient’s dose to the lowest dosage that effectively controls his/her symptoms [see]. Glaucoma, increased intraocular pressure, and cataracts have been reported following the long-term administration of inhaled corticosteroids, including budesonide. Therefore, close monitoring is warranted in patients with a change in vision or with a history of increased intraocular pressure, glaucoma, and/or cataracts. 5.11 Paradoxical Bronchospasm and Upper Airway Symptoms As with other inhaled asthma medications, PULMICORT FLEXHALER can produce paradoxical bronchospasm, which may be life threatening. If paradoxical bronchospasm occurs following dosing with PULMICORT FLEXHALER, it should be treated immediately with an inhaled, short-acting beta- bronchodilator. PULMICORT FLEXHALER should be discontinued immediately, and alternative therapy should be instituted. 5.12 Eosinophilic Conditions and Churg-Strauss Syndrome In rare cases, patients on inhaled corticosteroids may present with systemic eosinophilic conditions. Some of these patients have clinical features of vasculitis consistent with Churg- Strauss syndrome, a condition that is often treated with systemic corticosteroid therapy. These events usually, but not always, have been associated with the reduction and/or withdrawal of oral corticosteroid therapy following the introduction of inhaled corticosteroids. Physicians should be alert to eosinophilia, vasculitic rash, worsening pulmonary symptoms, cardiac complications, and/or neuropathy presenting in their patients. A causal relationship between budesonide and these underlying conditions has not been established. Systemic and inhaled corticosteroid use may result in the following: infection [see] Hypersensitivity Including Anaphylaxis [see] Immunosuppression [see] Hypercorticism and Adrenal Suppression [see] Reduction in Bone Mineral Density [see] Growth Effects [see (5.9) and Use in Specific Populations (8.4)] Glaucoma and Cataracts [see] Eosinophilic conditions and Churg-Strauss [see] Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The incidence of common adverse reactions in Table 1 is based upon pooled data reported in patients treated with PULMICORT FLEXHALER 180 or 90 mcg in two double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials in which 226 patients (106 females and 120 males) with mild to moderate asthma, previously receiving bronchodilators, inhaled corticosteroids, or both, were treated with PULMICORT FLEXHALER, administered as 360 mcg twice daily for 12 weeks. In these trials, the patients on PULMICORT FLEXHALER had a mean age of 28 years (range 6-80 years) and were predominantly Caucasian (59.7%) and Asian (31.4%). Table 1 includes all adverse reactions (regardless of investigator causality assessment) that occurred at a rate of ≥1% in the PULMICORT FLEXHALER group and more commonly than the placebo group. Table 1 - Adverse Reactions occurring at an incidence of ≥1% and more commonly than placebo in the PULMICORT FLEXHALER group: pooled data from two 12-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical asthma trials in patients 6 years and older Long-Term Safety in Patients 6 years of age and older Non-placebo controlled long-term studies in children (at doses up to 360 mcg daily), and adolescent and adult subjects (at doses up to 720 mcg daily), treated for up to one year with PULMICORT FLEXHALER, revealed a similar pattern and incidence of adverse events. The following adverse reactions occurred in placebo-controlled clinical trials with similar or lower doses with inhaled budesonide via a different PULMICORT dry powder inhaler with an incidence of ≥1% in the budesonide group and were more common than in the placebo group: ≥3%: respiratory infection, sinusitis, headache, pain, back pain, fever. ≥1-3%: neck pain, syncope, abdominal pain, dry mouth, vomiting, weight gain, fracture, myalgia, hypertonia, migraine, ecchymosis, insomnia, infection, taste perversion, voice alteration. Higher doses of inhaled budesonide (800 mcg twice daily) via a different PULMICORT dry powder inhaler resulted in an increased incidence of voice alteration, flu syndrome, dyspepsia, gastroenteritis, nausea, and back pain, compared with doses of 400 mcg twice daily. In a 20-week trial in adult asthmatics who previously required oral corticosteroids, the incidence of adverse reactions was evaluated with 400 mcg twice daily (N=53) and 800 mcg twice daily (N=53) of inhaled budesonide via a different PULMICORT dry powder inhaler and compared with placebo (N=53). In considering these data, the increased average duration of exposure for inhaled budesonide patients (78 days for inhaled budesonide vs. 41 days for placebo) should be taken into account. Adverse reactions, regardless of investigator causality assessment, reported in more than five patients in the budesonide group and which occurred more commonly than the placebo group in decreasing order of frequency include: respiratory infection, sinusitis, headache, oral candidiasis, pain, asthenia, dyspepsia, arthralgia, cough increased, nausea and rhinitis. The following adverse reactions have been reported during post-approval use of PULMICORT FLEXHALER. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. immediate and delayed hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylactic reaction, angioedema, bronchospasm, rash, contact dermatitis, urticaria, and cough, wheezing or bronchospasm in patients with severe milk protein hypersensitivity [see (5.3) and (4)] symptoms of hypocorticism and hypercorticism [see] cataracts, glaucoma, increased intraocular pressure [see] psychiatric symptoms including psychosis, depression, aggressive reactions, irritability, nervousness, restlessness, and anxiety throat irritation skin bruising The main route of metabolism of corticosteroids, including budesonide, is via cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoenzyme 3A4 (CYP3A4). After oral administration of ketoconazole, a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4, the mean plasma concentration of orally administered budesonide increased. Concomitant administration of CYP3A4 may inhibit the metabolism of, and increase the systemic exposure to, budesonide. Caution should be exercised when considering the co-administration of PULMICORT FLEXHALER with long-term ketoconazole and other known strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ritonavir, atazanavir, clarithromycin, indinavir, itraconazole, nefazodone, nelfinavir, saquinavir, telithromycin) [see]. Studies of pregnant women, have not shown that inhaled budesonide increases the risk of abnormalities when administered during pregnancy. The results from a large population-based prospective cohort epidemiological study reviewing data from three Swedish registries covering approximately 99% of the pregnancies from 1995-1997 (i.e., Swedish Medical Birth Registry; Registry of Congenital Malformations; Child Cardiology Registry) indicate no increased risk for congenital malformations from the use of inhaled budesonide during early pregnancy. Congenital malformations were studied in 2014 infants born to mothers reporting the use of inhaled budesonide for asthma in early pregnancy (usually 10-12 weeks after the last menstrual period), the period when most major organ malformations occur. The rate of recorded congenital malformations was similar compared to the general population rate (3.8% vs. 3.5%, respectively). In addition, after exposure to inhaled budesonide, the number of infants born with orofacial clefts was similar to the expected number in the normal population (4 children vs. 3.3, respectively). These same data were utilized in a second study bringing the total to 2534 infants whose mothers were exposed to inhaled budesonide. In this study, the rate of congenital malformations among infants whose mothers were exposed to inhaled budesonide during early pregnancy was not different from the rate for all newborn babies during the same period (3.6%). Despite the animal findings, it would appear that the possibility of fetal harm is remote if the drug is used during pregnancy. Nevertheless, because the studies in humans cannot rule out the possibility of harm, PULMICORT FLEXHALER should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. As with other glucocorticoids, budesonide produced fetal loss, decreased pup weight, and skeletal abnormalities at a subcutaneous dose in rabbits that was approximately 0.3 times the maximum recommended daily inhalation dose in adults on a mcg/m basis and at a subcutaneous dose in rats that was approximately 3 times the maximum recommended daily inhalation dose in adults on a mcg/m basis. No teratogenic or embryocidal effects were observed in rats when budesonide was administered by inhalation at doses up to approximately equivalent to the maximum recommended daily inhalation dose in adults on a mcg/m basis. Experience with oral corticosteroids since their introduction in pharmacologic as opposed to physiologic doses suggests that rodents are more prone to teratogenic effects from corticosteroids than humans. Hypoadrenalism may occur in infants born of mothers receiving corticosteroids during pregnancy. Such infants should be carefully observed. Budesonide, like other corticosteroids, is secreted in human milk. Data with budesonide delivered via dry powder inhaler indicates that the total daily oral dose of budesonide available in breast milk to the infant is approximately 0.3% to 1% of the dose inhaled by the mother [seeClinical Pharmacology, Pharmacokinetics, Special Populations, Nursing Mothers (12.3)]. No studies have been conducted in breastfeeding women specifically with PULMICORT FLEXHALER; however, the dose of budesonide available to the infant in breast milk, as a percentage of the maternal dose, would be expected to be similar. PULMICORT FLEXHALER should be used in nursing women only if clinically appropriate. Prescribers should weigh the known benefits of breastfeeding for the mother and the infant against the potential risks of minimal budesonide exposure in the infant. Dosing considerations include prescription or titration to the lowest clinically effective dose and use of PULMICORT FLEXHALER immediately after breastfeeding to maximize the time interval between dosing and breastfeeding to minimize infant exposure. However, in general, PULMICORT FLEXHALER use should not delay or interfere with infant feeding. In a 12-week pivotal study, 204 patients 6 to 17 years of age were treated with PULMICORT FLEXHALER twice daily [see]. Efficacy results in this age group were similar to those observed in patients 18 years and older. There were no obvious differences in the type or frequency of adverse events reported in this age group compared with patients 18 years of age and older. The safety and effectiveness of PULMICORT FLEXHALER in asthma patients below 6 years of age have not been established. Controlled clinical studies have shown that orally inhaled corticosteroids, including budesonide, may cause a reduction in growth velocity in pediatric patients. This effect has been observed in the absence of laboratory evidence of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis suppression, suggesting that growth velocity is a more sensitive indicator of systemic corticosteroid exposure in pediatric patients than some commonly used tests of HPA-axis function. The long-term effects of this reduction in growth velocity associated with orally inhaled corticosteroids including the impact on final adult height are unknown. The potential for “catch up” growth following discontinuation of treatment with orally inhaled corticosteroids has not been adequately studied. In a study of asthmatic children 5-12 years of age, those treated with inhaled budesonide via a different PULMICORT dry powder inhaler 200 mcg twice daily (n=311) had a 1.1- centimeter reduction in growth compared with those receiving placebo (n=418) at the end of one year; the difference between these two treatment groups did not increase further over three years of additional treatment. By the end of four years, children treated with a different PULMICORT dry powder inhaler and children treated with placebo had similar growth velocities. Conclusions drawn from this study may be confounded by the unequal use of corticosteroids in the treatment groups and inclusion of data from patients attaining puberty during the course of the study. The administration of inhaled budesonide via a different PULMICORT dry-powder inhaler in doses up to 800 mcg/day (mean daily dose 445 mcg/day) or via a pressurized metered-dose inhaler in doses up to 1200 mcg/day (mean daily dose 620 mcg/day) to 216 pediatric patients (age 3 to 11 years) for 2 to 6 years had no significant effect on statural growth compared with non-corticosteroid therapy in 62 matched control patients. However, the long-term effect of inhaled budesonide on growth is not fully known. The growth of pediatric patients receiving orally inhaled corticosteroids, including PULMICORT FLEXHALER, should be monitored (eg, via stadiometry). If a child or adolescent on any corticosteroid appears to have growth suppression, the possibility that he/she is particularly sensitive to this effect should be considered. The potential growth effects of prolonged treatment should be weighed against clinical benefits obtained. To minimize the systemic effects of inhaled corticosteroids, including PULMICORT FLEXHALER, each patient should be titrated to the lowest dose that effectively controls his/her asthma [see]. Of the total number of patients in controlled clinical studies receiving inhaled budesonide, 153 (n=11 treated with PULMICORT FLEXHALER ) were 65 years of age or older and one was age 75 years or older. No overall differences in safety were observed between these patients and younger patients. Clinical studies did not include sufficient numbers of patients aged 65 years and over to determine differences in efficacy between elderly and younger patients. Other reported clinical or medical surveillance experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. Formal pharmacokinetic studies using PULMICORT FLEXHALER have not been conducted in patients with hepatic impairment. However, since budesonide is predominantly cleared by hepatic metabolism, impairment of liver function may lead to accumulation of budesonide in the plasma. Therefore, patients with hepatic disease should be closely monitored. The potential for acute toxic effects following overdose of PULMICORT FLEXHALER is low. If used at excessive doses for prolonged periods, systemic corticosteroid effects such as hypercorticism may occur [seeWarnings and Precautions, Hypercorticism and Adrenal Suppression (5.6)]. Another budesonide-containing dry powder inhaler at 3200 mcg daily administered for 6 weeks caused a significant reduction (27%) in the plasma cortisol response to a 6-hour infusion of ACTH compared with placebo (+1%). The corresponding effect of 10 mg prednisone daily was a 35% reduction in the plasma cortisol response to ACTH. The minimal inhalation lethal dose in mice was 100 mg/kg (approximately 280 times the maximum recommended daily inhalation dose in adults and approximately 330 times the maximum recommended daily inhalation dose in children 6 to 17 years of age on a mcg/m basis). There were no deaths following the administration of an inhalation dose of 68 mg/kg in rats (approximately 380 times the maximum recommended daily inhalation dose in adults and approximately 450 times the maximum recommended daily inhalation dose in children 6 to 17 years of age on a mcg/m basis). The minimal oral lethal dose was 200 mg/kg in mice (approximately 560 times the maximum recommended daily inhalation dose in adults and approximately 670 times the maximum recommended daily inhalation dose in children 6 to 17 years of age on a mcg/m basis) and less than 100 mg/kg in rats (approximately 560 times the maximum recommended daily inhalation dose in adults and approximately 670 times the maximum recommended daily inhalation dose in children 6 to 17 years of age based on a mcg/m basis). Post-marketing experience showed that acute overdose of inhaled budesonide commonly remained asymptomatic. The use of excessive doses (up to 6400 mcg daily) for prolonged periods showed systemic corticosteroid effects such as hypercorticism. Budesonide, the active component of PULMICORT FLEXHALER, is a corticosteroid designated chemically as (RS)-11β, 16α, 17,21-Tetrahydroxypregna-1,4-diene-3,20-dione cyclic 16,17-acetal with butyraldehyde. Budesonide is provided as a mixture of two epimers (22R and 22S). The empirical formula of budesonide is CHO and its molecular weight is 430.5. Its structural formula is: Budesonide is a white to off-white, tasteless, odorless powder that is practically insoluble in water and in heptane, sparingly soluble in ethanol, and freely soluble in chloroform. Its partition coefficient between octanol and water at pH 7.4 is 1.6 x 10. PULMICORT FLEXHALER is an inhalation-driven multi-dose dry powder inhaler containing a formulation of 1 mg per actuation of micronized budesonide and micronized lactose monohydrate which contains trace levels of milk proteins [see ]. Each actuation of PULMICORT FLEXHALER 180 mcg delivers 160 mcg budesonide from the mouthpiece and each actuation of PULMICORT FLEXHALER 90 mcg delivers 80 mcg budesonide from the mouthpiece (based on testing at 60 L/min for 2 sec). Each PULMICORT FLEXHALER 180 mcg contains 120 actuations and each PULMICORT FLEXHALER 90 mcg contains 60 actuations. testing has shown that the dose delivery for PULMICORT FLEXHALER is dependent on airflow through the device, as evidenced by a decrease in the fine particle dose at a flow rate of 30 L/min to a value that is approximately 40-50% of that produced at 60 L/min. At a flow rate of 40 L/min, the fine particle dose is approximately 70% of that produced at 60 L/min. Patient factors such as inspiratory flow rates will also affect the dose delivered to the lungs of patients in actual use [see Patient Information and Instructions for Use (17.11)]. In asthmatic children age 6 to 17 (N=516, FEV 2.29 [0.97– 4.28]) peak inspiratory flow (PIF) through PULMICORT FLEXHALER was 72.5 [19.1 – 103.6] L/min). Inspiratory flows were not measured in the adult pivotal study. Patients should be carefully instructed on the use of this drug product to assure optimal dose delivery. Budesonide is an anti-inflammatory corticosteroid that exhibits potent glucocorticoid activity and weak mineralocorticoid activity. In standard and animal models, budesonide has approximately a 200-fold higher affinity for the glucocorticoid receptor and a 1000-fold higher topical anti-inflammatory potency than cortisol (rat croton oil ear edema assay). As a measure of systemic activity, budesonide is 40 times more potent than cortisol when administered subcutaneously and 25 times more potent when administered orally in the rat thymus involution assay. The clinical significance of this is unknown. The activity of PULMICORT FLEXHALER is due to the parent drug, budesonide. In glucocorticoid receptor affinity studies, the 22R form was two times as active as the 22S epimer. studies indicated that the two forms of budesonide do not interconvert. The precise mechanism of corticosteroid actions on inflammation in asthma is not known. Inflammation is an important component in the pathogenesis of asthma. Corticosteroids have a wide range of inhibitory activities against multiple cell types (e.g., mast cells, eosinophils, neutrophils, macrophages, and lymphocytes) and mediators (e.g., histamine, eicosanoids, leukotrienes, and cytokines) involved in allergic and non-allergic-mediated inflammation. These anti-inflammatory actions of corticosteroids may contribute to their efficacy in asthma. Studies in asthmatic patients have shown a favorable ratio between topical anti-inflammatory activity and systemic corticosteroid effects over a wide range of doses of inhaled budesonide. This is explained by a combination of a relatively high local anti-inflammatory effect, extensive first pass hepatic degradation of orally absorbed drug (85-95%), and the low potency of formed metabolites (see below). To confirm that systemic absorption is not a significant factor in the clinical efficacy of inhaled budesonide, a clinical study in patients with asthma was performed comparing 400 mcg budesonide administered via a pressurized metered-dose inhaler with a tube spacer to 1400 mcg of oral budesonide and placebo. The study demonstrated the efficacy of inhaled budesonide but not orally administered budesonide, even though systemic budesonide exposure was comparable for both treatments, indicating that the inhaled treatment is working locally in the lung. Thus, the therapeutic effect of conventional doses of orally inhaled budesonide are largely explained by its direct action on the respiratory tract. Inhaled budesonide has been shown to decrease airway reactivity in various challenge models, including histamine, methacholine, sodium metabisulfite, and adenosine monophosphate in patients with hyperreactive airways. The clinical relevance of these models is not certain. Pre-treatment with inhaled budesonide 1600 mcg daily (800 mcg twice daily) for 2 weeks reduced the acute (early-phase reaction) and delayed (late-phase reaction) decrease in FEV following inhaled allergen challenge. The effects of inhaled budesonide on the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis were studied in 905 adults and 404 pediatric patients with asthma. For most patients, the ability to increase cortisol production in response to stress, as assessed by cosyntropin (ACTH) stimulation test, remained intact with inhaled budesonide treatment at recommended doses. For adult patients treated with 100, 200, 400, or 800 mcg twice daily for 12 weeks, 4%, 2%, 6%, and 13% respectively, had an abnormal stimulated cortisol response (peak cortisol <14.5 mcg/dL assessed by liquid chromatography following short-cosyntropin test) as compared with 8% of patients treated with placebo. Similar results were obtained in pediatric patients. In another study in adults, doses of 400, 800 and 1600 mcg of inhaled budesonide twice daily for 6 weeks were examined; 1600 mcg twice daily (twice the maximum recommended dose) resulted in a 27% reduction in stimulated cortisol (6-hour ACTH infusion) while 10 mg prednisone resulted in a 35% reduction. In this study, no patient taking doses of 400 and 800 mcg twice daily met the criterion for an abnormal stimulated cortisol response (peak cortisol <14.5 mcg/dL assessed by liquid chromatography) following ACTH infusion. An open-label, long-term follow-up of 1133 patients for up to 52 weeks confirmed the minimal effect on the HPA axis (both basal and stimulated plasma cortisol) of inhaled budesonide when administered at doses ranging from 100 to 800 mcg twice daily. In patients who had previously been oral steroid-dependent, use of inhaled budesonide at doses ranging from 100 to 800 mcg twice daily was associated with higher stimulated cortisol response compared with baseline following 1 year of therapy. After oral administration of budesonide, peak plasma concentration was achieved in about 1 to 2 hours and the absolute systemic availability was 6-13%. In contrast, most of budesonide delivered to the lungs is systemically absorbed. In healthy subjects, 34% of the metered dose was deposited in the lungs (as assessed by plasma concentration method and using a different budesonide containing dry-powder inhaler) with an absolute systemic availability of 39% of the metered dose. Peak steady-state plasma concentrations of budesonide delivered from PULMICORT FLEXHALER in adults with asthma (n=39) occurred at approximately 10 minutes post-dose and averaged 0.6 and 1.6 nmol/L at doses of 180 mcg once daily and 360 mcg twice daily, respectively. In asthmatic patients, budesonide showed a linear increase in AUC and C with increasing dose after both a single dose and repeated dosing of inhaled budesonide. The volume of distribution of budesonide was approximately 3 L/kg. It was 85-90% bound to plasma proteins. Protein binding was constant over the concentration range (1-100 nmol/L) achieved with, and exceeding, recommended doses of PULMICORT FLEXHALER. Budesonide showed little or no binding to corticosteroid binding globulin. Budesonide rapidly equilibrated with red blood cells in a concentration independent manner with a blood/plasma ratio of about 0.8. studies with human liver homogenates have shown that budesonide is rapidly and extensively metabolized. Two major metabolites formed via cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoenzyme 3A4 (CYP3A4) catalyzed biotransformation have been isolated and identified as 16α-hydroxyprednisolone and 6β-hydroxybudesonide. The corticosteroid activity of each of these two metabolites is less than 1% of that of the parent compound. No qualitative differences between the and metabolic patterns have been detected. Negligible metabolic inactivation was observed in human lung and serum preparations. The 22R form of budesonide was preferentially cleared by the liver with systemic clearance of 1.4 L/min vs. 1.0 L/min for the 22S form. The terminal half-life, 2 to 3 hours, was the same for both epimers and was independent of dose. Budesonide was excreted in urine and feces in the form of metabolites. Approximately 60% of an intravenous radiolabeled dose was recovered in the urine. No unchanged budesonide was detected in the urine. No clinically relevant pharmacokinetic differences have been identified due to race, sex, or advanced age. The pharmacokinetics of PULMICORT FLEXHALER in geriatric patients have not been specifically studied. Following intravenous dosing in pediatric patients age 10-14 years, plasma half-life was shorter than in adults (1.5 hours vs. 2.0 hours in adults). In the same population following inhalation of budesonide via a pressurized metered-dose inhaler, absolute systemic availability was similar to that in adults. Peak steady-state plasma concentrations of budesonide delivered via PULMICORT FLEXHALER in children and adolescents with asthma (n=14) occurred at approximately 15 to 30 minutes post-dose and averaged 0.4 and 1.5 nmol/L at doses of 180 mcg once daily and 360 mcg twice daily, respectively. The disposition of budesonide when delivered by inhalation from a dry powder inhaler at doses of 200 or 400 mcg twice daily for at least 3 months was studied in eight lactating women with asthma from 1 to 6 months postpartum. Systemic exposure to budesonide in these women appears to be comparable to that in non-lactating women with asthma from other studies. Breast milk obtained over eight hours post-dose revealed that the maximum concentration of budesonide for the 400 and 800 mcg doses was 0.39 and 0.78 nmol/L, respectively, and occurred within 45 minutes after dosing. The estimated oral daily dose of budesonide from breast milk to the infant is approximately 0.007 and 0.014 mcg/kg/day for the two dose regimens used in this study, which represents approximately 0.3% to 1% of the dose inhaled by the mother. Budesonide levels in plasma samples obtained from five infants at about 90 minutes after breastfeeding (and about 140 minutes after drug administration to the mother) were below quantifiable levels (<0.02 nmol/L in four infants and <0.04 nmol/L in one infant) [see Use In Specific Populations, Nursing Mothers (8.3)]. There are no data regarding the specific use of PULMICORT FLEXHALER in patients with hepatic or renal impairment. Reduced liver function may affect the elimination of corticosteroids. The pharmacokinetics of budesonide were affected by compromised liver function as evidenced by a doubled systemic availability after oral ingestion. The intravenous pharmacokinetics of budesonide were, however, similar in cirrhotic patients and in healthy subjects. Ketoconazole: Ketoconazole, a strong inhibitor of cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoenzyme 3A4 (CYP3A4), the main metabolic enzyme for corticosteroids, increased plasma levels of orally ingested budesonide [see ]. Cimetidine: At recommended doses, cimetidine, a nonspecific inhibitor of CYP enzymes, had a slight but clinically insignificant effect on the pharmacokinetics of oral budesonide. 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility In a 104-week oral study in Sprague-Dawley rats, a statistically significant increase in the incidence of gliomas was observed in male rats receiving an oral dose of 50 mcg/kg/day (approximately 0.3 times the maximum recommended daily inhalation dose in adults and children 6 to 17 years of age respectively, on a mcg/m basis). No tumorigenicity was seen in male rats at oral doses up to 25 mcg/kg (approximately 0.1 and 0.2 times, respectively, the maximum recommended daily inhalation dose in adults and children 6 to 17 years of age, on a mcg/m basis) and in female rats at oral doses up to 50 mc/kg (approximately 0.3 times the maximum recommended daily inhalation doses in adults and children 6 to 17 years of age, respectively, on a mcg/m basis). In two additional two-year studies in male Fischer and Sprague-Dawley rats, budesonide caused no gliomas at an oral dose of 50 mcg/kg (approximately 0.3 times the maximum recommended daily inhalation dose in adults and children 6 to 17 years of age, respectively, on a mcg/m basis). However, in the male Sprague-Dawley rats, budesonide caused a statistically significant increase in the incidence of hepatocellular tumors at an oral dose of 50 mcg/kg (approximately 0.3 times the maximum recommended daily inhalation doses in adults and children 6 to 17 years of age on a mcg/m basis). The concurrent reference corticosteroids (prednisone and triamcinolone acetonide) in these two studies showed similar findings. There was no evidence of a carcinogenic effect when budesonide was administered orally for 91 weeks to mice at doses up to 200 mcg/kg/day (approximately 0.6 and 0.7 times, respectively the maximum recommended daily inhalation dose in adults and children 6 to 17 years of age on a mcg/m basis). Budesonide was not mutagenic or clastogenic in six different test systems: Ames /microsome plate test, mouse micronucleus test, mouse lymphoma test, chromosome aberration test in human lymphocytes, sex-linked recessive lethal test in , and DNA repair analysis in rat hepatocyte culture. In rats, budesonide had no effect on fertility at subcutaneous doses up to 80 mcg/kg (approximately 0.5 times the maximum recommended daily inhalation dose in adults on a mcg/m basis). At a subcutaneous dose of 20 mcg/kg/day (approximately 0.1 times the maximum recommended daily inhalation dose in adults on a mcg/m basis), decreases in maternal body weight gain, prenatal viability, and viability of the young at birth and during lactation were observed. No such effects were noted at 5 mcg/kg (approximately 0.03 times the maximum recommended daily inhalation dose in adults on a mcg/m basis). As with other corticosteroids, budesonide was teratogenic and embryocidal in rabbits and rats. Budesonide produced fetal loss, decreased pup weights, and skeletal abnormalities at a subcutaneous dose of 25 mcg/kg in rabbits (approximately 0.3 times the maximum recommended daily inhalation dose in adults on a mcg/m basis) and at a subcutaneous dose of 500 mcg/kg in rats (approximately 3 times the maximum recommended daily inhalation dose in adults on a mcg/m basis). No teratogenic or embryocidal effects were observed in rats when budesonide was administered by inhalation at doses up to 250 mcg/kg (approximately equivalent to the maximum recommended daily inhalation dose in adults on a mcg/m basis). The safety and efficacy of PULMICORT FLEXHALER were evaluated in two 12-week, double-blind, randomized, parallel-group, placebo-controlled clinical studies conducted at sites in the United States and Asia involving 1137 patients aged 6 to 80 years with mild to moderate asthma. Study 1 evaluated PULMICORT FLEXHALER 180 mcg, PULMICORT TURBUHALER 200 mcg, and placebo, each administered as 1 inhalation once daily or 2 inhalations twice daily in patients 18 years of age and older with mild to moderate asthma previously treated with inhaled corticosteroids. The delivered dose of PULMICORT FLEXHALER 180 mcg and PULMICORT TURBUHALER 200 mcg are the same; each delivers 160 mcg from the mouthpiece. Study 2 evaluated PULMICORT FLEXHALER 90 mcg, 2 inhalations once daily or 4 inhalations twice daily, PULMICORT TURBUHALER 200 mcg, 1 inhalation once daily or 2 inhalations twice daily, and placebo in pediatric patients aged 6 to 17 years with mild to moderate asthma. Both of the studies had a 2-week placebo treatment run-in period followed by a 12-week randomized treatment period. The primary endpoint was the difference between baseline and the mean of the treatment-period FEV (adults) or FEV % predicted (children). This study enrolled 621 patients aged ≥18 to 80 years with mild-to-moderate asthma (mean baseline % predicted FEV 64.3%) whose symptoms were previously controlled on inhaled corticosteroids. Mean change from baseline in FEV in the PULMICORT FLEXHALER 180 mcg, 2 inhalations twice-daily group was 0.28 liters, as compared to 0.10 liters in the placebo group (p<0.001). Secondary endpoints of morning and evening peak expiratory flow rate, daytime asthma symptom severity, nighttime asthma symptom severity, daily rescue medication use, and the percentage of patients who met predefined asthma related withdrawal criteria showed differences from baseline favoring PULMICORT FLEXHALER over placebo (p<0.001). 12-Week Trial in Adult Patients with Mild to Moderate Asthma (Study 1) Mean Change from Baseline in FEV (L) Footnote: PULMICORT TURBUHALER; a different PULMICORT DPI. Statistical model is analysis of covariance with treatment and region (US/Asia) as factors and the baseline value as the covariate. This study enrolled 516 patients aged 6 to 17 years with mild asthma (mean baseline % predicted FEV 84.9%). The study population included patients previously treated with inhaled corticosteroids for no more than 30 days before the study began (4%) and patients who were naïve to inhaled corticosteroids (96%). Mean change from baseline in % predicted FEV during the 12-week treatment period in the PULMICORT FLEXHALER 90 mcg, 4 inhalations twice daily treatment group was 5.6 compared with 0.2 in the placebo group (p<0.001). Secondary endpoints of morning and evening PEF showed differences from baseline favoring PULMICORT FLEXHALER over placebo (p<0.001). 12-Week Trial in Pediatric Patients With Mild Asthma (Study 2) Mean Change from Baseline in Percent Predicted FEV Footnote: PULMICORT TURBUHALER; a different PULMICORT DPI. Statistical model is analysis of covariance with treatment and region (US/Asia) as factors and the baseline value as the covariate. PULMICORT FLEXHALER is available as a dry powder for inhalation containing budesonide in the following strength: 90 mcg. Each dosage strength contains 60 actuations per device. 90 mcg/dose, 60 dose (NDC 21695-291-01) with a target fill weight of 165 mg (range 140-190). PULMICORT FLEXHALER consists of a number of assembled plastic details, the main parts being the dosing mechanism, the storage unit for drug substance, and the mouthpiece. The inhaler is protected by a white outer tubular cover screwed onto the inhaler. The body of the inhaler is white and the turning grip is brown. The PULMICORT FLEXHALER inhaler cannot be refilled and should be discarded when empty. The number in the middle of the dose indicator window shows how many doses are left in the inhaler. The inhaler is empty when the number zero (“0”) on the red background reaches the middle of the window. If the unit is used beyond the point at which the zero reaches the middle of the window, the correct amount of medication may not be obtained and the unit should be discarded. Store in a dry place at controlled room temperature 20-25°C (68-77°F) [see USP] with the cover tightly in place. Keep out of the reach of children. Patients being treated with PULMICORT FLEXHALER should receive the following information and instructions. This information is intended to aid the patient in the safe and effective use of the medication. It is not a disclosure of all possible adverse or intended effects. For proper use of PULMICORT FLEXHALER and to attain maximum improvement, the patient should read and follow the accompanying Patients should be advised that localized infections with occurred in the mouth and pharynx in some patients. If oropharyngeal candidiasis develops, it should be treated with appropriate local or systemic (i.e. oral) antifungal therapy while still continuing therapy with PULMICORT FLEXHALER, but at times therapy with PULMICORT FLEXHALER may need to be temporarily interrupted under close medical supervision. Rinsing the mouth after inhalation is advised. [see ] PULMICORT FLEXHALER is not meant to relieve acute asthma symptoms and extra doses should not be used for that purpose. Acute symptoms should be treated with an inhaled, short-acting beta-agonist such as albuterol (The physician should provide that patient with such medication and instruct the patient in how it should be used.) Patients should be instructed to notify their physician immediately if they experience any of the following: Decreasing effectiveness of inhaled, short-acting beta-agonists Need for more inhalations than usual of inhaled, short-acting beta-agonists Significant decrease in lung function as outlined by the physician Patients should not stop therapy with PULMICORT FLEXHALER without physician/provider guidance since symptoms may recur after discontinuation. [see ] Hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis, rash, contact dermatitis, urticaria, angioedema, and bronchospasm have been reported with use of PULMICORT FLEXHALER. Discontinue PULMICORT FLEXHALER if such reactions occur [see ]. PULMICORT FLEXHALER contains small amounts of lactose, which contains trace levels of milk proteins. It is possible that cough, wheezing, or bronchospasm may occur in patients who have a severe milk protein allergy [see]. Patients who are on immunosuppressant doses of corticosteroids should be warned to avoid exposure to chickenpox or measles and, if exposed, to consult their physician without delay. Patients should be informed of potential worsening of existing tuberculosis, fungal, bacterial, viral, or parasitic infections, or ocular herpes simplex [see ]. Patients should be advised that PULMICORT FLEXHALER may cause systemic corticosteroid effects of hypercorticism and adrenal suppression. Additionally, patients should be instructed that deaths due to adrenal insufficiency have occurred during and after transfer from systemic corticosteroids. Patients should taper slowly from systemic corticosteroids if transferring to PULMICORT FLEXHALER [see ]. Patients who are at an increased risk for decreased BMD should be advised that the use of corticosteroids may pose an additional risk [see ]. Patients should be informed that orally inhaled corticosteroids, including budesonide inhalation powder, may cause a reduction in growth velocity when administered to pediatric patients. Physicians should closely follow the growth of children and adolescents taking corticosteroids by any route [see ]. Long-term use of inhaled corticosteroids may increase the risk of some eye problems (cataracts or glaucoma); regular eye examinations should be considered [see ]. Patients should be advised to use PULMICORT FLEXHALER at regular intervals, since its effectiveness depends on regular use. Maximum benefit may not be achieved for 1 to 2 weeks or longer after starting treatment. If symptoms do not improve in that time frame or if the condition worsens, patients should be instructed to contact their physician. Patients should be carefully instructed on the use of this drug product to assure optimal dose delivery. The patient may not sense the presence of any medication entering their lungs when inhaling from PULMICORT FLEXHALER. This lack of sensation does not mean that they did not get the medication. They should not repeat their inhalation even if they did not feel the medication when inhaling [see]. This medicine is to only be inhaled through the mouth (by oral inhalation only). Read the Patient Information that comes with PULMICORT FLEXHALER before you start using it and each time you get a refill. There may be new information. This leaflet does not take the place of talking to your healthcare provider about your medical condition or treatment. PULMICORT FLEXHALER is an inhaled corticosteroid medicine. PULMICORT FLEXHALER is used for long-term (maintenance) treatment of asthma and to prevent asthma symptoms in adults and children 6 years of age and older. Inhaled corticosteroids help to decrease inflammation in the lungs. Inflammation in the lungs can lead to asthma symptoms. PULMICORT FLEXHALER helps reduce inflammation and helps keep the airways open to reduce asthma symptoms. PULMICORT FLEXHALER does not treat the symptoms of a sudden asthma attack. Always have a short-acting beta-agonist medicine (rescue inhaler) with you to treat sudden symptoms. If you do not have an inhaled, short-acting bronchodilator, call your healthcare provider to have one prescribed for you. It is not known if PULMICORT FLEXHALER is safe and effective in children younger than 6 years of age. if you have a severe allergy to milk proteins. PULMICORT FLEXHALER contains a small amount of lactose (milk sugar). People with severe allergies to milk protein may have symptoms of an allergic reaction with PULMICORT FLEXHALER including: cough, wheezing, trouble breathing or feeling like your throat is closing. What should I tell my healthcare provider before using PULMICORT FLEXHALER? Before using PULMICORT FLEXHALER, tell your healthcare provider if you: have any allergies.

Keep a list of them and show it to your healthcare provider and pharmacist when you get a new medicine. Use PULMICORT FLEXHALER exactly as prescribed by your healthcare provider. You must use PULMICORT FLEXHALER regularly for it to work. PULMICORT FLEXHALER comes in two strengths. Your healthcare provider has prescribed the strength that is best for you. Be sure you know the difference between PULMICORT FLEXHALER and any other inhaled medicines that are prescribed for you, including what you use them for (prescribed use) and what they look like. Do not stop using PULMICORT FLEXHALER, even if your symptoms get better. Your healthcare provider will change your medicines as needed. Do not change or stop any medicines used to control or treat your breathing problems, unless your healthcare provider tells you to. Rinse your mouth with water and spit the water out after each dose of PULMICORT FLEXHALER. Do not swallow the water. This will lessen the chance of getting a fungal infection (thrush) in the mouth. If you miss a dose, just take your next regularly scheduled dose when it is due. Do not use PULMICORT FLEXHALER more often or use more puffs than you have been prescribed. Make sure you always have a short-acting beta-agonist medicine with you. Use your short acting beta-agonist medicine if you have breathing problems between doses of PULMICORT FLEXHALER or if a sudden asthma attack happens. Call your healthcare provider right away if: your short-acting rescue medicine does not work as well for relieving asthma symptoms. you need to use your short-acting rescue medicines more often than usual. your breathing problems worsen with PULMICORT FLEXHALER. If you use another inhaled medicine by mouth to treat your asthma, talk with your healthcare provider for instructions about when to use the other medicine and when to use your PULMICORT FLEXHALER. If you have used corticosteroid medicines for a long time and the dose is now being lowered or stopped, you should carry a medical alert card. The medical alert card should state that you may need increased corticosteroids during times of stress or during an asthma attack that does not get better with bronchodilator medicines. Your healthcare provider may check your breathing, do blood tests and eye exams during treatment with PULMICORT FLEXHALER. Be sure to read, understand and follow the detailed Patient Instructions for Use at the end of this leaflet. These Instructions for Use tell you how to prime and use your PULMICORT FLEXHALER the right way. What are the possible side effects of PULMICORT FLEXHALER? PULMICORT FLEXHALER can cause serious side effects, including: thrush (candida), a fungal infection in your mouth and throat. Tell your healthcare provider if you have any redness or white colored patches in your mouth or throat. Tell your healthcare provider or get medical help right away if you have: Immune system effects and a higher chance of infections. You are more likely to get infections if you take medicines that weaken your immune system. Avoid contact with people who have contagious diseases such as chicken pox or measles while using PULMICORT FLEXHALER. Symptoms of infection may include: fever, pain, aches, chills, feeling tired, nausea and vomiting. Tell your healthcare provider about any signs of infection while you are using PULMICORT FLEXHALER. Adrenal insufficiency is a condition in which the adrenal glands do not make enough steroid hormones. Symptoms of adrenal insufficiency include: tiredness, weakness, nausea and vomiting and low blood pressure. Your healthcare provider should check you for this during treatment with PULMICORT FLEXHALER. A child’s growth should be checked regularly while using PULMICORT FLEXHALER. You should have regular eye exams while using PULMICORT FLEXHALER. Increased wheezing right after taking PULMICORT FLEXHALER. Always have a short-acting beta-agonist medicine (rescue inhaler) with you to treat sudden wheezing. Call your healthcare provider or get medical help right away if you have symptoms of any of the serious side effects listed above. Common side effects reported by patients using PULMICORT FLEXHALER include: viral irritation and inflammation of the stomach and intestine (gastroenteritis). Symptoms may include stomach area pain, diarrhea, nausea and vomiting, loss of appetite, headaches, and weakness. Tell your healthcare provider about any side effect that bothers you or that does not go away. These are not all of the side effects of PULMICORT FLEXHALER. Ask your healthcare provider or pharmacist for more information. Call your healthcare provider for medical advice about side effects. You may report side effects to AstraZeneca at 1-800-236-9933 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. Store PULMICORT FLEXHALER at 68° to 77°F (20° to 25°C). Keep your PULMICORT FLEXHALER with the cover tightly in place when not in use. Keep your PULMICORT FLEXHALER and all medicines out of the reach of children. Medicines are sometimes prescribed for conditions that are not mentioned in Patient Information Leaflets. Do not use PULMICORT FLEXHALER for a condition for which it was not prescribed. Do not give PULMICORT FLEXHALER to other people, even if they have the same symptoms that you have. It may harm them. This Patient Information leaflet summarizes the most important information about PULMICORT FLEXHALER. If you would like more information, talk with your healthcare provider. You can ask your pharmacist or healthcare provider for information about PULMICORT FLEXHALER that is written for health professionals. For more information, go to pulmicortflexhaler.com or call 1- 800-236-9933. Before you use a new PULMICORT FLEXHALER for the first time, you must prime it. To prime your PULMICORT FLEXHALER, follow the steps below: Hold the inhaler by the brown grip so that the white cover points upward (upright position). With the other hand, turn the white cover and lift it off (see Figure 2). Continue to hold your PULMICORT FLEXHALER upright as shown in Figure 1. Use your other hand to hold the inhaler in the middle. Do not hold the inhaler at the top of the mouthpiece. Twist the brown grip as far as it will go in one direction and then fully back again in the other direction until it stops (it does not matter which way you turn it first). You will hear a “click” during one of the twisting movements (see Figures 3 and 4). Repeat Step 3. Your PULMICORT FLEXHALER is now primed. You are ready to load your first dose. You do not have to prime your PULMICORT FLEXHALER again after this even if you do not use it for a long period of time. 1. Hold your PULMICORT FLEXHALER upright as described above. With your other hand, twist the white cover and lift it off (see Figure 2). 2. Continue to hold your PULMICORT FLEXHALER upright to be sure that the right dose of medicine is loaded. 3. Use your other hand to hold the inhaler in the middle. Do not hold the mouthpiece when you load the inhaler. 4. Twist the brown grip fully in one direction as far as it will go. Twist it fully back again in the other direction as far as it will go (it does not matter which way you turn it first) [see Figure 3]. • You will hear a “click” during one of the twisting movements (see Figure 4). PULMICORT FLEXHALER will only give one dose at a time, no matter how often you click the brown grip, but the dose indicator will continue to move (advance). This means that if you continue to move the brown grip, it is possible for the indicator to show fewer doses or zero doses even if more doses are left in the inhaler. Turn your head away from the inhaler and breathe out (exhale). If you accidentally blow into your inhaler after loading a dose, follow the instructions for loading a new dose. Place the mouthpiece in your mouth and close your lips around the mouthpiece. Breathe in (inhale) deeply and forcefully through the inhaler (see Figure 5). You may not sense the presence of any medication entering your lungs when inhaling from PULMICORT FLEXHALER. This lack of sensation does not mean that you did not get the medication. You should not repeat your inhalations even if you did not feel the medication when inhaling. Remove the inhaler from your mouth and exhale. If more than one dose is prescribed repeat the steps above. When you are finished taking your dose place the white cover back on the inhaler and twist shut. Rinse your mouth with water after each dose to decrease your risk of getting thrush. Do not swallow the water. The label on the box or cover will tell you how many doses are in your PULMICORT FLEXHALER. Your PULMICORT FLEXHALER has a dose indicator window just below the mouthpiece. The dose indicator tells you about how many doses are left in the inhaler. Look at the middle of the window to find out about how many doses are left in your inhaler (see Figure 6). The dose indicator is connected to the turning grip and moves (counts down) every time a dose is loaded. It is not likely that you will see the dose indicator move with each dose. You can usually see the indicator move each time you use about 5 doses. The dose indicator starts with either the number 60 or 120 when full, depending upon the strength of the inhaler. The indicator is marked in intervals of 10 doses. Markings are either with numbers or dashes (alternating), counting down to “0”. Dose indicator starts at 60 or 120 depending on strength (90 mcg or 180 mcg) of the inhaler and counts down to 0. The dose indicator will tell you about how many doses are left in your PULMICORT FLEXHALER. If you complete the instructions for loading the dose more than one time before you inhale the dose, you will only receive one dose. The dose indicator will move a small amount but it is not likely that you will see the dose indicator move with each dose. Your inhaler is empty when the number 0 on the red background reaches the middle of the dose indicator window. Throw away this inhaler. The inhaler may not give you the right amount of medicine, even though it may not feel completely empty and may seem like it continues to work (see Figure 7). Do not put your PULMICORT FLEXHALER in water (do not immerse it) to find out if it is empty. Check the dose indicator window to see how many doses are left. Refill your PULMICORT FLEXHALER prescription before your medicine runs out. You will get a new inhaler each time you refill your prescription. Keep your PULMICORT FLEXHALER clean and dry at all times. Do not immerse it in water. Wipe the outside of the mouthpiece one time each week with a dry tissue. Do not use water or liquids when cleaning the mouthpiece. Do not use your PULMICORT FLEXHALER if it has been damaged or if the mouthpiece has become detached. Talk to your healthcare provider or pharmacist if you have any problems with your PULMICORT FLEXHALER. PULMICORT FLEXHALER is a trademark of the AstraZeneca group of companies.

The objective of this study was to systematically review the evidence regarding the efficacy and safety of SCIT and SLIT for the treatment of pediatric asthma and allergic rhinoconjunctivitis. METHODS: Two independent reviewers selected articles for inclusion, extracted data, and graded the strength of evidence for each clinical outcome. All studies were randomized controlled trials of children with allergic asthma or rhinoconjunctivitis treated with SCIT or an aqueous formulation of SLIT. Data sources were Medline, Embase, LILACS, CENTRAL, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials through May 2012. RESULTS: In 13 trials, 920 children received SCIT or usual care; in 18 studies, 1583 children received SLIT or usual care. Three studies compared SCIT with SLIT head-to-head in 135 children. The strength of evidence is moderate that SCIT improves asthma and rhinitis symptoms and low that SCIT improves conjunctivitis symptoms and asthma medication scores. Strength of evidence is high that SLIT improves asthma symptoms and moderate that SLIT improves rhinitis and conjunctivitis symptoms and decreases medication usage. The evidence is low to support SCIT over SLIT for improving asthma or rhinitis symptoms or medication usage. Local reactions were frequent with SCIT and SLIT. There was 1 report of anaphylaxis with SCIT. CONCLUSIONS: Evidence supports the efficacy of both SCIT and SLIT for the treatment of asthma and rhinitis in children.

dab60f13-1dc2-4841-9325-8cb31b056a6d,"Naproxen is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) used to relieve symptoms of arthritis (osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, or juvenile arthritis) such as inflammation, swelling, stiffness, and joint pain. Naproxen also helps relieve symptoms of ankylosing spondylitis, which is a type of arthritis that affects the joints in the spine. However, this medicine does not cure arthritis and will help you only as long as you continue to take it. This medicine may also be used to treat mild to moderate pain, including acute gout and other painful conditions such as bursitis, tendinitis, or menstrual cramps. This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription. This product is available in the following dosage forms: In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make.

Their instructions may be different to the information in this leaflet. Your doctor will tell you how much of this medicine you should take. This will depend on your condition and whether you are taking any other medicines. The usual dose is from 50 mg to 200 mg each day, either as a single dose or divided into two doses. The usual dose is from 100 mg to 300 mg each day, divided into two or three doses. The usual dose is 200 mg each day, divided into two doses.

Your doctor will check your progress to make sure the medicine is working and will decide how long your treatment should continue. Talk to your doctor if you are not sure how long you need to take your medicine for. If it is almost time for your next dose, skip the missed dose and take your next dose at the usual time.

Immediately telephone your doctor or the Poisons Information Centre (telephone 13 11 26) for advice or go to Accident and Emergency at the nearest hospital, if you think that you or anyone else may have taken too much of this medicine. Do this even if there are no signs of discomfort or poisoning. Symptoms of an overdose may include feeling sick and vomiting, bluish skin and nails, very low blood pressure, slow heartbeat, difficulty breathing, fainting, convulsions (fits), coma or death.

There is a chance that metoprolol could make the allergic reaction worse or harder to treat. If you feel light-headed, dizzy or faint when getting out of bed or standing up, get up slowly. You may feel light-headed or dizzy when you start to take metoprolol. This is because your blood pressure is falling suddenly. If this problem doesn't go away, talk to your doctor.

The dose of your diabetes medicines may need to be changed. If you are about to have any blood tests, tell your doctor that you are taking this medicine. Make sure you drink enough water during exercise and hot weather when you are taking this medicine, especially if you sweat a lot. If you do not drink enough water while taking metoprolol, you may feel faint or lightheaded or sick. This is because your blood pressure is dropping too much. If you continue to feel unwell, tell your doctor. Keep all your doctor's appointments so that your progress can be checked. Your doctor may do some tests from time to time to make sure the medicine is working and to prevent unwanted side effects. Do not take this medicine to treat any other complaints unless your doctor tells you to. Do not give your medicine to anyone else, even if they have the same condition as you.

This helps to reduce the chance of your condition becoming worse or keep other unwanted heart problems from happening. Be careful driving, operating machinery or doing jobs that require you to be alert while you are taking this medicine until you know how it affects you.

If you drink alcohol, dizziness or light-headedness may be worse. Be careful to dress warmly during cold weather, especially if you will be outside for a long time. Like other beta-blocker medicines, metoprolol may make you more sensitive to cold temperatures, especially if you have problems with your blood circulation. These medicines tend to decrease blood circulation in the skin, fingers and toes. Tell your doctor or pharmacist as soon as possible if you do not feel well while you are taking this medicine.

Anti-IgE interferes with the function of IgE. IgE is an antibody in the immune system. IgE tells immune cells to initiate allergic reactions. This may bring on symptoms such as coughing, wheezing, nasal congestion, hives and swelling. Anti-IgE attaches to IgE in the blood and helps prevents the allergic reaction.    Corticosteroids (steroids) are medicines that are used to treat many chronic diseases. Corticosteroids are very good at reducing inflammation (swelling) and mucus production in the airways of the lungs. They also help other quick-relief medicines work better. The steroids (corticosteroids) used to treat asthma and other chronic lung diseases are not the same as anabolic steroids, used illegally by some athletes for bodybuilding. Corticosteroids do not affect the liver or cause sterility.    Managing your medications is a very important task. When you take medication as prescribed, your disease can be controlled. Your health care provider will give you specific information about your medications. Learning about your medications and following the guidelines listed below will help you manage your disease.    Consult your health care provider before taking herbal remedies. Herbs can interact with your medications. Herbs may also be harmful for certain health conditions or medical procedures. When you see your doctor, be sure to inform him/her of which herbs you are taking. Do not assume a product is safe or effective. Herbs are not overseen by a federal regulatory agency for guarantee of quality control or safety.    A peak flow meter is a small, easy-to-use instrument that enables you or your child to measure lung function at home, at work, at school  wherever you go. The peak flow meter measures how fast a person can blow out air after a maximum inhalation. It helps reveal how well you or your child's lungs are working. This is called the peak expiratory flow rate.    The early signs of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) for which many people seek medical attention before being formally diagnosed include marked shortness of breath with exertion, a cough that won t go away or frequent respiratory infections. This is often at a point when the disease is already advanced. Many people might be identified earlier if their doctors routinely screen all patients who are smokers or previous smokers.    Dust mites are microscopic animals, too small to be seen with the naked eye. The droppings and decaying bodies of dust mites are important allergens. These dust mites live in mattresses, pillows, bedding, carpets, fabric-covered furniture, old clothing and soft stuffed toys. They feed on human skin scales. Dust mites are most common in humid climates. They don't survive when the humidity is below 40-50%. If droppings of dust mites are inhaled or come in contact with the skin, they may cause allergy, asthma and/or eczema symptoms.    Many types of molds live in our environment. Mold grows in indoor and outdoor areas that are warm, dark and/or moist. Molds reproduce and grow by sending tiny spores into the air. Inhaled spores cause allergy and asthma symptoms.    Exposure to hazardous pollutants may have an immediate or a long-term effect, which may not show up for many years. The significance of the exposure depends upon the source, how much is emitted from the source, how harmful the pollutants are, and how much of the pollutants have accumulated within the home. Some immediate symptoms of exposure may include headache, dizziness, fatigue and upper airway irritation of the nose, throat and eyes. These symptoms may reoccur with repeated exposures.    When you are exposed to smoke in the environment it is called secondhand smoke. Secondhand smoke is a combination of two types of smoke, sidestream and mainstream smoke. Mainstream smoke is the smoke exhaled by a person who is smoking. Sidestream smoke is the smoke from the end of a burning cigarette. Sidestream smoke contains all of these same carcinogens.    Airways of people with asthma are often chronically inflamed (swollen). Therefore, the airways are sensitive to things that make asthma worse. These, either singly or together, cause symptoms in people with asthma. Identifying and controlling or treating things that make asthma worse, is essential to good asthma management. Things that make asthma worse include: irritants, allergens, infections, weather, exercise, emotions, gastroesophageal reflux and hormonal changes. These vary from person to person.    Recognizing the signs and symptoms of asthma is an important part of managing asthma. Knowing when early warning signs or mild symptoms are occurring is helpful so that treatment and other interventions can begin early. Early treatment is most effective. If severe symptoms are present, it is vital to begin the appropriate treatment immediately. Accurate and timely assessment of your symptoms or your child's symptoms can help you and your clinician decide if treatment should begin in the home, at your clinician's office or in the emergency room. What You Need to Know When Taking Anticoagulation Medicine What You Need to Know When Taking Anticoagulation Medicine    Anticoagulant medicines are a group of medicines that inhibit blood clotting, helping to prevent blood clots. Blood clots can cause heart attacks and strokes.    The Gastric Emptying Study will show if you have slow or rapid emptying of your stomach. Your doctor will use this information to determine the best treatment for you.    Learn how to get ready for the test, what is done during the test and how long it will take.The purpose of a food challenge is to identify if your child is allergic to a specific food and how much of the food it may take to cause a reaction.    This is sometimes called a Small Bowel Series. This will help your doctor identify possible problems and the best treatment. This study involves the drinking of barium which will be about two cups. The barium will show your small intestines on the x-ray. A series of x-rays will be taken to follow the path of the barium through your small intestine.    Cholesterol is a type of fat that is found in every cell in the body. It is used to build healthy cells and some vital hormones. High levels of cholesterol in the blood (high blood cholesterol) can be serious because it can cause fatty deposits, called plaque, to build up in arteries, making blood flow more difficult. High blood cholesterol can be secondary to many diseases and can contribute to many forms of disease, most notably cardiovascular disease, or heart disease.    Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is a condition in which high blood pressure exists within the vessels of the lungs. Normally, venous (low oxygen) blood returns from the body to the right side of the heart where it is pumped to lungs via the pulmonary arteries. Breathing brings oxygen to venous blood in the lungs, turning it into arterial (high oxygen) blood. Arterial blood returns to the left side of the heart through the pulmonary veins where it is pumped to the rest of the body.    Intracardiac shunting refers to the diversion of normal cardiac blood flow to alternate pathways within the heart. This is the result of a hole in structures that normally separate arterial from venous blood.    An esophageal motility study is a diagnostic test that will evaluate the function of your esophagus. The esophagus is a muscular hollow tube that transports food from your mouth to your stomach. The results of this study will help your doctor determine a diagnosis and the best treatment for you.    CTA stands for coronary computed tomography angiogram. A CT angiogram takes pictures of the heart. The pictures are more detailed than a typical x-ray. During a CT angiogram pictures are taken of cross sections or slices of the heart. When contrast is used during a CT scan pictures of the heart are highlighted even more. Ct scans can help determine a diagnosis early. Your doctor will use this information to determine the best treatment for you.    An echocardiogram is an ultrasound of the heart. The ultrasound shows the structures and functions of the heart muscle and heart valves from different angles. It does this by using sound waves. Contrast is used during an echocardiogram to see the flow of blood through the heart and the heart muscle better.    A Holter Monitor is a monitor that continually records the electrical signals of your heart for 24 or 48 hours.    Ultrasound (sound waves) can be used to look at organs, soft tissue and blood vessels within the body. The ultrasound shows the structures and blood flow through organs and blood vessels. It does this by using sound waves. Exercise Tolerance Test or Exercise for Desaturation Test Exercise Tolerance Test or Exercise for Desaturation Test    The exercise tolerance test evaluates the ability of your heart and lungs to provide oxygen and remove carbon dioxide from the bloodstream before, during and after you exercise.    The barium swallow is a study that is completed in radiology. The test evaluates the esophagus. The esophagus is the tube that goes from the throat to the stomach. This will help your doctor identify possible problems and the best treatment. This study is sometimes called an Esophagram.    Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is an advanced medical imaging technique that does not use x-rays or radiation. Instead it uses a strong magnetic field, radio waves, and a computer. This creates very clear pictures of internal body structures. A cardiac MRI is performed to help evaluate the structures and function of the heart, valves and major blood vessels. The MRI image offers unique information to help your doctor better plan your treatment and care.    A CT or CAT scan is a shortened name for computerized tomography. A CT scan takes pictures of the inside of the body. The pictures are more detailed than a typical x-ray. During a CT scan of the chest pictures are taken of cross sections or slices of the thoracic structures in your body. The thoracic structures include your lungs, heart and the bones around these areas. When contrast is used during a CT scan of the chest thoracic structures are highlighted even more. Ct scans can help determine a diagnosis early.    Bronchiectasis is a condition of the airways in the lungs. These airways (bronchial tubes) are tube-like structures that branch from the trachea into the right and left lungs. When a person has bronchiectasis the airways are permanently and abnormally widened (dilated) and inflamed. These damaged airways can no longer clear mucus and bacteria from the lung well. This causes a cough, sputum production and shortness of breath to occur more often. Bronchiectasis is caused by one or more infectious or inflammatory insults to the lungs. People with bronchiectasis are more likely to get lung infections. Each lung infection can make the bronchiectasis worse. Therefore, early diagnosis and treatment of bronchiectasis is very important.    Chickenpox (varicella) is a common childhood viral diseases. Chickenpox is highly contagious and can now be prevented with a safe and effective vaccine. Although chickenpox is usually mild, vaccinating children can prevent complications of severe chickenpox and reduce costs associated with children missing school and adults missing work. The chickenpox vaccine is very effective in preventing chickenpox.    Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease or COPD for short, is a progressive lung disease that affects millions of people each year. People with COPD have airways that are narrowed and blocked due to damage. This is often induced by smoking. People with COPD often have chronic bronchitis and/or emphysema. Many people have primarily chronic bronchitis. Some people with COPD may also have an ""asthma-like"" or reactive component to their pulmonary disease.    Anyone can fall, although falls that lead to injury are more common in the elderly. Learn ways to prevent falls in your home and outdoors.    Interstitial lung disease (ILD) is a broad category of lung diseases that includes more than 130 disorders which are characterized by scarring (fibrosis) and/or inflammation of the lungs.    Germs, like plants and animals, have been classified into similar groups. The groups are called ""families."" One such family of germs is known as the Mycobacteriaceae. Within this family there are a number of species. Some species can cause human diseases (pathogenic). Others species do not cause human diseases (saprophytic). Mycobacterium tuberculosis is an infamous species. This is the organism that causes human tuberculosis.    If you sneeze and have a runny or stuffy nose during the spring, summer or fall allergy seasons, you may have seasonal allergic rhinitis or hay fever. Hay fever is the most common type of allergy problem. It mainly affects the eyes and nose. Hay fever symptoms include sneezing, itching, runny or stuffy nose and red, watery eyes. Inhaled Medication With A Metered Dose Inhaler (MDI) Inhaled Medication With A Metered Dose Inhaler (MDI)    The metered dose inhaler (MDI) consists of a pressurized canister of medication in a plastic case with a mouthpiece. Pressing the MDI releases a mist of medication. When inhaled correctly, the medication has a better chance to reach the small airways. This increases the medication's effectiveness. Its portable size, efficiency and convenience make the MDI a desirable method for inhalation treatment.    A Diskus® consists of a plastic device containing powdered medication. A Diskus is breath activated. This means when you inhale, the Diskus automatically releases the medication. When inhaled correctly, the medication has a better chance to reach the small airways. This increases the medication's effectiveness. The portable size, efficiency and convenience make the Diskus a desirable method for inhalation treatment.    A Flexhaler® consists of a plastic device containing dry powdered medication. A Flexhaler is breath activated. This means when you inhale, the Flexhaler automatically releases the medication. When inhaled correctly, the medication has a better chance to reach the small airways. This increases the medication's effectiveness. The portable size, efficiency and convenience make the Flexhaler a desirable method for inhalation treatment.    A Twisthaler consists of a plastic device containing dry powdered medication. A Twisthaler is breath activated. This means when you inhale, the Twisthaler automatically releases the medication. When inhaled correctly, the medication has a better chance to reach the small airways. This increases the medication's effectiveness. The portable size, efficiency and convenience make the Twisthaler a desirable method for inhalation treatment.    Allergy tests can be done to help identify if you are allergic and what you are allergic to. Once allergies are identified specific avoidance and treatment measures can be recommended. There are several types of allergy testing.    Pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) is a program for people with chronic lung disease. These may include emphysema, chronic bronchitis, asthma, bronchiectasis and interstitial lung disease.    The tendency to develop allergies may be inherited. If you have allergic tendencies and are exposed to certain things in your environment (allergens), you may develop allergies to some of those things. Examples of allergy symptoms include itchy eyes, runny nose, asthma symptoms, eczema and rash. The timing of the allergic response may be immediate or delayed. Allergy testing may be recommended to help identify your allergies.    Allergies to drugs / medications are complicated because they can be caused by many different medications, resulting in a wide variety of signs and symptoms that may affect various organs or parts of the body. Furthermore, some drugs can cause adverse effects whose symptoms closely resemble those of an allergic reaction. The difference is that true drug allergy is caused by a hypersensitive immune system that creates IgE antibodies against an otherwise harmless substance in the medication. One characteristic of all drug allergies is that similar symptoms will occur every time soon after the offending medicine is taken.    Exercise can make asthma symptoms worse. This is called exercise-induced asthma. Exercise can cause asthma symptoms in up to 80 percent of people with asthma. Treatment and monitoring can allow people with exercise-induced asthma to participate fully in the physical activity or exercise of their choice. Upper Respiratory Infections (Colds) & Acute Bronchitis Upper Respiratory Infections (Colds) & Acute Bronchitis    Colds are viral, not bacterial infections of the upper respiratory tract. Colds are highly contagious. They are spread through touching contaminated surfaces, coughing and sneezing. Some people are more prone to colds than others. A child in preschool may ""catch"" as many as four to eight colds per year. Generally, there is an increased frequency of colds during fall and winter months because of closer, indoor contact with other people.    Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) is a serious disease that affects breathing, muscles, and energy. It can be fatal.    Pollens aren't the only allergens in the air. There is another potential bunch of allergens being flown around inside a special injection device that, when encountered, may threaten the lives of those who are sensitive to it...insect venom! The primary offenders are most often insects that sting rather than those that bite. These insects are members of the order of Hymenoptera of the class Insecta. Stinging insects of concern are found in three families.    Latex a kind of natural rubber made from the sap of a tree - can be found in many items. It is found in bicycle and wheelchair tires, toys, some balloons, examining gloves, household gloves, surgical tubing, rubber bands and condoms. When someone is allergic to latex, that person is actually allergic to one or more proteins (allergens) found in the sap from the rubber tree. Interestingly, these proteins or ones very similar to them can be found in banana, kiwi, avocado, potato, strawberries, peaches and chestnuts, since people who are allergic to latex often have crossreactions to these foods.    Immunotherapy (commonly called allergy shots) is a form of treatment to reduce your allergic reaction to allergens. Allergens are substances to which you are allergic. Research has shown that allergy shots can reduce symptoms of allergic rhinitis (hay fever) and allergic asthma. Remember, not all asthma is due to allergies. Research has shown allergy shots can reduce symptoms of allergic rhinitis (hay fever), allergic asthma, dust mite allergy, animal dander allergy and insect sting allergy. Anticoagulant Medicine and Potential for Drug - Food Interactions Anticoagulant Medicine and Potential for Drug - Food Interactions    Anticoagulant medicines are a group of medicines that inhibit blood clotting, helping to prevent blood clots. Blood clots can cause heart attacks and strokes. Anticoagulant medicines can be used with a number of diseases when there is an increased risk of blood clots.

da5ddb07-eea7-462b-b891-cc4789fe1055,"NOTICE: This Consumer Medicine Information (CMI) is intended for persons living in Australia. This leaflet answers some common questions about this medicine. It does not contain all the available information. It does not take the place of talking to your doctor or pharmacist. All medicines have risks and benefits. Your doctor has weighed the risks of you taking this medicine against the benefits they expect it will have for you. If you have any concerns about taking this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist. The name of your medicine is APO-Ramipril. It contains the active ingredient, ramipril. Ramipril belongs to a group of medicines called angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. some heart conditions, such as heart failure after a heart attack Ramipril is also used to reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems and complications in patients aged 55 years or more with heart or blood vessel disease, or diabetes. Ramipril is used to lower high blood pressure (hypertension). Everyone has blood pressure. This pressure helps get your blood all around your body. Your blood pressure may be different at different times of the day and can be influenced by how busy or worried you are. You have high blood pressure when your blood pressure stays higher than is needed, even when you are calm and relaxed. There are usually no symptoms of high blood pressure. The only way of knowing that you have high blood pressure is to have your blood pressure checked on a regular basis. If high blood pressure is not treated it can lead to serious health problems, including stroke, heart disease and kidney failure. Ramipril may be used after a heart attack. A heart attack occurs when one of the major blood vessels supplying blood to your heart becomes blocked. This means that your heart muscle cannot receive the oxygen it needs and becomes damaged. This may lead to further problems, such as heart failure, irregular heart rhythms and blood clots. Heart failure means that the heart muscle is weak and cannot pump blood strongly enough to supply all the blood needed throughout the body. Heart failure is not the same as heart attack and does not mean that the heart stops. Heart failure may start off with no symptoms, but as the condition progresses, patients may feel short of breath or may get tired easily after light physical activity, such as walking. Some patients may wake up short of breath at night. Fluid may collect in different parts of the body, often first noticed as swollen ankles and feet. Ramipril may be used to treat some kidney problems. Some conditions, such as diabetes and high blood pressure, can lead to kidney problems. These problems develop slowly over several years. Good control of your blood sugar and blood pressure are important in keeping your kidneys healthy but may not always prevent kidney damage from occurring. Prevention of Cardiovascular Problems and Complications Ramipril may be used to reduce the risk of some of the problems and complications that may arise in patients aged 55 years or more who have problems such as coronary artery disease (heart disease caused by poor blood flow in the blood vessels of the heart), peripheral vascular disease (poor circulation in the hands or feet) or stroke. Ramipril may also be used to reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems and complications in patients with diabetes aged 55 years or more who may be considered at risk because they have one or more additional risk factors (e.g. high blood pressure, high cholesterol levels, kidney problems, a current smoker or previous disease of the blood vessels). Ramipril works by widening the blood vessels, which then reduces the pressure in the vessels, making it easier for your heart to pump blood around your body. This helps increase the supply of oxygen to your heart, so that when you place extra demands on your heart (such as during exercise), your heart may cope better, and you may not get short of breath as easily. By increasing the supply of oxygen to your heart, your heart does not have to work as hard and it is under less stress, which may reduce the risk of further damage occurring to it following a heart attack. Ramipril also improves blood flow through the small blood vessels found in the kidneys, which helps the kidneys to work more efficiently. This in turn can help to slow down the progression of kidney damage that might result from having diabetes or high blood pressure. Ask your doctor if you have any questions about why this medicine has been prescribed for you. Your doctor may have prescribed it for another reason. This medicine is available only with a doctor's prescription. There is no evidence that this medicine is addictive.

Tell your doctor if you have or have had any of the following medical conditions: kidney problems, or are having dialysis (your doctor may give you ramipril because of your kidney problems) heart problems (your doctor may give you ramipril because of your heart problems) low blood pressure, which you may notice as dizziness or light-headedness diabetes (note: your doctor may give you ramipril because of your diabetes) Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE), scleroderma or other autoimmune conditions. Tell your doctor if you have a family history of swelling of the face, lips, tongue, throat, intestines, hands or feet. Tell your doctor if you are following a very low or very high salt diet. Tell your doctor if you are dehydrated, or have had a recent bout of vomiting or diarrhoea Tell your doctor if you are pregnant or plan to become pregnant or start breastfeeding. Tell your doctor if you are about to have surgery or a general anaesthetic Your doctor can discuss with you the risks and benefits involved. If you have not told your doctor about any of the above, tell them before you start taking this medicine. Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking any other medicines, including any that you buy without a prescription from your pharmacy, supermarket or health food shop. Some medicines and ramipril may interfere with each other. These include: other medicines used to treat high blood pressure especially sacubitril/valsartan, including those containing the active ingredient aliskiren lithium, used to treat mood swings and some types of depression potassium supplements, potassium-containing salt substitutes or any medicine that may increase your potassium levels non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), used to relieve pain, swelling and other symptoms of inflammation medicines which may affect the blood cells, such as allopurinol, procainamide, corticosteroids, immunosuppressants or medicines used to treat cancer if you are taking ramipril for high blood pressure, do not take any medicines (including the ones bought without a prescription) for appetite control, asthma, colds, coughs, hay fever or sinus problems unless you have discussed it with your doctor or pharmacist These medicines may be affected by ramipril or may affect how well it works. You may need different amounts of your medicines, or you may need to take different medicines. Your doctor and pharmacist have more information on medicines to be careful with or avoid while taking this medicine. Follow all directions given to you by your doctor or pharmacist carefully. They may differ from the information contained in this leaflet. If you do not understand the instructions on the label, ask your doctor or pharmacist for help. Your doctor or pharmacist will tell you how many capsules you will need to take. This depends on your condition and whether you are taking any other medicines. Some patients may need a lower starting dose. The usual dose is: for cardiovascular risk, 2.5 mg to 10 mg per day. Depending on your response, your doctor may adjust the dose. If two capsules are prescribed, your doctor may want you to take both together or at different times. This will depend on the condition being treated and how you respond to ramipril. The capsules should be swallowed whole with plenty of fluid. Take your medicine at about the same time each day. Taking it at the same time each day will have the best effect. It will also help you remember when to take it. It does not matter if you take this medicine before or after food. Continue taking your medicine for as long as your doctor tells you. Ramipril helps to control your condition but does not cure it. It is important to keep taking your medicine even if you feel well. If it is almost time to take your next dose, skip the dose you missed and take your next dose when you are meant to. Otherwise, take it as soon as you remember, and then go back to taking your medicine as you would normally. Do not take a double dose to make up for the dose that you missed. This may increase the chance of you getting an unwanted side effect. If you are not sure what to do, ask your doctor or pharmacist. If you have trouble remembering to take your medicine, ask your pharmacist for some hints. Immediately telephone your doctor or the Poisons Information Centre (telephone 13 11 26) for advice or go to Accident and Emergency at the nearest hospital, if you think that you or anyone else may have taken too much of this medicine. Do this even if there are no signs of discomfort or poisoning. If you take too much ramipril, you may feel light-headed, dizzy or you may faint. You may also experience a slow heartbeat. If you are about to be started on any new medicine, remind your doctor and pharmacist that you are taking this medicine. Tell any other doctors, dentists, and pharmacists who treat you that you are taking this medicine. If you are going to have surgery, tell the surgeon or anaesthetist that you are taking this medicine. Ramipril may also affect other medicines used during surgery. If you become pregnant or start to breastfeed while taking this medicine, tell your doctor immediately. Make sure you drink enough water during exercise and hot weather when you are taking ramipril, especially if you sweat a lot. If you do not drink enough water while taking ramipril, you may feel faint, light-headed or sick. This is because your blood pressure is dropping suddenly. If you continue to feel unwell, tell your doctor. If you have excess vomiting or diarrhoea while taking ramipril, tell your doctor. You may lose too much water and salt and your blood pressure may drop too much. If you feel light-headed or dizzy after taking your first dose of ramipril, or when your dose is increased, tell your doctor immediately. If you are about to have any blood tests, tell your doctor that you are taking this medicine. Ramipril may interfere with the results of some tests. Have your blood pressure checked when your doctor says, to make sure ramipril is working. Your doctor may do some tests from time to time to make sure the medicine is working and to prevent unwanted side effects. Your doctor may occasionally do a blood test to check your potassium levels and see how your kidneys are working. Do not take this medicine to treat any other complaints unless your doctor tells you to. Do not give your medicine to anyone else, even if they have the same condition as you. Do not stop taking your medicine or lower the dosage without checking with your doctor. If you feel light-headed, dizzy or faint when getting out of bed or standing up, get up slowly. Standing up slowly, especially when you get up from bed or chairs, will help your body get used to the change in position and blood pressure. If this problem continues or gets worse, talk to your doctor. Be careful while driving or operating machinery until you know how ramipril affects you. As with other ACE inhibitor medicines, ramipril may cause dizziness, light-headedness, tiredness or drowsiness in some people. Make sure you know how you react to ramipril before you drive a car, operate machinery or do anything else that could be dangerous if you are dizzy or light-headed. If this occurs, do not drive. If you drink alcohol, dizziness or light-headedness may be worse. Some self-help measures suggested below may help your condition. Talk to your doctor or pharmacist about these measures and for more information. Alcohol - your doctor may advise you to limit your alcohol intake. Diet - eat a healthy low-fat diet which includes plenty of fresh vegetables, fruit, bread, cereals and fish. Also, eat less fat and sugar. Exercise - regular exercise helps to reduce blood pressure and helps get the heart fitter, but it is important not to overdo it. Walking is good exercise but try to find a route that is reasonably flat. Before starting any exercise, ask your doctor about the best kind of exercise programme for you. Salt - your doctor may advise you to watch the amount of salt in your diet. To reduce your salt intake you should avoid using salt in cooking or at the table. Smoking - your doctor may advise you to stop, or at least cut down smoking. Weight - your doctor may suggest losing some weight to help lower your blood pressure and help lessen the amount of work your heart has to do. Some people may need a dietician's help to lose weight. Tell your doctor or pharmacist as soon as possible if you do not feel well while you are taking this medicine. Ramipril helps most people, but it may have unwanted side effects in a few people. All medicines may have some unwanted side effects. Sometimes they are serious, but most of the time they are not. Do not be alarmed by the following lists of side effects. You may not experience any of them. Ask your doctor or pharmacist to answer any questions you may have. Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you notice any of the following and they worry you: aching muscles, muscle tenderness or weakness, not caused by exercise The above list includes the more common side effects. Tell your doctor as soon as possible if you notice any of the following: changes to your sleeping pattern, including drowsiness symptoms of sunburn (such as redness, itching, swelling, blistering) which may occur more quickly than normal severe upper stomach pain, often with nausea and vomiting signs of anaemia such as tiredness, being short of breath and looking pale numbness, tingling and colour change (white, blue then red) in the fingers or toes when exposed to the cold frequent infections such as fever, severe chills, sore throat or mouth ulcers passing little or no urine or more urine than is normal for you These may be serious side effects. You may need medical attention. If any of the following happen, tell your doctor immediately or go to Accident and Emergency at your nearest hospital: severe dizziness and confusion with visual disturbances and speech problems swelling of the face, lips, mouth, tongue or throat which may cause difficulty in swallowing or breathing pink or red itchy spots on the skin which may blister and progress to form raised, red, pale-centred marks severe blisters and bleeding in the lips, eyes, mouth, nose and genitals signs of allergic reaction which may include shortness of breath, wheezing or difficulty breathing; swelling of the face, lips, tongue or other parts of the body; rash, itching or hives on the skin These are very serious side effects. You may need urgent medical attention or hospitalisation. These side effects are very rare. Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you notice anything that is making you feel unwell. Other side effects not listed above may also occur in some people. Keep your medicine in its original packaging until it is time to take it.

b1b0fb5e-8350-41f0-92f5-c8b672c9c974,"Meperidine is used to relieve pain severe enough to require opioid treatment and when other pain medicines did not work well enough or cannot be tolerated. It belongs to the group of medicines called narcotic analgesics (pain medicines). Meperidine acts on the central nervous system (CNS) to relieve pain. This medicine should not be used to relieve chronic (long-lasting or recurrent) pain. When meperidine is used for a long time, it may become habit-forming, causing mental or physical dependence. However, people who have continuing pain should not let the fear of dependence keep them from using narcotics to relieve their pain. Mental dependence (addiction) is not likely to occur when narcotics are used for this purpose. Physical dependence may lead to withdrawal side effects if treatment is stopped suddenly. However, severe withdrawal side effects can usually be prevented by gradually reducing the dose over a period of time before treatment is stopped completely.

Allergic rhinitis, often called allergies or hay fever, occurs when your overreacts to particles in the air that you breathe—you are allergic to them. Your immune system attacks the particles in your body, causing symptoms such as sneezing and a runny nose. The particles are called , which simply means they can cause an allergic reaction. People with allergies usually have symptoms for many years. You may have symptoms often during the year, or just at certain times. You also may get other problems such as and ear infections as a result of your allergies. Over time, allergens may begin to affect you less, and your symptoms may not be as severe as they had been. You sneeze again and again, especially after you wake up in the morning. You have a runny nose and . The drainage from a runny nose caused by allergies is usually clear and thin. But it may become thicker and cloudy or yellowish if you get a nasal or sinus infection. You probably know that pollens from trees, grasses, and weeds cause allergic rhinitis. Many people have allergies to , , cockroaches, and mold as well. Things in the workplace, such as cereal grain, wood dust, chemicals, or lab animals, can also cause allergic rhinitis. If you are allergic to pollens, you may have symptoms only at certain times of the year. If you are allergic to dust mites and indoor allergens, you may have symptoms all the time. To find out if you have allergies, your doctor will ask about your symptoms and examine you. Knowing what symptoms you have, when you get them, and what makes them worse or better can help your doctor know whether you have allergies or another problem. If you have severe symptoms, you may need to have allergy tests to find out what you are allergic to. Your doctor may do a skin test. In this test your doctor puts a small amount of an allergen into your skin to see if it causes an allergic reaction. Your doctor may order lab tests. These tests look for substances that put you at risk for allergies. There is no cure for allergic rhinitis. One of the best things you can do is to avoid the things that cause your allergies. You may need to clean your house often to get rid of dust, animal dander, or molds. Or you may need to stay indoors when pollen counts are high. Unless you have another health problem, such as asthma, you may take over-the-counter medicines to treat your symptoms at home. If you do have another problem, talk to your doctor first. Others who also should talk to their doctor before starting self-treatment include older adults, children, and women who are pregnant or breastfeeding. If your allergies bother you a lot and you cannot avoid the things you are allergic to, immunotherapy (such as ) may help prevent or reduce your symptoms. To have this treatment, you first need to know what you are allergic to. Finding the treatment that works best for you may take a little time. Health Tools help you make wise health decisions or take action to improve your health. Decision Points focus on key medical care decisions that are important to many health problems. Actionsets are designed to help people take an active role in managing a health condition. Allergic rhinitis, often called hay fever, occurs when your to particles in the air that you breathe—you are allergic to them. Your immune system causes symptoms such as sneezing and a runny nose. The particles are called allergens, which simply means they can cause an allergic reaction. Several cause allergic rhinitis, including pollens, mold, dust mites, animal dander, and cockroaches. Although polluted air is not an allergen, it can irritate your nose and lungs. An irritated nose or lungs may make an allergic reaction more likely when you breathe in an allergen. Symptoms of allergic rhinitis may develop within minutes or hours after you breathe in an allergen. The symptoms can last for days. Symptoms that often start as soon as you breathe in an allergen include: Sneezing over and over again, especially after you wake up in the morning. A tickle in your throat or coughing caused by postnasal drip. Other symptoms that may take longer to appear include: A stuffy nose, possibly with sniffing. This is the most common symptom in children. Breathing through your mouth because your nose is blocked. Pressure in your ear or having a hard time hearing. Dark circles or patches under your eyes (allergic shiners). Other problems with symptoms similar to allergic rhinitis include , nasal defects, and inflammation () not caused by an allergen (nonallergic rhinitis). Your symptoms may be better or worse at different times of the year or different times in your life. For example: If you are allergic to dust mites, animal dander, or indoor mold, your symptoms may be more severe in winter when you spend more time indoors. If you have a pollen allergy, your symptoms may vary based on what plants grow in your area and what season it is. If you get pregnant, your symptoms might get worse. Allergic rhinitis can then make asthma and sinusitis worse. The first time you are exposed to an allergen in the air, your body's immune system may recognize the allergen as a foreign substance. Your body reacts by making against the allergen. The next time you are exposed to the allergen, the antibodies react to it. This releases histamine and other chemicals that cause the symptoms of your allergy. This is called sensitization. Sensitization may occur early in life. Children who have allergic rhinitis may become allergic to many allergens, including dust mites, dander on cats and dogs, and tree and grass pollens. Allergic rhinitis can affect your health if you don't treat it. If it lasts a long time, you may have complications such as sinusitis, plugged ears, and ear infections. Some people with allergic rhinitis have . Some have asthma, and researchers are looking at whether allergic rhinitis may lead to asthma. Allergic rhinitis can also affect your quality of life. You may avoid seeing people, have problems sleeping, and feel tired or grumpy. You may have trouble with school or work. You may be more likely to have allergic rhinitis and other allergies if: You have a family history of allergies, especially allergic rhinitis. A child is more likely to have an allergy if both parents have an allergy or have the same type of allergy. You are exposed to dust mites, animal dander, or other indoor allergens. You have pain in the and other symptoms of sinus infection. (Symptoms may include fever or a creamy, yellow or green discharge from the nose.) Your allergy symptoms get worse and you don't know why. You are taking a prescription or over-the-counter allergy medicine that does not help your symptoms. Your allergy medicine is causing side effects that bother you, such as decreased coordination or increased drowsiness. You have a cough or cold that lasts longer than 1 to 2 weeks. Health professionals who can evaluate and treat mild allergic rhinitis symptoms include: You may need to see an allergy specialist (), depending on your symptoms or which other treatments you may need. For example, you may need to see a specialist if your medicines are not working or cause severe side effects or if you are thinking about getting immunotherapy (such as ). Your doctor may refer you to an ear, nose, and throat (ENT) specialist (also called an or otorhinolaryngologist). An ENT specialist may be helpful if your doctor thinks you may have or other obstructions in your nose. Your doctor can usually diagnose allergic rhinitis by examining you and asking you questions about your symptoms, activities, and home. If your doctor thinks that you have allergic rhinitis, and you don't have complications, he or she may decide to treat your symptoms without doing lab tests. The doctor will then check your symptoms again later. You and your doctor need to find out exactly what things you are allergic to so that you can take steps to avoid them. You are considering immunotherapy (such as allergy shots). For further testing, your doctor may suggest that you have . For example, a skin test can show how your skin reacts to an allergen. Or a blood test can measure the level of immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies, which your body makes in response to certain allergens. These tests can help your doctor know whether allergic rhinitis is causing your symptoms and find the best treatment. They can also help your doctor see if you have complications, such as sinusitis or asthma. In most cases, you do not need testing. But your doctor may suggest some tests to make sure that another condition is not causing your symptoms. These tests include: such as X-rays, CT scans, and MRIs. These tests can show if you have a sinus infection (sinusitis), chronic inflammation (thickening) of the sinus lining, structural defects of the nose, or, in rare cases, cancer. Both of these tests look for and other problems that may block the nasal cavity. This test looks for abnormal cilia in people who have very thick nasal discharge. Cilia are tiny hairs on the lining of the nasal passages. These tiny hairs beat back and forth to remove particles from the nose. Certain rare diseases can cause problems in the cilia, which can lead to more nasal discharge. The main treatments for allergic rhinitis are avoiding allergens, managing symptoms with medicine and other home treatment, and, in some cases, getting immunotherapy (such as allergy shots). How often you need treatment depends on how often you have symptoms. It is important to avoid allergens that are causing your symptoms. By doing this, you may be able to reduce your allergy symptoms and manage them without medicine or with fewer medicines. You may need to clean your house often to get rid of dust, animal dander, or molds. Or you may need to stay indoors when pollen counts are high. For more information on how to avoid and control allergens, see . Taking medicines and doing other home treatments can help you manage your symptoms. For example, over-the-counter allergy medicines (such as corticosteroid nasal sprays, antihistamines, or decongestants) may help relieve some of your symptoms. They may come in the form of a nasal spray, pill, liquid, or eyedrops. Or your doctor may prescribe stronger types of these medicines. You can do other things at home to help your symptoms, such as . To learn more about managing your symptoms, see and . If medicines don't help your symptoms or if they cause bad side effects, your doctor may suggest immunotherapy. For this treatment, you get shots or use pills that have a small amount of certain allergens in them. Your body ""gets used to"" the allergen, so you react less to it over time. This kind of treatment may help prevent or reduce some allergy symptoms. Sometimes people need surgery to fix a problem that makes treating allergies harder. You and your doctor should not consider surgery unless other treatments have failed. Treatment for children who have allergic rhinitis is much the same as for adults who have allergies. Treating children with medicine may be more difficult because of the possible side effects. Some medicines also may not be approved to treat children. Be safe with medicines. . Experts don't know how to prevent allergic rhinitis. Being exposed to many allergens, , and air pollution can irritate the nose and throat and may contribute to how a person develops an allergy. You can take steps to reduce the symptoms of allergic rhinitis or to make symptoms less severe. Allergic rhinitis is a long-term problem. It takes time and effort to control allergies through home treatment. But home treatment is one of the best things you can do to help your allergies. If you can avoid or reduce your contact with allergens, you may be able to reduce your allergy symptoms and manage them without medicine or with fewer medicines. Controlling your contact with allergens and reducing your symptoms may also make it less likely you will develop complications such as sinusitis. You do this by: . For example, dust regularly and wash bed linens in hot water. . One way to do this is to restrict pets to certain areas of your home. . Clean bathtubs and showers monthly. Avoiding outdoor pollens. This includes staying inside while pollen counts are high. If avoiding allergens doesn't help your symptoms or is not possible: You can treat a stuffy nose by with saline solution (salt water). You may be able to prevent or manage mild sinus infections by using a humidifier in your home, drinking plenty of liquids, and avoiding tobacco smoke. You may try taking to relieve symptoms. It is helpful to track your symptoms and how they affect you. For example, do your symptoms keep you from sleeping, make it hard to concentrate, or make you sleepy? Also track your allergens and how long after exposure to them you start to have symptoms. This information will help your doctor prevent and treat the problem. You can keep a to track this information. Medicines are a key part of treatment for allergic rhinitis. You can get over-the-counter or by prescription. These help reduce inflammation in the nose. They work well for most people. They start working quickly, but it may be several weeks before you get the full effect. There are other types of allergy medicines you can buy without a prescription, such as: Antihistamines. These help your sneezing, runny nose, itching, and watery eyes. If over-the-counter medicines don't work or in special cases, such as if you are pregnant, your doctor may suggest other medicines. Other medicines include: Leukotriene modifiers. These can relieve a stuffy nose, itching and sneezing, and a runny nose. Some people begin using over-the-counter medicines for allergic rhinitis before they see their doctors. These medicines can work well. But people who have other medical problems, older adults, children, women who are pregnant or breastfeeding, and people who have more than occasional mild symptoms should see a doctor before starting self-treatment. For example: If you are pregnant, talk with your doctor about which allergy medicines are safe when pregnant. Some medicines might be better for you and your baby than others. If possible, don't use medicine for at least the first 3 months of your pregnancy. When you treat children with medicine, know that it may be more difficult than treating adults because of the possible side effects. Some medicines also may not be approved for treating children. Be especially careful with antihistamines and decongestants. They may not be safe for young children, so check the label first. If you do give these medicines to a child, always follow the directions about how much to give based on the child's age and weight. Be safe with medicines. . Do not use the medicine longer than the label says. You may use medicine daily for quick relief of symptoms that occur suddenly or are getting worse. Or you may use it in advance if you know you may breathe an allergen. For example, if you have severe pollen allergies, your doctor may suggest that you start using a 1 to 2 weeks before the pollen season starts. You may want to think about using different medicines at different times of the day. For example, during the day you could use a nondrowsy antihistamine such as fexofenadine (such as Allegra) or loratadine (such as Claritin). But if you are at home in the evening and sleepiness is not a concern, you can think about using an antihistamine like diphenhydramine (Benadryl) or chlorpheniramine (Chlor-Trimeton). These are less expensive but can make you feel sleepy. You may also try a combination of medicines to relieve all of your symptoms. Talk with your doctor about which symptoms are most important for you to treat and which medicines may work best for you. For worse symptoms, an antihistamine nasal spray may be prescribed. If you don't take your medicine, your symptoms may come back or get worse. When you give medicine to children, explain to them why they are taking medicine and how it can help them. Also tell them what side effects may occur. Although surgery doesn't cure allergic rhinitis, you may need it to fix a physical defect of the nose or sinuses. Problems such as these can make allergic rhinitis harder to treat. You and your doctor should not consider surgery unless other treatments have failed. surgery on your nose to correct a crooked nose () or remove noncancerous (benign) . For information on this surgery, see the topic . Draining fluid from the middle ear (tympanotomy or myringotomy) or inserting tubes to help the ears drain (tympanostomy).

If medicines can't control your allergic rhinitis, you may think about having immunotherapy in the form of allergy shots or sublingual tablets. are small doses of that your doctor injects under your skin. With sublingual immunotherapy, you dissolve a tablet under your tongue daily. Each tablet has a small amount of allergen in it. These treatments help your body ""get used to"" the allergen, so your body reacts less to it over time. Allergy shots work best if you are allergic to pollens, animal dander, or dust mites. Doctors use allergy shots mainly to treat an allergy caused by one allergen or a closely related group of them, such as grass pollens. If you are allergic to more than one type of allergen, you may need to get shots for each type of allergen to relieve all of your symptoms. The allergens can usually be combined into one or two shots. Deciding on allergy shots is a personal decision. Although expensive, allergy shots may not cost more than the combined cost of medicine, doctor and emergency room visits, and missed days of school or work over several years. But you may need allergy shots for 3 to 5 years. And there is some risk of severe whole-body reactions (). For help deciding whether to get allergy shots, see: Because allergic rhinitis can't be cured and may be frustrating to treat, people may try alternative treatment methods, such as homeopathy. But most of these treatments either have not been studied or have not been proved to work. Such treatments may be expensive. And some can be dangerous to your health. Talk to your doctor if you are thinking about trying a complementary or alternative therapy or if you want to know about new treatments that are being studied for allergic rhinitis. Wallace D, et al.

MAJOR ISSUES IN UNDERSTANDING AS th ma I he purpose of this chapter is to provide background infor- mation helpful to the understanding of the material covered in the report. It contains a summary of the 1993 Institute of Medi- cine report Indoor Allergens, which covered some of the same top- ics examined here. It also addresses some of the major issues in understanding the medical condition called asthma: the contro- versy over the definition of the illness; the characteristics of its clinical presentation in children, adolescents, and adults; and the concepts of the ""development of asthma"" and ""exacerbations of asthma."" Finally, the chapter presents brief discussions of four topics addressed in greater detail later in the report: risk factors, trends in prevalence, pathophysiology, and tools for evaluating the effectiveness of interventions to reduce asthma. ORIGIN OF THE STUDY In 1993, as a result of joint funding between the U.S. Environ- mental Protection Agency (EPA) Indoor Air Division (IAD) and several agencies within the Department of Health and Human Services, the Institute of Medicine (IOM) issued a major report: Indoor Allergens: Assessing and Controlling Adverse Health Effects (hereafter called Indoor Allergens). Indoor Allergens received wide public and press attention and helped to focus public health 19 20 CLEARING THE AIR policy on the dramatic increases in asthma, especially in children. The report also pointed out the role of indoor allergens such as dust mites, cockroaches, fungi, and pet dander in the etiology of asthma. At about the same time, IAD and the EPA Office of Re- search and Development issued a major assessment of the health impacts of environmental tobacco smoke (ETS), which found a correlation between exposure to ETS and asthma in children. EPA's asthma and indoor air initiatives are now the responsi- bility of the Indoor Environments Division (IED), a part of the Office of Radiation and Indoor Air. IED has been actively involved in public outreach efforts on asthma and its relationship to indoor environmental pollutants. These include educational campaigns in high-risk communities, the Indoor Air Quality (IA Q) Tools for Schools Action Kit, and cooperative efforts with other government agencies. EPA is currently developing an outreach strategy focused on reducing asthma-related morbidity and mortality associated with exposure to indoor environments. To help ensure that such ef- forts are based on sound science, EPA requested that the National Academies undertake an assessment of asthma and its relation- ship to indoor air quality. This report presents the conclusions of that research effort. SUMMARY OF THE INDOOR ALLERGENS REPORT The early 1990s saw an increase in the level of concern about the potential adverse health effects of indoor air quality. Moti- vated by this concern, several agencies of the federal government asked the IOM to undertake an assessment of the public health significance of indoor allergens. The IOM responded by assem- bling a committee of experts in such fields as allergy and immu- nology, epidemiology, mycology, engineering, industrial health, pulmonology, education, and public policy. The study undertaken by the committee had three primary objectives: 1. to identify airborne biological and chemical agents found indoors that can be directly linked to allergic diseases; 2. to assess the health impacts of these allergens; and MAJOR ISSUES IN UNDERSTANDING ASTHMA 21 3. to determine the adequacy of the knowledge base that is currently available on this topic. That report described what was then known about the ad- verse human health effects caused by indoor allergens, the mag- nitude of the problem nationally, the specific causative agents and their sources, the testing methods used for identifying allergens and diagnosing related diseases, and associated educational and research needs. The committee responsible for the study identi- fied and developed a list of research agenda items and priority recommendations. The recommendations focused primarily on the need to improve awareness and education, while the research agenda focused on the longer-term, more expensive, and more technical aspects of fundamental research and data collection. Indoor Allergens details the 1993 study committee's conclu- sions. Although some of these conclusions address medical con- ditions and topics outside the scope of the present report, several address issues related to asthma and the impact of indoor air ex posures. The Indoor Allergens committee recommended that steps be taken to improve estimates of allergenic disease incidence and prevalence, and to establish effective mechanisms for medical professionals to acquire assessments of potential exposure to in- door allergens in residential environments. It called for improve- ments in heating, ventilating, and air-conditioning (HVAC) equip- ment in order to minimize allergen reservoirs and amplifiers, and for the development of consensus standards for controlling mois- ture in buildings to help control microbial and arthropod aeroallergens and allergen reservoirs. The committee also recom- mended several educational initiatives including the develop- ment of focused intervention programs for allergic populations with different socioeconomic and educational characteristics. It called for efforts to inform architects, engineers, contractors, building maintenance personnel, and others responsible for the design and maintenance of indoor environments about the mag- nitude and severity of diseases caused by indoor allergens and the health implications of the design, construction, and operation of buildings. Among the report's research agenda items were calls to 22 CLEARING THE AIR · better characterize rates of initial asthma sensitization, in- cidence, prevalence, and morbidity, and clarify the relation be- tween these and socioeconomic status, race, and other factors; · identify, characterize, and determine the health impact of indoor allergens, specifically suggesting research on allergenic chemicals, arthropods, dust mites, fungi, and indoor animals and plants; · conduct dose-response studies in humans to determine both the relationship between allergen concentration and immu- nologic response and the threshold environmental exposure con- centration for sensitization; and · evaluate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a broad variety of environmental control measures on patient symptoms, and determine whether long-term allergen avoidance has a posi- tive effect on quality of life. DEFINITIONS OF ASTHMA Although patients of all ages are routinely diagnosed with asthma, finding a widely accepted definition for this disease has proven to be problematic (Samet, 1987; Toelle et al., 1992, 1997~. One commonly used definition of asthma (Murphy, 1997) states: Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the airways in which many cells and cellular elements play a role, in particular, mast cells, eosinophils, T lymphocytes, macrophages, neutrophils, and epithe- lial cells. In susceptible individuals, this inflammation causes re- current episodes of wheezing, breathlessness, chest tightness, and coughing, particularly at night or in the early morning. These epi- sodes are usually associated with widespread but variable airflow obstruction that is often reversible either spontaneously or with treatment. The inflammation also causes an associated increase in the existing bronchial hyper-responsiveness to a variety of stimuli. (Murphy, 1997) There are two important concerns with this definition: (1) the definition implies that asthma is a single disease entity, although much of the contemporary evidence suggests that asthma is a syn- drome caused by several different mechanisms (Borish, 1999~; and (2) many interpret this definition to mean that asthma results from an aberration or variation of the immune system leading to MAJOR ISSUES IN UNDERSTANDING ASTHMA 23 chronic inflammation. There is general agreement that asthma is always associated with inflammation within the lungs, and the intensity of the inflammation is related to the severity of respira- tory symptoms and the degree of bronchial hyperresponsiveness (slough and Dow, 1987; Ingram, 1991; Pattemore and Holgate, 1993~. (Hyperresponsiveness refers to the abnormally large re- sponse of the lungs to the inhalation of minor irritants such as cold air.) There is also consensus that inflammation is the cause of hyperresponsiveness (Ingram, 1991; Jeffrey et al., 1989; Richmond et al., 1996; Woolley et al., 1996~. Discovering the origin or origins of the inflammatory response, however, remains a critical unan- swered question for researchers. The absence of a universally accepted definition of asthma makes it especially difficult to arrive at a consistent operational definition for epidemiologic studies. One of the most commonly used definitions of asthma in epidemiology is a ""physician's di- agnosis"" (Barbee et al., 1985; Dodge et al., 1986; Samet, 1987; Yunginger et al., 1992~. This term is imprecise since there is little information about the reasoning and consistency used by physi- cians when making this diagnosis. A variety of definitions, based on questions about symptoms, have been proposed. The validity of these symptom-based definitions has rarely been rigorously evaluated (Toelle et al., 1997~. For the purposes of this report, asthma is understood to be a chronic disease of the airways characterized by an inflammatory response involving many cell types. Both genetic and environ- mental factors appear to play important roles in the initiation and continuation of the inflammation. Although the inflammatory re- sponse may vary from one patient to another, the symptoms are often episodic and usually include wheezing, breathlessness, chest tightness, and coughing. Symptoms may occur at any time of the day but are more commonly seen at night. These symp- toms are associated with widespread airflow obstruction that is at least partially reversible with pharmacologic agents or time. Many persons with asthma also have varying degrees of bron- chial hyperresponsiveness (Britton, 1992; Ingram, 1991~. Research has shown that after long periods of time this inflammation may cause a gradual alteration or remodeling of the architecture of the 24 CLEARING THE AIR lungs that cannot be reversed with therapy Jeffrey et al., 1989; Kamm and Drazen, 1992; Murphy, 1997; Richmond et al., 1996~. CLINICAL PRESENTATION OF ASTHMA . Asthma may present at any age, but most studies suggest that in the majority of patients, asthma will present before puberty (Barbee et al., 1985; Martinez et al., 1995~. Discussing the presen- tation of asthma is complicated by a lack of consensus on criteria for defining the onset of asthma. Many children who are sick with respiratory infections will experience asthma-like symptoms. In some children the symptoms will diminish, whereas in others the symptoms will persist (Brooke et al., 1995; Dodge et al., 1996; Martinez et al., 1995; Ross et al., 1995; Williams and McNicol, 1969~. A diagnosis of asthma is dependent upon the recurring na- ture of these symptoms over a period of time. It appears that the more frequently these episodes occur, the more likely the child is to have asthma (Dodge et al., 1996; Martin et al., 1982; Martinez et al., 1995; Williams and McNicol, 1969~. Unfortunately, no clear criteria mark the transition from recurrent wheezing with infec- tions to asthma, and there are no tests capable of confirming a diagnosis (Brooke et al., 1995; Dodge et al., 1996~. Tests of pulmo- nary function are very helpful in the diagnosis of asthma in ado- lescents and adults, but testing the lung function of children ages 1-6 is very difficult and possible only in a small number of re- search settings. This means that defining the onset of asthma de- pends on the variable skills and criteria applied by different phy . . slclans. In most children, asthma begins as episodes of prolonged coughing, with or without wheezing, within the first few years of life. In young children, these symptomatic episodes are almost always associated with infections of the respiratory tract. The agents most often associated with these respiratory infections are common viral respiratory pathogens (Busse, 1989,1995; Folkerts and Nijkamp, 1995; Martinez, 1995; Pattemore et al., 1992) . The potential roles of other infectious agents including mycoplasma and chlamydia have been questioned but not defined (Hahn et al., 1991, 1998; von Hertzen et al., 1999~. In the majority of chil- dren these symptomatic episodes resolve with time. For others, MAJOR ISSUES IN UNDERSTANDING ASTHMA 25 the episodes will continue and will gradually begin to occur with- out the concomitant presence of infection (Brooke et al., 1995; Martinez et al., 1995~. The frequency and severity of these epi- sodes appear to increase with exposure to tobacco smoke and other forms of airborne pollutants (Arlian et al., 1993; Gidding and SchydIower, 1994; Menon et al., 1991~. A family history of asthma and allergy and a personal atopic predisposition increase the likelihood that asthma will develop (Brooke et al., 1995; Martinez et al., 1995; Williams and McNicol, 1969~. With asthma symptoms ranging from clearly episodic to nearly continuous, from mild to severe, and from an isolated cough to a loud wheeze, diagnosing patients accurately can prove to be very difficult. In some children, asthma presents as distinct episodes of wheezing and difficulty breathing, whereas in others, cough may be the only complaint. When episodes are distinct events and wheezing is a prominent symptom, a diagnosis of asthma is relatively easy to make. However, when symptoms are less episodic and when wheezing is minimal or absent, asthma can be misdiagnosed or missed altogether. In many children the episodes of symptoms are diagnosed as recurrent bronchitis, bronchiolitis, or pneumonia (Brooke et al., 1995; Dodge et al., 1996; Sherman et al., 1990~. When treated with antibiotics, these ill- nesses seemingly ""resolve."" If these episodes occur only a few times each year, the true asthma diagnosis may be missed for years (Davis, 1976; Martin et al., 1982; Schwartz et al., 1990~. Phy- sician recognition of asthma symptoms is further complicated by the parents' and child's perceptions, expectations, and abilities to describe the symptoms. When a diagnosis of asthma has been made, many parents of asthmatic children often state that the symptoms they now recognize as coming from asthma were present months or years before a diagnosis was made. These variations in the presentation of asthma lead to confu- sion between the concepts of the ""development of asthma"" and the ""exacerbations of asthma."" The concept of developing asthma is that the lungs of a normal individual go through a process in which they develop characteristic, chronic, eosinophilic inflam- mation. The eosinophilic inflammation is associated with symp- toms, such as cough and wheezing, that are recognized as asthma. Because there is no distinct finding or test that allows precise iden 26 CLEARING THE AIR tification of these changes, it is usually impossible to pinpoint when asthma actually begins or develops. The term asthma exac- erbation is used when referring to the sudden onset of symptoms in someone who already has developed asthma. In older children and some adults, the onset of asthma can be defined by the first exacerbation that brought the patient to medical attention. How- ever, even in these individuals there was presumably a gradual process that took days, weeks, or months before the exacerbation appeared. There is essentially no information concerning whether changes in lung function or immune process in the lung can be detected prior to or during the development of asthma. Another important but difficult concept is referred to as ""growing out of asthma,"" which originated from the experiences of many parents and physicians. As already mentioned, many in- fants and young children wheeze in association with viral respi- ratory infections (Brooke et al., 1995; Martinez et al., 1995; Ross et al., 1995~. As these infants grow older they cease to wheeze with this type of infection. If the child had been diagnosed as having asthma, he or she has now ""outgrown"" that asthma. There are also children who have recurrent episodes of wheezing during childhood and are diagnosed as having asthma, but cease to wheeze during adolescence, often during the years of puberty. The probability that the symptoms of asthma will remit appears to be higher if the child has little evidence of allergic disease (Martinez et al., 1995; Ross et al., 1995; Williams and McNicol, 1969~. Some of the children whose asthma has remitted will rede- velop asthma symptoms in adulthood. Because of the length of time required, there have been few prospective studies of the risk of asthma recurring once remission has occurred; hence there is no information about risk factors for redeveloping asthma. As children move into adolescence and adulthood, respira- tory infections remain a common cause of symptomatic episodes (Busse, 1995; Martinez, 1995~. Additionally, symptoms may occur ""spontaneously"" or with exercise. Spontaneous symptoms are of- ten discovered to be the result of exposure to either an allergen or a potent airborne irritant. When symptoms of coughing and wheezing are associated only with exercise, it is often difficult to distinguish whether these are new symptoms or unrecognized symptoms that have been present for years. Symptoms associ MAJOR ISSUES IN UNDERSTANDING ASTHMA 27 ated with exercise are more easily recognized in older children because they typically have a higher level of physical activity and have developed the verbal means to describe their symptoms. In some adolescents and adults, symptoms are perceived more as chest tightness or chest pain than as difficulty breathing. People who experience these symptoms may not recognize them as com- ing from the chest and complain instead of chronic fatigue or of becoming fatigued rapidly during the day (Brooke et al., 1995; Dodge et al., 1993~. An interesting change that takes place between childhood and adulthood is in the ratio of males to females with asthma. In child- hood, boys with asthma outnumber girls by 1.5-2 to 1. By 20-30 years of age, women with asthma outnumber men by 1.5-2 to 1, a complete reversal of the childhood ratio (Barbee et al., 1985; Clough, 1993~. Although it is tempting to speculate that this change, which occurs over the years of sexual maturation, results from hormonal changes, little is known about the actual cause. Although asthma can develop anytime, there are times in a person's life when it can be especially troublesome. For some women, asthma first appears or markedly increases during preg- nancy. Because poorly managed asthma is associated with an in- creased risk of maternal and fetal complications, the prompt rec- ognition and appropriate treatment of asthma during pregnancy are important. During pregnancy, the onset of asthma and changes in the severity of preexisting asthma are presumed to be related to the major hormonal changes that occur, but the exact cause is unknown. Occupational asthma is another complex problem (Cartier, 1994; Park et al., 1986~. In some individuals, asthma symptoms first develop as a result of an occupation-related exposure. In most cases the agent responsible for the onset is an allergen to which the worker has become sensitized. In other cases the agent is a strong respiratory irritant. Occupational problems are beyond the scope of this report, however, and are therefore not discussed in detail. A final important concern about the progression of asthma throughout life is the relationship between asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. As mentioned earlier, the chronic inflammatory process of asthma appears to ultimately result in 28 CLEARING THE AIR irreversible obstructive changes in the lungs. The progression from a largely reversible airway obstruction, asthma, to an essen- tially irreversible state, chronic obstructive lung disease, appears to be highly variable and dependent upon a variety of factors such as smoking. The contribution of indoor sources of allergens and irritants to respiratory disease is important because chronic ob- structive pulmonary disease is an important cause of increased morbidity and mortality among adults. RISK FACTORS FOR ASTHMA As early as the 1920s, studies demonstrated that a familial predisposition to asthma existed, suggesting that genetics may play a role in asthma development. This genetic influence has remained constant in subsequent studies; however it explains only 30-80% of the asthma risk. The remaining risk appears to be related to environmental exposure. The recently noted increase in the prevalence of asthma suggests a change in some environmen- tal influence since it is hard to imagine a significant change in human genetics in such a short time (Borish, 1999~. Major studies have been conducted to better define the genes related to the development of asthma. These studies reveal com- plex relationships between genes and asthma (Borish, 1999~. It appears that asthma results from the effects of multiple genes, not a single gene. Further complicating the association between ge- netics and asthma has been the discovery that genes closely linked to asthma in one population may not be significantly linked in another population. Some of these discrepancies appear to be ra- cial, and some appear to be related to the peculiarities of rela- tively isolated and therefore somewhat inbred populations. These findings raise the question of whether asthma is best thought of as a single disease entity, a syndrome, or a final common manifes- tation of several different disease processes (Borish, 1999~. Many different environmental variables have been evaluated in relationship to asthma. Some of these are nonspecific such as an increase in global pollution, a decrease in exercise or outdoor play because of television and computer games, fewer childhood infections because of immunizations, more childhood respiratory infections because of day care, alterations in microbial flora be MAJOR ISSUES IN UNDERSTANDING ASTHMA 29 cause of the frequent use of antibiotics, or changes in indoor envi- ronments. Alternatively, there are relatively specific factors, such as increased exposure to dust mite allergens, that are discussed in more detail in Chapters 5-8. TRENDS IN THE PREVALENCE OF ASTHMAS Many studies have shown that the prevalence of asthma has been increasing in the United States for the past 30 years. Al- though this subject is explored further in Chapter 3, it is impor- tant to summarize some of the most important aspects of asthma trends to provide a better understanding of the problem of asthma in the United States today. In 1998, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) published a study concerning the change in the prevalence of asthma across the United States from 1960 to 1995 (Manning et al., 1998~. That report combined information from several sources to produce a broad picture of the changes in asthma prevalence. Population estimates were based on the 1960,1970,1980, and 1990 censuses and the 1996 intercensal estimate. Each data set was stratified by region, sex, race, and age group. Self-reported asthma data came from the National Health Interview Survey, which is conducted annually. Data on visits to physicians' offices for asthma have been collected since 1975 by the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS). The data have been gathered on five different occasions within the study interval, and each time ap- proximately 2,000 physician offices or about 30,000-60,000 patient encounters, were evaluated. Also since 1992, NCHS has gathered annual data on hospital emergency and outpatient department visits. Hospitalizations attributable to asthma were estimated from 1979 to 1994 from the National Hospital Discharge Survey. Only cases with a primary discharge diagnosis of asthma were included. Finally, mortality was estimated from the Underlying Cause of Death data set from NCHS for 1960 through 1995 to identify all deaths in which asthma was selected as the underly- ~ng cause. The results of this study show an increase in the prevalence of asthma and death rates from asthma over 15 years both nation- ally and regionally. Regional differences were found for some end 30 CLEARING THE AIR points such as hospitalization but not for others such as preva- lence. The self-reported prevalence of asthma increased by 75% from 1980 to 1994. In 1993-1994, an estimated 13.7 million resi- dents of the United States reported asthma during the preceding 12 months. A significant increase in asthma was found for all races, both sexes, and for all age groups. The increase was most prominent among children 0-4 years (160%) and 5-14 years (74%~. During 1993-1994, the self-reported prevalence of asthma was slightly higher among children <14 years of age than among per- sons 215 years of age. In this same year, prevalence rates were similar in all four regions of the country. When office visits for asthma are considered, the estimated annual number of visits increased from 4.6 million to 10.4 million between 1975 and 1993-1994. Again, the increasing rates were found for all race strata, both sexes, and all age groups. During 1993-1994, the rate of office visits for asthma was lowest for the 15-34 year age group. Data on emergency room (ER) visits for asthma were avail- able only from 1992-1995, and during this interval there was no significant change. In 1995, there were in excess of 1.8 million ER visits for asthma. African Americans had consistently higher rates of ER visits than whites. The rate of ER visits decreased with in- creas~ng age. From 1979-1980 to 1993-1994, the estimated number of asthma-related hospitalizations increased, but the rate of hospi- talization did not change over this interval. Hospitalization rates were consistently higher among African Americans than among whites. In 1993-1994, the age-adjusted asthma hospitalization rates were higher in the Northeast than in the West. In each time interval examined, the hospitalization rates were highest among children 0-4 years, lowest among persons aged 15-34 years, and intermediate for those 235. Mortality rates from asthma are confused by the changes in the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) coding criteria. Asthma death rates declined from 1960-1962 to 1975-1978, and then began to rise again by 1993-1994. The 1960-1962 death rate was 28.2 per 100,000 in contrast to a rate of 17.9 per 100,000 in 1993-1994. The lowest death rate was in 1975-1978 at 8.2 per 100,000 or less than half the rate of 1993-1994. MAJOR ISSUES IN UNDERSTANDING ASTHMA 31 These national statistics are consistent with many local and regional reports showing an increase in the prevalence of asthma predominantly in children (Gergen et al., 1988; Gerstman et al., 1993; Vollmer et al., 1998; Yunginger et al., 1992~. This problem has been found in all regions of the United States and affects all races. Even though all races are affected, most studies have con- sistently shown a greater impact of asthma in African Americans in comparison to whites (Cunningham et al., 1996; Gergen, 1996; Gergen et al., 1988; Gerstman et al., 1993~. Similar trends have been observed in most developed countries. This increase in the prevalence of asthma over the relatively short interval of approxi- mately 30 years strongly suggests that some as yet unidentified environmental or behavioral change is responsible. MECHANISMS OF ASTHMA Details of the pathophysiology of asthma are presented in Chapter 4; thus, only the major concepts are discussed here. Fig- ure 1-1 attempts to illustrate these major concepts in a schematic form. Asthma appears to present in two different forms, allergic and nonallergic asthma, illustrated on the left and right sides of the figure, respectively. The critical difference is that in persons with allergic asthma, inhalation of allergens initiates an inflam- matory response that leads to hyperreactivity of the airways and symptoms of asthma. In persons with nonallergic asthma, the in- flammatory process and airway hyperreactivity appear the same as in individuals with allergic asthma, but allergic responses, de- fined by the presence of immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies spe- cific for allergens, cannot be demonstrated. As shown in the fig- ure, allergic asthma is the result of allergen exposure leading to allergic sensitization of a genetically predisposed individual. The development of allergic sensitization during allergen exposure may be influenced by other environmental effects such as the fre- quency and type of respiratory infections, passive exposure to to- bacco smoke, or intensity of allergen exposure. Airway hyperre- activity may be a direct result of allergic airway inflammation or may result from one or more genes. Once asthma is present, a variety of exposures may result in acute or chronic asthma symp- toms. In addition to allergen exposure, the exposures capable of 32 Genetic Predisposition Allergen ~ I Exposure Respiratory,' Allergic *~~~~---- lnfections .'

Dashed lines illustrate relationships that are likely to exist but for which there is little direct evi- dence at present.

The development of nonallergic asthma is somewhat harder to explain, although there are suggestions that chronic infections may be related to asthma in some nonallergic individuals (von Hertzen et al., 1999~. As in the case of allergic asthma, inflamma- tion occurs in the lungs and is typically accompanied by airway Hyperreactivity A variety of exposures may lead to wheezing in the nonallergic asthmatic; however, the origin of the inflamma- tion cannot be directly identified. It is probable that various ge- netic influences on the immune system lead to inflammation in the lungs following some as yet undefined environmental expo MAJOR ISSUES IN UNDERSTANDING ASTHMA 33 sure. It is possible that nonallergic asthma is the result of an uni- dentified allergen, but for many reasons this appears unlikely. Estimates suggest that approximately 80% of asthma in chil- dren is allergic asthma. In adults, the percentage of those with allergic asthma is lower, in the 30-50% range depending on the population studied (Burr, 1993; Eriksson, 1990; von Mutius, 1996; Wever and Wever-Hess, 1993~. The lower prevalence of allergic asthma in adults may arise in many different ways. The preva- lence of allergic sensitivity is lower in adults than in children. It is possible that the inflammatory response that started as an allergic response in a child may become self-perpetuating by adulthood even as the allergic sensitization is lost. It is also possible that these are two different disease processes that merely have similar clinical appearances. EVALUATING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERVENTIONS TO REDUCE ASTHMA Before an asthma intervention can be evaluated, the goals of the intervention must be defined. The goal of asthma therapy is ultimately to prevent a patient's asthma from altering or unduly influencing their life. Specific goals proposed in the Guidelinesfor the Diagnosis and Management of Asthma include (1) prevention of chronic and troublesome symptoms; (2) maintenance of ""normal"" pulmonary function; (3) prevention of recurrent exacerbations of asthma and minimization of the need for emergency department visits or hospitalizations; (4) provision of optimal pharmaco- therapy with minimal or no adverse effects; and (5) meeting pa- tients' and families' expectations and satisfaction with asthma care (Murphy, 1997~. Once goals are agreed upon, tools must be selected to evalu- ate how close the intervention comes to achieving all of the goals. In a typical clinical practice, the physician simply asks patients how they are doing. This is imprecise, and responses can vary depending upon how well the person can perceive his or her symptoms. Since many patients perceive their symptoms poorly, other tools are necessary to assess the adequacy of asthma control. Pulmonary function tests, primarily spirometry, are essential 34 CLEARING THE AIR tools for evaluating a patient with asthma. Good control of asthma is reflected in normal or near-normal spirometry. Sequential i] spirometry allows the physician to follow the course of disease and judge the adequacy of therapy. In children old enough to per- form spirometry, lung growth can be monitored and assessed more easily. There has been increasing recognition that control of asthma evolves more than the absence of symptoms and the normality of lung function tests. Important aspects of asthma management involve the total impact of the disease on a person's life. How much does it affect what a person tries to accomplish? How does it affect daily activities? Do people avoid certain situations for fear of an attack? These diverse aspects have been grouped under the term ""quality of life,"" and questionnaires have been devel- oped that attempt to capture and estimate these aspects of dis- ease control Quniper et al., 1993; Rowe and Oxman, 1993~. Other methods for evaluating asthma are constantly being developed and evaluated. One of the most important areas in need of an adequate means of testing is the intensity of Jung in- flammation. In research settings it is possible to directly sample the linings of the airways and the numbers of inflammatory cells within the lungs, but these techniques are very expensive and involve some risk to the patient. Techniques are needed that could estimate Jung inflammation accurately and yet be simple and in- expensive enough for use on a routine clinical basis. The present state of the art in assessing any form of interven- tion for the control of asthma typically involves four components: (1) patient symptom scores or checklists, (2) physician assess- ments, (3) spirometry (often supplemented with home peak flow monitoring), and (4) completion of quality-of-life questionnaires. Given the lack of precision of these instruments, it is usually nec- essary to apply them with a relatively large number of persons for weeks or months before the effect of the intervention can be estimated adequately. In some cases, other measurements can be used to supplement the components listed above. These measures could include some attempt at estimating Jung inflammation, de- termining allergen-specific IgE levels in serum, or assessing exer cise tolerance.

Since about 1980, asthma prevalence and asthma-related hospitalizations and deaths have increased substantially, especially among children. Of particular concern is the high mortality rate among African Americans with asthma. Recent studies have suggested that indoor exposures—to dust mites, cockroaches, mold, pet dander, tobacco smoke, and other biological and chemical pollutants—may influence the disease course of asthma. To ensure an appropriate response, public health and education officials have sought a science-based assessment of asthma and its relationship to indoor air exposures. meets this need. This book examines how indoor pollutants contribute to asthma—its causation, prevalence, triggering, and severity. The committee discusses asthma among the general population and in sensitive subpopulations including children, low-income individuals, and urban residents. Based on the most current findings, the book also evaluates the scientific basis for mitigating the effects of indoor air pollutants implicated in asthma. The committee identifies priorities for public health policy, public education outreach, preventive intervention, and further research. 2 Methodological Considerations in Evaluating the Evidence 10 Impact of Ventilation and Air Cleaning on Asthma 11 Summary of Research Recommendations and Overall Conclusions Appendix A: Theoretical Considerations Relevant to the Influence of Ventilation and Air Cleaning on Exposures to Indoor-Generated Pollutants You're looking at OpenBook, NAP.edu's online reading room since 1999.

6f92dedc-aac0-44d4-8b5c-a9097306c077,"Amlodipine is used alone or together with other medicines to lower hypertension (high blood pressure) in adults and children. High blood pressure adds to the workload of the heart and arteries. If it continues for a long time, the heart and arteries may not function properly. This can damage the blood vessels of the brain, heart, and kidneys, resulting in a stroke, heart failure, or kidney failure. Lowering blood pressure can reduce the risk of strokes and heart attacks. Amlodipine is also used to relieve chronic stable angina (chest pain) in adults. Amlodipine is a calcium channel blocker. It affects the movement of calcium into the cells of the heart and blood vessels. This relaxes the blood vessels and lowers blood pressure. A lower blood pressure will increase the supply of blood and oxygen to the heart. This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription. This product is available in the following dosage forms: In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered: Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully. Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of amlodipine to lower blood pressure in children younger than 6 years of age or to relieve chest pain in children. Safety and efficacy have not been established. Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of amlodipine in the elderly. However, elderly patients are more likely to have age-related kidney, liver, or heart problems, which may require caution and an adjustment in the dose for patients receiving this medicine. There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding. Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. When you are taking this medicine, it is especially important that your healthcare professional know if you are taking any of the medicines listed below. The following interactions have been selected on the basis of their potential significance and are not necessarily all-inclusive. Using this medicine with any of the following medicines is usually not recommended, but may be required in some cases. If both medicines are prescribed together, your doctor may change the dose or how often you use one or both of the medicines. Using this medicine with any of the following medicines may cause an increased risk of certain side effects, but using both drugs may be the best treatment for you. If both medicines are prescribed together, your doctor may change the dose or how often you use one or both of the medicines. Certain medicines should not be used at or around the time of eating food or eating certain types of food since interactions may occur. Using alcohol or tobacco with certain medicines may also cause interactions to occur. Discuss with your healthcare professional the use of your medicine with food, alcohol, or tobacco. The presence of other medical problems may affect the use of this medicine. Make sure you tell your doctor if you have any other medical problems, especially: Heart or blood vessel disease (eg, coronary artery disease) or Hypotension (low blood pressure)—Use with caution. May make these conditions worse. Aortic stenosis (heart valve problem), severe or Heart or blood vessel disease—Use with caution. May cause side effects to become worse. Liver disease—Use with caution. The effects may be increased because of slower removal of the medicine from the body. Take this medicine only as directed by your doctor. Do not take more of it, do not take it more often, and do not take it for a longer time than your doctor ordered. In addition to the use of this medicine, treatment for your high blood pressure may include weight control and changes in the types of foods you eat, especially foods high in sodium (salt). Your doctor will tell you which of these are most important for you. You should check with your doctor before changing your diet. It is very important that you take your medicine exactly as directed and that you keep your appointments with your doctor even if you feel well. Remember that this medicine will not cure your high blood pressure, but it does help control it. Therefore, you must continue to take it as directed if you expect to lower your blood pressure and keep it down. You might have to take high blood pressure medicine for the rest of your life. If high blood pressure is not treated, it can cause serious problems such as heart failure, blood vessel disease, strokes, or kidney disease. You may take this medicine with or without food. Take it at the same time each day. The dose of this medicine will be different for different patients. Follow your doctor's orders or the directions on the label. The following information includes only the average doses of this medicine. If your dose is different, do not change it unless your doctor tells you to do so. The amount of medicine that you take depends on the strength of the medicine. Also, the number of doses you take each day, the time allowed between doses, and the length of time you take the medicine depend on the medical problem for which you are using the medicine. For oral dosage forms (suspension or tablets): For angina (chest pain): Adults—5 to 10 milligrams (mg) once a day. Your doctor may adjust your dose as needed. However, the dose is usually not more than 10 mg per day. Children—Use and dose must be determined by your doctor. For high blood pressure: Adults—At first, 5 milligrams (mg) once a day. Some patients may be started on 2.5 mg once a day. Your doctor may adjust your dose as needed. However, the dose is usually not more than 10 mg per day. Children 6 to 17 years of age—2.5 to 5 mg once a day. Your doctor may adjust your dose as needed. However, the dose is usually not more than 5 mg per day. Children younger than 6 years of age—Use and dose must be determined by your doctor. If you miss a dose of this medicine, take it as soon as possible. However, if it is almost time for your next dose, skip the missed dose and go back to your regular dosing schedule. Do not double doses. Do not take this medicine if it has been more than 12 hours since you missed your last dose. Store the medicine in a closed container at room temperature, away from heat, moisture, and direct light. Keep from freezing. Do not keep outdated medicine or medicine no longer needed. Ask your healthcare professional how you should dispose of any medicine you do not use. It is very important that your doctor check your or your child's progress at regular visits to make sure this medicine is working properly. Blood tests may be needed to check for unwanted effects. This medicine may cause angina (chest pain) or a heart attack in certain patients with severe heart or blood vessel disease. Check with your doctor right away if you are having chest pain or discomfort, fast or irregular heartbeat, nausea or vomiting, pain or discomfort in the arms, jaw, back, or neck, trouble breathing, or sweating. Dizziness, lightheadedness, or fainting may also occur, especially when you get up suddenly from a lying or sitting position. If you feel dizzy, lie down so you do not faint. Then sit for a few moments before standing to prevent the dizziness from returning. If you faint, call your doctor right away. Dizziness, lightheadedness, or fainting may also occur if you exercise or if the weather is hot. Heavy sweating can cause loss of too much water and result in low blood pressure. Use extra care during exercise or hot weather. Check with your doctor right away if you or your child have pain or tenderness in the upper stomach, pale stools, dark urine, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, or yellow eyes or skin. These could be symptoms of a serious liver problem. If you have been using this medicine regularly for several weeks, do not suddenly stop using it. Stopping suddenly may cause your chest pain or high blood pressure to come back or get worse. Check with your doctor for the best way to reduce gradually the amount you are taking before stopping completely. After taking a dose of this medicine you may get a headache that lasts for a short time. This should become less noticeable after you have taken this medicine for a while. If this effect continues, or if the headaches are severe, check with your doctor. In some patients, tenderness, swelling, or bleeding of the gums may appear soon after treatment with this medicine is started. Brushing and flossing your teeth carefully and regularly and massaging your gums may help prevent this. See your dentist regularly to have your teeth cleaned. Check with your doctor or dentist if you have any questions about how to take care of your teeth and gums, or if you notice any tenderness, swelling, or bleeding of your gums. Do not take other medicines unless they have been discussed with your doctor. This especially includes prescription or nonprescription (over-the-counter [OTC]) medicines for appetite control, asthma, colds, cough, hay fever, or sinus problems, and herbal or vitamin supplements. Along with its needed effects, a medicine may cause some unwanted effects. Although not all of these side effects may occur, if they do occur they may need medical attention. Check with your doctor immediately if any of the following side effects occur: fast, irregular, pounding, or racing heartbeat or pulse redness of the face, neck, arms, and occasionally, upper chest burning, crawling, itching, numbness, prickling, ""pins and needles"", or tingling feelings dizziness or lightheadedness when getting up from a lying or sitting position large, hive-like swelling on the face, eyelids, lips, tongue, throat, hands, legs, feet, or sex organs numbness and tingling of the face, fingers, or toes pain in the arms, legs, or lower back, especially pain in the calves or heels upon exertion redness of the face, neck, arms, and occasionally, upper chest sores, ulcers, or white spots on the lips or in the mouth swelling of the face, fingers, feet, or lower legs uncontrolled movements, especially of the face, neck, and back Some side effects may occur that usually do not need medical attention. These side effects may go away during treatment as your body adjusts to the medicine. Also, your health care professional may be able to tell you about ways to prevent or reduce some of these side effects. Check with your health care professional if any of the following side effects continue or are bothersome or if you have any questions about them: redness of the face, neck, arms, and occasionally, upper chest blistering, crusting, irritation, itching, or reddening of the skin continuing ringing or buzzing or other unexplained noise in the ears feeling of constant movement of self or surroundings pains in the stomach, side, or abdomen, possibly radiating to the back redness, pain, or swelling of the eye, eyelid, or inner lining of the eyelid unsteadiness, trembling, or other problems with muscle control or coordination Swelling of the breasts or breast soreness in both females and males Other side effects not listed may also occur in some patients.

It should not be used to treat pain that you only have once in a while or ""as needed"". Hydrocodone belongs to the group of medicines called narcotic analgesics (pain medicines) that act on the central nervous system (CNS) to relieve pain. When hydrocodone is used for a long time, it may become habit-forming, causing mental or physical dependence. However, people who have continuing pain should not let the fear of dependence keep them from using narcotics to relieve their pain. Mental dependence (addiction) is not likely to occur when narcotics are used for this purpose. Physical dependence may lead to withdrawal side effects if treatment is stopped suddenly. However, severe withdrawal side effects can usually be prevented by gradually reducing the dose over a period of time before treatment is stopped completely. This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription.

0ccabd22-6d68-4851-a290-8f2151433942,"Información sobre medicamentos proporcionada por: Amlodipine is used alone or together with other medicines to lower hypertension (high blood pressure) in adults and children. High blood pressure adds to the workload of the heart and arteries. If it continues for a long time, the heart and arteries may not function properly. This can damage the blood vessels of the brain, heart, and kidneys, resulting in a stroke, heart failure, or kidney failure. Lowering blood pressure can reduce the risk of strokes and heart attacks. Amlodipine is also used to relieve chronic stable angina (chest pain) in adults. Amlodipine is a calcium channel blocker. It affects the movement of calcium into the cells of the heart and blood vessels. This relaxes the blood vessels and lowers blood pressure. A lower blood pressure will increase the supply of blood and oxygen to the heart. This medicine is available only with your doctor's prescription. This product is available in the following dosage forms: In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do.

How to take tablets 4. Possible side effects 5. How to store tablets 6. Contents of the pack and other Information 1. What MST Continus tablets are and what they are used for This medicine has been prescribed for you for the relief of severe pain over a period of 12 hours. It contains morphine, which belongs to a class of medicines called opioids, which are ‘pain relievers’. The medicine has been prescribed for you and should not be given to anyone else. Opioids can cause addiction and you may get withdrawal symptoms if you stop taking it suddenly. Your doctor should have explained how long you will be taking it for and when it is appropriate to stop, how to do this safely. 2. What you need to know before you take Continus tablets you are allergic to morphine or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6); you have breathing problems, such as obstructive airways disease, respiratory depression, or severe asthma. Your doctor will have told you if you have these conditions. Symptoms may include breathlessness, coughing or breathing more slowly or weakly than expected; you have a head injury that causes a severe headache or makes you feel sick. This is because the tablets may make these symptoms worse or hide the extent of the head injury; you have a condition where the small bowel (part of your gut) does not work properly (paralytic ileus), your stomach empties more slowly than it should (delayed gastric emptying) or you have severe pain in your abdomen; you are taking a type of medicine known as a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (examples include tranylcypromine, phenelzine, isocarboxazid, moclobemide and linezolid), or you have taken this type of medicine in the last two weeks; If you are going to have an operation, please tell the doctor at the hospital that you are taking these tablets. Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking these tablets if you: are or have ever been addicted to opioids, alcohol, prescription medicines, or illegal drugs; have previously suffered from withdrawal symptoms such as agitation, anxiety, shaking or sweating when you have stopped taking alcohol or drugs; feel you need to take more tablets to get the same level of pain relief, this may mean you are becoming tolerant to the effects of this medicine or are becoming addicted to it. Speak to your doctor who will discuss your treatment and may change your dose or switch you to an alternative pain reliever; have breathing problems, such as impaired lung function or severe bronchial asthma. Your doctor will have told you if you have these conditions. Symptoms may include breathlessness and coughing; have an under-active thyroid gland (hypothyroidism), severe kidney or liver problems as you may need a lower dose; have a severe headache or feel sick as this may indicate that the pressure in your skull is increased; suffer from, or have ever suffered from epilepsy, seizures, fits or convulsions; have a severe heart problem after long-term lung disease (severe cor pulmonale); have inflammation of the pancreas (which causes severe pain in the abdomen and back) or problems with your gall bladder; experience weakness, fatigue, lack of appetite, nausea, vomiting or low blood pressure. This may be a symptom of the adrenal glands producing too little of the hormone ‘cortisol’, and you may need to take a hormone supplement; have loss of libido, impotence, cessation of menstruation. This may be because of decreased sex hormone production. Taking this medicine regularly, particularly for a long time, can lead to addiction. Your doctor should have explained how long you will be using it for and when it is appropriate to stop, how to do this safely. Rarely, increasing the dose of this medicine can make you more sensitive to pain. If this happens, you need to speak to your doctor about your treatment. Addiction can cause withdrawal symptoms when you stop taking this medicine. Withdrawal symptoms can include restlessness, difficulty sleeping, irritability, agitation, anxiety, feeling your heartbeat (palpitations), increased blood pressure, feeling or being sick, diarrhoea, loss of appetite, shaking, shivering or sweating. Your doctor will discuss with you how to gradually reduce your dose before stopping the medicine. It is important that you do not stop taking the medicine suddenly as you will be more likely to experience withdrawal symptoms. Opioids should only be used by those they are prescribed for. Do not give your medicine to anyone else. Taking higher doses or more frequent doses of opioid may increase the risk of addiction. Overuse and misuse can lead to overdose and/or death. This medicine may cause breathing problems or worsen already existing problems while sleeping. These problems may include pauses in breathing during sleep, being awoken by shortness of breath, difficulty staying asleep or excessive daytime drowsiness. If you or someone else observes these symptoms contact your doctor. Your doctor may want to lower your dose. You may experience hormonal changes while taking these tablets.

When butorphanol is used for a long time, it may become habit-forming, causing mental or physical dependence. However, people who have continuing pain should not let the fear of dependence keep them from using narcotics to relieve their pain. Mental dependence (addiction) is not likely to occur when narcotics are used for this purpose. Physical dependence may lead to withdrawal side effects if treatment is stopped suddenly. However, severe withdrawal side effects can usually be prevented by gradually reducing the dose over a period of time before treatment is stopped completely.

Your blood pressure may be different at different times of the day, depending on how busy or worried you are. You have high blood pressure (also known as hypertension) when your blood pressure stays higher than is needed, even when you are calm and relaxed. There are usually no symptoms of high blood pressure. The only way of knowing that you have it is to have your blood pressure checked on a regular basis. If high blood pressure is not treated it can lead to serious health problems. You may feel fine and have no symptoms, but eventually it can cause stroke, heart disease and kidney failure. Heart failure means that the heart muscle is not pumping blood strongly enough to circulate blood around the body properly. Heart failure is not the same as a heart attack and does not mean that the heart stops working. Some people may develop heart failure after having a heart attack, but there are a number of other causes of heart failure. Heart failure may start off with no symptoms, but as the condition progresses, you may feel short of breath or get tired easily after light physical activity such as walking. Fluid may accumulate in different parts of the body, often first noticed as swollen ankles and feet. You may also wake up short of breath at night. In severe heart failure, symptoms like breathlessness may occur even at rest. Perindopril helps to treat heart failure. If you follow your doctor's advice, your ability to perform daily activities may improve. You may breathe more easily, feel less tired and have less swelling.

World Asthma Day 2020 falls on 5 May. The annual observance is organised by the Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA), with the aim of raising awareness, care and support for the people affected by the respiratory disease . World Asthma Day was initiated in 1998 and this year (2020), the Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) has decided the World Asthma Day will be May 5 every year . World Asthma Day 2020 theme is 'Enough Asthma Deaths.' On this World Asthma Day, we will look into the topic of childhood asthma or asthma in children. In general, asthma is a chronic disease which causes inflammation and narrowing of airways in the lungs. It causes wheezing (a whistling sound when you breathe), chest tightness, shortness of breath, and coughing . During an asthma attack, your airway muscles constrict and mucous membranes produce excess mucus, blocking your breathing. Allergens such as dust, spores, animal hairs, cold air, infection and even stress can trigger asthma . Pollen Exposure During Pregnancy May Increase The Risk Of Paediatric Asthma There are many different types of asthma, brought on by different triggers. Some of the most common types of asthma are adult-onset asthma, allergic asthma, asthma-COPD overlap, nonallergic asthma, occupational asthma and childhood asthma . Childhood asthma also termed as pediatric asthma, is the same as that of asthma reported in adults. However, childhood asthma has different symptoms in comparison to other types of asthma. When a child has asthma, the lungs and airways become easily inflamed when exposed to triggers such as inhaling pollen or catching a cold or other respiratory infection . The symptoms of this respiratory problem can make it difficult for your child to do everyday activities such as going to school, playing and even sleeping. There is no cure for asthma in children but there are ways through which you can prevent the triggers and hence, limit the damage to the child's growing lungs . What Are The Signs & Symptoms Of Childhood Asthma? The symptoms of childhood asthma can vary from one child to another and a child can have different symptoms from one episode to the next. The most common symptoms of childhood asthma are as follows : Frequent coughing, especially during play or exercise Trouble sleeping because of coughing or breathing problems In infants, trouble eating or grunting while eating Severe symptoms of childhood asthma that requires immediate medical attention are as follows : Stopping in the middle of a sentence to catch a breath A belly that sinks in under their ribs when they try to get air Health experts assert that the causes of childhood asthma are not fully understood. Some of the possible causes of pediatric asthma are as follows : Exposure to environmental pollutants, such as cigarette smoke or other air pollution The triggers vary from child to child and in some cases, the reaction trigger can be delayed, making it more difficult to identify it. Some of the common triggers of childhood asthma are as follows : Allergens like cockroaches, dust mites, mould, pet dander, and pollen Irritants like air pollution, chemicals, cold air, odours, or smoke Airway infections like colds, pneumonia, and sinus infections In some children, asthma symptoms occur with no apparent triggers. Factors that can increase your child's likelihood of developing asthma are as follows : Previous allergic reactions, including skin reactions, food allergies or hay fever Respiratory conditions, such as a chronic runny or stuffy nose (rhinitis), inflamed sinuses (sinusitis) or pneumonia Heartburn (gastroesophageal reflux disease, or GERD) Childhood asthma can cause a number of complications and they are as follows : Severe asthma attacks that require emergency treatment or hospital care Symptoms that interfere with normal physical activities Asthma, in general, can be difficult to diagnose because a number of childhood conditions can have symptoms similar to those caused by asthma . The doctor will analyse the symptoms and will determine whether your child's symptoms are caused by asthma, a condition other than asthma, or both asthma and another condition. The following conditions can cause asthma-like symptoms in children : Acid reflux or gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) Respiratory tract infections such as bronchiolitis and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) In order to diagnose the condition, the doctor may prescribe the following tests : Exhaled nitric oxide test help determine whether steroid medications might be helpful for your child's asthma Allergy skin testing, where the skin is pricked with extracts of common allergy-causing substances and observed for signs of an allergic reaction The first form of treatment for childhood asthma depends on the severity of your child's asthma and the goal of asthma treatment is to keep symptoms under control. Treating asthma involves both preventing symptoms and treating an asthma attack in progress . For children younger than age 3 who have mild symptoms of asthma, the doctor might use a wait-and-see approach because the long-term effects of asthma medication on infants and young children are not clear . Then, once the cause and triggers are understood, long-term medications will be prescribed to reduce the inflammation in your child's airways that leads to symptoms and they are as follows : : Corticosteroids are a class of drug that lowers inflammation in the body. Careful planning and avoiding asthma triggers can help prevent asthma attacks. Consider the following preventive measures : Use air conditioner as it helps reduce the amount of airborne pollen from trees, grasses and weeds that finds its way indoors Encourage your child to be active as regular activity can help the lungs to work more efficiently It can be stressful to help your child manage asthma but you need to be the support system for your child and focus attention on what your child can do, not on limitations. Make treatment a regular part of life and get help, when necessary. Is Wheezing In Children A Sign Of Asthma?

This medicine should only be used for short periods of time, usually for a total of less than 10 days. This combination is not used for osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis. Hydrocodone is a narcotic analgesic that acts on the central nervous system to relieve pain. If hydrocodone is used for a long time, it may become habit-forming (causing mental or physical dependence). However, people who have continuing pain should not let the fear of dependence keep them from using narcotics to relieve their pain. Mental dependence (addiction) is not likely to occur when narcotics are used for this purpose. Physical dependence may lead to withdrawal side effects when you stop taking the medicine. Since hydrocodone and ibuprofen combination is only used for short-term (10 days or less) relief of pain, physical dependence will probably not occur. Ibuprofen is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that is used in this combination to relieve inflammation, swelling, and pain. This medicine is available only under a restricted distribution program called the Opioid Analgesic REMS (Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy) program.

It contains the active ingredient, prochlorperazine (as prochlorperazine maleate). It is used to treat nausea associated with migraine (throbbing headache, usually affecting one side of the head, and often accompanied by nausea, vomiting and sensitivity to light). Ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions about why this medicine has been selected for you. Prochlorperazine belongs to a group of medicines called phenothiazines. It helps to correct chemical imbalances in the brain, allowing it to function correctly. These chemicals may also affect the parts of the brain which control nausea (feeling sick) and vomiting. APO-Prochlorperazine Nausea Relief tablets should not be given to adolescents or children under 18 years of age. Do not take this medicine if you have in the past experienced jaundice (yellow skin and/or eyes) or problems with your blood cells, after taking prochlorperazine or similar medicines called phenothiazines. This is called a hypersensitivity reaction. Do not take this medicine if you have had an allergic reaction to prochlorperazine, the group of medicines called phenothiazines or any of the ingredients listed at the end of this leaflet. Symptoms of an allergic reaction may include: shortness of breath, wheezing or difficulty breathing, swelling of the face, lips, tongue or other parts of the body; rash, itching or hives on the skin. The expiry date (EXP) printed on the pack has passed. The packaging is torn, shows signs of tampering or it does not look quite right.

Systemic eosinophilia, sometimes presenting with clinical features of vasculitis consistent with Churg-Strauss syndrome, has been reported. These events have been sometimes associated with the reduction of oral corticosteroid therapy ( and ). Most common adverse reactions (incidence ≥5% and greater than placebo listed in descending order of frequency): upper respiratory infection, fever, headache, pharyngitis, cough, abdominal pain, diarrhea, otitis media, influenza, rhinorrhea, sinusitis, otitis ().  To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact Aurobindo Pharma USA, Inc. at 1-866-850-2876 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or Pediatric use information for patients ages 6 to 14 years of age for acute prevention of exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (EIB) is approved for Merck Sharp & Dohme Corp’s montelukast tablet products.  However, due to Merck Sharp & Dohme Corp’s marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product is not labeled with that pediatric information. See 17 for PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION and FDA-approved patient labeling. 2.2 Exercise-Induced Bronchoconstriction (EIB) in Patients 15 Years of Age and Older 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Sections or subsections omitted from the full prescribing information are not listed. Montelukast sodium tablets are indicated for the prophylaxis and chronic treatment of asthma in patients 15 years of age and older. Montelukast sodium tablets are indicated for prevention of exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (EIB) in patients 15 years of age and older. Pediatric use information for patients ages 6 to 14 years of age for acute prevention of exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (EIB) is approved for Merck Sharp & Dohme Corp’s montelukast tablet products. However, due to Merck Sharp & Dohme Corp’s marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product  not labeled with that pediatric information. Montelukast sodium tablets are indicated for the relief of symptoms of seasonal allergic rhinitis in patients 15 years of age and older and perennial allergic rhinitis in patients 15 years of age and older. Montelukast sodium tablets should be taken once daily in the evening. The following dose is recommended: For adults and adolescents 15 years of age and older: one 10 mg tablet. Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients less than 12 months of age with asthma have not been established. There have been no clinical trials in patients with asthma to evaluate the relative efficacy of morning versus evening dosing. The pharmacokinetics of montelukast are similar whether dosed in the morning or evening. Efficacy has been demonstrated for asthma when montelukast was administered in the evening without regard to time of food ingestion. 2.2 Exercise-Induced Bronchoconstriction (EIB) in Patients 15 Years of Age and Older For prevention of EIB, a single 10 mg dose of montelukast sodium tablets should be taken at least 2 hours before exercise. An additional dose of montelukast sodium tablets should not be taken within 24 hours of a previous dose. Patients already taking montelukast sodium tablets daily for another indication (including chronic asthma) should not take an additional dose to prevent EIB. All patients should have available for rescue a short-acting β-agonist. Safety and effectiveness in patients younger than 15 years of age have not been established. Daily administration of montelukast sodium tablets for the chronic treatment of asthma has not been established to prevent acute episodes of EIB. Pediatric use information for patients ages 6 to 14 years of age for acute prevention of exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (EIB) is approved for Merck Sharp & Dohme Corp’s montelukast tablet products.

The time of administration may be individualized to suit patient needs. The following dose for the treatment of symptoms of seasonal allergic rhinitis is recommended: For adults and adolescents 15 years of age and older: one 10 mg tablet. Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients younger than 2 years of age with seasonal allergic rhinitis have not been established. The following dose for the treatment of symptoms of perennial allergic rhinitis is recommended:  For adults and adolescents 15 years of age and older: one 10 mg tablet. Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients younger than 6 months of age with perennial allergic rhinitis have not been established. Patients with both asthma and allergic rhinitis should take only one montelukast sodium tablet dose daily in the evening. are beige, rounded square shaped, film-coated tablets debossed with ‘X’ on one side and ‘54’ on other side. Hypersensitivity to any component of this product. Montelukast sodium is not indicated for use in the reversal of bronchospasm in acute asthma attacks, including status asthmaticus. Patients should be advised to have appropriate rescue medication available. Therapy with montelukast sodium can be continued during acute exacerbations of asthma. Patients who have exacerbations of asthma after exercise should have available for rescue a short-acting inhaled β-agonist. While the dose of inhaled corticosteroid may be reduced gradually under medical supervision, montelukast sodium should not be abruptly substituted for inhaled or oral corticosteroids. Patients with known aspirin sensitivity should continue avoidance of aspirin or non-steroidal anti­-inflammatory agents while taking montelukast sodium. Although montelukast sodium is effective in improving airway function in asthmatics with documented aspirin sensitivity, it has not been shown to truncate bronchoconstrictor response to aspirin and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in aspirin-sensitive asthmatic patients . Neuropsychiatric events have been reported in adult, adolescent, and pediatric patients taking montelukast sodium. Postmarketing reports with montelukast sodium use include agitation, aggressive behavior or hostility, anxiousness, depression,disorientation, disturbance in attention, dream abnormalities, hallucinations, insomnia, irritability, memory impairment, restlessness, somnambulism, suicidal thinking and behavior (including suicide), and tremor. The clinical details of some postmarketing reports involving montelukast sodium appear consistent with a drug-induced effect. Patients and prescribers should be alert for neuropsychiatric events. Patients should be instructed to notify their prescriber if these changes occur. Prescribers should carefully evaluate the risks and benefits of continuing treatment with montelukast sodium if such events occur . Patients with asthma on therapy with montelukast sodium may present with systemic eosinophilia, sometimes presenting with clinical features of vasculitis consistent with Churg-Strauss syndrome, a condition which  often treated with systemic corticosteroid therapy. These events have been sometimes associated with the reduction of oral corticosteroid therapy. Physicians should be alert to eosinophilia, vasculitic rash, worsening pulmonary symptoms, cardiac complications, and/or neuropathy presenting in their patients. A causal association between montelukast sodium and these underlying conditions has not been established . Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. In the following description of clinical trials experience, adverse reactions are listed regardless of causality assessment. The most common adverse reactions (incidence ≥5% and greater than placebo; listed in descending order of frequency) in controlled clinical trials were: upper respiratory infection, fever, headache, pharyngitis, cough, abdominal pain, diarrhea, otitis media, influenza, rhinorrhea, sinusitis, otitis. Adults and Adolescents 15 Years of Age and Older with Asthma Montelukast sodium has been evaluated for safety in approximately 2950 adult and adolescent patients 15 years of age and older in clinical trials. In placebo-controlled clinical trials, the following adverse experiences reported with montelukast sodium occurred in greater than or equal to 1% of patients and at an incidence greater than that in patients treated with placebo: TABLE 1: Adverse Experiences Occurring in ≥1% of Patients with an Incidence Greater than that in Patients Treated with Placebo * Number of patients tested (montelukast sodium and placebo, respectively): ALT and AST, 1935, 1170; pyuria, 1924, 1159. The frequency of less common adverse events was comparable between montelukast sodium and placebo. The safety profile of montelukast sodium, when administered as a single dose for prevention of EIB in adult and adolescent patients 15 years of age and older, was consistent with the safety profile previously described for montelukast sodium. Cumulatively, 569 patients were treated with montelukast sodium for at least 6 months, 480 for one year, and 49 for two years in clinical trials. With prolonged treatment, the adverse experience profile did not significantly change. Adults and Adolescents 15 Years of Age and Older with Seasonal Allergic Rhinitis Montelukast sodium has been evaluated for safety in 2199 adult and adolescent patients 15 years of age and older in clinical trials. Montelukast sodium administered once daily in the morning or in the evening had a safety profile similar to that of placebo. In placebo-controlled clinical trials, the following event was reported with montelukast sodium with a frequency ≥1% and at an incidence greater than placebo: upper respiratory infection, 1.9% of patients receiving montelukast sodium vs. 1.5% of patients receiving placebo. In a 4-week, placebo-controlled clinical study, the safety profile was consistent with that observed in 2-week studies. The incidence of somnolence was similar to that of placebo in all studies. Adults and Adolescents 15 Years of Age and Older with Perennial Allergic Rhinitis Montelukast sodium has been evaluated for safety in 3357 adult and adolescent patients 15 years of age and older with perennial allergic rhinitis of whom 1632 received montelukast sodium in two, 6-week, clinical studies. Montelukast sodium administered once daily had a safety profile consistent with that observed in patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis and similar to that of placebo. In these two studies, the following events were reported with montelukast sodium with a frequency ≥1% and at an incidence greater than placebo: sinusitis, upper respiratory infection, sinus headache, cough, epistaxis, and increased ALT. The incidence of somnolence was similar to that of placebo. The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of montelukast sodium. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Blood and lymphatic system disorders: increased bleeding tendency, thrombocytopenia. Immune system disorders: hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis, hepatic eosinophilic infiltration. Psychiatric disorders: agitation including aggressive behavior or hostility, anxiousness, depression, disorientation, disturbance in attention, dream abnormalities, hallucinations, insomnia, irritability, memory impairment, restlessness, somnambulism, suicidal thinking and behavior (including suicide), and tremor Nervous system disorders: drowsiness, paraesthesia/hypoesthesia, seizures. Cardiac disorders: palpitations. Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders: epistaxis, pulmonary eosinophilia. Gastrointestinal disorders: diarrhea, dyspepsia, nausea, pancreatitis, vomiting. Hepatobiliary disorders: Cases of cholestatic hepatitis, hepatocellular liver-injury, and mixed-pattern liver injury have been reported in patients treated with montelukast sodium. Most of these occurred in combination with other confounding factors, such as use of other medications, or when montelukast sodium was administered to patients who had underlying potential for liver disease such as alcohol use or other forms of hepatitis. Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: angioedema, bruising, erythema multiforme, erythema nodosum, pruritus, Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis, urticaria. Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders: arthralgia, myalgia including muscle cramps. Renal and urinary disorders: enuresis in children. General disorders and administration site conditions: edema. Patients with asthma on therapy with montelukast sodium may present with systemic eosinophilia, sometimes presenting with clinical features of vasculitis consistent with Churg-Strauss syndrome, a condition which is often treated with systemic corticosteroid therapy. These events have been sometimes associated with the reduction of oral corticosteroid therapy. Physicians should be alert to eosinophilia, vasculitic rash, worsening pulmonary symptoms, cardiac complications, and/or neuropathy presenting in their patients . No dose adjustment is needed when montelukast sodium is co-administered with theophylline, prednisone, prednisolone, oral contraceptives, terfenadine, digoxin, warfarin, gemfibrozil, itraconazole, thyroid hormones, sedative hypnotics, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents, benzodiazepines, decongestants, and Cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme inducers . There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, montelukast sodium should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed.No teratogenicity was observed in rats and rabbits at doses approximately 100 and 110 times, respectively, the maximum recommended daily oral dose in adults based on AUCs . During worldwide marketing experience, congenital limb defects have been rarely reported in the offspring of women being treated with montelukast sodium during pregnancy. Most of these women were also taking other asthma medications during their pregnancy. A causal relationship between these events and montelukast sodium has not been established. Studies in rats have shown that montelukast is excreted in milk. It is not known if montelukast is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when montelukast sodium is given to a nursing mother. The safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of 12 months with asthma and 6 months with perennial allergic rhinitis have not been established. The safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of 6 years with exercise-induced bronchoconstriction have not been established. Pediatric use information for patients ages 6 to 14 years of age for acute prevention of exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (EIB) is approved for Merck Sharp & Dohme Corp’s montelukast tablet products. However, due to Merck Sharp & Dohme Corp’s marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product   not labeled with that pediatric information Of the total number of subjects in clinical studies of montelukast, 3.5% were 65 years of age and over, and 0.4% were 75 years of age and over. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out. The pharmacokinetic profile and the oral bioavailability of a single 10 mg oral dose of montelukast are similar in elderly and younger adults. The plasma half-life of montelukast is slightly longer in the elderly. No dosage adjustment in the elderly is required. No dosage adjustment is required in patients with mild-to-moderate hepatic insufficiency No dosage adjustment is recommended in patients with renal insufficiency No specific information is available on the treatment of overdosage with montelukast sodium. In chronic asthma studies, montelukast has been administered at doses up to 200 mg/day to adult patients for 22 weeks and, in short-term studies, up to 900 mg/day to patients for approximately a week without clinically important adverse experiences. In the event of overdose, it is reasonable to employ the usual supportive measures; e.g., remove unabsorbed material from the gastrointestinal tract, employ clinical monitoring, and institute supportive therapy, if required. There have been reports of acute overdosage in postmarketing experience and clinical studies with montelukast sodium. These include reports in adults and children with a dose as high as 1000 mg. The clinical and laboratory findings observed were consistent with the safety profile in adults and pediatric patients. There were no adverse experiences in the majority of overdosage reports. The most frequently occurring adverse experiences were consistent with the safety profile of montelukast sodium and included abdominal pain, somnolence, thirst, headache, vomiting and psychomotor hyperactivity. It is not known whether montelukast is removed by peritoneal dialysis or hemodialysis. Montelukast sodium, the active ingredient in montelukast sodium tablets, is a selective and orally active leukotriene receptor antagonist that inhibits the cysteinyl leukotriene CysLT receptor. Montelukast sodium is described chemically as [-()]-1-[[[1-[3-[2-(7-chloro-2­-quinolinyl)ethenyl]phenyl]-3-[2-(1-hydroxy-1-methylethyl)phenyl]propyl]thio]methyl]cyclopropaneacetic acid, monosodium salt. The molecular formula is CHCINNaOS, and its molecular weight is 608.18. The structural formula is: Montelukast sodium USP is a hygroscopic, optically active, off-white to pale yellow colored powder. Montelukast sodium is freely soluble in ethanol, methanol, and water and practically insoluble in acetonitrile. Each 10 mg film-coated montelukast sodium tablet contains 10.38 mg montelukast sodium USP, which is equivalent to 10 mg of montelukast, and the following inactive ingredients: carnauba wax, croscarmellose sodium, hydroxypropyl cellulose, hypromellose, iron oxide red, iron oxide yellow, lactose monohydrate, magnesium stearate, microcrystalline cellulose, and titanium dioxide. The cysteinyl leukotrienes (LTC, LTD, LTE) are products of arachidonic acid metabolism and are released from various cells, including mast cells and eosinophils. These eicosanoids bind to cysteinyl leukotriene (CysLT) receptors. The CysLT type-1 (CysLT) receptor is found in the human airway (including airway smooth muscle cells and airway macrophages) and on other pro-inflammatory cells (including eosinophils and certain myeloid stem cells). CysLTs have been correlated with the pathophysiology of asthma and allergic rhinitis. In asthma, leukotriene-mediated effects include airway edema, smooth muscle contraction, and altered cellular activity associated with the inflammatory process. In allergic rhinitis, CysLTs are released from the nasal mucosa after allergen exposure during both early- and late-phase reactions and are associated with symptoms of allergic rhinitis. Montelukast is an orally active compound that binds with high affinity and selectivity to the CysLT receptor (in preference to other pharmacologically important airway receptors, such as the prostanoid, cholinergic, or β-adrenergic receptor). Montelukast inhibits physiologic actions of LTD at the CysLT receptor without any agonist activity. Montelukast causes inhibition of airway cysteinyl leukotriene receptors as demonstrated by the ability to inhibit bronchoconstriction due to inhaled LTD in asthmatics. Doses as low as 5 mg cause substantial blockage of LTD-induced bronchoconstriction. In a placebo-controlled, crossover study (n=12), montelukast sodium inhibited early- and late-phase bronchoconstriction due to antigen challenge by 75% and 57%, respectively. The effect of montelukast sodium on eosinophils in the peripheral blood was examined in clinical trials. In patients with asthma aged 2 years and older who received montelukast sodium, a decrease in mean peripheral blood eosinophil counts ranging from 9% to 15% was noted, compared with placebo, over the double-blind treatment periods. In patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis aged 15 years and older who received montelukast sodium, a mean increase of 0.2% in peripheral blood eosinophil counts was noted, compared with a mean increase of 12.5% in placebo-treated patients, over the double-blind treatment periods; this reflects a mean difference of 12.3% in favor of montelukast sodium. The relationship between these observations and the clinical benefits of montelukast noted in the clinical trials is not known . Montelukast is rapidly absorbed following oral administration. After administration of the  10 mg film-coated tablet to fasted adults, the mean peak montelukast plasma concentration (C) is achieved in 3 to 4 hours (T). The mean oral bioavailability is 64%. The oral bioavailability and C are not influenced by a standard meal in the morning. The safety and efficacy of montelukast in patients with asthma were demonstrated in clinical trials in which the 10 mg film-coated tablet formulation was administered in the evening without regard to the time of food ingestion. The safety and efficacy of montelukast in patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis were demonstrated in clinical trials in which the 10 mg film-coated tablet was administered in the morning or evening without regard to the time of food ingestion. The comparative pharmacokinetics of montelukast when administered as two 5 mg chewable tablets versus one 10 mg film-coated tablet have not been evaluated. Montelukast is more than 99% bound to plasma proteins. The steady state volume of distribution of montelukast averages 8 to 11 liters. Studies in rats with radiolabeled montelukast indicate minimal distribution across the blood-brain barrier. In addition, concentrations of radiolabeled material at 24 hours postdose were minimal in all other tissues. Montelukast is extensively metabolized. In studies with therapeutic doses, plasma concentrations of metabolites of montelukast are undetectable at steady state in adults and pediatric patients. studies using human liver microsomes indicate that CYP3A4, 2C8, and 2C9 are involved in the metabolism of montelukast. At clinically relevant concentrations, 2C8 appears to play a major role in the metabolism of montelukast. The plasma clearance of montelukast averages 45 mL/min in healthy adults. Following an oral dose of radiolabeled montelukast, 86% of the radioactivity was recovered in 5-day fecal collections and <0.2% was recovered in urine. Coupled with estimates of montelukast oral bioavailability, this indicates that montelukast and its metabolites are excreted almost exclusively via the bile. In several studies, the mean plasma half-life of montelukast ranged from 2.7 to 5.5 hours in healthy young adults. The pharmacokinetics of montelukast are nearly linear for oral doses up to 50 mg. During once-daily dosing with 10 mg montelukast, there is little accumulation of the parent drug in plasma (14%). Patients with mild-to-moderate hepatic insufficiency and clinical evidence of cirrhosis had evidence of decreased metabolism of montelukast resulting in 41% (90% CI=7%, 85%) higher mean montelukast AUC following a single 10 mg dose. The elimination of montelukast was slightly prolonged compared with that in healthy subjects (mean half-life, 7.4 hours). No dosage adjustment is required in patients with mild-to-moderate hepatic insufficiency. The pharmacokinetics of montelukast sodium in patients with more severe hepatic impairment or with hepatitis have not been evaluated.Since montelukast and its metabolites are not excreted in the urine, the pharmacokinetics of montelukast were not evaluated in patients with renal insufficiency. No dosage adjustment is recommended in these patients.The pharmacokinetics of montelukast are similar in males and females.Pharmacokinetic differences due to race have not been studied.Pharmacokinetic studies evaluated the systemic exposure of the 10 mg film-coated tablets in young adults and adolescents ≥15 years of age.  The plasma concentration profile of montelukast following administration of the 10 mg film-coated tablet is similar in adolescents ≥15 years of age and young adults. The 10 mg film-coated tablet is recommended for use in patients ≥15 years of age. Montelukast sodium has been administered with other therapies routinely used in the prophylaxis and chronic treatment of asthma with no apparent increase in adverse reactions. In drug-interaction studies, the recommended clinical dose of montelukast did not have clinically important effects on the pharmacokinetics of the following drugs: theophylline, prednisone, and prednisolone. Montelukast at a dose of 10 mg once daily dosed to pharmacokinetic steady state, did not cause clinically significant changes in the kinetics of a single intravenous dose of theophylline [predominantly a cytochrome P450 (CYP) 1A2 substrate]. Montelukast at doses of ≥100 mg daily dosed to pharmacokinetic steady state, did not cause any clinically significant change in plasma profiles of prednisone or prednisolone following administration of either oral prednisone or intravenous prednisolone. Oral Contraceptives, Terfenadine, Digoxin, and Warfarin: In drug interaction studies, the recommended clinical dose of montelukast did not have clinically important effects on the pharmacokinetics of the following drugs: oral contraceptives (norethindrone 1 mg/ethinyl estradiol 35 mcg), terfenadine, digoxin, and warfarin. Montelukast at doses of ≥100 mg daily dosed to pharmacokinetic steady state did not significantly alter the plasma concentrations of either component of an oral contraceptive containing norethindrone 1 mg/ethinyl estradiol  35 mcg. Montelukast at a dose of 10 mg once daily dosed to pharmacokinetic steady state did not change the plasma concentration profile of terfenadine (a substrate of CYP3A4) or fexofenadine, the carboxylated metabolite, and did not prolong the QTc interval following coadministration with terfenadine 60 mg twice daily; did not change the pharmacokinetic profile or urinary excretion of immunoreactive digoxin; did not change the pharmacokinetic profile of warfarin (primarily a substrate of CYP2C9, 3A4 and 1A2) or influence the effect of a single 30 mg oral dose of warfarin on prothrombin time or the International Normalized Ratio (INR). Thyroid Hormones, Sedative Hypnotics, Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Benzodiazepines, and Decongestants: Although additional specific interaction studies were not performed, montelukast sodium was used concomitantly with a wide range of commonly prescribed drugs in clinical studies without evidence of clinical adverse interactions. These medications included thyroid hormones, sedative hypnotics, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents, benzodiazepines, and decongestants. Phenobarbital, which induces hepatic metabolism, decreased the area under the plasma concentration curve (AUC) of montelukast approximately 40% following a single 10 mg dose of montelukast. No dosage adjustment for montelukast sodium is recommended. It is reasonable to employ appropriate clinical monitoring when potent CYP enzyme inducers, such as phenobarbital or rifampin, are coadministered with montelukast sodium. Effect of Montelukast on Cytochrome P450 (CYP) Enzymes: Montelukast is a potent inhibitor of CYP2C8 However, data from a clinical drug-drug interaction study involving montelukast and rosiglitazone (a probe substrate representative of drugs primarily metabolized by CYP2C8) in 12 healthy individuals demonstrated that the pharmacokinetics of rosiglitazone are not altered when the drugs are coadministered, indicating that montelukast does not inhibit CYP2C8 Therefore, montelukast is not anticipated to alter the metabolism of drugs metabolized by this enzyme (e.g., paclitaxel, rosiglitazone, and repaglinide). Based on further results in human liver microsomes, therapeutic plasma concentrations of montelukast do not inhibit CYP 3A4, 2C9, 1A2, 2A6, 2C19, or 2D6. studies have shown that montelukast is a substrate of CYP 2C8, 2C9, and 3A4. Co-administration of montelukast with itraconazole, a strong CYP 3A4 inhibitor, resulted in no significant increase in the systemic exposure of montelukast. Data from a clinical drug-drug interaction study involving montelukast and gemfibrozil (an inhibitor of both CYP 2C8 and 2C9) demonstrated that gemfibrozil, at a therapeutic dose, increased the systemic exposure of montelukast by 4.4-fold. Co-administration of itraconazole, gemfibrozil, and montelukast did not further increase the systemic exposure of montelukast. Based on available clinical experience, no dosage adjustment of montelukast is required upon co-administration with gemfibrozil . 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility No evidence of tumorigenicity was seen in carcinogenicity studies of either 2 years in Sprague-Dawley rats or 92 weeks in mice at oral gavage doses up to 200 mg/kg/day or 100 mg/kg/day, respectively. The estimated exposure in rats was approximately 120 and 75 times the AUC for adults and children, respectively, at the maximum recommended daily oral dose. The estimated exposure in mice was approximately 45 and 25 times the AUC for adults and children, respectively, at the maximum recommended daily oral dose. Montelukast demonstrated no evidence of mutagenic or clastogenic activity in the following assays: the microbial mutagenesis assay, the V-79 mammalian cell mutagenesis assay, the alkaline elution assay in rat hepatocytes, the chromosomal aberration assay in Chinese hamster ovary cells, and in the mouse bone marrow chromosomal aberration assay. In fertility studies in female rats, montelukast produced reductions in fertility and fecundity indices at an oral dose of 200 mg/kg (estimated exposure was approximately 70 times the AUC for adults at the maximum recommended daily oral dose). No effects on female fertility or fecundity were observed at an oral dose of 100 mg/kg (estimated exposure was approximately 20 times the AUC for adults at the maximum recommended daily oral dose). Montelukast had no effects on fertility in male rats at oral doses up to 800 mg/kg (estimated exposure was approximately 160 times the AUC for adults at the maximum recommended daily oral dose). No teratogenicity was observed at oral doses up to 400 mg/kg/day and 300 mg/kg/day in rats and rabbits, respectively. These doses were approximately 100 and 110 times the maximum recommended daily oral dose in adults, respectively, based on AUCs. Montelukast crosses the placenta following oral dosing in rats and rabbits . Adults and Adolescents 15 Years of Age and Older with Asthma Clinical trials in adults and adolescents 15 years of age and older demonstrated there is no additional clinical benefit to montelukast doses above 10 mg once daily. The efficacy of montelukast sodium for the chronic treatment of asthma in adults and adolescents 15 years of age and older was demonstrated in two (U.S. and Multinational) similarly designed, randomized, 12-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials in 1576 patients (795 treated with montelukast sodium, 530 treated with placebo, and 251 treated with active control). The median age was 33 years (range 15 to 85); 56.8% were females and 43.2% were males. The ethnic/racial distribution in these studies was 71.6% Caucasian, 17.7% Hispanic, 7.2% other origins and 3.5% Black. Patients had mild or moderate asthma and were non­-smokers who required approximately 5 puffs of inhaled β-agonist per day on an “as-needed” basis. The patients had a mean baseline percent of predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV) of 66% (approximate range, 40 to 90%). The co-primary endpoints in these trials were FEV and daytime asthma symptoms. In both studies after 12 weeks, a random subset of patients receiving montelukast sodium was switched to placebo for an additional 3 weeks of double-blind treatment to evaluate for possible rebound effects. The results of the U.S. trial on the primary endpoint, morning FEV, expressed as mean percent change from baseline averaged over the 12-week treatment period, are shown in FIGURE 2. Compared with placebo, treatment with one montelukast 10 mg tablet daily in the evening resulted in a statistically significant increase in FEV percent change from baseline (13%-change in the group treated with montelukast sodium vs. 4.2%-change in the placebo group, p<0.001); the change from baseline in FEV for montelukast sodium was 0.32 liters compared with 0.1 liters for placebo, corresponding to a between-group difference of 0.22 liters (p<0.001, 95% CI 0.17 liters, 0.27 liters). The results of the Multinational trial on FEV were similar. The effect of montelukast sodium on other primary and secondary endpoints, represented by the Multinational study is shown in TABLE 2. Results on these endpoints were similar in the U.S. study. TABLE 2: Effect of Montelukast Sodium on Primary and Secondary Endpoints in a Multinational Placebo-controlled Trial (ANOVA Model) Both studies evaluated the effect of montelukast sodium on secondary outcomes, including asthma attack (utilization of health-care resources such as an unscheduled visit to a doctor’s office, emergency room, or hospital; or treatment with oral, intravenous, or intramuscular corticosteroid), and use of oral corticosteroids for asthma rescue. In the Multinational study, significantly fewer patients (15.6% of patients) on montelukast sodium experienced asthma attacks compared with patients on placebo (27.3%, p < 0.001). In the U.S. study, 7.8% of patients on montelukast sodium and 10.3% of patients on placebo experienced asthma attacks, but the difference between the two treatment groups was not significant (p = 0.334). In the Multinational study, significantly fewer patients (14.8% of patients) on montelukast sodium were prescribed oral corticosteroids for asthma rescue compared with patients on placebo (25.7%, p < 0.001). In the U.S. study, 6.9% of patients on montelukast sodium and 9.9% of patients on placebo were prescribed oral corticosteroids for asthma rescue, but the difference between the two treatment groups was not significant (p = 0.196). In each placebo-controlled trial in adults, the treatment effect of montelukast sodium, measured by daily diary card parameters, including symptom scores, ""as-needed"" β-agonist use, and PEFR measurements, was achieved after the first dose and was maintained throughout the dosing interval (24 hours). No significant change in treatment effect was observed during continuous once-daily evening administration in non­-placebo-controlled extension trials for up to one year. Withdrawal of montelukast sodium in asthmatic patients after 12 weeks of continuous use did not cause rebound worsening of asthma. Effects in Patients on Concomitant Inhaled Corticosteroids Separate trials in adults evaluated the ability of montelukast sodium to add to the clinical effect of inhaled corticosteroids and to allow inhaled corticosteroid tapering when used concomitantly. One randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trial (n=226) enrolled adults with stable asthma with a mean FEV of approximately 84% of predicted who were previously maintained on various inhaled corticosteroids (delivered by metered-dose aerosol or dry powder inhalers). The median age was 41.5 years (range 16 to 70); 52.2% were females and 47.8% were males. The ethnic/racial distribution in this study was 92% Caucasian, 3.5% Black, 2.2% Hispanic, and 2.2% Asian. The types of inhaled corticosteroids and their mean baseline requirements included beclomethasone dipropionate (mean dose, 1203 mcg/day), triamcinolone acetonide (mean dose, 2004 mcg/day), flunisolide (mean dose, 1971 mcg/day), fluticasone propionate (mean dose, 1083 mcg/day), or budesonide (mean dose, 1192 mcg/day). Some of these inhaled corticosteroids were non-U.S.-approved formulations, and doses expressed may not be ex-actuator. The pre-study inhaled corticosteroid requirements were reduced by approximately 37% during a 5- to 7-week placebo run-in period designed to titrate patients toward their lowest effective inhaled corticosteroid dose. Treatment with montelukast sodium resulted in a further 47% reduction in mean inhaled corticosteroid dose compared with a mean reduction of 30% in the placebo group over the 12-week active treatment period (p≤0.05). It is not known whether the results of this study can be generalized to patients with asthma who require higher doses of inhaled corticosteroids or systemic corticosteroids. In another randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trial (n=642) in a similar population of adult patients previously maintained, but not adequately controlled, on inhaled corticosteroids (beclomethasone 336 mcg/day), the addition of montelukast sodium to beclomethasone resulted in statistically significant improvements in FEV compared with those patients who were continued on beclomethasone alone or those patients who were withdrawn from beclomethasone and treated with montelukast or placebo alone over the last 10 weeks of the 16-week, blinded treatment period. Patients who were randomized to treatment arms containing beclomethasone had statistically significantly better asthma control than those patients randomized to montelukast sodium alone or placebo alone as indicated by FEV, daytime asthma symptoms, PEFR, nocturnal awakenings due to asthma, and “as-needed” β-agonist requirements. In adult patients with asthma with documented aspirin sensitivity, nearly all of whom were receiving concomitant inhaled and/or oral corticosteroids, a 4-week, randomized, parallel-group trial (n=80) demonstrated that montelukast sodium, compared with placebo, resulted in significant improvement in parameters of asthma control. The magnitude of effect of montelukast sodium in aspirin-sensitive patients was similar to the effect observed in the general population of asthma patients studied. The effect of montelukast sodium on the bronchoconstrictor response to aspirin or other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in aspirin-sensitive asthmatic patients has not been evaluated Exercise-Induced Bronchoconstriction (Adults and Adolescents 15 years of age and older) The efficacy of montelukast, 10 mg, when given as a single dose 2 hours before exercise for the prevention of EIB was investigated in three (U.S. and Multinational), randomized, double-blind, placebo­-controlled crossover studies that included a total of 160 adult and adolescent patients 15 years of age and older with EIB. Exercise challenge testing was conducted at 2 hours, 8.5 or 12 hours, and 24 hours following administration of a single dose of study drug (montelukast 10 mg or placebo). The primary endpoint was the mean maximum percent fall in FEV following the 2 hours post-dose exercise challenge in all three studies (Study A, Study B, and Study C). In Study A, a single dose of montelukast 10 mg demonstrated a statistically significant protective benefit against EIB when taken 2 hours prior to exercise. Some patients were protected from EIB at 8.5 and 24 hours after administration; however, some patients were not. The results for the mean maximum percent fall at each timepoint in Study A are shown in TABLE 3 and are representative of the results from the other two studies.  TABLE 3: Mean Maximum Percent Fall in FEV Following Exercise Challenge in Study A (N=47) ANOVA Model Time of exercise challengefollowing medication administrationTreatment difference % for Montelukast Sodium versus Placebo (95% CI)* Pediatric use information for patients ages 6 to 14 years of age for acute prevention of exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (EIB) is approved for Merck Sharp & Dohme Corp’s montelukast tablet products. However, due to Merck Sharp & Dohme Corp’s marketing exclusivity rights, this drug product   The efficacy of montelukast sodium for prevention of EIB in patients below 6 years of age has not been established. Daily administration of montelukast sodium for the chronic treatment of asthma has not been established to prevent acute episodes of EIB.   In a 12-week, randomized, double-blind, parallel group study of 110 adult and adolescent asthmatics 15 years of age and older, with a mean baseline FEV percent of predicted of 83% and with documented exercise-induced exacerbation of asthma, treatment with montelukast, 10 mg, once daily in the evening, resulted in a statistically significant reduction in mean maximal percent fall in FEV and mean time to recovery to within 5% of the pre-exercise FEV. Exercise challenge was conducted at the end of the dosing interval (i.e., 20 to 24 hours after the preceding dose). This effect was maintained throughout the 12-week treatment period indicating that tolerance did not occur. Montelukast sodium did not, however, prevent clinically significant deterioration in maximal percent fall in FEV after exercise (i.e., ≥20% decrease from pre-exercise baseline) in 52% of patients studied. In a separate crossover study in adults, a similar effect was observed after two once-daily 10 mg doses of montelukast. In pediatric patients 6 to 14 years of age, using the 5 mg chewable tablet, a 2-day crossover study demonstrated effects similar to those observed in adults when exercise challenge was conducted at the end of the dosing interval (i.e., 20 to 24 hours after the preceding dose). The efficacy of montelukast sodium tablets for the treatment of seasonal allergic rhinitis was investigated in 5 similarly designed, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo- and active-controlled (loratadine) trials conducted in North America. The 5 trials enrolled a total of 5029 patients, of whom 1799 were treated with montelukast sodium tablets. Patients were 15 to 82 years of age with a history of seasonal allergic rhinitis, a positive skin test to at least one relevant seasonal allergen, and active symptoms of seasonal allergic rhinitis at study entry. The period of randomized treatment was 2 weeks in 4 trials and 4 weeks in one trial. The primary outcome variable was mean change from baseline in daytime nasal symptoms score (the average of individual scores of nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, nasal itching, sneezing) as assessed by patients on a 0 to 3 categorical scale. Four of the five trials showed a significant reduction in daytime nasal symptoms scores with montelukast 10 mg tablets compared with placebo. The results of one trial are shown below. The median age in this trial was 35 years (range 15 to 81); 65.4% were females and 34.6% were males. The ethnic/racial distribution in this study was 83.1% Caucasian, 6.4% other origins, 5.8% Black, and 4.8% Hispanic. The mean changes from baseline in daytime nasal symptoms score in the treatment groups that received montelukast sodium tablets, loratadine, and placebo are shown in TABLE 5. The remaining three trials that demonstrated efficacy showed similar results.  TABLE 5: Effects of Montelukast Sodium on Daytime Nasal Symptoms Score* in a Placebo- and Active-controlled Trial in Patients with Seasonal Allergic Rhinitis (ANCOVA Model) Difference Between Treatment and Placebo (95% CI) Least-Squares Mean Average of individual scores of nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, nasal itching, sneezing as assessed by patients on a 0 to 3 categorical scale. Statistically different from placebo (p≤0.001). The study was not designed for statistical comparison between montelukast sodium and the active control (loratadine).   The efficacy of montelukast sodium tablets for the treatment of perennial allergic rhinitis was investigated in 2 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies conducted in North America and Europe. The two studies enrolled a total of 3357 patients, of whom 1632 received montelukast 10 mg tablets. Patients 15 to 82 years of age with perennial allergic rhinitis as confirmed by history and a positive skin test to at least one relevant perennial allergen (dust mites, animal dander, and/or mold spores), who had active symptoms at the time of study entry, were enrolled. In the study in which efficacy was demonstrated, the median age was 35 years (range 15 to 81); 64.1% were females and 35.9% were males. The ethnic/racial distribution in this study was 83.2% Caucasian, 8.1% Black, 5.4% Hispanic, 2.3% Asian, and 1% other origins. Montelukast 10 mg tablets once daily was shown to significantly reduce symptoms of perennial allergic rhinitis over a 6-week treatment period (TABLE 6); in this study the primary outcome variable was mean change from baseline in daytime nasal symptoms score (the average of individual scores of nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, and sneezing). TABLE 6: Effects of Montelukast Sodium on Daytime Nasal Symptoms Score* in a Placebo-controlled Trial in Patients with Perennial Allergic Rhinitis (ANCOVA Model) Difference Between Treatment and Placebo (95% CI) Least-Squares Mean Average of individual scores of nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, sneezing as assessed by patients on a 0 to 3 categorical scale. Statistically different from placebo (p≤0.001). The other 6-week study evaluated montelukast 10 mg (n=626), placebo (n=609), and an active-control (cetirizine 10 mg; n=120). The primary analysis compared the mean change from baseline in daytime nasal symptoms score for montelukast sodium vs. placebo over the first 4 weeks of treatment; the study was not designed for statistical comparison between montelukast sodium and the active-control. The primary outcome variable included nasal itching in addition to nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, and sneezing. The estimated difference between montelukast sodium and placebo was -0.04 with a 95% CI of (-0.09, 0.01). The estimated difference between the active-control and placebo was -0.1 with a 95% CI of (-0.19, -0.01). are beige, rounded square shaped, film-coated tablets debossed with ‘X’ on one side and ‘54’ on other side.         Bottles of 30                                                               NDC 65862-574-30        Bottles of 90                                                               NDC 65862-574-90        Bottles of 10000                                                         NDC 65862-574-19        Cartons of 100 (10 x 10) Unit-dose Tablets                NDC 65862-574-10 20° to 25°C (68° to 77°F) [see USP Controlled Room Temperature].

Patients should be advised to take montelukast sodium daily as prescribed, even when they are asymptomatic, as well as during periods of worsening asthma, and to contact their physicians if their asthma is not well controlled. Patients should be advised that oral montelukast sodium is not for the treatment of acute asthma attacks. They should have appropriate short-acting inhaled β-agonist medication available to treat asthma exacerbations. Patients who have exacerbations of asthma after exercise should be instructed to have available for rescue a short-acting inhaled β-agonist. Daily administration of montelukast sodium for the chronic treatment of asthma has not been established to prevent acute episodes of EIB. Patients should be advised that, while using montelukast sodium, medical attention should be sought if short-acting inhaled bronchodilators are needed more often than usual, or if more than the maximum number of inhalations of short-acting bronchodilator treatment prescribed for a 24-hour period are needed. Patients receiving montelukast sodium should be instructed not to decrease the dose or stop taking any other anti-asthma medications unless instructed by a physician. Patients should be instructed to notify their physician if neuropsychiatric events occur while using montelukast sodium. Patients with known aspirin sensitivity should be advised to continue avoidance of aspirin or non­-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents while taking montelukast sodium.

Here's What It Could Mean Many conditions can cause this stuck-in-a-vise feeling. Feeling tightness in your chest under normal conditions is already stressful—six months ago, your immediate reaction might have been to suspect a heart attack. But during a global pandemic, an onset of chest tightness will probably make you wonder if you've contracted the . This is unfortunately a reasonable concern: According to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), one of the more alarming symptoms of COVID-19 is pressure in your chest. In fact, if you're experiencing persistent pain and pressure in your chest, the CDC classifies that as an emergency warning sign, and advises that you seek medical attention immediately. Something else the CDC says, whether you have tightness in your chest or not: If you think you may have been exposed to COVID-19 and have developed any symptoms, like a cough, fever, or shortness or breath, you should contact a health care provider for medical advice right away. With all that said, while COVID-19 is likely top of mind for you right now, there are numerous other health conditions that can make you feel that tightness in your chest. Some of them as serious as a heart attack, while others are nowhere near that dire. That said, you should always seek medical attention when you're experiencing tightness in your chest. “I always tell people that, no matter what, if you are having chest tightness, you need to see your doctor. It’s never really normal,” Dr. Haythe tells SELF. But there’s a big difference in urgency when it comes to acid-reflux-induced chest tightness because you ate a bunch of spicy nachos, and tightness that’s due to something like a heart issue, COVID-19, or pulmonary embolism. A lot of how you handle when to see a doctor depends on what you already know about your health, Dr. Haythe says. You can read me about that at the bottom of this post. Meanwhile, in order to know when chest tightness is an emergency, you have to understand a little bit about the conditions most likely to bring on this symptom. Here are some of health issues that often cause chest tightness to alert you that something’s up, plus information about when to reach out to doctor down below. Since the new coronavirus is undoubtedly is on everyone's minds right now, let's just talk about it one more time to make sure you know all the basics about symptoms and what to do if you think you might have it. , the most typical symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, cough, and shortness of breath. These typically present between 2 and 14 days after you've been exposed to the virus. For many people, one or several of these symptoms will be the extent of their experience with this new virus; if you have only fever and a cough without other symptoms, you can typically just manage that at home (and consider yourself lucky). But for a subset of other people, the symptoms can be much, much worse—potentially leading to hospitalization, ventilation (having to be put on a respirator to help your lungs function), or death. As we mentioned above, if you're experiencing symptoms of COVID-19 and think you've been exposed, you should reach out to your health care provider for instructions about what to do—many doctors are advising that people try to take care of themselves at home if their symptoms are mild, instead of rushing to the hospital for testing, which can overload your local health care system and potentially expose more people to the virus. Either way, call your doctor to find out whether you fall into that category. We've published some additional resources that might help: , as well as How to Know If You Need to Go to the E.R. With Coronavirus, in case they are helpful. Feeling tightness in your chest is a warning sign that your symptoms are becoming more severe—like by possibly developing into a pneumonia—and that you need medical attention immediately. That also goes for some other red flag symptoms, including trouble breathing, confusion or inability to rouse, and bluish lips or face, according to the CDC. See the for more information. Experiencing at some point in life is part of being human. Right now, though, in the middle of a global pandemic, it's likely something that almost everyone around you is dealing with to some degree, yourself included. Various anxiety issues can manifest with physical symptoms, such as a . But you should know that panic attacks in particular can lead to feelings of chest tightness and pain. Great. Certainly doesn't make this whole situation any easier, does it? Panic attacks are bouts of acute fear that usually come on suddenly and can be completely debilitating. They can cause a range of symptoms like terror over the loss of control, sweating, trembling, and trouble breathing, according to the . The chest tightness is linked to that last one. The rapid breathing that typically comes along with panic attacks can escalate to the point that you’re hyperventilating, or breathing too quickly and deeply, according to the . If you’re not expelling as much air from your lungs as usual, you may feel a sense of tightness and discomfort in your chest, Raymond Casciari, M.D., a pulmonologist at St. Joseph Hospital in Orange, California, tells SELF. This can be so intense that it might make you think . Or, if you're particularly concerned about the new coronavirus, it might make you wonder if you're dealing with that. If you can't tell if it's anxiety or coronavirus, see the . If you're still not sure, seek medical attention by reaching out to your doctor, who can help you figure out what's going on. Meanwhile, if it turns out that you're actually dealing with pandemic-induced anxiety, you might find this helpful: What to Do If Your Anxiety About Coronavirus Feels Overwhelming. screws with the passages that transport air into your lungs to supply your body with oxygen. If you have asthma, encountering certain triggers can cause these airways to misbehave more than the most rambunctious of toddlers, and may cause you to feel a tightness in your chest. Exposure to a trigger like pet dander, , mold, cold air, or even can cause your airways to swell, making the muscles around them tighten, according to the . At the same time, your panicky airways pump out more mucus to try to help the situation. (: Mucus is supposed to ensnare any dangerous substances you’ve inhaled so they’re easier to cough out.) This cascading series of events can lead to chest tightness because when your airways constrict, you can’t get as much air in and out as usual, Dr. Casciari says. This difficulty inhaling and exhaling can make your chest feel tight from built-up pressure, he explains. Beyond that shortness of breath, if you have asthma-induced chest tightness, you may also experience (a high-pitched noise when you breathe), coughing, and trouble sleeping, according to the . This condition, also known as gastroesophageal reflux (GER), happens when bitter acid from your stomach basically trespasses and goes into your esophagus, where it doesn’t belong, according to the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK). If you get mild acid reflux at least twice a week or more severe instances of it at least once a week, you might have (GERD), the more intense form of this condition. No matter the severity of your case, when your stomach acid bubbles up into your esophagus, the irritation can cause the tight, burning, painful sensation in your chest that you may know as . You may also be able to taste food or stomach acid way back in your mouth and experience additional symptoms like bad breath, nausea and vomiting, a hard time swallowing, respiratory problems, and the erosion of your over time due to all that acid, according to the . There’s a fancy name for this—pneumothorax—and it happens when air seeps into the space between your lung and chest wall, according to the . This air then applies pressure to the outside of your lung, forcing it to collapse. Among other causes, your lung can collapse because of something like a chest injury or a lung disease such as pneumonia or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (, this is a long-term lung disease that most often happens because of smoking), the explains. Whatever the reason, the main symptoms of a collapsed lung are sudden chest pain and shortness of breath. The pain tends to be pretty sharp and located in the area where the lung has collapsed, and in some cases, people register it as chest tightness instead, Dr. Casciari says. A pulmonary embolism happens when something blocks one of the arteries in your lungs that transports blood, the explains. That something is usually a blood clot that, after forming in your legs (this is called ), broke off and traveled to your lungs. Symptoms of a pulmonary embolism can change depending on the size of the clot and how much of your lung it’s affecting. Chest pain and tightness that won’t go away even when you take it easy are one common sign, according to the . A pulmonary embolism might actually kill parts of your lungs, making it harder than usual to breathe, , M.D., codirector of the Women's Center for Cardiovascular Health at Columbia University Irving Medical Center and cardiologist at NewYork-Presbyterian/Columbia, tells SELF. This can lead to a tight-feeling, painful chest. Other symptoms generally include out-of-the-blue that intensifies when you push yourself physically and a cough that may be bloody. You should also keep an eye out for issues like fever, heavy , dizziness, and leg pain or swelling. Okay, sure, having chest tightness signal that you’re having a heart attack or angina, which is chest pain caused by reduced blood flow to your heart (and a possible warning of a future heart attack), per the . But if you’re an otherwise healthy person, it’s more likely that your chest tightness is due to something less serious like acid reflux, Dr. Haythe says. Still, let’s go over the basics. Symptoms of and a are pretty similar. They usually include pain, squeezing, pressure, or tightness in your chest, pain in your arms, neck, jaw, shoulder, or back, nausea, fatigue, shortness of breath, sweating, and dizziness. The chest tightness comes from the fact that your heart isn’t getting enough blood, Dr. Haythe explains, so it’s setting off alarm bells to alert you to the emergency. Again, if you’re healthy and young, it’s unlikely that your chest discomfort is due to a serious heart problem. That doesn’t mean you can just put off persistent chest tightness, though. Bottom line: You should talk to your doctor about chest tightness, no matter how it presents, but there are a few red flags that you need to seek help immediately. For example, if you know you have and your chest tightness gets better when you use your prescribed medication, you can consider checking in with your doctor in a few days, Dr. Casciari says. Having means you shouldn’t need to use your short-acting rescue medications often. Even if your symptoms respond to the drugs, this could be a sign that your needs tweaking. But if your chest tightness and other asthma symptoms aren’t getting better in response to your medications, you may need to go to the emergency room. Another possibility is that you’re aware that you have panic attacks, but you don’t know how to stop them. Totally normal—this is not something many people can overcome on their own. Treatment methods like may help, and many drugs, like selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor , are meant to relieve panic attack symptoms, according to the . When you’re less sure about what exactly is going on, you can glean clues from when your chest tightness happens and any symptoms that occur with it. If you get burning chest tightness like clockwork after you eat certain foods and it’s especially prone to striking at night, you probably don’t need to rush to the doctor super concerned. But for comfort’s sake, see your doctor soon and ask if you may have acid reflux that’s causing heartburn. If you do, like antacids to neutralize your stomach acid may help. Other symptoms are more worrisome, Dr. Haythe says. If you’re suddenly having chest tightness that sticks around whether you’re exerting yourself or resting, shortness of breath, or pain happening in parts of your body like your jaw and shoulder, get to the emergency room immediately. We can’t diagnose you through the screen, especially since so many things can cause this combination of symptoms, but that could point to an issue like a collapsed lung, pulmonary embolism, or heart problem. Or if you've been experiencing other symptoms of coronavirus, like fever and a cough, and then you also develop persistent chest pain or tightness in your chest, that's a sign you need to seek help immediately. Of course, these are loose guidelines. No matter when your chest tightness happens or how intense it feels, seek medical help if you’re concerned. A few of your most important organs are packed in there, so it’s okay to play it safe. How to Know If You Need to Go to the ER For Coronavirus Korin is a former New Yorker who now lives at the beach.

It belongs to the group of medicines called narcotic analgesics (pain medicines). Butorphanol acts on the central nervous system (CNS) to relieve pain. When butorphanol is used for a long time, it may become habit-forming, causing mental or physical dependence. However, people who have continuing pain should not let the fear of dependence keep them from using narcotics to relieve their pain. Mental dependence (addiction) is not likely to occur when narcotics are used for this purpose. Physical dependence may lead to withdrawal side effects if treatment is stopped suddenly. However, severe withdrawal side effects can usually be prevented by gradually reducing the dose over a period of time before treatment is stopped completely. This medicine is available only under a restricted distribution program called the Opioid Analgesic REMS (Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy) program. This product is available in the following dosage forms: In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make.

Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully. Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of butorphanol nasal spray in the pediatric population. Safety and efficacy have not been established. Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of butorphanol nasal spray in the elderly. However, elderly patients may be more sensitive to the effects of this medicine than younger adults, and are more likely to have age-related liver, kidney, heart, or lung problems, which may require caution and an adjustment in the dose for patients receiving butorphanol nasal spray. There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding. Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary.

If asthma symptoms arise in the period between doses, an inhaled, short-acting beta-agonist should be taken for immediate relief. Patients 18 Years of Age and Older: For patients 18 years of age and older, the recommended starting dosage is 360 mcg twice daily. In some adult patients, a starting dose of 180 mcg twice daily may be adequate. The maximum dosage should not exceed 720 mcg twice daily. Patients 6 to 17 Years of Age: The recommended starting dosage is 180 mcg twice daily. In some pediatric patients, a starting dose of 360 mcg twice daily may be appropriate. The maximum dosage should not exceed 360 mcg twice daily. For all patients, it is desirable to titrate to the lowest effective dose after adequate asthma stability is achieved. Improvement in asthma control following inhaled administration of budesonide can occur within 24 hours of initiation of treatment, although maximum benefit may not be achieved for 1 to 2 weeks, or longer. Individual patients will experience a variable onset and degree of symptom relief. If a previously effective dosage regimen of PULMICORT FLEXHALER fails to provide adequate control of asthma, the therapeutic regimen should be re-evaluated and additional therapeutic options (e.g. replacing the lower strength of PULMICORT FLEXHALER with the higher strength or initiating oral corticosteroids) should be considered. PULMICORT FLEXHALER is available as a dry powder for inhalation containing budesonide in the following 2 strengths: 90 mcg and 180 mcg. Each inhaler contains 60 or 120 actuations. The use of PULMICORT FLEXHALER is contraindicated in the following conditions: Primary treatment of status asthmaticus or other acute episodes of asthma where intensive measures are required. Severe hypersensitivity to milk proteins or any ingredients of PULMICORT FLEXHALER [see]. In clinical studies, the development of localized infections of the mouth and pharynx with has occurred in patients treated with PULMICORT FLEXHALER. When such an infection develops, it should be treated with appropriate local or systemic (i.e. oral antifungal) therapy while treatment with PULMICORT FLEXHALER continues, but at times, therapy with PULMICORT FLEXHALER may need to be interrupted. Patients should rinse the mouth after inhalation of PULMICORT FLEXHALER. PULMICORT FLEXHALER is not a bronchodilator and is not indicated for the rapid relief of bronchospasm or other acute episodes of asthma. Patients should be instructed to contact their physician immediately if episodes of asthma not responsive to their usual doses of bronchodilators occur during the course of treatment with PULMICORT FLEXHALER. During such episodes, patients may require therapy with oral corticosteroids. An inhaled short acting beta-agonist, not PULMICORT FLEXHALER, should be used to relieve acute symptoms such as shortness of breath. When prescribing PULMICORT FLEXHALER, the physician must also provide the patient with an inhaled, short-acting beta-agonist (e.g. albuterol) for treatment of acute symptoms, despite regular twice-daily (morning and evening) use of PULMICORT FLEXHALER. 5.3 Hypersensitivity Reactions Including Anaphylaxis Hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis, rash, contact dermatitis, urticaria, angioedema, and bronchospasm have been reported with use of PULMICORT FLEXHALER. Discontinue PULMICORT FLEXHALER if such reactions occur [see]. PULMICORT FLEXHALER contains small amounts of lactose, which contains trace levels of milk proteins. It is possible that cough, wheezing, or bronchospasm may occur in patients who have a severe milk protein allergy [seeand Adverse Reactions, Post-marketing Experience (6.2)]. Patients who are on drugs that suppress the immune system are more susceptible to infection than healthy individuals. Chicken pox and measles, for example, can have a more serious or even fatal course in susceptible children or adults using corticosteroids. In children or adults who have not had these diseases or been properly immunized, particular care should be taken to avoid exposure. How the dose, route, and duration of corticosteroid administration affects the risk of developing a disseminated infection is not known. The contribution of the underlying disease and/or prior corticosteroid treatment to the risk is also not known. If exposed to chicken pox, therapy with varicella zoster immune globulin (VZIG) or pooled intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), as appropriate, may be indicated. If exposed to measles, prophylaxis with pooled intramuscular immunoglobulin (IG) may be indicated. (See the respective package inserts for complete VZIG and IG prescribing information.) If chicken pox develops, treatment with antiviral agents may be considered. The immune responsiveness to varicella vaccine was evaluated in pediatric patients with asthma ages 12 months to 8 years with budesonide inhalation suspension. An open-label, nonrandomized clinical study examined the immune responsiveness to varicella vaccine in 243 asthma patients 12 months to 8 years of age who were treated with budesonide inhalation suspension 0.25 mg to 1 mg daily (n=151) or non-corticosteroid asthma therapy (n=92) (i.e., beta-agonists, leukotriene receptor antagonists, cromones). The percentage of patients developing a seroprotective antibody titer of ≥5.0 (gpELISA value) in response to the vaccination was similar in patients treated with budesonide inhalation suspension (85%), compared to patients treated with non-corticosteroid asthma therapy (90%). No patient treated with budesonide inhalation suspension developed chicken pox as a result of vaccination. Inhaled corticosteroids should be used with caution, if at all, in patients with active or quiescent tuberculosis infection of the respiratory tract, untreated systemic fungal, bacterial, viral or parasitic infections, or ocular herpes simplex. 5.5 Transferring Patients from Systemic Corticosteroid Therapy Particular care is needed for patients who are transferred from systemically active corticosteroids to PULMICORT FLEXHALER because deaths due to adrenal insufficiency have occurred in asthmatic patients during and after transfer from systemic corticosteroids to less systemically available inhaled corticosteroids. After withdrawal from systemic corticosteroids, a number of months are required for recovery of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) function. Patients who have been previously maintained on 20 mg or more per day of prednisone (or its equivalent) may be most susceptible, particularly when their systemic corticosteroids have been almost completely withdrawn. During this period of HPA suppression, patients may exhibit signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency when exposed to trauma, surgery, or infection (particularly gastroenteritis) or other conditions associated with severe electrolyte loss. Although PULMICORT FLEXHALER may provide control of asthma symptoms during these episodes, in recommended doses it supplies less than normal physiological amounts of glucocorticoid systemically and does NOT provide the mineralocorticoid activity that is necessary for coping with these emergencies. During periods of stress or a severe asthma attack, patients who have been withdrawn from systemic corticosteroids should be instructed to resume oral corticosteroids (in large doses) immediately and to contact their physicians for further instruction. These patients should also be instructed to carry a medical identification card indicating that they may need supplementary systemic corticosteroids during periods of stress or a severe asthma attack. Patients requiring oral corticosteroids should be weaned slowly from systemic corticosteroid use after transferring to PULMICORT FLEXHALER. Prednisone reduction can be accomplished by reducing the daily prednisone dose by 2.5 mg on a weekly basis during therapy with PULMICORT FLEXHALER. Lung function (mean forced expiratory volume in 1 second [FEV] or morning peak expiratory flow [PEF]), beta-agonist use, and asthma symptoms should be carefully monitored during withdrawal of oral corticosteroids. In addition to monitoring asthma signs and symptoms, patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency such as fatigue, lassitude, weakness, nausea and vomiting, and hypotension. Transfer of patients from systemic corticosteroid therapy to PULMICORT FLEXHALER may unmask allergic conditions previously suppressed by the systemic corticosteroid therapy, (e.g., rhinitis, conjunctivitis, eczema, arthritis, eosinophilic conditions). Some patients may experience symptoms of systemically active corticosteroid withdrawal (e.g., joint and/or muscular pain, lassitude, depression) despite maintenance or even improvement of respiratory function. PULMICORT FLEXHALER will often help control asthma symptoms with less suppression of HPA function than therapeutically equivalent oral doses of prednisone. Since budesonide is absorbed into the circulation and can be systemically active at higher doses, the beneficial effects of PULMICORT FLEXHALER in minimizing HPA dysfunction may be expected only when recommended dosages are not exceeded and individual patients are titrated to the lowest effective dose. Since individual sensitivity to effects on cortisol production exists, physicians should consider this information when prescribing PULMICORT FLEXHALER. Because of the possibility of systemic absorption of inhaled corticosteroids, patients treated with PULMICORT FLEXHALER should be observed carefully for any evidence of systemic corticosteroid effects. Particular care should be taken in observing patients postoperatively or during periods of stress for evidence of inadequate adrenal response. It is possible that systemic corticosteroid effects such as hypercorticism and adrenal suppression (including adrenal crisis) may appear in a small number of patients, particularly when budesonide is administered at higher than recommended doses over prolonged periods of time. If such effects occur, the dosage of PULMICORT FLEXHALER should be reduced slowly, consistent with accepted procedures for reducing systemic corticosteroids and for management of asthma symptoms. 5.7 Interactions with Strong Cytochrome P450 3A4 Inhibitors Caution should be exercised when considering the co-administration of PULMICORT FLEXHALER with ketoconazole, and other known strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. ritonavir, atazanavir, clarithromycin, indinavir, itraconazole, nefazodone, nelfinavir, saquinavir, telithromycin) because adverse effects related to increased systemic exposure to budesonide may occur [ee]. Decreases in bone mineral density (BMD) have been observed with long-term administration of products containing inhaled corticosteroids. The clinical significance of small changes in BMD with regard to long-term consequences such as fracture is unknown. Patients with major risk factors for decreased bone mineral content, such as prolonged immobilization, family history of osteoporosis, post menopausal status, tobacco use, advance age, poor nutrition, or chronic use of drugs that can reduce bone mass (e.g, anticonvulsants, oral corticosteroids) should be monitored and treated with established standards of care. Orally inhaled corticosteroids, including budesonide, may cause a reduction in growth velocity when administered to pediatric patients. Monitor the growth of pediatric patients receiving PULMICORT FLEXHALER routinely (e.g., via stadiometry). To minimize the systemic effects of orally inhaled corticosteroids, including PULMICORT FLEXHALER, titrate each patient’s dose to the lowest dosage that effectively controls his/her symptoms [see]. Glaucoma, increased intraocular pressure, and cataracts have been reported following the long-term administration of inhaled corticosteroids, including budesonide. Therefore, close monitoring is warranted in patients with a change in vision or with a history of increased intraocular pressure, glaucoma, and/or cataracts. 5.11 Paradoxical Bronchospasm and Upper Airway Symptoms As with other inhaled asthma medications, PULMICORT FLEXHALER can produce paradoxical bronchospasm, which may be life threatening. If paradoxical bronchospasm occurs following dosing with PULMICORT FLEXHALER, it should be treated immediately with an inhaled, short-acting beta- bronchodilator. PULMICORT FLEXHALER should be discontinued immediately, and alternative therapy should be instituted. 5.12 Eosinophilic Conditions and Churg-Strauss Syndrome In rare cases, patients on inhaled corticosteroids may present with systemic eosinophilic conditions. Some of these patients have clinical features of vasculitis consistent with Churg- Strauss syndrome, a condition that is often treated with systemic corticosteroid therapy. These events usually, but not always, have been associated with the reduction and/or withdrawal of oral corticosteroid therapy following the introduction of inhaled corticosteroids. Physicians should be alert to eosinophilia, vasculitic rash, worsening pulmonary symptoms, cardiac complications, and/or neuropathy presenting in their patients. A causal relationship between budesonide and these underlying conditions has not been established. Systemic and inhaled corticosteroid use may result in the following: infection [see] Hypersensitivity Including Anaphylaxis [see] Immunosuppression [see] Hypercorticism and Adrenal Suppression [see] Reduction in Bone Mineral Density [see] Growth Effects [see (5.9) and Use in Specific Populations (8.4)] Glaucoma and Cataracts [see] Eosinophilic conditions and Churg-Strauss [see] Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The incidence of common adverse reactions in Table 1 is based upon pooled data reported in patients treated with PULMICORT FLEXHALER 180 or 90 mcg in two double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials in which 226 patients (106 females and 120 males) with mild to moderate asthma, previously receiving bronchodilators, inhaled corticosteroids, or both, were treated with PULMICORT FLEXHALER, administered as 360 mcg twice daily for 12 weeks. In these trials, the patients on PULMICORT FLEXHALER had a mean age of 28 years (range 6-80 years) and were predominantly Caucasian (59.7%) and Asian (31.4%). Table 1 includes all adverse reactions (regardless of investigator causality assessment) that occurred at a rate of ≥1% in the PULMICORT FLEXHALER group and more commonly than the placebo group. Table 1 - Adverse Reactions occurring at an incidence of ≥1% and more commonly than placebo in the PULMICORT FLEXHALER group: pooled data from two 12-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical asthma trials in patients 6 years and older Long-Term Safety in Patients 6 years of age and older Non-placebo controlled long-term studies in children (at doses up to 360 mcg daily), and adolescent and adult subjects (at doses up to 720 mcg daily), treated for up to one year with PULMICORT FLEXHALER, revealed a similar pattern and incidence of adverse events. The following adverse reactions occurred in placebo-controlled clinical trials with similar or lower doses with inhaled budesonide via a different PULMICORT dry powder inhaler with an incidence of ≥1% in the budesonide group and were more common than in the placebo group: ≥3%: respiratory infection, sinusitis, headache, pain, back pain, fever. ≥1-3%: neck pain, syncope, abdominal pain, dry mouth, vomiting, weight gain, fracture, myalgia, hypertonia, migraine, ecchymosis, insomnia, infection, taste perversion, voice alteration. Higher doses of inhaled budesonide (800 mcg twice daily) via a different PULMICORT dry powder inhaler resulted in an increased incidence of voice alteration, flu syndrome, dyspepsia, gastroenteritis, nausea, and back pain, compared with doses of 400 mcg twice daily. In a 20-week trial in adult asthmatics who previously required oral corticosteroids, the incidence of adverse reactions was evaluated with 400 mcg twice daily (N=53) and 800 mcg twice daily (N=53) of inhaled budesonide via a different PULMICORT dry powder inhaler and compared with placebo (N=53). In considering these data, the increased average duration of exposure for inhaled budesonide patients (78 days for inhaled budesonide vs. 41 days for placebo) should be taken into account. Adverse reactions, regardless of investigator causality assessment, reported in more than five patients in the budesonide group and which occurred more commonly than the placebo group in decreasing order of frequency include: respiratory infection, sinusitis, headache, oral candidiasis, pain, asthenia, dyspepsia, arthralgia, cough increased, nausea and rhinitis. The following adverse reactions have been reported during post-approval use of PULMICORT FLEXHALER. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. immediate and delayed hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylactic reaction, angioedema, bronchospasm, rash, contact dermatitis, urticaria, and cough, wheezing or bronchospasm in patients with severe milk protein hypersensitivity [see (5.3) and (4)] symptoms of hypocorticism and hypercorticism [see] cataracts, glaucoma, increased intraocular pressure [see] psychiatric symptoms including psychosis, depression, aggressive reactions, irritability, nervousness, restlessness, and anxiety throat irritation skin bruising The main route of metabolism of corticosteroids, including budesonide, is via cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoenzyme 3A4 (CYP3A4). After oral administration of ketoconazole, a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4, the mean plasma concentration of orally administered budesonide increased. Concomitant administration of CYP3A4 may inhibit the metabolism of, and increase the systemic exposure to, budesonide. Caution should be exercised when considering the co-administration of PULMICORT FLEXHALER with long-term ketoconazole and other known strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ritonavir, atazanavir, clarithromycin, indinavir, itraconazole, nefazodone, nelfinavir, saquinavir, telithromycin) [see]. Studies of pregnant women, have not shown that inhaled budesonide increases the risk of abnormalities when administered during pregnancy. The results from a large population-based prospective cohort epidemiological study reviewing data from three Swedish registries covering approximately 99% of the pregnancies from 1995-1997 (i.e., Swedish Medical Birth Registry; Registry of Congenital Malformations; Child Cardiology Registry) indicate no increased risk for congenital malformations from the use of inhaled budesonide during early pregnancy. Congenital malformations were studied in 2014 infants born to mothers reporting the use of inhaled budesonide for asthma in early pregnancy (usually 10-12 weeks after the last menstrual period), the period when most major organ malformations occur. The rate of recorded congenital malformations was similar compared to the general population rate (3.8% vs. 3.5%, respectively). In addition, after exposure to inhaled budesonide, the number of infants born with orofacial clefts was similar to the expected number in the normal population (4 children vs. 3.3, respectively). These same data were utilized in a second study bringing the total to 2534 infants whose mothers were exposed to inhaled budesonide. In this study, the rate of congenital malformations among infants whose mothers were exposed to inhaled budesonide during early pregnancy was not different from the rate for all newborn babies during the same period (3.6%). Despite the animal findings, it would appear that the possibility of fetal harm is remote if the drug is used during pregnancy. Nevertheless, because the studies in humans cannot rule out the possibility of harm, PULMICORT FLEXHALER should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. As with other glucocorticoids, budesonide produced fetal loss, decreased pup weight, and skeletal abnormalities at a subcutaneous dose in rabbits that was approximately 0.3 times the maximum recommended daily inhalation dose in adults on a mcg/m basis and at a subcutaneous dose in rats that was approximately 3 times the maximum recommended daily inhalation dose in adults on a mcg/m basis. No teratogenic or embryocidal effects were observed in rats when budesonide was administered by inhalation at doses up to approximately equivalent to the maximum recommended daily inhalation dose in adults on a mcg/m basis. Experience with oral corticosteroids since their introduction in pharmacologic as opposed to physiologic doses suggests that rodents are more prone to teratogenic effects from corticosteroids than humans. Hypoadrenalism may occur in infants born of mothers receiving corticosteroids during pregnancy. Such infants should be carefully observed. Budesonide, like other corticosteroids, is secreted in human milk. Data with budesonide delivered via dry powder inhaler indicates that the total daily oral dose of budesonide available in breast milk to the infant is approximately 0.3% to 1% of the dose inhaled by the mother [seeClinical Pharmacology, Pharmacokinetics, Special Populations, Nursing Mothers (12.3)]. No studies have been conducted in breastfeeding women specifically with PULMICORT FLEXHALER; however, the dose of budesonide available to the infant in breast milk, as a percentage of the maternal dose, would be expected to be similar. PULMICORT FLEXHALER should be used in nursing women only if clinically appropriate. Prescribers should weigh the known benefits of breastfeeding for the mother and the infant against the potential risks of minimal budesonide exposure in the infant. Dosing considerations include prescription or titration to the lowest clinically effective dose and use of PULMICORT FLEXHALER immediately after breastfeeding to maximize the time interval between dosing and breastfeeding to minimize infant exposure. However, in general, PULMICORT FLEXHALER use should not delay or interfere with infant feeding. In a 12-week pivotal study, 204 patients 6 to 17 years of age were treated with PULMICORT FLEXHALER twice daily [see]. Efficacy results in this age group were similar to those observed in patients 18 years and older. There were no obvious differences in the type or frequency of adverse events reported in this age group compared with patients 18 years of age and older. The safety and effectiveness of PULMICORT FLEXHALER in asthma patients below 6 years of age have not been established. Controlled clinical studies have shown that orally inhaled corticosteroids, including budesonide, may cause a reduction in growth velocity in pediatric patients. This effect has been observed in the absence of laboratory evidence of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis suppression, suggesting that growth velocity is a more sensitive indicator of systemic corticosteroid exposure in pediatric patients than some commonly used tests of HPA-axis function. The long-term effects of this reduction in growth velocity associated with orally inhaled corticosteroids including the impact on final adult height are unknown. The potential for “catch up” growth following discontinuation of treatment with orally inhaled corticosteroids has not been adequately studied. In a study of asthmatic children 5-12 years of age, those treated with inhaled budesonide via a different PULMICORT dry powder inhaler 200 mcg twice daily (n=311) had a 1.1- centimeter reduction in growth compared with those receiving placebo (n=418) at the end of one year; the difference between these two treatment groups did not increase further over three years of additional treatment. By the end of four years, children treated with a different PULMICORT dry powder inhaler and children treated with placebo had similar growth velocities. Conclusions drawn from this study may be confounded by the unequal use of corticosteroids in the treatment groups and inclusion of data from patients attaining puberty during the course of the study. The administration of inhaled budesonide via a different PULMICORT dry-powder inhaler in doses up to 800 mcg/day (mean daily dose 445 mcg/day) or via a pressurized metered-dose inhaler in doses up to 1200 mcg/day (mean daily dose 620 mcg/day) to 216 pediatric patients (age 3 to 11 years) for 2 to 6 years had no significant effect on statural growth compared with non-corticosteroid therapy in 62 matched control patients. However, the long-term effect of inhaled budesonide on growth is not fully known. The growth of pediatric patients receiving orally inhaled corticosteroids, including PULMICORT FLEXHALER, should be monitored (eg, via stadiometry). If a child or adolescent on any corticosteroid appears to have growth suppression, the possibility that he/she is particularly sensitive to this effect should be considered. The potential growth effects of prolonged treatment should be weighed against clinical benefits obtained. To minimize the systemic effects of inhaled corticosteroids, including PULMICORT FLEXHALER, each patient should be titrated to the lowest dose that effectively controls his/her asthma [see]. Of the total number of patients in controlled clinical studies receiving inhaled budesonide, 153 (n=11 treated with PULMICORT FLEXHALER ) were 65 years of age or older and one was age 75 years or older. No overall differences in safety were observed between these patients and younger patients. Clinical studies did not include sufficient numbers of patients aged 65 years and over to determine differences in efficacy between elderly and younger patients. Other reported clinical or medical surveillance experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. Formal pharmacokinetic studies using PULMICORT FLEXHALER have not been conducted in patients with hepatic impairment. However, since budesonide is predominantly cleared by hepatic metabolism, impairment of liver function may lead to accumulation of budesonide in the plasma. Therefore, patients with hepatic disease should be closely monitored. The potential for acute toxic effects following overdose of PULMICORT FLEXHALER is low. If used at excessive doses for prolonged periods, systemic corticosteroid effects such as hypercorticism may occur [seeWarnings and Precautions, Hypercorticism and Adrenal Suppression (5.6)]. Another budesonide-containing dry powder inhaler at 3200 mcg daily administered for 6 weeks caused a significant reduction (27%) in the plasma cortisol response to a 6-hour infusion of ACTH compared with placebo (+1%). The corresponding effect of 10 mg prednisone daily was a 35% reduction in the plasma cortisol response to ACTH. The minimal inhalation lethal dose in mice was 100 mg/kg (approximately 280 times the maximum recommended daily inhalation dose in adults and approximately 330 times the maximum recommended daily inhalation dose in children 6 to 17 years of age on a mcg/m basis). There were no deaths following the administration of an inhalation dose of 68 mg/kg in rats (approximately 380 times the maximum recommended daily inhalation dose in adults and approximately 450 times the maximum recommended daily inhalation dose in children 6 to 17 years of age on a mcg/m basis). The minimal oral lethal dose was 200 mg/kg in mice (approximately 560 times the maximum recommended daily inhalation dose in adults and approximately 670 times the maximum recommended daily inhalation dose in children 6 to 17 years of age on a mcg/m basis) and less than 100 mg/kg in rats (approximately 560 times the maximum recommended daily inhalation dose in adults and approximately 670 times the maximum recommended daily inhalation dose in children 6 to 17 years of age based on a mcg/m basis). Post-marketing experience showed that acute overdose of inhaled budesonide commonly remained asymptomatic. The use of excessive doses (up to 6400 mcg daily) for prolonged periods showed systemic corticosteroid effects such as hypercorticism. Budesonide, the active component of PULMICORT FLEXHALER, is a corticosteroid designated chemically as (RS)-11β, 16α, 17,21-Tetrahydroxypregna-1,4-diene-3,20-dione cyclic 16,17-acetal with butyraldehyde. Budesonide is provided as a mixture of two epimers (22R and 22S). The empirical formula of budesonide is CHO and its molecular weight is 430.5. Its structural formula is: Budesonide is a white to off-white, tasteless, odorless powder that is practically insoluble in water and in heptane, sparingly soluble in ethanol, and freely soluble in chloroform. Its partition coefficient between octanol and water at pH 7.4 is 1.6 x 10. PULMICORT FLEXHALER is an inhalation-driven multi-dose dry powder inhaler containing a formulation of 1 mg per actuation of micronized budesonide and micronized lactose monohydrate which contains trace levels of milk proteins [see ]. Each actuation of PULMICORT FLEXHALER 180 mcg delivers 160 mcg budesonide from the mouthpiece and each actuation of PULMICORT FLEXHALER 90 mcg delivers 80 mcg budesonide from the mouthpiece (based on testing at 60 L/min for 2 sec). Each PULMICORT FLEXHALER 180 mcg contains 120 actuations and each PULMICORT FLEXHALER 90 mcg contains 60 actuations. testing has shown that the dose delivery for PULMICORT FLEXHALER is dependent on airflow through the device, as evidenced by a decrease in the fine particle dose at a flow rate of 30 L/min to a value that is approximately 40-50% of that produced at 60 L/min. At a flow rate of 40 L/min, the fine particle dose is approximately 70% of that produced at 60 L/min. Patient factors such as inspiratory flow rates will also affect the dose delivered to the lungs of patients in actual use [see Patient Information and Instructions for Use (17.11)]. In asthmatic children age 6 to 17 (N=516, FEV 2.29 [0.97– 4.28]) peak inspiratory flow (PIF) through PULMICORT FLEXHALER was 72.5 [19.1 – 103.6] L/min). Inspiratory flows were not measured in the adult pivotal study. Patients should be carefully instructed on the use of this drug product to assure optimal dose delivery. Budesonide is an anti-inflammatory corticosteroid that exhibits potent glucocorticoid activity and weak mineralocorticoid activity. In standard and animal models, budesonide has approximately a 200-fold higher affinity for the glucocorticoid receptor and a 1000-fold higher topical anti-inflammatory potency than cortisol (rat croton oil ear edema assay). As a measure of systemic activity, budesonide is 40 times more potent than cortisol when administered subcutaneously and 25 times more potent when administered orally in the rat thymus involution assay. The clinical significance of this is unknown. The activity of PULMICORT FLEXHALER is due to the parent drug, budesonide. In glucocorticoid receptor affinity studies, the 22R form was two times as active as the 22S epimer. studies indicated that the two forms of budesonide do not interconvert. The precise mechanism of corticosteroid actions on inflammation in asthma is not known. Inflammation is an important component in the pathogenesis of asthma. Corticosteroids have a wide range of inhibitory activities against multiple cell types (e.g., mast cells, eosinophils, neutrophils, macrophages, and lymphocytes) and mediators (e.g., histamine, eicosanoids, leukotrienes, and cytokines) involved in allergic and non-allergic-mediated inflammation. These anti-inflammatory actions of corticosteroids may contribute to their efficacy in asthma. Studies in asthmatic patients have shown a favorable ratio between topical anti-inflammatory activity and systemic corticosteroid effects over a wide range of doses of inhaled budesonide. This is explained by a combination of a relatively high local anti-inflammatory effect, extensive first pass hepatic degradation of orally absorbed drug (85-95%), and the low potency of formed metabolites (see below). To confirm that systemic absorption is not a significant factor in the clinical efficacy of inhaled budesonide, a clinical study in patients with asthma was performed comparing 400 mcg budesonide administered via a pressurized metered-dose inhaler with a tube spacer to 1400 mcg of oral budesonide and placebo. The study demonstrated the efficacy of inhaled budesonide but not orally administered budesonide, even though systemic budesonide exposure was comparable for both treatments, indicating that the inhaled treatment is working locally in the lung. Thus, the therapeutic effect of conventional doses of orally inhaled budesonide are largely explained by its direct action on the respiratory tract. Inhaled budesonide has been shown to decrease airway reactivity in various challenge models, including histamine, methacholine, sodium metabisulfite, and adenosine monophosphate in patients with hyperreactive airways. The clinical relevance of these models is not certain. Pre-treatment with inhaled budesonide 1600 mcg daily (800 mcg twice daily) for 2 weeks reduced the acute (early-phase reaction) and delayed (late-phase reaction) decrease in FEV following inhaled allergen challenge. The effects of inhaled budesonide on the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis were studied in 905 adults and 404 pediatric patients with asthma. For most patients, the ability to increase cortisol production in response to stress, as assessed by cosyntropin (ACTH) stimulation test, remained intact with inhaled budesonide treatment at recommended doses. For adult patients treated with 100, 200, 400, or 800 mcg twice daily for 12 weeks, 4%, 2%, 6%, and 13% respectively, had an abnormal stimulated cortisol response (peak cortisol <14.5 mcg/dL assessed by liquid chromatography following short-cosyntropin test) as compared with 8% of patients treated with placebo. Similar results were obtained in pediatric patients. In another study in adults, doses of 400, 800 and 1600 mcg of inhaled budesonide twice daily for 6 weeks were examined; 1600 mcg twice daily (twice the maximum recommended dose) resulted in a 27% reduction in stimulated cortisol (6-hour ACTH infusion) while 10 mg prednisone resulted in a 35% reduction. In this study, no patient taking doses of 400 and 800 mcg twice daily met the criterion for an abnormal stimulated cortisol response (peak cortisol <14.5 mcg/dL assessed by liquid chromatography) following ACTH infusion. An open-label, long-term follow-up of 1133 patients for up to 52 weeks confirmed the minimal effect on the HPA axis (both basal and stimulated plasma cortisol) of inhaled budesonide when administered at doses ranging from 100 to 800 mcg twice daily. In patients who had previously been oral steroid-dependent, use of inhaled budesonide at doses ranging from 100 to 800 mcg twice daily was associated with higher stimulated cortisol response compared with baseline following 1 year of therapy. After oral administration of budesonide, peak plasma concentration was achieved in about 1 to 2 hours and the absolute systemic availability was 6-13%. In contrast, most of budesonide delivered to the lungs is systemically absorbed. In healthy subjects, 34% of the metered dose was deposited in the lungs (as assessed by plasma concentration method and using a different budesonide containing dry-powder inhaler) with an absolute systemic availability of 39% of the metered dose. Peak steady-state plasma concentrations of budesonide delivered from PULMICORT FLEXHALER in adults with asthma (n=39) occurred at approximately 10 minutes post-dose and averaged 0.6 and 1.6 nmol/L at doses of 180 mcg once daily and 360 mcg twice daily, respectively. In asthmatic patients, budesonide showed a linear increase in AUC and C with increasing dose after both a single dose and repeated dosing of inhaled budesonide. The volume of distribution of budesonide was approximately 3 L/kg. It was 85-90% bound to plasma proteins. Protein binding was constant over the concentration range (1-100 nmol/L) achieved with, and exceeding, recommended doses of PULMICORT FLEXHALER. Budesonide showed little or no binding to corticosteroid binding globulin. Budesonide rapidly equilibrated with red blood cells in a concentration independent manner with a blood/plasma ratio of about 0.8. studies with human liver homogenates have shown that budesonide is rapidly and extensively metabolized. Two major metabolites formed via cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoenzyme 3A4 (CYP3A4) catalyzed biotransformation have been isolated and identified as 16α-hydroxyprednisolone and 6β-hydroxybudesonide. The corticosteroid activity of each of these two metabolites is less than 1% of that of the parent compound. No qualitative differences between the and metabolic patterns have been detected. Negligible metabolic inactivation was observed in human lung and serum preparations. The 22R form of budesonide was preferentially cleared by the liver with systemic clearance of 1.4 L/min vs. 1.0 L/min for the 22S form. The terminal half-life, 2 to 3 hours, was the same for both epimers and was independent of dose. Budesonide was excreted in urine and feces in the form of metabolites. Approximately 60% of an intravenous radiolabeled dose was recovered in the urine. No unchanged budesonide was detected in the urine. No clinically relevant pharmacokinetic differences have been identified due to race, sex, or advanced age. The pharmacokinetics of PULMICORT FLEXHALER in geriatric patients have not been specifically studied. Following intravenous dosing in pediatric patients age 10-14 years, plasma half-life was shorter than in adults (1.5 hours vs. 2.0 hours in adults). In the same population following inhalation of budesonide via a pressurized metered-dose inhaler, absolute systemic availability was similar to that in adults. Peak steady-state plasma concentrations of budesonide delivered via PULMICORT FLEXHALER in children and adolescents with asthma (n=14) occurred at approximately 15 to 30 minutes post-dose and averaged 0.4 and 1.5 nmol/L at doses of 180 mcg once daily and 360 mcg twice daily, respectively. The disposition of budesonide when delivered by inhalation from a dry powder inhaler at doses of 200 or 400 mcg twice daily for at least 3 months was studied in eight lactating women with asthma from 1 to 6 months postpartum. Systemic exposure to budesonide in these women appears to be comparable to that in non-lactating women with asthma from other studies. Breast milk obtained over eight hours post-dose revealed that the maximum concentration of budesonide for the 400 and 800 mcg doses was 0.39 and 0.78 nmol/L, respectively, and occurred within 45 minutes after dosing. The estimated oral daily dose of budesonide from breast milk to the infant is approximately 0.007 and 0.014 mcg/kg/day for the two dose regimens used in this study, which represents approximately 0.3% to 1% of the dose inhaled by the mother. Budesonide levels in plasma samples obtained from five infants at about 90 minutes after breastfeeding (and about 140 minutes after drug administration to the mother) were below quantifiable levels (<0.02 nmol/L in four infants and <0.04 nmol/L in one infant) [see Use In Specific Populations, Nursing Mothers (8.3)]. There are no data regarding the specific use of PULMICORT FLEXHALER in patients with hepatic or renal impairment. Reduced liver function may affect the elimination of corticosteroids. The pharmacokinetics of budesonide were affected by compromised liver function as evidenced by a doubled systemic availability after oral ingestion. The intravenous pharmacokinetics of budesonide were, however, similar in cirrhotic patients and in healthy subjects. Ketoconazole: Ketoconazole, a strong inhibitor of cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoenzyme 3A4 (CYP3A4), the main metabolic enzyme for corticosteroids, increased plasma levels of orally ingested budesonide [see ]. Cimetidine: At recommended doses, cimetidine, a nonspecific inhibitor of CYP enzymes, had a slight but clinically insignificant effect on the pharmacokinetics of oral budesonide. 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility In a 104-week oral study in Sprague-Dawley rats, a statistically significant increase in the incidence of gliomas was observed in male rats receiving an oral dose of 50 mcg/kg/day (approximately 0.3 times the maximum recommended daily inhalation dose in adults and children 6 to 17 years of age respectively, on a mcg/m basis). No tumorigenicity was seen in male rats at oral doses up to 25 mcg/kg (approximately 0.1 and 0.2 times, respectively, the maximum recommended daily inhalation dose in adults and children 6 to 17 years of age, on a mcg/m basis) and in female rats at oral doses up to 50 mc/kg (approximately 0.3 times the maximum recommended daily inhalation doses in adults and children 6 to 17 years of age, respectively, on a mcg/m basis). In two additional two-year studies in male Fischer and Sprague-Dawley rats, budesonide caused no gliomas at an oral dose of 50 mcg/kg (approximately 0.3 times the maximum recommended daily inhalation dose in adults and children 6 to 17 years of age, respectively, on a mcg/m basis). However, in the male Sprague-Dawley rats, budesonide caused a statistically significant increase in the incidence of hepatocellular tumors at an oral dose of 50 mcg/kg (approximately 0.3 times the maximum recommended daily inhalation doses in adults and children 6 to 17 years of age on a mcg/m basis). The concurrent reference corticosteroids (prednisone and triamcinolone acetonide) in these two studies showed similar findings. There was no evidence of a carcinogenic effect when budesonide was administered orally for 91 weeks to mice at doses up to 200 mcg/kg/day (approximately 0.6 and 0.7 times, respectively the maximum recommended daily inhalation dose in adults and children 6 to 17 years of age on a mcg/m basis). Budesonide was not mutagenic or clastogenic in six different test systems: Ames /microsome plate test, mouse micronucleus test, mouse lymphoma test, chromosome aberration test in human lymphocytes, sex-linked recessive lethal test in , and DNA repair analysis in rat hepatocyte culture. In rats, budesonide had no effect on fertility at subcutaneous doses up to 80 mcg/kg (approximately 0.5 times the maximum recommended daily inhalation dose in adults on a mcg/m basis). At a subcutaneous dose of 20 mcg/kg/day (approximately 0.1 times the maximum recommended daily inhalation dose in adults on a mcg/m basis), decreases in maternal body weight gain, prenatal viability, and viability of the young at birth and during lactation were observed. No such effects were noted at 5 mcg/kg (approximately 0.03 times the maximum recommended daily inhalation dose in adults on a mcg/m basis). As with other corticosteroids, budesonide was teratogenic and embryocidal in rabbits and rats. Budesonide produced fetal loss, decreased pup weights, and skeletal abnormalities at a subcutaneous dose of 25 mcg/kg in rabbits (approximately 0.3 times the maximum recommended daily inhalation dose in adults on a mcg/m basis) and at a subcutaneous dose of 500 mcg/kg in rats (approximately 3 times the maximum recommended daily inhalation dose in adults on a mcg/m basis). No teratogenic or embryocidal effects were observed in rats when budesonide was administered by inhalation at doses up to 250 mcg/kg (approximately equivalent to the maximum recommended daily inhalation dose in adults on a mcg/m basis). The safety and efficacy of PULMICORT FLEXHALER were evaluated in two 12-week, double-blind, randomized, parallel-group, placebo-controlled clinical studies conducted at sites in the United States and Asia involving 1137 patients aged 6 to 80 years with mild to moderate asthma. Study 1 evaluated PULMICORT FLEXHALER 180 mcg, PULMICORT TURBUHALER 200 mcg, and placebo, each administered as 1 inhalation once daily or 2 inhalations twice daily in patients 18 years of age and older with mild to moderate asthma previously treated with inhaled corticosteroids. The delivered dose of PULMICORT FLEXHALER 180 mcg and PULMICORT TURBUHALER 200 mcg are the same; each delivers 160 mcg from the mouthpiece. Study 2 evaluated PULMICORT FLEXHALER 90 mcg, 2 inhalations once daily or 4 inhalations twice daily, PULMICORT TURBUHALER 200 mcg, 1 inhalation once daily or 2 inhalations twice daily, and placebo in pediatric patients aged 6 to 17 years with mild to moderate asthma. Both of the studies had a 2-week placebo treatment run-in period followed by a 12-week randomized treatment period. The primary endpoint was the difference between baseline and the mean of the treatment-period FEV (adults) or FEV % predicted (children). This study enrolled 621 patients aged ≥18 to 80 years with mild-to-moderate asthma (mean baseline % predicted FEV 64.3%) whose symptoms were previously controlled on inhaled corticosteroids. Mean change from baseline in FEV in the PULMICORT FLEXHALER 180 mcg, 2 inhalations twice-daily group was 0.28 liters, as compared to 0.10 liters in the placebo group (p<0.001). Secondary endpoints of morning and evening peak expiratory flow rate, daytime asthma symptom severity, nighttime asthma symptom severity, daily rescue medication use, and the percentage of patients who met predefined asthma related withdrawal criteria showed differences from baseline favoring PULMICORT FLEXHALER over placebo (p<0.001). 12-Week Trial in Adult Patients with Mild to Moderate Asthma (Study 1) Mean Change from Baseline in FEV (L) Footnote: PULMICORT TURBUHALER; a different PULMICORT DPI. Statistical model is analysis of covariance with treatment and region (US/Asia) as factors and the baseline value as the covariate. This study enrolled 516 patients aged 6 to 17 years with mild asthma (mean baseline % predicted FEV 84.9%). The study population included patients previously treated with inhaled corticosteroids for no more than 30 days before the study began (4%) and patients who were naïve to inhaled corticosteroids (96%). Mean change from baseline in % predicted FEV during the 12-week treatment period in the PULMICORT FLEXHALER 90 mcg, 4 inhalations twice daily treatment group was 5.6 compared with 0.2 in the placebo group (p<0.001). Secondary endpoints of morning and evening PEF showed differences from baseline favoring PULMICORT FLEXHALER over placebo (p<0.001). 12-Week Trial in Pediatric Patients With Mild Asthma (Study 2) Mean Change from Baseline in Percent Predicted FEV Footnote: PULMICORT TURBUHALER; a different PULMICORT DPI. Statistical model is analysis of covariance with treatment and region (US/Asia) as factors and the baseline value as the covariate. PULMICORT FLEXHALER is available as a dry powder for inhalation containing budesonide in the following strength: 90 mcg. Each dosage strength contains 60 actuations per device. 90 mcg/dose, 60 dose (NDC 21695-291-01) with a target fill weight of 165 mg (range 140-190). PULMICORT FLEXHALER consists of a number of assembled plastic details, the main parts being the dosing mechanism, the storage unit for drug substance, and the mouthpiece. The inhaler is protected by a white outer tubular cover screwed onto the inhaler. The body of the inhaler is white and the turning grip is brown. The PULMICORT FLEXHALER inhaler cannot be refilled and should be discarded when empty. The number in the middle of the dose indicator window shows how many doses are left in the inhaler. The inhaler is empty when the number zero (“0”) on the red background reaches the middle of the window. If the unit is used beyond the point at which the zero reaches the middle of the window, the correct amount of medication may not be obtained and the unit should be discarded. Store in a dry place at controlled room temperature 20-25°C (68-77°F) [see USP] with the cover tightly in place. Keep out of the reach of children. Patients being treated with PULMICORT FLEXHALER should receive the following information and instructions. This information is intended to aid the patient in the safe and effective use of the medication. It is not a disclosure of all possible adverse or intended effects. For proper use of PULMICORT FLEXHALER and to attain maximum improvement, the patient should read and follow the accompanying Patients should be advised that localized infections with occurred in the mouth and pharynx in some patients. If oropharyngeal candidiasis develops, it should be treated with appropriate local or systemic (i.e. oral) antifungal therapy while still continuing therapy with PULMICORT FLEXHALER, but at times therapy with PULMICORT FLEXHALER may need to be temporarily interrupted under close medical supervision. Rinsing the mouth after inhalation is advised. [see ] PULMICORT FLEXHALER is not meant to relieve acute asthma symptoms and extra doses should not be used for that purpose. Acute symptoms should be treated with an inhaled, short-acting beta-agonist such as albuterol (The physician should provide that patient with such medication and instruct the patient in how it should be used.) Patients should be instructed to notify their physician immediately if they experience any of the following: Decreasing effectiveness of inhaled, short-acting beta-agonists Need for more inhalations than usual of inhaled, short-acting beta-agonists Significant decrease in lung function as outlined by the physician Patients should not stop therapy with PULMICORT FLEXHALER without physician/provider guidance since symptoms may recur after discontinuation. [see ] Hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis, rash, contact dermatitis, urticaria, angioedema, and bronchospasm have been reported with use of PULMICORT FLEXHALER. Discontinue PULMICORT FLEXHALER if such reactions occur [see ]. PULMICORT FLEXHALER contains small amounts of lactose, which contains trace levels of milk proteins. It is possible that cough, wheezing, or bronchospasm may occur in patients who have a severe milk protein allergy [see]. Patients who are on immunosuppressant doses of corticosteroids should be warned to avoid exposure to chickenpox or measles and, if exposed, to consult their physician without delay. Patients should be informed of potential worsening of existing tuberculosis, fungal, bacterial, viral, or parasitic infections, or ocular herpes simplex [see ]. Patients should be advised that PULMICORT FLEXHALER may cause systemic corticosteroid effects of hypercorticism and adrenal suppression. Additionally, patients should be instructed that deaths due to adrenal insufficiency have occurred during and after transfer from systemic corticosteroids. Patients should taper slowly from systemic corticosteroids if transferring to PULMICORT FLEXHALER [see ]. Patients who are at an increased risk for decreased BMD should be advised that the use of corticosteroids may pose an additional risk [see ]. Patients should be informed that orally inhaled corticosteroids, including budesonide inhalation powder, may cause a reduction in growth velocity when administered to pediatric patients. Physicians should closely follow the growth of children and adolescents taking corticosteroids by any route [see ]. Long-term use of inhaled corticosteroids may increase the risk of some eye problems (cataracts or glaucoma); regular eye examinations should be considered [see ]. Patients should be advised to use PULMICORT FLEXHALER at regular intervals, since its effectiveness depends on regular use. Maximum benefit may not be achieved for 1 to 2 weeks or longer after starting treatment. If symptoms do not improve in that time frame or if the condition worsens, patients should be instructed to contact their physician. Patients should be carefully instructed on the use of this drug product to assure optimal dose delivery. The patient may not sense the presence of any medication entering their lungs when inhaling from PULMICORT FLEXHALER. This lack of sensation does not mean that they did not get the medication. They should not repeat their inhalation even if they did not feel the medication when inhaling [see]. This medicine is to only be inhaled through the mouth (by oral inhalation only). Read the Patient Information that comes with PULMICORT FLEXHALER before you start using it and each time you get a refill. There may be new information. This leaflet does not take the place of talking to your healthcare provider about your medical condition or treatment. PULMICORT FLEXHALER is an inhaled corticosteroid medicine. PULMICORT FLEXHALER is used for long-term (maintenance) treatment of asthma and to prevent asthma symptoms in adults and children 6 years of age and older. Inhaled corticosteroids help to decrease inflammation in the lungs. Inflammation in the lungs can lead to asthma symptoms. PULMICORT FLEXHALER helps reduce inflammation and helps keep the airways open to reduce asthma symptoms. PULMICORT FLEXHALER does not treat the symptoms of a sudden asthma attack. Always have a short-acting beta-agonist medicine (rescue inhaler) with you to treat sudden symptoms. If you do not have an inhaled, short-acting bronchodilator, call your healthcare provider to have one prescribed for you. It is not known if PULMICORT FLEXHALER is safe and effective in children younger than 6 years of age. if you have a severe allergy to milk proteins. PULMICORT FLEXHALER contains a small amount of lactose (milk sugar). People with severe allergies to milk protein may have symptoms of an allergic reaction with PULMICORT FLEXHALER including: cough, wheezing, trouble breathing or feeling like your throat is closing. What should I tell my healthcare provider before using PULMICORT FLEXHALER? Before using PULMICORT FLEXHALER, tell your healthcare provider if you: have any allergies. See the section “Who should not use PULMICORT FLEXHALER”. There is a complete list of ingredients in PULMICORT FLEXHALER at the end of this leaflet. have or had chicken pox or measles, or have recently been near anyone with chicken pox or measles. have or had tuberculosis of your respiratory tract. have certain kinds of serious infections that have not been treated, including: herpes simplex infection of the eye (ocular herpes simplex) PULMICORT FLEXHALER may not be right for people who have or had any of these types of infections. You are at risk for decreased bone mineral density if you: are a woman going through menopause or are past menopause (“the change of life”) take bone thinning medicines (such as anticonvulsant medicines or corticosteroids) for a long time. have eye problems such as increased pressure in the eye, glaucoma, or cataracts are pregnant or plan to become pregnant. It is not known if PULMICORT FLEXHALER may harm your unborn baby are breast-feeding or plan to breast-feed. PULMICORT FLEXHALER can pass into breast milk. You and your healthcare provider should decide if you will use PULMICORT FLEXHALER or breast-feed Tell your healthcare provider about all the medicines you take, including prescription and non-prescription medicines, vitamins, and herbal supplements. Using PULMICORT FLEXHALER with certain other medicines may affect each other causing side effects. Especially tell your healthcare provider if you take: medicines that suppress your immune system (immunosuppressant) ketoconazale (Nizoral), other medicines that affect how your liver works. Ask your healthcare provider or pharmacist if you are not sure if your medicine is one listed above. Know the medicines you take. Keep a list of them and show it to your healthcare provider and pharmacist when you get a new medicine. Use PULMICORT FLEXHALER exactly as prescribed by your healthcare provider. You must use PULMICORT FLEXHALER regularly for it to work. PULMICORT FLEXHALER comes in two strengths. Your healthcare provider has prescribed the strength that is best for you. Be sure you know the difference between PULMICORT FLEXHALER and any other inhaled medicines that are prescribed for you, including what you use them for (prescribed use) and what they look like. Do not stop using PULMICORT FLEXHALER, even if your symptoms get better. Your healthcare provider will change your medicines as needed. Do not change or stop any medicines used to control or treat your breathing problems, unless your healthcare provider tells you to. Rinse your mouth with water and spit the water out after each dose of PULMICORT FLEXHALER. Do not swallow the water. This will lessen the chance of getting a fungal infection (thrush) in the mouth. If you miss a dose, just take your next regularly scheduled dose when it is due. Do not use PULMICORT FLEXHALER more often or use more puffs than you have been prescribed. Make sure you always have a short-acting beta-agonist medicine with you. Use your short acting beta-agonist medicine if you have breathing problems between doses of PULMICORT FLEXHALER or if a sudden asthma attack happens. Call your healthcare provider right away if: your short-acting rescue medicine does not work as well for relieving asthma symptoms. you need to use your short-acting rescue medicines more often than usual. your breathing problems worsen with PULMICORT FLEXHALER. If you use another inhaled medicine by mouth to treat your asthma, talk with your healthcare provider for instructions about when to use the other medicine and when to use your PULMICORT FLEXHALER. If you have used corticosteroid medicines for a long time and the dose is now being lowered or stopped, you should carry a medical alert card. The medical alert card should state that you may need increased corticosteroids during times of stress or during an asthma attack that does not get better with bronchodilator medicines. Your healthcare provider may check your breathing, do blood tests and eye exams during treatment with PULMICORT FLEXHALER. Be sure to read, understand and follow the detailed Patient Instructions for Use at the end of this leaflet. These Instructions for Use tell you how to prime and use your PULMICORT FLEXHALER the right way. What are the possible side effects of PULMICORT FLEXHALER? PULMICORT FLEXHALER can cause serious side effects, including: thrush (candida), a fungal infection in your mouth and throat. Tell your healthcare provider if you have any redness or white colored patches in your mouth or throat. Tell your healthcare provider or get medical help right away if you have: Immune system effects and a higher chance of infections. You are more likely to get infections if you take medicines that weaken your immune system. Avoid contact with people who have contagious diseases such as chicken pox or measles while using PULMICORT FLEXHALER. Symptoms of infection may include: fever, pain, aches, chills, feeling tired, nausea and vomiting. Tell your healthcare provider about any signs of infection while you are using PULMICORT FLEXHALER. Adrenal insufficiency is a condition in which the adrenal glands do not make enough steroid hormones. Symptoms of adrenal insufficiency include: tiredness, weakness, nausea and vomiting and low blood pressure. Your healthcare provider should check you for this during treatment with PULMICORT FLEXHALER. A child’s growth should be checked regularly while using PULMICORT FLEXHALER. You should have regular eye exams while using PULMICORT FLEXHALER. Increased wheezing right after taking PULMICORT FLEXHALER. Always have a short-acting beta-agonist medicine (rescue inhaler) with you to treat sudden wheezing. Call your healthcare provider or get medical help right away if you have symptoms of any of the serious side effects listed above. Common side effects reported by patients using PULMICORT FLEXHALER include: viral irritation and inflammation of the stomach and intestine (gastroenteritis). Symptoms may include stomach area pain, diarrhea, nausea and vomiting, loss of appetite, headaches, and weakness. Tell your healthcare provider about any side effect that bothers you or that does not go away. These are not all of the side effects of PULMICORT FLEXHALER. Ask your healthcare provider or pharmacist for more information. Call your healthcare provider for medical advice about side effects. You may report side effects to AstraZeneca at 1-800-236-9933 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. Store PULMICORT FLEXHALER at 68° to 77°F (20° to 25°C). Keep your PULMICORT FLEXHALER with the cover tightly in place when not in use. Keep your PULMICORT FLEXHALER and all medicines out of the reach of children. Medicines are sometimes prescribed for conditions that are not mentioned in Patient Information Leaflets. Do not use PULMICORT FLEXHALER for a condition for which it was not prescribed. Do not give PULMICORT FLEXHALER to other people, even if they have the same symptoms that you have. It may harm them. This Patient Information leaflet summarizes the most important information about PULMICORT FLEXHALER. If you would like more information, talk with your healthcare provider. You can ask your pharmacist or healthcare provider for information about PULMICORT FLEXHALER that is written for health professionals. For more information, go to pulmicortflexhaler.com or call 1- 800-236-9933. Before you use a new PULMICORT FLEXHALER for the first time, you must prime it. To prime your PULMICORT FLEXHALER, follow the steps below: Hold the inhaler by the brown grip so that the white cover points upward (upright position). With the other hand, turn the white cover and lift it off (see Figure 2). Continue to hold your PULMICORT FLEXHALER upright as shown in Figure 1. Use your other hand to hold the inhaler in the middle. Do not hold the inhaler at the top of the mouthpiece. Twist the brown grip as far as it will go in one direction and then fully back again in the other direction until it stops (it does not matter which way you turn it first). You will hear a “click” during one of the twisting movements (see Figures 3 and 4). Repeat Step 3. Your PULMICORT FLEXHALER is now primed. You are ready to load your first dose. You do not have to prime your PULMICORT FLEXHALER again after this even if you do not use it for a long period of time. 1. Hold your PULMICORT FLEXHALER upright as described above. With your other hand, twist the white cover and lift it off (see Figure 2). 2. Continue to hold your PULMICORT FLEXHALER upright to be sure that the right dose of medicine is loaded. 3. Use your other hand to hold the inhaler in the middle. Do not hold the mouthpiece when you load the inhaler. 4. Twist the brown grip fully in one direction as far as it will go. Twist it fully back again in the other direction as far as it will go (it does not matter which way you turn it first) [see Figure 3]. • You will hear a “click” during one of the twisting movements (see Figure 4). PULMICORT FLEXHALER will only give one dose at a time, no matter how often you click the brown grip, but the dose indicator will continue to move (advance). This means that if you continue to move the brown grip, it is possible for the indicator to show fewer doses or zero doses even if more doses are left in the inhaler. Turn your head away from the inhaler and breathe out (exhale). If you accidentally blow into your inhaler after loading a dose, follow the instructions for loading a new dose. Place the mouthpiece in your mouth and close your lips around the mouthpiece. Breathe in (inhale) deeply and forcefully through the inhaler (see Figure 5). You may not sense the presence of any medication entering your lungs when inhaling from PULMICORT FLEXHALER. This lack of sensation does not mean that you did not get the medication. You should not repeat your inhalations even if you did not feel the medication when inhaling. Remove the inhaler from your mouth and exhale. If more than one dose is prescribed repeat the steps above. When you are finished taking your dose place the white cover back on the inhaler and twist shut. Rinse your mouth with water after each dose to decrease your risk of getting thrush. Do not swallow the water. The label on the box or cover will tell you how many doses are in your PULMICORT FLEXHALER. Your PULMICORT FLEXHALER has a dose indicator window just below the mouthpiece. The dose indicator tells you about how many doses are left in the inhaler. Look at the middle of the window to find out about how many doses are left in your inhaler (see Figure 6). The dose indicator is connected to the turning grip and moves (counts down) every time a dose is loaded. It is not likely that you will see the dose indicator move with each dose. You can usually see the indicator move each time you use about 5 doses. The dose indicator starts with either the number 60 or 120 when full, depending upon the strength of the inhaler. The indicator is marked in intervals of 10 doses. Markings are either with numbers or dashes (alternating), counting down to “0”. Dose indicator starts at 60 or 120 depending on strength (90 mcg or 180 mcg) of the inhaler and counts down to 0. The dose indicator will tell you about how many doses are left in your PULMICORT FLEXHALER. If you complete the instructions for loading the dose more than one time before you inhale the dose, you will only receive one dose. The dose indicator will move a small amount but it is not likely that you will see the dose indicator move with each dose. Your inhaler is empty when the number 0 on the red background reaches the middle of the dose indicator window. Throw away this inhaler. The inhaler may not give you the right amount of medicine, even though it may not feel completely empty and may seem like it continues to work (see Figure 7). Do not put your PULMICORT FLEXHALER in water (do not immerse it) to find out if it is empty. Check the dose indicator window to see how many doses are left. Refill your PULMICORT FLEXHALER prescription before your medicine runs out. You will get a new inhaler each time you refill your prescription. Keep your PULMICORT FLEXHALER clean and dry at all times. Do not immerse it in water. Wipe the outside of the mouthpiece one time each week with a dry tissue. Do not use water or liquids when cleaning the mouthpiece. Do not use your PULMICORT FLEXHALER if it has been damaged or if the mouthpiece has become detached. Talk to your healthcare provider or pharmacist if you have any problems with your PULMICORT FLEXHALER. PULMICORT FLEXHALER is a trademark of the AstraZeneca group of companies.

What should I avoid while taking montelukast sodium tablets? What are the possible side effects of montelukast sodium tablets? General Information about the safe and effective use of montelukast sodium tablets What are the ingredients in montelukast sodium tablets? Sections or subsections omitted from the full prescribing information are not listed. Montelukast sodium tablets are indicated for the prophylaxis and chronic treatment of asthma in adults and adolescent patients 15 years of age and older. Montelukast sodium tablets are indicated for prevention of exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (EIB) in patients 15 years of age and older. Montelukast sodium tablets are indicated for the relief of symptoms of seasonal allergic rhinitis in patients 15 years of age and older and perennial allergic rhinitis in patients 15 years of age and older. Montelukast sodium tablets should be taken once daily in the evening. The following dose is recommended: For adults and adolescents 15 years of age and older: one 10 mg tablet. Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients less than 12 months of age with asthma have not been established. There have been no clinical trials in patients with asthma to evaluate the relative efficacy of morning versus evening dosing. The pharmacokinetics of montelukast are similar whether dosed in the morning or evening. Efficacy has been demonstrated for asthma when montelukast was administered in the evening without regard to time of food ingestion. 2.2 Exercise-Induced Bronchoconstriction (EIB) in Patients 15 Years of Age and Older For prevention of EIB, a single 10 mg dose of montelukast sodium tablets should be taken at least 2 hours before exercise. An additional dose of montelukast sodium tablets should not be taken within 24 hours of a previous dose. Patients already taking montelukast sodium tablets daily for another indication (including chronic asthma) should not take an additional dose to prevent EIB. All patients should have available for rescue a short-acting β-agonist. Safety and efficacy in patients younger than 15 years of age have not been established. Daily administration of montelukast sodium tablets for the chronic treatment of asthma has not been established to prevent acute episodes of EIB. For allergic rhinitis, montelukast sodium tablets should be taken once daily. Efficacy was demonstrated for seasonal allergic rhinitis when montelukast was administered in the morning or the evening without regard to time of food ingestion. The time of administration may be individualized to suit patient needs. The following dose for the treatment of symptoms of seasonal allergic rhinitis is recommended: For adults and adolescents 15 years of age and older: one 10 mg tablet. Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients younger than 2 years of age with seasonal allergic rhinitis have not been established. The following dose for the treatment of symptoms of perennial allergic rhinitis is recommended: For adults and adolescents 15 years of age and older: one 10 mg tablet. Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients younger than 6 months of age with perennial allergic rhinitis have not been established. Patients with both asthma and allergic rhinitis should take only one montelukast sodium tablet dose daily in the evening. Montelukast sodium tablets 10 mg (10.4 mg montelukast sodium equivalent to 10 mg montelukast) are round beige colored, biconvex coated tablets engraved with ‘G’ on one side and ‘392’ on other side. Hypersensitivity to any component of this product. Montelukast sodium is not indicated for use in the reversal of bronchospasm in acute asthma attacks, including status asthmaticus. Patients should be advised to have appropriate rescue medication available. Therapy with montelukast sodium can be continued during acute exacerbations of asthma. Patients who have exacerbations of asthma after exercise should have available for rescue a short-acting inhaled β-agonist. While the dose of inhaled corticosteroid may be reduced gradually under medical supervision, montelukast sodium should not be abruptly substituted for inhaled or oral corticosteroids. Patients with known aspirin sensitivity should continue avoidance of aspirin or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents while taking montelukast sodium. Although montelukast sodium is effective in improving airway function in asthmatics with documented aspirin sensitivity, it has not been shown to truncate bronchoconstrictor response to aspirin and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in aspirin-sensitive asthmatic patients . Neuropsychiatric events have been reported in adult, adolescent, and pediatric patients taking montelukast sodium. Post-marketing reports with montelukast sodium use include agitation, aggressive behavior or hostility, anxiousness, depression,  disorientation, disturbance in attention, dream abnormalities, hallucinations, insomnia, irritability, memory impairment, restlessness, somnambulism, suicidal thinking and behavior (including suicide), tic and tremor. The clinical details of some post-marketing reports involving montelukast sodium appear consistent with a drug-induced effect. Patients and prescribers should be alert for neuropsychiatric events. Patients should be instructed to notify their prescriber if these changes occur. Prescribers should carefully evaluate the risks and benefits of continuing treatment with montelukast sodium if such events occur . Patients with asthma on therapy with montelukast sodium may present with systemic eosinophilia, sometimes presenting with clinical features of vasculitis consistent with Churg-Strauss syndrome, a condition which is often treated with systemic corticosteroid therapy. These events have been sometimes associated with the reduction of oral corticosteroid therapy. Physicians should be alert to eosinophilia, vasculitic rash, worsening pulmonary symptoms, cardiac complications, and/or neuropathy presenting in their patients. A causal association between montelukast sodium and these underlying conditions has not been established Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. In the following description of clinical trials experience, adverse reactions are listed regardless of causality assessment. The most common adverse reactions (incidence ≥5% and greater than placebo; listed in descending order of frequency) in controlled clinical trials were: upper respiratory infection, fever, headache, pharyngitis, cough, abdominal pain, diarrhea, otitis media, influenza, rhinorrhea, sinusitis, otitis. Adults and Adolescents 15 Years of Age and Older with Asthma Montelukast sodium has been evaluated for safety in approximately 2950 adult and adolescent patients 15 years of age and older in clinical trials. In placebo-controlled clinical trials, the following adverse experiences reported with montelukast sodium occurred in greater than or equal to 1% of patients and at an incidence greater than that in patients treated with placebo: TABLE 1: Adverse Experiences Occurring in ≥1% of Patients with an Incidence Greater than that in Patients Treated with Placebo Number of patients tested (montelukast sodium and placebo, respectively): ALT and AST, 1935, 1170; pyuria, 1924, 1159. 10 mg/day (%) (n=1955) (%) (n=1180)     Pain, abdominal     Asthenia/fatigue     Fever     Trauma 2.9 1.8 1.5 1.0 2.5 1.2 0.9 0.8 Dyspepsia Pain, dental Gastroenteritis, infectious 2.1 1.7 1.5 1.1 1.0 0.5     Headache     Dizziness 18.4 1.9 18.1 1.4     Influenza     Cough     Congestion, nasal 4.2 2.7 1.6 3.9 2.4 1.3     Rash     ALT increased     AST increased     Pyuria 2.1 1.6 1.0 2.0 1.2 0.9 The frequency of less common adverse events was comparable between montelukast sodium and placebo. The safety profile of montelukast sodium, when administered as a single dose for prevention of EIB in adult and adolescent patients 15 years of age and older, was consistent with the safety profile previously described for montelukast sodium. Cumulatively, 569 patients were treated with montelukast sodium for at least 6 months, 480 for one year, and 49 for two years in clinical trials. With prolonged treatment, the adverse experience profile did not significantly change. Adults and Adolescents 15 Years of Age and Older with Seasonal Allergic Rhinitis Montelukast sodium has been evaluated for safety in 2199 adult and adolescent patients 15 years of age and older in clinical trials. Montelukast sodium administered once daily in the morning or in the evening had a safety profile similar to that of placebo. In placebo-controlled clinical trials, the following event was reported with montelukast sodium with a frequency ≥1% and at an incidence greater than placebo: upper respiratory infection, 1.9% of patients receiving montelukast sodium vs. 1.5% of patients receiving placebo. In a 4-week, placebo-controlled clinical study, the safety profile was consistent with that observed in 2-week studies. The incidence of somnolence was similar to that of placebo in all studies. Adults and Adolescents 15 Years of Age and Older with Perennial Allergic Rhinitis Montelukast sodium has been evaluated for safety in 3357 adult and adolescent patients 15 years of age and older with perennial allergic rhinitis of whom 1632 received montelukast sodium in two, 6-week, clinical studies. Montelukast sodium administered once daily had a safety profile consistent with that observed in patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis and similar to that of placebo. In these two studies, the following events were reported with montelukast sodium with a frequency ≥1% and at an incidence greater than placebo: sinusitis, upper respiratory infection, sinus headache, cough, epistaxis, and increased ALT. The incidence of somnolence was similar to that of placebo. The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of montelukast sodium. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Blood and lymphatic system disorders: increased bleeding tendency, thrombocytopenia. Immune system disorders: hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis, hepatic eosinophilic infiltration. Psychiatric disorders: agitation including aggressive behavior or hostility, anxiousness, depression, disorientation, disturbance in attention, dream abnormalities, hallucinations, insomnia, irritability, memory impairment, restlessness, somnambulism, suicidal thinking and behavior (including suicide), tic and tremor . Nervous system disorders: drowsiness, paraesthesia/hypoesthesia, seizures. Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders: epistaxis, pulmonary eosinophilia. Gastrointestinal disorders: diarrhea, dyspepsia, nausea, pancreatitis, vomiting. Hepatobiliary disorders: Cases of cholestatic hepatitis, hepatocellular liver-injury, and mixed-pattern liver injury have been reported in patients treated with montelukast sodium. Most of these occurred in combination with other confounding factors, such as use of other medications, or when montelukast sodium was administered to patients who had underlying potential for liver disease such as alcohol use or other forms of hepatitis. Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: angioedema, bruising, erythema multiforme, erythema nodosum, pruritus, Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis, urticaria. Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders: arthralgia, myalgia including muscle cramps. Renal and urinary disorders: enuresis in children. General disorders and administration site conditions: edema. Patients with asthma on therapy with montelukast sodium may present with systemic eosinophilia, sometimes presenting with clinical features of vasculitis consistent with Churg-Strauss syndrome, a condition which is often treated with systemic corticosteroid therapy. These events have been sometimes associated with the reduction of oral corticosteroid therapy. Physicians should be alert to eosinophilia, vasculitic rash, worsening pulmonary symptoms, cardiac complications, and/or neuropathy presenting in their patients . No dose adjustment is needed when montelukast sodium is co-administered with theophylline, prednisone, prednisolone, oral contraceptives, terfenadine, digoxin, warfarin, gemfibrozil, itraconazole, thyroid hormones, sedative hypnotics, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents, benzodiazepines, decongestants, and Cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme inducers . There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, montelukast sodium should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. No teratogenicity was observed in rats and rabbits at doses approximately 100 and 110 times, respectively, the maximum recommended daily oral dose in adults based on AUCs . During worldwide marketing experience, congenital limb defects have been rarely reported in the offspring of women being treated with montelukast sodium during pregnancy. Most of these women were also taking other asthma medications during their pregnancy. A causal relationship between these events and montelukast sodium has not been established. Studies in rats have shown that montelukast is excreted in milk. It is not known if montelukast is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when montelukast sodium is given to a nursing mother. The safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of 12 months with asthma and 6 months with perennial allergic rhinitis have not been established. The safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of 6 years with exercise-induced bronchoconstriction have not been established. Of the total number of subjects in clinical studies of montelukast, 3.5% were 65 years of age and over, and 0.4% were 75 years of age and over. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out. The pharmacokinetic profile and the oral bioavailability of a single 10-mg oral dose of montelukast are similar in elderly and younger adults. The plasma half-life of montelukast is slightly longer in the elderly. No dosage adjustment in the elderly is required. No dosage adjustment is required in patients with mild-to-moderate hepatic insufficiency . No dosage adjustment is recommended in patients with renal insufficiency No specific information is available on the treatment of overdosage with montelukast sodium. In chronic asthma studies, montelukast has been administered at doses up to 200 mg/day to adult patients for 22 weeks and, in short-term studies, up to 900 mg/day to patients for approximately a week without clinically important adverse experiences. In the event of overdose, it is reasonable to employ the usual supportive measures; e.g., remove unabsorbed material from the gastrointestinal tract, employ clinical monitoring, and institute supportive therapy, if required. There have been reports of acute overdosage in post-marketing experience and clinical studies with montelukast sodium. These include reports in adults and children with a dose as high as 1000 mg. The clinical and laboratory findings observed were consistent with the safety profile in adults and pediatric patients. There were no adverse experiences in the majority of overdosage reports. The most frequently occurring adverse experiences were consistent with the safety profile of montelukast sodium and included abdominal pain, somnolence, thirst, headache, vomiting and psychomotor hyperactivity. It is not known whether montelukast is removed by peritoneal dialysis or hemodialysis. Montelukast sodium USP, the active ingredient in montelukast sodium tablets, is a selective and orally active leukotriene receptor antagonist that inhibits the cysteinyl leukotriene CysLT receptor. Montelukast sodium is described chemically as [ -( )]-1-[[[1-[3-[2-(7-chloro-2-quinolinyl) ethenyl]phenyl]-3-[2-(1-hydroxy-1-methylethyl)phenyl] propyl] thio] methyl] cyclopropaneacetic acid, monosodium salt. The empirical formula is C H ClNNaO S, and its molecular weight is 608.17. The structural formula is: Montelukast sodium USP is a off-white to light yellow colored, hygroscopic powder. Montelukast sodium USP is freely soluble in water and in methylene chloride and very soluble to freely soluble in alcohol. Each 10 mg film-coated montelukast sodium tablet contains 10.4 mg montelukast sodium, which is equivalent to 10 mg of montelukast, and the following inactive ingredients: microcrystalline cellulose, lactose monohydrate, croscarmellose sodium, hydroxypropyl cellulose and magnesium stearate. The film coating consists of: hypromellose, hydroxypropyl cellulose, titanium dioxide, ferric oxide yellow, ferric oxide red and carnauba wax. The cysteinyl leukotrienes (LTC , LTD , LTE ) are products of arachidonic acid metabolism and are released from various cells, including mast cells and eosinophils. These eicosanoids bind to cysteinyl leukotriene (CysLT) receptors. The CysLT type-1 (CysLT ) receptor is found in the human airway (including airway smooth muscle cells and airway macrophages) and on other pro-inflammatory cells (including eosinophils and certain myeloid stem cells). CysLTs have been correlated with the pathophysiology of asthma and allergic rhinitis. In asthma, leukotriene-mediated effects include airway edema, smooth muscle contraction, and altered cellular activity associated with the inflammatory process. In allergic rhinitis, CysLTs are released from the nasal mucosa after allergen exposure during both early- and late-phase reactions and are associated with symptoms of allergic rhinitis. Montelukast is an orally active compound that binds with high affinity and selectivity to the CysLT receptor (in preference to other pharmacologically important airway receptors, such as the prostanoid, cholinergic, or β-adrenergic receptor). Montelukast inhibits physiologic actions of LTD at the CysLT receptor without any agonist activity. Montelukast causes inhibition of airway cysteinyl leukotriene receptors as demonstrated by the ability to inhibit bronchoconstriction due to inhaled LTD in asthmatics. Doses as low as 5 mg cause substantial blockage of LTD -induced bronchoconstriction. In a placebo-controlled, crossover study (n=12), montelukast sodium inhibited early- and late-phase bronchoconstriction due to antigen challenge by 75% and 57%, respectively. The effect of montelukast sodium on eosinophils in the peripheral blood was examined in clinical trials. In patients with asthma aged 2 years and older who received montelukast sodium, a decrease in mean peripheral blood eosinophil counts ranging from 9% to 15% was noted, compared with placebo, over the double-blind treatment periods. In patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis aged 15 years and older who received montelukast sodium, a mean increase of 0.2% in peripheral blood eosinophil counts was noted, compared with a mean increase of 12.5% in placebo-treated patients, over the double-blind treatment periods; this reflects a mean difference of 12.3% in favor of montelukast sodium. The relationship between these observations and the clinical benefits of montelukast noted in the clinical trials is not known Montelukast is rapidly absorbed following oral administration. After administration of the 10-mg film-coated tablet to fasted adults, the mean peak montelukast plasma concentration (C ) is achieved in 3 to 4 hours (T ). The mean oral bioavailability is 64%. The oral bioavailability and C are not influenced by a standard meal in the morning. The safety and efficacy of montelukast sodium in patients with asthma were demonstrated in clinical trials in which the 10-mg film-coated tablet formulation was administered in the evening without regard to the time of food ingestion. The safety and efficacy of montelukast sodium in patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis were demonstrated in clinical trials in which the 10-mg film-coated tablet was administered in the morning or evening without regard to the time of food ingestion. Montelukast is more than 99% bound to plasma proteins. The steady state volume of distribution of montelukast averages 8 to 11 liters. Studies in rats with radiolabeled montelukast indicate minimal distribution across the blood-brain barrier. In addition, concentrations of radiolabeled material at 24 hours postdose were minimal in all other tissues. Montelukast is extensively metabolized. In studies with therapeutic doses, plasma concentrations of metabolites of montelukast are undetectable at steady state in adults and pediatric patients. studies using human liver microsomes indicate that CYP3A4, 2C8 and 2C9 are involved in the metabolism of montelukast. At clinically relevant concentrations, 2C8 appears to play a major role in the metabolism of montelukast. The plasma clearance of montelukast averages 45 mL/min in healthy adults. Following an oral dose of radiolabeled montelukast, 86% of the radioactivity was recovered in 5-day fecal collections and <0.2% was recovered in urine. Coupled with estimates of montelukast oral bioavailability, this indicates that montelukast and its metabolites are excreted almost exclusively via the bile. In several studies, the mean plasma half-life of montelukast ranged from 2.7 to 5.5 hours in healthy young adults. The pharmacokinetics of montelukast are nearly linear for oral doses up to 50 mg. During once-daily dosing with 10-mg montelukast, there is little accumulation of the parent drug in plasma (14%). Patients with mild-to-moderate hepatic insufficiency and clinical evidence of cirrhosis had evidence of decreased metabolism of montelukast resulting in 41% (90% CI=7%, 85%) higher mean montelukast AUC following a single 10-mg dose. The elimination of montelukast was slightly prolonged compared with that in healthy subjects (mean half-life, 7.4 hours). No dosage adjustment is required in patients with mild-to-moderate hepatic insufficiency. The pharmacokinetics of montelukast sodium in patients with more severe hepatic impairment or with hepatitis have not been evaluated. Since montelukast and its metabolites are not excreted in the urine, the pharmacokinetics of montelukast were not evaluated in patients with renal insufficiency. No dosage adjustment is recommended in these patients. The pharmacokinetics of montelukast are similar in males and females. Pharmacokinetic differences due to race have not been studied. Pharmacokinetic studies evaluated the systemic exposure of the 10-mg film-coated tablets in young adults and adolescents ≥15 years of age. The plasma concentration profile of montelukast following administration of the 10-mg film-coated tablet is similar in adolescents ≥15 years of age and young adults. The 10-mg film-coated tablet is recommended for use in patients ≥15 years of age. Montelukast sodium has been administered with other therapies routinely used in the prophylaxis and chronic treatment of asthma with no apparent increase in adverse reactions. In drug-interaction studies, the recommended clinical dose of montelukast did not have clinically important effects on the pharmacokinetics of the following drugs: theophylline, prednisone, and prednisolone. Montelukast at a dose of 10 mg once daily dosed to pharmacokinetic steady state, did not cause clinically significant changes in the kinetics of a single intravenous dose of theophylline [predominantly a cytochrome P450 (CYP) 1A2 substrate]. Montelukast at doses of ≥100 mg daily dosed to pharmacokinetic steady state, did not cause any clinically significant change in plasma profiles of prednisone or prednisolone following administration of either oral prednisone or intravenous prednisolone. Oral Contraceptives, Terfenadine, Digoxin, and Warfarin: In drug interaction studies, the recommended clinical dose of montelukast did not have clinically important effects on the pharmacokinetics of the following drugs: oral contraceptives (norethindrone 1 mg/ethinyl estradiol 35 mcg), terfenadine, digoxin, and warfarin. Montelukast at doses of ≥100 mg daily dosed to pharmacokinetic steady state did not significantly alter the plasma concentrations of either component of an oral contraceptive containing norethindrone 1 mg/ethinyl estradiol 35 mcg. Montelukast at a dose of 10 mg once daily dosed to pharmacokinetic steady state did not change the plasma concentration profile of terfenadine (a substrate of CYP3A4) or fexofenadine, the carboxylated metabolite, and did not prolong the QTc interval following co-administration with terfenadine 60 mg twice daily; did not change the pharmacokinetic profile or urinary excretion of immunoreactive digoxin; did not change the pharmacokinetic profile of warfarin (primarily a substrate of CYP2C9, 3A4 and 1A2) or influence the effect of a single 30-mg oral dose of warfarin on prothrombin time or the International Normalized Ratio (INR). Thyroid Hormones, Sedative Hypnotics, Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Benzodiazepines, and Decongestants: Although additional specific interaction studies were not performed, montelukast sodium was used concomitantly with a wide range of commonly prescribed drugs in clinical studies without evidence of clinical adverse interactions. These medications included thyroid hormones, sedative hypnotics, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents, benzodiazepines, and decongestants. Phenobarbital, which induces hepatic metabolism, decreased the area under the plasma concentration curve (AUC) of montelukast approximately 40% following a single 10-mg dose of montelukast. No dosage adjustment for montelukast sodium is recommended. It is reasonable to employ appropriate clinical monitoring when potent CYP enzyme inducers, such as phenobarbital or rifampin, are co-administered with montelukast sodium. Effect of Montelukast on Cytochrome P450 (CYP) Enzymes: Montelukast is a potent inhibitor of CYP2C8 However, data from a clinical drug-drug interaction study involving montelukast and rosiglitazone (a probe substrate representative of drugs primarily metabolized by CYP2C8) in 12 healthy individuals demonstrated that the pharmacokinetics of rosiglitazone are not altered when the drugs are coadministered, indicating that montelukast does not inhibit CYP2C8 Therefore, montelukast is not anticipated to alter the metabolism of drugs metabolized by this enzyme (e.g., paclitaxel, rosiglitazone, and repaglinide). Based on further results in human liver microsomes, therapeutic plasma concentrations of montelukast do not inhibit CYP 3A4, 2C9, 1A2, 2A6, 2C19, or 2D6. Cytochrome P450 (CYP) Enzyme Inhibitors: In vitro studies have shown that montelukast is a substrate of CYP 2C8, 2C9, and 3A4. Co-administration of montelukast with itraconazole, a strong CYP 3A4 inhibitor, resulted in no significant increase in the systemic exposure of montelukast. Data from a clinical drug-drug interaction study involving montelukast and gemfibrozil (an inhibitor of both CYP 2C8 and 2C9) demonstrated that gemfibrozil, at a therapeutic dose, increased the systemic exposure of montelukast by 4.4-fold. Co-administration of itraconazole, gemfibrozil, and montelukast did not further increase the systemic exposure of montelukast. Based on available clinical experience, no dosage adjustment of montelukast is required upon co-administration with gemfibrozil [see ] . 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility No evidence of tumorigenicity was seen in carcinogenicity studies of either 2 years in Sprague-Dawley rats or 92 weeks in mice at oral gavage doses up to 200 mg/kg/day or 100 mg/kg/day, respectively. The estimated exposure in rats was approximately 120 and 75 times the AUC for adults and children, respectively, at the maximum recommended daily oral dose. The estimated exposure in mice was approximately 45 and 25 times the AUC for adults and children, respectively, at the maximum recommended daily oral dose. Montelukast demonstrated no evidence of mutagenic or clastogenic activity in the following assays: the microbial mutagenesis assay, the V-79 mammalian cell mutagenesis assay, the alkaline elution assay in rat hepatocytes, the chromosomal aberration assay in Chinese hamster ovary cells, and in the mouse bone marrow chromosomal aberration assay. In fertility studies in female rats, montelukast produced reductions in fertility and fecundity indices at an oral dose of 200 mg/kg (estimated exposure was approximately 70 times the AUC for adults at the maximum recommended daily oral dose). No effects on female fertility or fecundity were observed at an oral dose of 100 mg/kg (estimated exposure was approximately 20 times the AUC for adults at the maximum recommended daily oral dose). Montelukast had no effects on fertility in male rats at oral doses up to 800 mg/kg (estimated exposure was approximately 160 times the AUC for adults at the maximum recommended daily oral dose). No teratogenicity was observed at oral doses up to 400 mg/kg/day and 300 mg/kg/day in rats and rabbits, respectively. These doses were approximately 100 and 110 times the maximum recommended daily oral dose in adults, respectively, based on AUCs. Montelukast crosses the placenta following oral dosing in rats and rabbits Adults and Adolescents 15 Years of Age and Older with Asthma Clinical trials in adults and adolescents 15 years of age and older demonstrated there is no additional clinical benefit to montelukast doses above 10 mg once daily. The efficacy of montelukast sodium for the chronic treatment of asthma in adults and adolescents 15 years of age and older was demonstrated in two (U.S. and Multinational) similarly designed, randomized, 12-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials in 1576 patients (795 treated with montelukast sodium, 530 treated with placebo, and 251 treated with active control). The median age was 33 years (range 15 to 85); 56.8% were females and 43.2% were males. The ethnic/racial distribution in these studies was 71.6% Caucasian, 17.7% Hispanic, 7.2% other origins and 3.5% Black. Patients had mild or moderate asthma and were non-smokers who required approximately 5 puffs of inhaled β-agonist per day on an “as-needed” basis. The patients had a mean baseline percent of predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV ) of 66% (approximate range, 40 to 90%). The co-primary endpoints in these trials were FEV and daytime asthma symptoms. In both studies after 12 weeks, a random subset of patients receiving montelukast sodium was switched to placebo for an additional 3 weeks of double-blind treatment to evaluate for possible rebound effects. The results of the U.S. trial on the primary endpoint, morning FEV , expressed as mean percent change from baseline averaged over the 12-week treatment period, are shown in FIGURE 1. Compared with placebo, treatment with one montelukast sodium 10-mg tablet daily in the evening resulted in a statistically significant increase in FEV percent change from baseline (13.0%-change in the group treated with montelukast sodium vs. 4.2%-change in the placebo group, p<0.001); the change from baseline in FEV for montelukast sodium was 0.32 liters compared with 0.10 liters for placebo, corresponding to a between-group difference of 0.22 liters (p<0.001, 95% CI 0.17 liters, 0.27 liters). The results of the Multinational trial on FEV were similar. FIGURE 1: FEV Mean Percent Change from Baseline (U.S. Trial: Montelukast Sodium N=406; Placebo N=270) (ANOVA Model) The effect of montelukast sodium on other primary and secondary endpoints, represented by the Multinational study is shown in TABLE 2. Results on these endpoints were similar in the US study. TABLE 2: Effect of Montelukast Sodium on Primary and Secondary Endpoints in a Multinational Placebo-controlled Trial (ANOVA Model) Both studies evaluated the effect of montelukast sodium on secondary outcomes, including asthma attack (utilization of health-care resources such as an unscheduled visit to a doctor's office, emergency room, or hospital; or treatment with oral, intravenous, or intramuscular corticosteroid), and use of oral corticosteroids for asthma rescue. In the Multinational study, significantly fewer patients (15.6% of patients) on montelukast sodium experienced asthma attacks compared with patients on placebo (27.3%, p < 0.001). In the US study, 7.8% of patients on montelukast sodium and 10.3% of patients on placebo experienced asthma attacks, but the difference between the two treatment groups was not significant (p = 0.334). In the Multinational study, significantly fewer patients (14.8% of patients) on montelukast sodium were prescribed oral corticosteroids for asthma rescue compared with patients on placebo (25.7%, p < 0.001). In the US study, 6.9% of patients on montelukast sodium and 9.9% of patients on placebo were prescribed oral corticosteroids for asthma rescue, but the difference between the two treatment groups was not significant (p = 0.196). In each placebo-controlled trial in adults, the treatment effect of montelukast sodium, measured by daily diary card parameters, including symptom scores, “as-needed” β-agonist use, and PEFR measurements, was achieved after the first dose and was maintained throughout the dosing interval (24 hours). No significant change in treatment effect was observed during continuous once-daily evening administration in non-placebo-controlled extension trials for up to one year. Withdrawal of montelukast sodium in asthmatic patients after 12 weeks of continuous use did not cause rebound worsening of asthma. Effects in Patients on Concomitant Inhaled Corticosteroids Separate trials in adults evaluated the ability of montelukast sodium to add to the clinical effect of inhaled corticosteroids and to allow inhaled corticosteroid tapering when used concomitantly. One randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trial (n=226) enrolled adults with stable asthma with a mean FEV of approximately 84% of predicted who were previously maintained on various inhaled corticosteroids (delivered by metered-dose aerosol or dry powder inhalers). The median age was 41.5 years (range 16 to 70); 52.2% were females and 47.8% were males. The ethnic/racial distribution in this study was 92.0% Caucasian, 3.5% Black, 2.2% Hispanic, and 2.2% Asian. The types of inhaled corticosteroids and their mean baseline requirements included beclomethasone dipropionate (mean dose, 1203 mcg/day), triamcinolone acetonide (mean dose, 2004 mcg/day), flunisolide (mean dose, 1971 mcg/day), fluticasone propionate (mean dose, 1083 mcg/day), or budesonide (mean dose, 1192 mcg/day). Some of these inhaled corticosteroids were non-U.S.-approved formulations, and doses expressed may not be ex-actuator. The pre-study inhaled corticosteroid requirements were reduced by approximately 37% during a 5- to 7-week placebo run-in period designed to titrate patients toward their lowest effective inhaled corticosteroid dose. Treatment with montelukast sodium resulted in a further 47% reduction in mean inhaled corticosteroid dose compared with a mean reduction of 30% in the placebo group over the 12-week active treatment period (p≤0.05). It is not known whether the results of this study can be generalized to patients with asthma who require higher doses of inhaled corticosteroids or systemic corticosteroids. In another randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trial (n=642) in a similar population of adult patients previously maintained, but not adequately controlled, on inhaled corticosteroids (beclomethasone 336 mcg/day), the addition of montelukast sodium to beclomethasone resulted in statistically significant improvements in FEV compared with those patients who were continued on beclomethasone alone or those patients who were withdrawn from beclomethasone and treated with montelukast or placebo alone over the last 10 weeks of the 16-week, blinded treatment period. Patients who were randomized to treatment arms containing beclomethasone had statistically significantly better asthma control than those patients randomized to montelukast sodium alone or placebo alone as indicated by FEV , daytime asthma symptoms, PEFR, nocturnal awakenings due to asthma, and “as-needed” β-agonist requirements. In adult patients with asthma with documented aspirin sensitivity, nearly all of whom were receiving concomitant inhaled and/or oral corticosteroids, a 4-week, randomized, parallel-group trial (n=80) demonstrated that montelukast sodium, compared with placebo, resulted in significant improvement in parameters of asthma control. The magnitude of effect of montelukast sodium in aspirin-sensitive patients was similar to the effect observed in the general population of asthma patients studied. The effect of montelukast sodium on the bronchoconstrictor response to aspirin or other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in aspirin-sensitive asthmatic patients has not been evaluated . Exercise-Induced Bronchoconstriction - (Adults and Adolescents 15 years of age and older) The efficacy of montelukast sodium, 10 mg, when given as a single dose 2 hours before exercise for the prevention of EIB was investigated in three (U.S. and Multinational), randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover studies that included a total of 160 adult and adolescent patients 15 years of age and older with EIB. Exercise challenge testing was conducted at 2 hours, 8.5 or 12 hours, and 24 hours following administration of a single dose of study drug (montelukast sodium 10 mg or placebo). The primary endpoint was the mean maximum percent fall in FEV following the 2 hours post-dose exercise challenge in all three studies (Study A, Study B, and Study C). In Study A, a single dose of montelukast sodium 10 mg demonstrated a statistically significant protective benefit against EIB when taken 2 hours prior to exercise. Some patients were protected from EIB at 8.5 and 24 hours after administration; however, some patients were not. The results for the mean maximum percent fall at each timepoint in Study A are shown in TABLE 3 and are representative of the results from the other two studies. TABLE 3: Mean Maximum Percent Fall in FEV Following Exercise Challenge in Study A (N=47) ANOVA Model Time of exercise challenge following medication administration Mean Maximum percent fall in FEV Treatment difference % for montelukast sodium versus Placebo (95%CI) The efficacy of montelukast sodium for prevention of EIB in patients below 6 years of age has not been established. Daily administration of montelukast sodium for the chronic treatment of asthma has not been established to prevent acute episodes of EIB. In a 12-week, randomized, double-blind, parallel group study of 110 adult and adolescent asthmatics 15 years of age and older, with a mean baseline FEV percent of predicted of 83% and with documented exercise-induced exacerbation of asthma, treatment with montelukast sodium, 10 mg, once daily in the evening, resulted in a statistically significant reduction in mean maximal percent fall in FEV and mean time to recovery to within 5% of the pre-exercise FEV . Exercise challenge was conducted at the end of the dosing interval (i.e., 20 to 24 hours after the preceding dose). This effect was maintained throughout the 12-week treatment period indicating that tolerance did not occur. Montelukast sodium did not, however, prevent clinically significant deterioration in maximal percent fall in FEV after exercise (i.e., ≥20% decrease from pre-exercise baseline) in 52% of patients studied. In a separate crossover study in adults, a similar effect was observed after two once-daily 10-mg doses of montelukast sodium. The efficacy of montelukast sodium tablets for the treatment of seasonal allergic rhinitis was investigated in 5 similarly designed, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo- and active-controlled (loratadine) trials conducted in North America. The 5 trials enrolled a total of 5029 patients, of whom 1799 were treated with montelukast sodium tablets. Patients were 15 to 82 years of age with a history of seasonal allergic rhinitis, a positive skin test to at least one relevant seasonal allergen, and active symptoms of seasonal allergic rhinitis at study entry. The period of randomized treatment was 2 weeks in 4 trials and 4 weeks in one trial. The primary outcome variable was mean change from baseline in daytime nasal symptoms score (the average of individual scores of nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, nasal itching, sneezing) as assessed by patients on a 0-3 categorical scale. Four of the five trials showed a significant reduction in daytime nasal symptoms scores with montelukast sodium 10-mg tablets compared with placebo. The results of one trial are shown below. The median age in this trial was 35.0 years (range 15 to 81); 65.4% were females and 34.6% were males. The ethnic/racial distribution in this study was 83.1% Caucasian, 6.4% other origins, 5.8% Black, and 4.8% Hispanic. The mean changes from baseline in daytime nasal symptoms score in the treatment groups that received montelukast sodium tablets, loratadine, and placebo are shown in TABLE 4. The remaining three trials that demonstrated efficacy showed similar results.

The efficacy of montelukast sodium tablets for the treatment of perennial allergic rhinitis was investigated in 2 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies conducted in North America and Europe. The two studies enrolled a total of 3357 patients, of whom 1632 received montelukast sodium 10-mg tablets. Patients 15 to 82 years of age with perennial allergic rhinitis as confirmed by history and a positive skin test to at least one relevant perennial allergen (dust mites, animal dander, and/or mold spores), who had active symptoms at the time of study entry, were enrolled. In the study in which efficacy was demonstrated, the median age was 35 years (range 15 to 81); 64.1% were females and 35.9% were males. The ethnic/racial distribution in this study was 83.2% Caucasian, 8.1% Black, 5.4% Hispanic, 2.3% Asian, and 1.0% other origins. Montelukast sodium 10-mg tablets once daily was shown to significantly reduce symptoms of perennial allergic rhinitis over a 6-week treatment period (TABLE 5); in this study the primary outcome variable was mean change from baseline in daytime nasal symptoms score (the average of individual scores of nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, and sneezing). TABLE 5: Effects of Montelukast Sodium on Daytime Nasal Symptoms Score* in a Placebo-controlled Trial in Patients with Perennial Allergic Rhinitis (ANCOVA Model) Baseline Mean Score Difference Between Treatment and Placebo (95% CI) Least-Squares Mean * Average of individual scores of nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, nasal itching, sneezing as assessed by patients on a 0-3 categorical scale. The other 6-week study evaluated montelukast sodium 10 mg (n=626), placebo (n=609), and an active-control (cetirizine 10 mg; n=120). The primary analysis compared the mean change from baseline in daytime nasal symptoms score for montelukast sodium vs. placebo over the first 4 weeks of treatment; the study was not designed for statistical comparison between montelukast sodium and the active-control. The primary outcome variable included nasal itching in addition to nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, and sneezing. The estimated difference between montelukast sodium and placebo was -0.04 with a 95% CI of (-0.09, 0.01). The estimated difference between the active-control and placebo was -0.10 with a 95% CI of (-0.19, -0.01).

Tolerance to Tramadol/paracetamol may develop, which means that the effect of the medicine may decrease. If this happens, more may be needed to maintain the same effect. Tell your doctor or pharmacist as soon as possible if you do not feel well while you are taking this medicine. This medicine helps most people with pain, but it may have unwanted side effects in a few people. All medicines can have side effects. Sometimes they are serious, most of the time they are not. You may need medical attention if you get some of the side effects. Do not be alarmed by the following lists of side effects. You may not experience any of them. Ask your doctor or pharmacist to answer any questions you may have. Tell your doctor if you notice any of the following side effects: digestion problems, such as constipation, wind, diarrhoea, stomach pain or vomiting increase in pulse or blood pressure, heart rate or rhythm disorders tingling, numbness or feeling of pins and needles in the limbs, ringing in the ear, involuntary muscle twitching depression, nightmares, hallucinations or memory lapses fits, difficulties in carrying out coordinated movements The following are side effects which have been reported by people using ONLY tramadol or ONLY paracetamol. Tell your doctor as soon as possible if you notice any of the following: feeling faint when getting up from a lying or sitting position If you experience any of the following, stop taking your medicine and contact your doctor immediately or go to Accident and Emergency at your nearest hospital: shortness of breath, wheezing or difficulty breathing; swelling of the face, lips, tongue, throat or other parts of the body; rash, itching or hives on the skin (signs of an allergic reaction) In rare cases, taking strong pain killers may make you become dependent on them, making it hard to stop taking it.

2909f228-c9be-4a3b-86a7-dd41eaf764b7,"Información sobre medicamentos proporcionada por: Fentanyl nasal spray is used to treat breakthrough cancer pain. Breakthrough episodes of cancer pain are the flares of pain which “breaks through” the medication used to control the persistent pain. Fentanyl belongs to the group of medicines called narcotic analgesics, which are medicines used to relieve pain. Nasal fentanyl is only used in patients who are already taking narcotic analgesics and who are tolerant to opioid medicines for cancer pain. Fentanyl acts in the central nervous system (CNS) to relieve pain. Some of its side effects are also caused by actions in the CNS. When a narcotic is used for a long time, it may become habit-forming (causing mental or physical dependence). However, people who have continuing pain should not let the fear of dependence keep them from using narcotics to relieve their pain. Mental dependence (addiction) is not likely to occur when narcotics are used for this purpose. Physical dependence may lead to withdrawal side effects if treatment is stopped suddenly. However, severe withdrawal side effects can usually be prevented by reducing the dose gradually over a period of time before treatment is stopped completely. Your doctor will take this into consideration when deciding on the amount of nasal fentanyl you should receive. This medicine is available only under a restricted distribution program called TIRF REMS Program. This product is available in the following dosage forms: In deciding to use a medicine, the risks of taking the medicine must be weighed against the good it will do. This is a decision you and your doctor will make. For this medicine, the following should be considered: Tell your doctor if you have ever had any unusual or allergic reaction to this medicine or any other medicines. Also tell your health care professional if you have any other types of allergies, such as to foods, dyes, preservatives, or animals. For non-prescription products, read the label or package ingredients carefully. Appropriate studies have not been performed on the relationship of age to the effects of nasal fentanyl in the pediatric population. Safety and efficacy have not been established. Appropriate studies performed to date have not demonstrated geriatric-specific problems that would limit the usefulness of nasal fentanyl in the elderly. However, elderly patients may be more sensitive to the effects of narcotic analgesics than younger adults and are more likely to have age-related kidney disease, which may require caution and an adjustment in the dose for patients receiving nasal fentanyl. There are no adequate studies in women for determining infant risk when using this medication during breastfeeding. Weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks before taking this medication while breastfeeding. Although certain medicines should not be used together at all, in other cases two different medicines may be used together even if an interaction might occur. In these cases, your doctor may want to change the dose, or other precautions may be necessary. When you are taking this medicine, it is especially important that your healthcare professional know if you are taking any of the medicines listed below. The following interactions have been selected on the basis of their potential significance and are not necessarily all-inclusive. Using this medicine with any of the following medicines is not recommended. Your doctor may decide not to treat you with this medication or change some of the other medicines you take. Using this medicine with any of the following medicines is usually not recommended, but may be required in some cases. If both medicines are prescribed together, your doctor may change the dose or how often you use one or both of the medicines. Certain medicines should not be used at or around the time of eating food or eating certain types of food since interactions may occur. Using alcohol or tobacco with certain medicines may also cause interactions to occur. The following interactions have been selected on the basis of their potential significance and are not necessarily all-inclusive. Using this medicine with any of the following is usually not recommended, but may be unavoidable in some cases. If used together, your doctor may change the dose or how often you use this medicine, or give you special instructions about the use of food, alcohol, or tobacco. The presence of other medical problems may affect the use of this medicine. Make sure you tell your doctor if you have any other medical problems, especially: Breathing problems (eg, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD], cor pulmonale, hypoxia) or Drug dependence, especially with narcotics, history of or Seizures, history of—Use with caution. May increase risk for more serious side effects. Pancreatitis (inflammation or swelling of the pancreas), acute—Use with caution. May make these conditions worse. Liver disease—Use with caution. The effects may be increased because of slower removal of the medicine from the body. Lung or breathing problems, severe (eg, bronchial asthma, respiratory depression) or Stomach or bowel blockage (including paralytic ileus), known or suspected—Should not be used in patients with these conditions. Fentanyl nasal sprays are for use in opioid-tolerant patients only. If you are not sure whether or not you are opioid-tolerant, check with your doctor before using this medicine. This medicine should come with a Medication Guide and patient instructions. Read and follow these instructions carefully. Ask your doctor if you have any questions. This medicine is for use only in the nose. Do not get any of it in your eyes or on your skin. If it does get on these areas, rinse it off with water right away. Fentanyl nasal spray works differently than other fentanyl products, even at the same dose (number of milligrams). Do not substitute or convert it to other products containing fentanyl. Keep the spray in the child-resistant container until ready to use. If you are using the nasal spray for the first time, you will need to prime the spray. To do this, you should release four sprays into the pouch. Now it is ready to use. If you have not used the medicine for more than 5 days, re-prime by spraying once into the pouch. Before using this medicine, gently blow your nose to clear the nostrils. Insert the tip of the Lazanda® bottle into the nose. Point towards the bridge of the nose and tilt the bottle slightly. Press down firmly on the finger grips until you hear a ""click"" sound and the number in the dose counter window adds up. This confirms a spray has been taken. Return the spray bottle to the child-resistant container after each use. The dose of this medicine will be different for different patients. Follow your doctor's orders or the directions on the label. The following information includes only the average doses of this medicine. If your dose is different, do not change it unless your doctor tells you to do so. The amount of medicine that you take depends on the strength of the medicine. Also, the number of doses you take each day, the time allowed between doses, and the length of time you take the medicine depend on the medical problem for which you are using the medicine. For nasal dosage form (spray): For cancer pain: Adults—At first, 100 micrograms (mcg) or 1 spray in one nostril during an episode of breakthrough cancer pain. Your doctor may increase your dose as needed and tolerated, up to a maximum of 800 mcg or 1 spray containing 400 mcg of fentanyl in each nostril. However, patients should not use more than 4 doses per 24 hours. Wait at least 2 hours before treating another episode of breakthrough cancer pain. If pain relief is not achieved within 30 minutes, a rescue medicine may be used as directed by your doctor. Patients should record their use over several episodes of breakthrough cancer pain and review their experience with their doctor to determine if a dosage adjustment is warranted. Children—Use and dose must be determined by your doctor. Store the medicine in a closed container at room temperature, away from heat, moisture, and direct light. Keep from freezing. Do not keep outdated medicine or medicine no longer needed. Ask your healthcare professional how you should dispose of any medicine you do not use. Ask your pharmacist about the best way to dispose of medicine that you do not use. Throw away any spray bottle and start using a new one if you have used 8 sprays or if it has been 60 days or more since it has been used. Dispose any used, partially used, or unneeded spray bottles by emptying and spraying the remaining solution into the pouch. The sealed pouch and the empty bottle should be placed in a child-resistant container before discarding it in the trash can. Wash your hands with soap and water right away after handling the pouch. It is very important that your doctor check your progress at regular visits. This will allow your doctor to make sure that this medicine is working properly and to check you for any problems or unwanted effects that may be caused by this medicine. Do not use Lazanda® if you need pain medicine for just a short time, such as during a headache or migraine attack, tooth pain, or when recovering from surgery or an injury. After you have been using this medicine for awhile, ""breakthrough"" pain may occur more often than usual, and it may not be relieved by your regular dose of medicine. If this occurs, do not increase the amount of nasal fentanyl or other narcotic that you are using without first checking with your doctor. Using too much nasal fentanyl, or taking too much of another narcotic while using nasal fentanyl, may cause an overdose. If this occurs, get emergency help right away. An overdose can cause severe breathing problems (breathing may even stop), unconsciousness, and death. Serious signs of an overdose include very slow breathing (fewer than 8 breaths a minute) and drowsiness that is so severe that you are not able to answer when spoken to or, if asleep, cannot be awakened. Other signs of an overdose may include cold, clammy skin, low blood pressure, pinpoint pupils of the eyes, and slow heartbeat. It may be best to have a family member or a friend check on you several times a day when you start using a narcotic regularly, and whenever your dose is increased, so that he or she can get help for you if you cannot do so yourself. Lazanda® contains an amount of fentanyl which can be fatal to a child. Patients and their caregivers should keep this medicine out of the reach of children, and discard used and unused bottle sprays in its child-resistant container properly. This medicine will add to the effects of alcohol and other central nervous system (CNS) depressants. This effect may last for a few days after you stop using this medicine. CNS depressants are medicines that slow down the nervous system, which may cause drowsiness or make you less alert. Some examples of CNS depressants are antihistamines or medicine for hay fever, allergies, or colds, sedatives, tranquilizers, benzodiazepines, sleeping medicines, other prescription pain medicine or narcotics, barbiturates or seizure medicine, muscle relaxants, or anesthetics (numbing medicines), including some dental anesthetics. Check with your doctor before taking any of the other medicines listed above while you are using this medicine. Fentanyl may cause some people to become drowsy, dizzy, or lightheaded, or to feel a false sense of well-being. Make sure you know how you react to this medicine before you drive, use machines, or do anything else that could be dangerous if you are dizzy or not alert and clearheaded. These effects usually go away after a few days of treatment, when your body gets used to the medicine. However, check with your doctor if drowsiness that is severe enough to interfere with your activities continues for more than a few days. This medicine may cause serious allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis. Anaphylaxis can be life-threatening and requires immediate medical attention. Call your doctor right away if you have a rash, itching, hoarseness, trouble breathing, trouble swallowing, or any swelling of your hands, face, or mouth while you are using this medicine. This medicine may be habit-forming. If you feel that the medicine is not working as well, do not use more than your prescribed dose. Call your doctor for instructions. Using narcotics for a long time may cause severe constipation. To prevent this, your doctor may tell you to take laxatives, drink a lot of fluids, or increase the amount of fiber in your diet. Be sure to follow the directions carefully, because continuing constipation can lead to more serious problems. Do not use this medicine if you have taken a monoamine oxidase (MAOI) inhibitor in the previous 2 weeks. Some examples of MAO inhibitors are isocarboxazid (Marplan®), phenelzine (Nardil®), selegiline (Eldepryl®), or tranylcypromine (Parnate®). If you use the 2 medicines close together it may cause serious side effects like confusion, agitation, restlessness, stomach or intestinal symptoms, a sudden high temperature, an extremely high blood pressure, or severe convulsions. Using this medicine while you are pregnant may cause serious unwanted effects in your newborn baby. Tell your doctor right away if you think you are pregnant or if you plan to become pregnant while using this medicine. Using too much of this medicine may cause reduced infertility (unable to have children). Talk with your doctor before using this medicine if you plan to have children. Do not eat grapefruit or drink grapefruit juice while you are using this medicine. Grapefruit and grapefruit juice may change the amount of this medicine that is absorbed in the body. Do not take other medicines unless they have been discussed with your doctor. This includes prescription or nonprescription (over-the-counter [OTC]) medicines and herbal or vitamin supplements. Along with its needed effects, a medicine may cause some unwanted effects. Although not all of these side effects may occur, if they do occur they may need medical attention. Check with your doctor immediately if any of the following side effects occur: bloating or swelling of the face, arms, hands, lower legs, or feet sudden shortness of breath or troubled breathing swelling of the eyelids, face, lips, hands, or feet Some side effects may occur that usually do not need medical attention. These side effects may go away during treatment as your body adjusts to the medicine. Also, your health care professional may be able to tell you about ways to prevent or reduce some of these side effects. Check with your health care professional if any of the following side effects continue or are bothersome or if you have any questions about them: Other side effects not listed may also occur in some patients. If you notice any other effects, check with your healthcare professional. Call your doctor for medical advice about side effects. You may report side effects to the FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088.

11ab18a8-9333-4f7e-a2da-e246fbcdeac1,"Asmanex Twisthaler 200 micrograms Inhalation Powder Summary of Product Characteristics Updated 12-Dec-2017 | Merck Sharp & Dohme Limited 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 6.6 Special precautions for disposal and other handling 9. Date of first authorisation/renewal of the authorisation Asmanex® Twisthaler® 200 micrograms Inhalation Powder Each delivered dose contains 200 micrograms of mometasone furoate. The maximum recommended daily dose contains lactose 4.64 mg per day.For the full list of excipients, see 6.1. Inhalation powder.White to off-white powder agglomerates. Asmanex Twisthaler 200 micrograms Inhalation Powder is indicated in adults and adolescents 12 years of age and older for regular treatment to control persistent asthma. Dosage recommendations are based on severity of asthma (see criteria below).Patients with persistent mild to moderate asthma: The recommended starting dose for most of these patients is 400 micrograms once daily. Data suggest that better asthma control is achieved if once daily dosing is administered in the evening. Some patients may be more adequately controlled on 400 micrograms daily, given in two divided doses (200 micrograms twice daily). The dose of Asmanex Twisthaler 200 micrograms Inhalation Powder should be individualised and titrated to the lowest dose at which effective control of asthma is maintained. Dose reduction to 200 micrograms once daily given in the evening may be an effective maintenance dose for some patients.: The recommended starting dose is 400 micrograms twice daily, which is the maximum recommended dose. When symptoms are controlled, titrate Asmanex Twisthaler 200 micrograms Inhalation Powder to the lowest effective dose.In patients with severe asthma and previously receiving oral corticosteroids, Asmanex Twisthaler 200 micrograms Inhalation Powder will be initiated concurrently with the patient's usual maintenance dose of systemic corticosteroid. After approximately one week, gradual withdrawal of the systemic corticosteroid can be initiated by reducing the daily or alternate daily dose. The next reduction is made after an interval of one to two weeks, depending on the response of the patient. Generally, these decrements are not to exceed 2.5 mg of prednisone daily, or its equivalent. A slow rate of withdrawal is strongly recommended. During withdrawal of oral corticosteroids, patients must be carefully monitored for signs of unstable asthma, including objective measures of airway function, and for adrenal insufficiency (see 4.4).The patient should be instructed that Asmanex Twisthaler 200 micrograms Inhalation Powder is not intended to be used ""on demand"" as a reliever medication to treat acute symptoms and that this product must be taken regularly to maintain therapeutic benefit even when he or she is asymptomatic. : symptoms > 1 time a week but < 1 time per day; exacerbations may affect activity and sleep; night-time asthma symptoms > 2 times a month; PEF or FEV > 80 % predicted, variability 20 – 30 %: symptoms daily; exacerbations affect activity and sleep; night-time asthma symptoms > 1 time a week; daily use of short-acting beta–agonist; PEF or FEV > 60-< 80 % predicted, variability > 30 %: continuous symptoms; frequent exacerbations; frequent night-time asthma symptoms; physical activities limited by asthma symptoms; PEF or FEV≤ 60% predicted, variability > 30% The safety and efficacy of Asmanex Twisthaler 200 mcg in children less than 12 years of age have not been established. No data are available. No dosage adjustment is necessary. This product is for inhalation use only.The patient needs to be instructed how to use the inhaler correctly (see below).Patients should be in an upright position when inhaling the product.Prior to removing the cap, be sure the counter and the pointer on the cap are aligned. The inhaler can be opened by removing the white cap while holding unit upright (the pink-coloured base down), gripping the base, and twisting the cap counterclockwise. The counter will register the number down by one count. Instruct the patient to place the inhaler in the mouth, closing the lips around the mouthpiece, and to breathe in rapidly and deeply. Then, the inhaler is removed from the mouth, and the breath held for about 10 seconds, or as long as is comfortable. The patient is not to breathe out through the inhaler. To close, while holding the unit in an upright position, replace the cap immediately after each inhalation, loading for the next dose by rotating the cap clockwise while gently pressing down until a click sound is heard and the cap is fully closed. The arrow on the cap will be fully aligned with the counter window. After inhalation, patients are advised to rinse the mouth and spit out the water. This helps to reduce the risk of candidiasis.The digital display will indicate when the last dose has been delivered; after dose 01, the counter will read 00 and the cap will lock, at which time the unit must be discarded. The inhaler is to be kept clean and dry at all times. The outside of the mouthpiece can be cleaned with a dry cloth or tissue; do not wash the inhaler; avoid contact with water.For detailed instructions see Package Leaflet. Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. During clinical trials, oral candidiasis, which is associated with the use of this class of medicinal product, occurred in some patients. This infection may require treatment with appropriate antifungal therapy and in some patients discontinuance of Asmanex Twisthaler 200 micrograms Inhalation Powder may be necessary (see 4.8). Systemic effects of inhaled corticosteroids may occur, particularly at high doses prescribed for prolonged periods. These effects are much less likely to occur than with oral corticosteroids and may vary in individual patients and between different corticosteroid preparations. Possible systemic effects may include Cushing's syndrome, Cushingoid features, adrenal suppression, growth retardation in children and adolescents, decrease in bone mineral density, cataracts, glaucoma, and more rarely, a range of psychological or behavioural effects including psychomotor hyperactivity, sleep disorders, anxiety, depression or aggression (particularly in children). Therefore, it is important that the dose of inhaled corticosteroid is titrated to the lowest dose at which effective control of asthma is maintained.Visual disturbance may be reported with systemic and topical (including, intranasal, inhaled and intraocular) corticosteroid use. If a patient presents with symptoms such as blurred vision or other visual disturbances, the patient should be considered for referral to an ophthalmologist for evaluation of possible causes of visual disturbances which may include cataract, glaucoma or rare diseases such as central serous chorioretinopathy (CSCR) which have been reported after use of systemic and topical corticosteroids. Particular care is needed for patients who are transferred from systemically active corticosteroids to inhaled mometasone furoate, because deaths due to adrenal insufficiency have occurred in asthmatic patients during and after transfer from systemic corticosteroids to less systemically available inhaled corticosteroids. After withdrawal from systemic corticosteroids, a number of months are required for recovery of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis functionDuring dose reduction some patients may experience symptoms of systemic corticosteroid withdrawal, e.g. joint and/or muscular pain, lassitude and depression, despite maintenance or even improvement in pulmonary function. Such patients are to be encouraged to continue with both Asmanex Twisthaler 200 micrograms Inhalation Powder treatment and withdrawal of the systemic corticosteroids, unless objective signs of adrenal insufficiency are present. If evidence of adrenal insufficiency occurs, increase the systemic corticosteroid doses temporarily and thereafter continue withdrawal more slowly.During periods of stress, including trauma, surgery, or infection, or a severe asthma attack, patients transferred from systemic corticosteroids will require supplementary treatment with a short course of systemic corticosteroids, which is gradually tapered as symptoms subside.It is recommended that such patients carry a supply of oral corticosteroids and a warning card indicating their need and recommended dosage of systemic corticosteroids during stressful periods. Periodic testing of adrenocortical function, particularly measurement of early morning plasma cortisol levels, is recommended.Transfer of patients from systemic corticosteroid therapy to Asmanex Twisthaler 200 micrograms Inhalation Powder may unmask pre-existing allergic conditions previously suppressed by systemic corticosteroid therapy. If this occurs, symptomatic treatment is recommended. Use of Asmanex Twisthaler 200 micrograms Inhalation Powder will often permit control of asthma symptoms with less suppression of HPA axis function than therapeutically equivalent oral doses of prednisone. Although mometasone furoate has demonstrated low systemic bioavailability at the recommended dosage, it is absorbed into the circulation and can be systemically active at higher doses. Thus, to maintain its profile of limited potential for HPA axis suppression, recommended doses of this product must not be exceeded, and must be titrated to the lowest effective dose for each individual patient. As with other inhaled asthma medications, bronchospasm may occur with an immediate increase in wheezing after dosing. If bronchospasm occurs following dosing with the Asmanex Twisthaler 200 micrograms Inhalation Powder, immediate treatment with a fast-acting inhaled bronchodilator is recommended; thus, the patient should be told to keep an appropriate bronchodilator inhaler on hand at all times. In such cases, treatment with Asmanex Twisthaler 200 micrograms Inhalation Powder is then discontinued immediately and alternative therapy instituted.Mometasone furoate is not to be regarded as a bronchodilator and is not indicated for rapid relief of bronchospasm or asthma attacks; thus, patients should be instructed to keep an appropriate short-acting bronchodilator inhaler on hand for use when needed.Instruct patients to contact their physician immediately when asthmatic episodes are not responsive to bronchodilators during treatment with this product or if peak-flow falls. This may indicate worsening asthma. During such episodes, patients may require systemic corticosteroid therapy. In these patients, dose titration to the maximum recommended maintenance dose of inhaled mometasone furoate may be considered. Use Asmanex Twisthaler 200 micrograms Inhalation Powder with caution, if at all, in patients with untreated active or quiescent tuberculous infections of the respiratory tract, or in untreated fungal, bacterial, systemic viral infections or ocular herpes simplex.Advise patients who are receiving corticosteroids or other immunosuppressant medicines of the risk of exposure to certain infections (e.g., chickenpox, measles) and of the importance of obtaining medical advice if such exposure occurs. This is of particular importance in children. A reduction of growth velocity in children or adolescents may occur as a result of inadequate control of chronic diseases such as asthma or from use of corticosteroids for treatment. Physicians are advised to closely follow the growth of adolescents taking corticosteroids by any route and weigh the benefits of corticosteroid therapy and asthma control against the possibility of growth suppression if an adolescent's growth appears slowed.If growth is slowed, review therapy with the aim of reducing the dose of inhaled corticosteroids if possible, to the lowest dose at which effective control of symptoms is achieved. In addition, consideration should be given to referring the patient to a paediatric respiratory specialist. When using inhaled corticosteroids, the possibility for clinically significant adrenal suppression may occur, especially after prolonged treatment with high doses and particularly with higher than recommended doses. This is to be considered during periods of stress or elective surgery, when additional systemic corticosteroids may be needed. However, during clinical trials there was no evidence of HPA axis suppression after prolonged treatment with inhaled mometasone furoate at doses of ≤ 800 micrograms per day. Lack of response or severe exacerbations of asthma should be treated by increasing the maintenance dose of inhaled mometasone furoate, and if necessary, by giving a systemic corticosteroid and/or an antibiotic if infection is suspected, and by use of beta-agonist therapy.The patient should be advised against abrupt discontinuation of therapy with Asmanex Twisthaler 200 micrograms Inhalation Powder.There is no evidence that the administration of this product in amounts greater than recommended doses increases efficacy. The maximum recommended daily dose contains lactose 4.64 mg per day. This amount does not normally cause problems in lactose intolerant people. 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction Due to the very low plasma concentration achieved after inhaled dosing, clinically significant drug interactions are unlikely. However, there may be a potential for increased systemic exposure to mometasone furoate when strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (eg ketoconazole, itraconazole, nelfinavir, ritonavir, cobicistat) are co-administered. Co-administration of inhaled mometasone furoate with the potent CYP3A4 enzyme inhibitor ketoconazole causes small but marginally significant (p= 0.09) decreases in serum cortisol AUC and resulted in approximately a 2-fold increase in plasma concentration of mometasone furoate.Interaction studies have only been performed in adults. Co-treatment with CYP3A inhibitors, including cobicistat-containing products, is expected to increase the risk of systemic side-effects of corticosteroids. The combination should be avoided unless the benefit outweighs the increased risk of systemic corticosteroid side-effects, in which case patients should be monitored for systemic corticosteroid side-effects. There are no or limited amount of data from the use of mometasone furoate in pregnant women. Studies in animals with mometasone furoate, like other glucocorticoids, have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3).As with other inhaled corticosteroid preparations, mometasone furoate is not to be used during pregnancy unless the potential benefit to the mother justifies the potential risk to the mother, fetus or infant. Infants born of mothers who received corticosteroids during pregnancy are to be observed carefully for hypoadrenalism. It is unknown whether mometasone furoate/metabolites are excreted in human milk. Available pharmacodynamic/toxicological data in animals have shown excretion of mometasone furoate in milk (see section 5.3). A decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to discontinue/abstain from mometasone furoate therapy taking into account the benefit of breast feeding for the child and the benefit of therapy for the woman. In reproductive studies in rats, there was no effect on fertility (see section 5.3). Asmanex Twisthaler 200 micrograms Inhalation Powder has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. In placebo-controlled clinical trials, oral candidiasis was very common (> 10%) in the 400 micrograms twice daily treatment group; other common (1-10%), treatment-related undesirable effects were pharyngitis, headache and dysphonia. Treatment related undesirable effects seen in clinical trials and post-marketing reporting with Asmanex Twisthaler Inhalation Powder use are listed below. The adverse reactions reported during clinical trials and the post-marketing period are listed in the following table by treatment regimen, severity, System Organ Class and Preferred Term. Frequencies are defined as very common (≥ 1/10), common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10), uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100), rare (≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000), very rare (< 1/10,000) and not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). Hypersensitivity reactions including rash, pruritis, angioedema and anaphylactic reaction Psychomotor hyperactivity, sleep disorders, anxiety, depression or aggression Asthma aggravation including cough, dyspnea, wheezing and bronchospasm General disorders and administration site conditions In patients dependent on oral corticosteroids, who were treated with Asmanex Twisthaler 400 micrograms twice daily for 12 weeks, oral candidiasis occurred in 20 %, and dysphonia in 7 %. These effects were considered treatment-related.Uncommonly reported adverse events were dry mouth and throat, dyspepsia, weight increase and palpitations.As with other inhalation therapy, bronchospasm may occur (see 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use). This should be treated immediately with a fast-acting inhaled bronchodilator. Asmanex should be discontinued immediately, the patient assessed, and if necessary alternative therapy instituted.Systemic effects of inhaled corticosteroids may occur, particularly when prescribed at high doses for prolonged periods. These may include adrenal suppression, growth retardation in children and adolescents, and decrease in bone mineral density.As with other inhaled corticosteroids, rare cases of glaucoma, increased intraocular pressure and/or cataracts have been reported.As with other glucocorticoid products, the potential for hypersensitivity reactions including rashes, urticaria, pruritus and erythema and oedema of the eyes, face, lips and throat should be considered. Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the Yellow Card Scheme at: www.mhra.gov.uk/yellowcard or search for MHRA Yellow Card in the Google Play or Apple App Store. Because of the low systemic bioavailability of this product, overdose is unlikely to require any therapy other than observation, followed by initiation of the appropriate prescribed dosage. Inhalation or oral administration of excessive doses of corticosteroids may lead to suppression of HPA axis function. Management of the inhalation of mometasone furoate in doses in excess of the recommended dose regimens should include monitoring of adrenal function. Mometasone furoate therapy in a dose sufficient to control asthma can be continued. Pharmacotherapeutic group: Other Antiasthmatics, Inhalants, - Glucocorticoids, ATC code R03B A07 Mometasone furoate is a topical glucocorticoid with local anti-inflammatory properties.It is likely that much of the mechanism for the effects of mometasone furoate lies in its ability to inhibit the release of mediators of the inflammatory cascade., mometasone furoate inhibits the release of leukotrienes from leukocytes of allergic patients. In cell culture, mometasone furoate demonstrated high potency in inhibition of synthesis and release of IL-1, IL-5, IL-6, and TNF-alpha; it is also a potent inhibitor of LT production and in addition it is an extremely potent inhibitor of the production of the Th cytokines, IL-4 and IL-5, from human CD4+ T-cells.Mometasone furoate has been shown to exhibit a binding affinity for the human glucocorticoid receptor which is approximately 12 times that of dexamethasone, 7 times that of triamcinolone acetonide, 5 times that of budesonide, and 1.5 times that of fluticasone.In a clinical trial, inhaled mometasone furoate has been shown to reduce airway reactivity to adenosine monophosphate in hyperreactive patients. In another trial, pretreatment using the Asmanex Twisthaler for five days significantly attenuated the early and late phase reactions following inhaled allergen challenge and also reduced allergen-induced hyperresponsiveness to methacholine.Inhaled mometasone furoate treatment was also shown to attenuate the increase in inflammatory cells (total and activated eosinophils) in induced sputum following allergen and methacholine challenge. The clinical significance of these findings is not known. In asthmatic patients, repeated administration of inhaled mometasone furoate for 4 weeks at doses of 200 micrograms twice daily to 1200 micrograms once daily showed no evidence of clinically relevant HPA-axis suppression at any dose level and was associated with detectable systemic activity only at a dose of 1600 micrograms per day. In long-term clinical trials using doses up to 800 micrograms per day, there was no evidence of HPA axis suppression, as assessed by reductions in morning plasma cortisol levels or abnormal responses to cosyntropin.In a 28 day clinical trial involving 60 asthmatic patients, administration of Asmanex Twisthaler at doses of 400 micrograms, 800 micrograms or 1200 micrograms once daily, or 200 micrograms twice daily, did not result in a statistically significant decrease in 24-hour plasma cortisol AUC.The potential systemic effect of twice daily dosing of mometasone furoate was evaluated in an active and placebo controlled trial that compared 24-hour plasma cortisol AUC in 64 adult asthmatic patients treated for 28 days with mometasone furoate 400 micrograms twice daily, 800 micrograms twice daily, or prednisone 10 mg once daily. Mometasone furoate 400 micrograms twice daily treatment reduced plasma cortisol AUC values from placebo values by 10 - 25 %. Mometasone furoate 800 micrograms twice daily reduced plasma cortisol AUC from placebo values by 21 - 40 %. Reduction in cortisol was significantly greater after prednisone 10 mg once daily than with placebo or either of the mometasone treatment groups.Double-blind placebo-controlled trials of 12-weeks duration have shown that treatment with Asmanex Twisthaler at delivered doses within the range of 200 micrograms (once-daily in the evening) - 800 micrograms per day resulted in improved lung function as measured by FEV and peak expiratory flow, improved asthma symptom control, and decreased need for inhaled beta-agonist. Improved lung function was observed within 24 hours of the start of treatment in some patients, although maximum benefit was not achieved before 1 to 2 weeks or longer. Improved lung function was maintained for the duration of treatment. The systemic bioavailability of mometasone furoate following oral inhalation in healthy volunteers is low, due to poor absorption from the lungs and the gut and extensive pre-systemic metabolism. Plasma concentrations of mometasone following inhalation at the recommended doses of 200 micrograms to 400 micrograms per day were generally near or below the limit of quantification (50 pg/ml) of the analytical assay and were highly variable. After intravenous bolus administration, the Vis 332 l. The protein binding for mometasone furoate is high, 98 % to 99 % in concentration range of 5 to 500 ng/ml. The portion of an inhaled mometasone furoate dose that is swallowed and absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract undergoes extensive metabolism to multiple metabolites. There are no major metabolites detectable in plasma. In human liver microsomes, mometasone is metabolised by cytochrome P-450 3A4 (CYP3A4). After intravenous bolus administration, mometasone furoate has a terminal elimination T of approximately 4.5 hours. A radiolabelled, orally inhaled dose is excreted mainly in the feces (74 %) and to a lesser extent in the urine (8 %). Adverse reactions not observed in clinical studies, but seen in animals at exposure levels similar to clinical exposure levels and with possible relevance to clinical use were as follows. All toxicological effects observed are typical of this class of compounds and are related to exaggerated pharmacological effects of glucocorticoids. Like other glucocorticoids, mometasone furoate is a teratogen in rodents and rabbits. Effects noted were umbilical hernia in rats, cleft palate in mice, and gall bladder agenesis, umbilical hernia, and flexed front paws in rabbits. There were also reductions in maternal body weight gains, effects on fetal growth (lower fetal body weight and/or delayed ossification) in rats, rabbits and mice, and reduced offspring survival in mice. In studies of reproductive function, subcutaneous mometasone furoate, at 15 micrograms/kg prolonged gestation and prolonged and difficult labour occurred with a reduction in offspring survival and body weight or body weight gain. There was no effect on fertility. Mometasone furoate is excreted in low doses in the milk of suckling rats. In long-term carcinogenicity studies in mice and rats, inhaled mometasone furoate demonstrated no statistically significant increase in the incidence of tumours.

Date of first authorisation/renewal of the authorisation Asmanex® Twisthaler® 400 micrograms Inhalation Powder Each delivered dose contains 400 micrograms of mometasone furoate. The maximum recommended daily dose contains lactose 4.64 mg per day.For the full list of excipients, see 6.1. Inhalation powder.White to off-white powder agglomerates. Asmanex Twisthaler 400 micrograms Inhalation Powder is indicated in adults and adolescents 12 years of age and older for regular treatment to control persistent asthma. Dosage recommendations are based on severity of asthma (see criteria below).Patients with persistent mild to moderate asthma: The recommended starting dose for most of these patients is 400 micrograms once daily. Data suggest that better asthma control is achieved if once daily dosing is administered in the evening. Some patients may be more adequately controlled on 400 micrograms daily, given in two divided doses (200 micrograms twice daily). (A formulation of Asmanex Twisthaler 200 micrograms Inhalation Powder is also available.)The dose of Asmanex Twisthaler 400 micrograms Inhalation Powder should be individualised and titrated to the lowest dose at which effective control of asthma is maintained. Dose reduction to 200 micrograms once daily given in the evening may be an effective maintenance dose for some patients.: The recommended starting dose is 400 micrograms twice daily, which is the maximum recommended dose. When symptoms are controlled, titrate Asmanex Twisthaler 400 micrograms Inhalation Powder to the lowest effective dose.In patients with severe asthma and previously receiving oral corticosteroids, Asmanex Twisthaler 400 micrograms Inhalation Powder will be initiated concurrently with the patient's usual maintenance dose of systemic corticosteroid. After approximately one week, gradual withdrawal of the systemic corticosteroid can be initiated by reducing the daily or alternate daily dose. The next reduction is made after an interval of one to two weeks, depending on the response of the patient. Generally, these decrements are not to exceed 2.5 mg of prednisone daily, or its equivalent. A slow rate of withdrawal is strongly recommended. During withdrawal of oral corticosteroids, patients must be carefully monitored for signs of unstable asthma, including objective measures of airway function, and for adrenal insufficiency (see 4.4).The patient should be instructed that Asmanex Twisthaler 400 micrograms Inhalation Powder is not intended to be used ""on demand"" as a reliever medication to treat acute symptoms and that this product must be taken regularly to maintain therapeutic benefit even when he or she is asymptomatic. : symptoms > 1 time a week but < 1 time per day; exacerbations may affect activity and sleep; night-time asthma symptoms > 2 times a month; PEF or FEV > 80 % predicted, variability 20 – 30 %: symptoms daily; exacerbations affect activity and sleep; night-time asthma symptoms > 1 time a week; daily use of short-acting beta–agonist; PEF or FEV > 60-< 80 % predicted, variability > 30 %: continuous symptoms; frequent exacerbations; frequent night-time asthma symptoms; physical activities limited by asthma symptoms; PEF or FEV≤ 60% predicted, variability > 30% The safety and efficacy of Asmanex Twisthaler 400 mcg in children less than 12 years of age have not been established. No data are available. No dosage adjustment is necessary. This product is for inhalation use only.The patient needs to be instructed how to use the inhaler correctly (see below).Patients should be in an upright position when inhaling the product.Prior to removing the cap, be sure the counter and the pointer on the cap are aligned. The inhaler can be opened by removing the white cap while holding unit upright (the maroon-coloured base down), gripping the base, and twisting the cap counterclockwise. The counter will register the number down by one count. Instruct the patient to place the inhaler in the mouth, closing the lips around the mouthpiece, and to breathe in rapidly and deeply. Then, the inhaler is removed from the mouth, and the breath held for about 10 seconds, or as long as is comfortable. The patient is not to breathe out through the inhaler. To close, while holding the unit in an upright position, replace the cap immediately after each inhalation, loading for the next dose by rotating the cap clockwise while gently pressing down until a click sound is heard and the cap is fully closed. The arrow on the cap will be fully aligned with the counter window. After inhalation, patients are advised to rinse the mouth and spit out the water. This helps to reduce the risk of candidiasis.The digital display will indicate when the last dose has been delivered; after dose 01, the counter will read 00 and the cap will lock, at which time the unit must be discarded. The inhaler is to be kept clean and dry at all times. The outside of the mouthpiece can be cleaned with a dry cloth or tissue; do not wash the inhaler; avoid contact with water.For detailed instructions see Package Leaflet. Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. During clinical trials, oral candidiasis, which is associated with the use of this class of medicinal product, occurred in some patients. This infection may require treatment with appropriate antifungal therapy and in some patients discontinuance of Asmanex Twisthaler 400 micrograms Inhalation Powder may be necessary (see 4.8). Systemic effects of inhaled corticosteroids may occur, particularly at high doses prescribed for prolonged periods. These effects are much less likely to occur than with oral corticosteroids and may vary in individual patients and between different corticosteroid preparations. Possible systemic effects may include Cushing's syndrome, Cushingoid features, adrenal suppression, growth retardation in children and adolescents, decrease in bone mineral density, cataracts glaucoma, and more rarely, a range of psychological or behavioural effects including psychomotor hyperactivity, sleep disorders, anxiety, depression or aggression (particularly in children). Therefore, it is important that the dose of inhaled corticosteroid is titrated to the lowest dose at which effective control of asthma is maintained.Visual disturbance may be reported with systemic and topical (including, intranasal, inhaled and intraocular) corticosteroid use. If a patient presents with symptoms such as blurred vision or other visual disturbances, the patient should be considered for referral to an ophthalmologist for evaluation of possible causes of visual disturbances which may include cataract, glaucoma or rare diseases such as central serous chorioretinopathy (CSCR) which have been reported after use of systemic and topical corticosteroids. Particular care is needed for patients who are transferred from systemically active corticosteroids to inhaled mometasone furoate, because deaths due to adrenal insufficiency have occurred in asthmatic patients during and after transfer from systemic corticosteroids to less systemically available inhaled corticosteroids. After withdrawal from systemic corticosteroids, a number of months are required for recovery of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis functionDuring dose reduction some patients may experience symptoms of systemic corticosteroid withdrawal, e.g. joint and/or muscular pain, lassitude and depression, despite maintenance or even improvement in pulmonary function. Such patients are to be encouraged to continue with both Asmanex Twisthaler 400 micrograms Inhalation Powder treatment and withdrawal of the systemic corticosteroids, unless objective signs of adrenal insufficiency are present. If evidence of adrenal insufficiency occurs, increase the systemic corticosteroid doses temporarily and thereafter continue withdrawal more slowly.During periods of stress, including trauma, surgery, or infection, or a severe asthma attack, patients transferred from systemic corticosteroids will require supplementary treatment with a short course of systemic corticosteroids, which is gradually tapered as symptoms subside.It is recommended that such patients carry a supply of oral corticosteroids and a warning card indicating their need and recommended dosage of systemic corticosteroids during stressful periods. Periodic testing of adrenocortical function, particularly measurement of early morning plasma cortisol levels, is recommended.Transfer of patients from systemic corticosteroid therapy to Asmanex Twisthaler 400 micrograms Inhalation Powder may unmask pre-existing allergic conditions previously suppressed by systemic corticosteroid therapy. If this occurs, symptomatic treatment is recommended. Use of Asmanex Twisthaler 400 micrograms Inhalation Powder will often permit control of asthma symptoms with less suppression of HPA axis function than therapeutically equivalent oral doses of prednisone. Although mometasone furoate has demonstrated low systemic bioavailability at the recommended dosage, it is absorbed into the circulation and can be systemically active at higher doses. Thus, to maintain its profile of limited potential for HPA axis suppression, recommended doses of this product must not be exceeded, and must be titrated to the lowest effective dose for each individual patient. As with other inhaled asthma medications, bronchospasm may occur with an immediate increase in wheezing after dosing. If bronchospasm occurs following dosing with the Asmanex Twisthaler 400 micrograms Inhalation Powder, immediate treatment with a fast-acting inhaled bronchodilator is recommended; thus, the patient should be told to keep an appropriate bronchodilator inhaler on hand at all times. In such cases, treatment with Asmanex Twisthaler 400 micrograms Inhalation Powder is then discontinued immediately and alternative therapy instituted.Mometasone furoate is not to be regarded as a bronchodilator and is not indicated for rapid relief of bronchospasm or asthma attacks; thus, patients should be instructed to keep an appropriate short-acting bronchodilator inhaler on hand for use when needed.Instruct patients to contact their physician immediately when asthmatic episodes are not responsive to bronchodilators during treatment with this product or if peak-flow falls. This may indicate worsening asthma. During such episodes, patients may require systemic corticosteroid therapy. In these patients, dose titration to the maximum recommended maintenance dose of inhaled mometasone furoate may be considered. Use Asmanex Twisthaler 400 micrograms Inhalation Powder with caution, if at all, in patients with untreated active or quiescent tuberculous infections of the respiratory tract, or in untreated fungal, bacterial, systemic viral infections or ocular herpes simplex.Advise patients who are receiving corticosteroids or other immunosuppressant medicines of the risk of exposure to certain infections (e.g., chickenpox, measles) and of the importance of obtaining medical advice if such exposure occurs. This is of particular importance in children. A reduction of growth velocity in children or adolescents may occur as a result of inadequate control of chronic diseases such as asthma or from use of corticosteroids for treatment. Physicians are advised to closely follow the growth of adolescents taking corticosteroids by any route and weigh the benefits of corticosteroid therapy and asthma control against the possibility of growth suppression if an adolescent's growth appears slowed.If growth is slowed, review therapy with the aim of reducing the dose of inhaled corticosteroids if possible, to the lowest dose at which effective control of symptoms is achieved. In addition, consideration should be given to referring the patient to a paediatric respiratory specialist. When using inhaled corticosteroids, the possibility for clinically significant adrenal suppression may occur, especially after prolonged treatment with high doses and particularly with higher than recommended doses. This is to be considered during periods of stress or elective surgery, when additional systemic corticosteroids may be needed. However, during clinical trials there was no evidence of HPA axis suppression after prolonged treatment with inhaled mometasone furoate at doses of ≤ 800 micrograms per day. Lack of response or severe exacerbations of asthma should be treated by increasing the maintenance dose of inhaled mometasone furoate, and if necessary, by giving a systemic corticosteroid and/or an antibiotic if infection is suspected, and by use of beta-agonist therapy.The patient should be advised against abrupt discontinuation of therapy with Asmanex Twisthaler 400 micrograms Inhalation Powder.There is no evidence that the administration of this product in amounts greater than recommended doses increases efficacy. The maximum recommended daily dose contains lactose 4.64 mg per day. This amount does not normally cause problems in lactose intolerant people. 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction Due to the very low plasma concentration achieved after inhaled dosing, clinically significant drug interactions are unlikely. However, there may be a potential for increased systemic exposure to mometasone furoate when strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (eg ketoconazole, itraconazole, nelfinavir, ritonavir, cobicistat) are co-administered. Co-administration of inhaled mometasone furoate with the potent CYP3A4 enzyme inhibitor ketoconazole causes small but marginally significant (p= 0.09) decreases in serum cortisol AUC and resulted in approximately a 2-fold increase in plasma concentration of mometasone furoate.Interaction studies have only been performed in adults. Co-treatment with CYP3A inhibitors, including cobicistat-containing products, is expected to increase the risk of systemic side-effects of corticosteroids. The combination should be avoided unless the benefit outweighs the increased risk of systemic corticosteroid side-effects, in which case patients should be monitored for systemic corticosteroid side-effects. There are no or limited amount of data from the use of mometasone furoate in pregnant women. Studies in animals with mometasone furoate, like other glucocorticoids, have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3).As with other inhaled corticosteroid preparations, mometasone furoate is not to be used during pregnancy unless the potential benefit to the mother justifies the potential risk to the mother, fetus or infant. Infants born of mothers who received corticosteroids during pregnancy are to be observed carefully for hypoadrenalism. It is unknown whether mometasone furoate/metabolites are excreted in human milk. Available pharmacodynamic/toxicological data in animals have shown excretion of mometasone furoate in milk (see section 5.3). A decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to discontinue/abstain from mometasone furoate therapy taking into account the benefit of breast feeding for the child and the benefit of therapy for the woman. In reproductive studies in rats, there was no effect on fertility (see section 5.3). Asmanex Twisthaler 400 micrograms Inhalation Powder has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. In placebo-controlled clinical trials, oral candidiasis was very common (> 10%) in the 400 micrograms twice daily treatment group; other common (1-10%), treatment-related undesirable effects were pharyngitis, headache and dysphonia. Treatment related undesirable effects seen in the clinical trials and post-marketing reporting with Asmanex Twisthaler Inhalation Powder use are listed below. The adverse reactions reported during clinical trials and the post-marketing period are listed in the following table by treatment regimen, severity, System Organ Class and Preferred Term. Frequencies are defined as very common (≥ 1/10), common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10), uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100), rare (≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000), very rare (< 1/10,000) and not known (cannot be estimated from the available data).

May cause increased systemic corticosteroid effects (, ) See 17 for PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION and FDA-approved patient labeling. 5.3 Hypersensitivity Reactions Including Anaphylaxis 5.5 Transferring Patients from Systemic Corticosteroid Therapy 5.7 Interactions with Strong Cytochrome P450 3A4 Inhibitors 5.11 Paradoxical Bronchospasm and Upper Airway Symptoms 5.12 Eosinophilic Conditions and Churg-Strauss Syndrome 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Sections or subsections omitted from the full prescribing information are not listed. PULMICORT FLEXHALER is indicated for the maintenance treatment of asthma as prophylactic therapy in patients six years of age or older. PULMICORT FLEXHALER is NOT indicated for the relief of acute bronchospasm. PULMICORT FLEXHALER should be administered twice daily by the orally inhaled route only. After inhalation, the patient should rinse the mouth with water without swallowing . Patients should be instructed to prime PULMICORT FLEXHALER prior to its initial use, and instructed to inhale deeply and forcefully each time the device is used. The safety and efficacy of PULMICORT FLEXHALER when administered in excess of recommended doses have not been established. After asthma stability has been achieved, it is desirable to titrate to the lowest effective dosage to reduce the possibility of side effects. For patients who do not respond adequately to the starting dose after 1-2 weeks of therapy with PULMICORT FLEXHALER, increasing the dose may provide additional asthma control. If asthma symptoms arise in the period between doses, an inhaled, short-acting beta-agonist should be taken for immediate relief. Patients 18 Years of Age and Older: For patients 18 years of age and older, the recommended starting dosage is 360 mcg twice daily. In some adult patients, a starting dose of 180 mcg twice daily may be adequate. The maximum dosage should not exceed 720 mcg twice daily. Patients 6 to 17 Years of Age: The recommended starting dosage is 180 mcg twice daily. In some pediatric patients, a starting dose of 360 mcg twice daily may be appropriate. The maximum dosage should not exceed 360 mcg twice daily. For all patients, it is desirable to titrate to the lowest effective dose after adequate asthma stability is achieved. Improvement in asthma control following inhaled administration of budesonide can occur within 24 hours of initiation of treatment, although maximum benefit may not be achieved for 1 to 2 weeks, or longer. Individual patients will experience a variable onset and degree of symptom relief. If a previously effective dosage regimen of PULMICORT FLEXHALER fails to provide adequate control of asthma, the therapeutic regimen should be re-evaluated and additional therapeutic options (e.g., replacing the lower strength of PULMICORT FLEXHALER with the higher strength or initiating oral corticosteroids) should be considered. PULMICORT FLEXHALER is available as a dry powder for inhalation containing budesonide in the following 2 strengths: 90 mcg and 180 mcg. Each inhaler contains 60 or 120 actuations. The use of PULMICORT FLEXHALER is contraindicated in the following conditions: Primary treatment of status asthmaticus or other acute episodes of asthma where intensive measures are required. Severe hypersensitivity to milk proteins or any ingredients of PULMICORT FLEXHALER [see , ]. In clinical studies, the development of localized infections of the mouth and pharynx with has occurred in patients treated with PULMICORT FLEXHALER. When such an infection develops, it should be treated with appropriate local or systemic (i.e., oral antifungal) therapy while treatment with PULMICORT FLEXHALER continues, but at times, therapy with PULMICORT FLEXHALER may need to be interrupted. Patients should rinse the mouth after inhalation of PULMICORT FLEXHALER. PULMICORT FLEXHALER is not a bronchodilator and is not indicated for the rapid relief of bronchospasm or other acute episodes of asthma. Patients should be instructed to contact their physician immediately if episodes of asthma not responsive to their usual doses of bronchodilators occur during the course of treatment with PULMICORT FLEXHALER. During such episodes, patients may require therapy with oral corticosteroids. An inhaled short acting beta-agonist, not PULMICORT FLEXHALER, should be used to relieve acute symptoms such as shortness of breath. When prescribing PULMICORT FLEXHALER, the physician must also provide the patient with an inhaled, short-acting beta-agonist (e.g., albuterol) for treatment of acute symptoms, despite regular twice-daily (morning and evening) use of PULMICORT FLEXHALER. 5.3 Hypersensitivity Reactions Including Anaphylaxis Hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis, rash, contact dermatitis, urticaria, angioedema, and bronchospasm have been reported with use of PULMICORT FLEXHALER. Discontinue PULMICORT FLEXHALER if such reactions occur [see , ]. PULMICORT FLEXHALER contains small amounts of lactose, which contains trace levels of milk proteins. It is possible that cough, wheezing, or bronchospasm may occur in patients who have a severe milk protein allergy [see , ]. Patients who are on drugs that suppress the immune system are more susceptible to infection than healthy individuals. Chicken pox and measles, for example, can have a more serious or even fatal course in susceptible children or adults using corticosteroids. In children or adults who have not had these diseases or been properly immunized, particular care should be taken to avoid exposure. How the dose, route, and duration of corticosteroid administration affects the risk of developing a disseminated infection is not known. The contribution of the underlying disease and/or prior corticosteroid treatment to the risk is also not known. If exposed to chicken pox, therapy with varicella zoster immune globulin (VZIG) or pooled intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), as appropriate, may be indicated. If exposed to measles, prophylaxis with pooled intramuscular immunoglobulin (IG) may be indicated (see the respective package inserts for complete VZIG and IG prescribing information). If chicken pox develops, treatment with antiviral agents may be considered. The immune responsiveness to varicella vaccine was evaluated in pediatric patients with asthma ages 12 months to 8 years with budesonide inhalation suspension. An open-label, nonrandomized clinical study examined the immune responsiveness to varicella vaccine in 243 asthma patients 12 months to 8 years of age who were treated with budesonide inhalation suspension 0.25 mg to 1 mg daily (n=151) or non-corticosteroid asthma therapy (n=92) (i.e., beta-agonists, leukotriene receptor antagonists, cromones). The percentage of patients developing a seroprotective antibody titer of ≥5.0 (gpELISA value) in response to the vaccination was similar in patients treated with budesonide inhalation suspension (85%), compared to patients treated with non-corticosteroid asthma therapy (90%). No patient treated with budesonide inhalation suspension developed chicken pox as a result of vaccination. Inhaled corticosteroids should be used with caution, if at all, in patients with active or quiescent tuberculosis infection of the respiratory tract, untreated systemic fungal, bacterial, viral or parasitic infections, or ocular herpes simplex. 5.5 Transferring Patients from Systemic Corticosteroid Therapy Particular care is needed for patients who are transferred from systemically active corticosteroids to PULMICORT FLEXHALER because deaths due to adrenal insufficiency have occurred in asthmatic patients during and after transfer from systemic corticosteroids to less systemically available inhaled corticosteroids. After withdrawal from systemic corticosteroids, a number of months are required for recovery of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) function. Patients who have been previously maintained on 20 mg or more per day of prednisone (or its equivalent) may be most susceptible, particularly when their systemic corticosteroids have been almost completely withdrawn. During this period of HPA suppression, patients may exhibit signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency when exposed to trauma, surgery, or infection (particularly gastroenteritis) or other conditions associated with severe electrolyte loss. Although PULMICORT FLEXHALER may provide control of asthma symptoms during these episodes, in recommended doses it supplies less than normal physiological amounts of glucocorticoid systemically and does NOT provide the mineralocorticoid activity that is necessary for coping with these emergencies. During periods of stress or a severe asthma attack, patients who have been withdrawn from systemic corticosteroids should be instructed to resume oral corticosteroids (in large doses) immediately and to contact their physicians for further instruction. These patients should also be instructed to carry a medical identification card indicating that they may need supplementary systemic corticosteroids during periods of stress or a severe asthma attack. Patients requiring oral corticosteroids should be weaned slowly from systemic corticosteroid use after transferring to PULMICORT FLEXHALER. Prednisone reduction can be accomplished by reducing the daily prednisone dose by 2.5 mg on a weekly basis during therapy with PULMICORT FLEXHALER. Lung function (mean forced expiratory volume in 1 second [FEV] or morning peak expiratory flow [PEF]), beta-agonist use, and asthma symptoms should be carefully monitored during withdrawal of oral corticosteroids. In addition to monitoring asthma signs and symptoms, patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency such as fatigue, lassitude, weakness, nausea and vomiting, and hypotension. Transfer of patients from systemic corticosteroid therapy to PULMICORT FLEXHALER may unmask allergic conditions previously suppressed by the systemic corticosteroid therapy, (e.g., rhinitis, conjunctivitis, eczema, arthritis, eosinophilic conditions). Some patients may experience symptoms of systemically active corticosteroid withdrawal (e.g., joint and/or muscular pain, lassitude, depression) despite maintenance or even improvement of respiratory function. PULMICORT FLEXHALER will often help control asthma symptoms with less suppression of HPA function than therapeutically equivalent oral doses of prednisone. Since budesonide is absorbed into the circulation and can be systemically active at higher doses, the beneficial effects of PULMICORT FLEXHALER in minimizing HPA dysfunction may be expected only when recommended dosages are not exceeded and individual patients are titrated to the lowest effective dose. Since individual sensitivity to effects on cortisol production exists, physicians should consider this information when prescribing PULMICORT FLEXHALER. Because of the possibility of systemic absorption of inhaled corticosteroids, patients treated with PULMICORT FLEXHALER should be observed carefully for any evidence of systemic corticosteroid effects. Particular care should be taken in observing patients postoperatively or during periods of stress for evidence of inadequate adrenal response. It is possible that systemic corticosteroid effects such as hypercorticism and adrenal suppression (including adrenal crisis) may appear in a small number of patients, particularly when budesonide is administered at higher than recommended doses over prolonged periods of time. If such effects occur, the dosage of PULMICORT FLEXHALER should be reduced slowly, consistent with accepted procedures for reducing systemic corticosteroids and for management of asthma symptoms. 5.7 Interactions with Strong Cytochrome P450 3A4 Inhibitors Caution should be exercised when considering the co-administration of PULMICORT FLEXHALER with ketoconazole, and other known strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ritonavir, atazanavir, clarithromycin, indinavir, itraconazole, nefazodone, nelfinavir, saquinavir, telithromycin) because adverse effects related to increased systemic exposure to budesonide may occur [see , ]. Decreases in bone mineral density (BMD) have been observed with long-term administration of products containing inhaled corticosteroids. The clinical significance of small changes in BMD with regard to long-term consequences such as fracture is unknown. Patients with major risk factors for decreased bone mineral content, such as prolonged immobilization, family history of osteoporosis, post menopausal status, tobacco use, advance age, poor nutrition, or chronic use of drugs that can reduce bone mass (e.g., anticonvulsants, oral corticosteroids) should be monitored and treated with established standards of care. Orally inhaled corticosteroids, including budesonide, may cause a reduction in growth velocity when administered to pediatric patients. Monitor the growth of pediatric patients receiving PULMICORT FLEXHALER routinely (e.g., via stadiometry). To minimize the systemic effects of orally inhaled corticosteroids, including PULMICORT FLEXHALER, titrate each patient’s dose to the lowest dosage that effectively controls his/her symptoms . Glaucoma, increased intraocular pressure, and cataracts have been reported following the long-term administration of inhaled corticosteroids, including budesonide. Therefore, close monitoring is warranted in patients with a change in vision or with a history of increased intraocular pressure, glaucoma, and/or cataracts. 5.11 Paradoxical Bronchospasm and Upper Airway Symptoms As with other inhaled asthma medications, PULMICORT FLEXHALER can produce paradoxical bronchospasm, which may be life threatening. If paradoxical bronchospasm occurs following dosing with PULMICORT FLEXHALER, it should be treated immediately with an inhaled, short-acting beta-bronchodilator. PULMICORT FLEXHALER should be discontinued immediately, and alternative therapy should be instituted. 5.12 Eosinophilic Conditions and Churg-Strauss Syndrome In rare cases, patients on inhaled corticosteroids may present with systemic eosinophilic conditions. Some of these patients have clinical features of vasculitis consistent with Churg-Strauss syndrome, a condition that is often treated with systemic corticosteroid therapy. These events usually, but not always, have been associated with the reduction and/or withdrawal of oral corticosteroid therapy following the introduction of inhaled corticosteroids. Physicians should be alert to eosinophilia, vasculitic rash, worsening pulmonary symptoms, cardiac complications, and/or neuropathy presenting in their patients. A causal relationship between budesonide and these underlying conditions has not been established. Systemic and inhaled corticosteroid use may result in the following: Infection Hypersensitivity Including Anaphylaxis Immunosuppression Hypercorticism and Adrenal Suppression Reduction in Bone Mineral Density Growth Effects Glaucoma and Cataracts Eosinophilic Conditions and Churg-Strauss Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The incidence of common adverse reactions in Table 1 is based upon pooled data reported in patients treated with PULMICORT FLEXHALER 180 or 90 mcg in two double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials in which 226 patients (106 females and 120 males) with mild to moderate asthma, previously receiving bronchodilators, inhaled corticosteroids, or both, were treated with PULMICORT FLEXHALER, administered as 360 mcg twice daily for 12 weeks. In these trials, the patients on PULMICORT FLEXHALER had a mean age of 28 years (range 6-80 years) and were predominantly Caucasian (59.7%) and Asian (31.4%). Table 1 includes all adverse reactions (regardless of investigator causality assessment) that occurred at a rate of ≥1% in the PULMICORT FLEXHALER group and more commonly than the placebo group. Table 1 - Adverse Reactions occurring at an incidence of ≥1% and more commonly than placebo in the PULMICORT FLEXHALER group: pooled data from two 12-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical asthma trials in patients 6 years and older Long-Term Safety in Patients 6 years of age and older Non-placebo controlled long-term studies in children (at doses up to 360 mcg daily), and adolescent and adult subjects (at doses up to 720 mcg daily), treated for up to one year with PULMICORT FLEXHALER, revealed a similar pattern and incidence of adverse events. The following adverse reactions occurred in placebo-controlled clinical trials with similar or lower doses with inhaled budesonide via a different PULMICORT dry powder inhaler with an incidence of ≥1% in the budesonide group and were more common than in the placebo group: ≥3%: respiratory infection, sinusitis, headache, pain, back pain, fever. ≥1-3%: neck pain, syncope, abdominal pain, dry mouth, vomiting, weight gain, fracture, myalgia, hypertonia, migraine, ecchymosis, insomnia, infection, taste perversion, voice alteration. Higher doses of inhaled budesonide (800 mcg twice daily) via a different PULMICORT dry powder inhaler resulted in an increased incidence of voice alteration, flu syndrome, dyspepsia, gastroenteritis, nausea, and back pain, compared with doses of 400 mcg twice daily. In a 20-week trial in adult asthmatics who previously required oral corticosteroids, the incidence of adverse reactions was evaluated with 400 mcg twice daily (N=53) and 800 mcg twice daily (N=53) of inhaled budesonide via a different PULMICORT dry powder inhaler and compared with placebo (N=53). In considering these data, the increased average duration of exposure for inhaled budesonide patients (78 days for inhaled budesonide vs. 41 days for placebo) should be taken into account. Adverse reactions, regardless of investigator causality assessment, reported in more than five patients in the budesonide group and which occurred more commonly than the placebo group in decreasing order of frequency include: respiratory infection, sinusitis, headache, oral candidiasis, pain, asthenia, dyspepsia, arthralgia, cough increased, nausea and rhinitis. The following adverse reactions have been reported during post-approval use of PULMICORT FLEXHALER. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. immediate and delayed hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylactic reaction, angioedema, bronchospasm, rash, contact dermatitis, urticaria, and cough, wheezing or bronchospasm in patients with severe milk protein hypersensitivity symptoms of hypocorticism and hypercorticism cataracts, glaucoma, increased intraocular pressure psychiatric symptoms including psychosis, depression, aggressive reactions, irritability, nervousness, restlessness, and anxiety throat irritation skin bruising The main route of metabolism of corticosteroids, including budesonide, is via cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoenzyme 3A4 (CYP3A4). After oral administration of ketoconazole, a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4, the mean plasma concentration of orally administered budesonide increased. Concomitant administration of CYP3A4 may inhibit the metabolism of, and increase the systemic exposure to, budesonide. Caution should be exercised when considering the co-administration of PULMICORT FLEXHALER with long-term ketoconazole and other known strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ritonavir, atazanavir, clarithromycin, indinavir, itraconazole, nefazodone, nelfinavir, saquinavir, telithromycin) . There are no adequate well-controlled studies of PULMICORT FLEXHALER in pregnant women. However, there are published studies on the use of budesonide, the active ingredient in PULMICORT FLEXHALER, in pregnant women. In animal reproduction studies, budesonide, administered by the subcutaneous route, caused structural abnormalities, was embryocidal, and reduced fetal weights in rats and rabbits at less than the maximum recommended human daily inhalation dose (MRHDID), but these effects were not seen in rats that received inhaled doses approximately 2 times the MRHDID (). Studies of pregnant women have not shown that inhaled budesonide increases the risk of abnormalities when administered during pregnancy. Experience with oral corticosteroids suggests that rodents are more prone to structural abnormalities from corticosteroid exposure than humans. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage of the indicated populations is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2% to 4% and 15% to 20%, respectively. Disease-Associated Maternal and/or Embryo/Fetal risk In women with poorly or moderately controlled asthma, there is an increased risk of several perinatal adverse outcomes such as preeclampsia in the mother and prematurity, low birth weight, and small for gestational age in the neonate. Pregnant women with asthma should be closely monitored and medication adjusted as necessary to maintain optimal asthma control. There are no well-controlled human studies that have investigated the effects of PULMICORT FLEXHALER during labor and delivery. Studies of pregnant women have not shown that inhaled budesonide increases the risk of abnormalities when administered during pregnancy. The results from a large population-based prospective cohort epidemiological study reviewing data from three Swedish registries covering approximately 99% of the pregnancies from 1995-1997 (i.e., Swedish Medical Birth Registry; Registry of Congenital Malformations; Child Cardiology Registry) indicate no increased risk for congenital malformations from the use of inhaled budesonide during early pregnancy. Congenital malformations were studied in 2014 infants born to mothers reporting the use of inhaled budesonide for asthma in early pregnancy (usually 10-12 weeks after the last menstrual period), the period when most major organ malformations occur. The rate of recorded congenital malformations was similar compared to the general population rate (3.8% vs. 3.5%, respectively). In addition, after exposure to inhaled budesonide, the number of infants born with orofacial clefts was similar to the expected number in the normal population (4 children vs. 3.3, respectively). These same data were utilized in a second study bringing the total to 2534 infants whose mothers were exposed to inhaled budesonide. In this study, the rate of congenital malformations among infants whose mothers were exposed to inhaled budesonide during early pregnancy was not different from the rate for all newborn babies during the same period (3.6%). In a fertility and reproduction study, male rats were subcutaneously dosed for 9 weeks and females for 2 weeks prior to pairing and throughout the mating period. Females were dosed up until weaning of their offspring. Budesonide caused a decrease in prenatal viability and viability in the pups at birth and during lactation, along with a decrease in maternal body-weight gain, at doses 0.1 times the MRHDID (on a mcg/m basis at maternal subcutaneous doses of 20 mcg/kg/day and above). No such effects were noted at a dose 0.03 times the MRHDID (on a mcg/m basis at a maternal subcutaneous dose of 5 mcg/kg/day). In an embryo-fetal development study in pregnant rabbits dosed during the period of organogenesis from gestation days 6-18, budesonide produced fetal loss, decreased fetal weight, and skeletal abnormalities at doses 0.3 times the MRHDID (on a mcg/m basis at a maternal subcutaneous dose of 25 mcg/kg/day). In an embryo-fetal development study in pregnant rats dosed during the period of organogenesis from gestation days 6-15, budesonide produced similar adverse fetal effects at doses approximately 4 times the MRHDID (on a mcg/m basis at a maternal subcutaneous dose of 500 mcg/kg/day). In another embryo-fetal development study in pregnant rats, no structural abnormalities or embryocidal effects were seen at doses approximately 2 times the MRHDID (on a mcg/m basis at maternal inhalation doses up to 250 mcg/kg/day). In a peri-and post-natal development study, rats dosed from gestation day 15 to postpartum day 21, budesonide had no effects on delivery, but did have an effect on growth and development of offspring. Offspring survival was reduced and surviving offspring had decreased mean body weights at birth and during lactation at doses 0.1 times the MRHDID and higher (on a mcg/m basis at maternal subcutaneous doses of 20 mcg/kg/day and higher). These findings occurred in the presence of maternal toxicity. There are no available data on the effects of PULMICORT FLEXHALER on the breastfed child or on milk production. Budesonide, like other inhaled corticosteroids, is present in human milk . The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother’s clinical need for PULMICORT FLEXHALER and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from PULMICORT FLEXHALER or from the underlying maternal condition. Human data with budesonide delivered via dry powder inhaler indicates that the total daily oral dose of budesonide available in breast milk to the infant is approximately 0.3% to 1% of the dose inhaled by the mother In a 12-week pivotal study, 204 patients 6 to 17 years of age were treated with PULMICORT FLEXHALER twice daily . Efficacy results in this age group were similar to those observed in patients 18 years and older. There were no obvious differences in the type or frequency of adverse events reported in this age group compared with patients 18 years of age and older. The safety and effectiveness of PULMICORT FLEXHALER in asthma patients below 6 years of age have not been established. Controlled clinical studies have shown that orally inhaled corticosteroids, including budesonide, may cause a reduction in growth velocity in pediatric patients. This effect has been observed in the absence of laboratory evidence of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis suppression, suggesting that growth velocity is a more sensitive indicator of systemic corticosteroid exposure in pediatric patients than some commonly used tests of HPA-axis function. The long-term effects of this reduction in growth velocity associated with orally inhaled corticosteroids including the impact on final adult height are unknown. The potential for “catch up” growth following discontinuation of treatment with orally inhaled corticosteroids has not been adequately studied. In a study of asthmatic children 5-12 years of age, those treated with inhaled budesonide via a different PULMICORT dry powder inhaler 200 mcg twice daily (n=311) had a 1.1-centimeter reduction in growth compared with those receiving placebo (n=418) at the end of one year; the difference between these two treatment groups did not increase further over three years of additional treatment. By the end of four years, children treated with a different PULMICORT dry powder inhaler and children treated with placebo had similar growth velocities. Conclusions drawn from this study may be confounded by the unequal use of corticosteroids in the treatment groups and inclusion of data from patients attaining puberty during the course of the study. The administration of inhaled budesonide via a different PULMICORT dry-powder inhaler in doses up to 800 mcg/day (mean daily dose 445 mcg/day) or via a pressurized metered-dose inhaler in doses up to 1200 mcg/day (mean daily dose 620 mcg/day) to 216 pediatric patients (age 3 to 11 years) for 2 to 6 years had no significant effect on statural growth compared with non-corticosteroid therapy in 62 matched control patients. However, the long-term effect of inhaled budesonide on growth is not fully known. The growth of pediatric patients receiving orally inhaled corticosteroids, including PULMICORT FLEXHALER, should be monitored (e.g., via stadiometry). If a child or adolescent on any corticosteroid appears to have growth suppression, the possibility that he/she is particularly sensitive to this effect should be considered. The potential growth effects of prolonged treatment should be weighed against clinical benefits obtained. To minimize the systemic effects of inhaled corticosteroids, including PULMICORT FLEXHALER, each patient should be titrated to the lowest dose that effectively controls his/her asthma . Of the total number of patients in controlled clinical studies receiving inhaled budesonide, 153 (n=11 treated with PULMICORT FLEXHALER) were 65 years of age or older and one was age 75 years or older. No overall differences in safety were observed between these patients and younger patients. Clinical studies did not include sufficient numbers of patients aged 65 years and over to determine differences in efficacy between elderly and younger patients. Other reported clinical or medical surveillance experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. Formal pharmacokinetic studies using PULMICORT FLEXHALER have not been conducted in patients with hepatic impairment. However, since budesonide is predominantly cleared by hepatic metabolism, impairment of liver function may lead to accumulation of budesonide in the plasma. Therefore, patients with hepatic disease should be closely monitored. The potential for acute toxic effects following overdose of PULMICORT FLEXHALER is low. If used at excessive doses for prolonged periods, systemic corticosteroid effects such as hypercorticism may occur . Another budesonide-containing dry powder inhaler at 3200 mcg daily administered for 6 weeks caused a significant reduction (27%) in the plasma cortisol response to a 6-hour infusion of ACTH compared with placebo (+1%). The corresponding effect of 10 mg prednisone daily was a 35% reduction in the plasma cortisol response to ACTH. Postmarketing experience showed that acute overdose of inhaled budesonide commonly remained asymptomatic. The use of excessive doses (up to 6400 mcg daily) for prolonged periods showed systemic corticosteroid effects such as hypercorticism. Budesonide, the active component of PULMICORT FLEXHALER, is a corticosteroid designated chemically as (RS)-11β, 16α, 17,21-Tetrahydroxypregna-1,4-diene-3,20-dione cyclic 16,17-acetal with butyraldehyde. Budesonide is provided as a mixture of two epimers (22R and 22S). The empirical formula of budesonide is CHO and its molecular weight is 430.5. Its structural formula is: Budesonide is a white to off-white, tasteless, odorless powder that is practically insoluble in water and in heptane, sparingly soluble in ethanol, and freely soluble in chloroform. Its partition coefficient between octanol and water at pH 7.4 is 1.6 x 10. PULMICORT FLEXHALER is an inhalation-driven multi-dose dry powder inhaler containing a formulation of 1 mg per actuation of micronized budesonide and micronized lactose monohydrate which contains trace levels of milk proteins . Each actuation of PULMICORT FLEXHALER 180 mcg delivers 160 mcg budesonide from the mouthpiece and each actuation of PULMICORT FLEXHALER 90 mcg delivers 80 mcg budesonide from the mouthpiece (based on testing at 60 L/min for 2 sec). Each PULMICORT FLEXHALER 180 mcg contains 120 actuations and each PULMICORT FLEXHALER 90 mcg contains 60 actuations. testing has shown that the dose delivery for PULMICORT FLEXHALER is dependent on airflow through the device, as evidenced by a decrease in the fine particle dose at a flow rate of 30 L/min to a value that is approximately 40-50% of that produced at 60 L/min. At a flow rate of 40 L/min, the fine particle dose is approximately 70% of that produced at 60 L/min. Patient factors such as inspiratory flow rates will also affect the dose delivered to the lungs of patients in actual use . In asthmatic children age 6 to 17 (N=516, FEV 2.29 [0.97– 4.28]) peak inspiratory flow (PIF) through PULMICORT FLEXHALER was 72.5 [19.1 – 103.6] L/min). Inspiratory flows were not measured in the adult pivotal study. Patients should be carefully instructed on the use of this drug product to assure optimal dose delivery. Budesonide is an anti-inflammatory corticosteroid that exhibits potent glucocorticoid activity and weak mineralocorticoid activity. In standard and animal models, budesonide has approximately a 200-fold higher affinity for the glucocorticoid receptor and a 1000-fold higher topical anti-inflammatory potency than cortisol (rat croton oil ear edema assay). As a measure of systemic activity, budesonide is 40 times more potent than cortisol when administered subcutaneously and 25 times more potent when administered orally in the rat thymus involution assay. The clinical significance of this is unknown. The activity of PULMICORT FLEXHALER is due to the parent drug, budesonide. In glucocorticoid receptor affinity studies, the 22R form was two times as active as the 22S epimer. studies indicated that the two forms of budesonide do not interconvert. The precise mechanism of corticosteroid actions on inflammation in asthma is not known. Inflammation is an important component in the pathogenesis of asthma. Corticosteroids have a wide range of inhibitory activities against multiple cell types (e.g., mast cells, eosinophils, neutrophils, macrophages, and lymphocytes) and mediators (e.g., histamine, eicosanoids, leukotrienes, and cytokines) involved in allergic and non-allergic-mediated inflammation. These anti-inflammatory actions of corticosteroids may contribute to their efficacy in asthma. Studies in asthmatic patients have shown a favorable ratio between topical anti-inflammatory activity and systemic corticosteroid effects over a wide range of doses of inhaled budesonide. This is explained by a combination of a relatively high local anti-inflammatory effect, extensive first pass hepatic degradation of orally absorbed drug (85-95%), and the low potency of formed metabolites (see below). To confirm that systemic absorption is not a significant factor in the clinical efficacy of inhaled budesonide, a clinical study in patients with asthma was performed comparing 400 mcg budesonide administered via a pressurized metered-dose inhaler with a tube spacer to 1400 mcg of oral budesonide and placebo. The study demonstrated the efficacy of inhaled budesonide but not orally administered budesonide, even though systemic budesonide exposure was comparable for both treatments, indicating that the inhaled treatment is working locally in the lung. Thus, the therapeutic effect of conventional doses of orally inhaled budesonide are largely explained by its direct action on the respiratory tract. Inhaled budesonide has been shown to decrease airway reactivity in various challenge models, including histamine, methacholine, sodium metabisulfite, and adenosine monophosphate in patients with hyperreactive airways. The clinical relevance of these models is not certain. Pre-treatment with inhaled budesonide 1600 mcg daily (800 mcg twice daily) for 2 weeks reduced the acute (early-phase reaction) and delayed (late-phase reaction) decrease in FEV following inhaled allergen challenge. The effects of inhaled budesonide on the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis were studied in 905 adults and 404 pediatric patients with asthma. For most patients, the ability to increase cortisol production in response to stress, as assessed by cosyntropin (ACTH) stimulation test, remained intact with inhaled budesonide treatment at recommended doses. For adult patients treated with 100, 200, 400, or 800 mcg twice daily for 12 weeks, 4%, 2%, 6%, and 13% respectively, had an abnormal stimulated cortisol response (peak cortisol <14.5 mcg/dL assessed by liquid chromatography following short-cosyntropin test) as compared with 8% of patients treated with placebo. Similar results were obtained in pediatric patients. In another study in adults, doses of 400, 800 and 1600 mcg of inhaled budesonide twice daily for 6 weeks were examined; 1600 mcg twice daily (twice the maximum recommended dose) resulted in a 27% reduction in stimulated cortisol (6-hour ACTH infusion) while 10 mg prednisone resulted in a 35% reduction. In this study, no patient taking doses of 400 and 800 mcg twice daily met the criterion for an abnormal stimulated cortisol response (peak cortisol <14.5 mcg/dL assessed by liquid chromatography) following ACTH infusion. An open-label, long-term follow-up of 1133 patients for up to 52 weeks confirmed the minimal effect on the HPA axis (both basal and stimulated plasma cortisol) of inhaled budesonide when administered at doses ranging from 100 to 800 mcg twice daily. In patients who had previously been oral steroid-dependent, use of inhaled budesonide at doses ranging from 100 to 800 mcg twice daily was associated with higher stimulated cortisol response compared with baseline following 1 year of therapy. After oral administration of budesonide, peak plasma concentration was achieved in about 1 to 2 hours and the absolute systemic availability was 6-13%. In contrast, most of budesonide delivered to the lungs is systemically absorbed. In healthy subjects, 34% of the metered dose was deposited in the lungs (as assessed by plasma concentration method and using a different budesonide containing dry-powder inhaler) with an absolute systemic availability of 39% of the metered dose. Peak steady-state plasma concentrations of budesonide delivered from PULMICORT FLEXHALER in adults with asthma (n=39) occurred at approximately 10 minutes post-dose and averaged 0.6 and 1.6 nmol/L at doses of 180 mcg once daily and 360 mcg twice daily, respectively. In asthmatic patients, budesonide showed a linear increase in AUC and C with increasing dose after both a single dose and repeated dosing of inhaled budesonide. The volume of distribution of budesonide was approximately 3 L/kg. It was 85-90% bound to plasma proteins. Protein binding was constant over the concentration range (1-100 nmol/L) achieved with, and exceeding, recommended doses of PULMICORT FLEXHALER. Budesonide showed little or no binding to corticosteroid binding globulin. Budesonide rapidly equilibrated with red blood cells in a concentration independent manner with a blood/plasma ratio of about 0.8. studies with human liver homogenates have shown that budesonide is rapidly and extensively metabolized. Two major metabolites formed via cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoenzyme 3A4 (CYP3A4) catalyzed biotransformation have been isolated and identified as 16α-hydroxyprednisolone and 6β-hydroxybudesonide. The corticosteroid activity of each of these two metabolites is less than 1% of that of the parent compound. No qualitative differences between the and metabolic patterns have been detected. Negligible metabolic inactivation was observed in human lung and serum preparations. The 22R form of budesonide was preferentially cleared by the liver with systemic clearance of 1.4 L/min vs. 1.0 L/min for the 22S form. The terminal half-life, 2 to 3 hours, was the same for both epimers and was independent of dose. Budesonide was excreted in urine and feces in the form of metabolites. Approximately 60% of an intravenous radiolabeled dose was recovered in the urine. No unchanged budesonide was detected in the urine. No clinically relevant pharmacokinetic differences have been identified due to race, sex, or advanced age. The pharmacokinetics of PULMICORT FLEXHALER in geriatric patients have not been specifically studied. Following intravenous dosing in pediatric patients age 10-14 years, plasma half-life was shorter than in adults (1.5 hours vs. 2.0 hours in adults). In the same population following inhalation of budesonide via a pressurized metered-dose inhaler, absolute systemic availability was similar to that in adults. Peak steady-state plasma concentrations of budesonide delivered via PULMICORT FLEXHALER in children and adolescents with asthma (n=14) occurred at approximately 15 to 30 minutes post-dose and averaged 0.4 and 1.5 nmol/L at doses of 180 mcg once daily and 360 mcg twice daily, respectively. The disposition of budesonide when delivered by inhalation from a dry powder inhaler at doses of 200 or 400 mcg twice daily for at least 3 months was studied in eight lactating women with asthma from 1 to 6 months postpartum. Systemic exposure to budesonide in these women appears to be comparable to that in non-lactating women with asthma from other studies. Breast milk obtained over eight hours post-dose revealed that the maximum concentration of budesonide for the 400 and 800 mcg doses was 0.39 and 0.78 nmol/L, respectively, and occurred within 45 minutes after dosing. The estimated oral daily dose of budesonide from breast milk to the infant is approximately 0.007 and 0.014 mcg/kg/day for the two dose regimens used in this study, which represents approximately 0.3% to 1% of the dose inhaled by the mother. Budesonide levels in plasma samples obtained from five infants at about 90 minutes after breastfeeding (and about 140 minutes after drug administration to the mother) were below quantifiable levels (<0.02 nmol/L in four infants and <0.04 nmol/L in one infant) . There are no data regarding the specific use of PULMICORT FLEXHALER in patients with hepatic or renal impairment. Reduced liver function may affect the elimination of corticosteroids. The pharmacokinetics of budesonide were affected by compromised liver function as evidenced by a doubled systemic availability after oral ingestion. The intravenous pharmacokinetics of budesonide were, however, similar in cirrhotic patients and in healthy subjects. Ketoconazole: Ketoconazole, a strong inhibitor of cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoenzyme 3A4 (CYP3A4), the main metabolic enzyme for corticosteroids, increased plasma levels of orally ingested budesonide [see , ]. Cimetidine: At recommended doses, cimetidine, a nonspecific inhibitor of CYP enzymes, had a slight but clinically insignificant effect on the pharmacokinetics of oral budesonide. 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility In a 104-week oral study in Sprague-Dawley rats, a statistically significant increase in the incidence of gliomas was observed in male rats receiving an oral dose of 50 mcg/kg/day (approximately 0.3 times the MRHDID in adults and children 6 to 17 years of age on a mcg/m basis). No tumorigenicity was seen in male rats at oral doses up to 25 mcg/kg (approximately 0.2 times the MRHDID in adults and children 6 to 17 years of age, on a mcg/m basis) and in female rats at oral doses up to 50 mc/kg (approximately 0.3 times, the MRHDID doses in adults and children 6 to 17 years of age, respectively, on a mcg/m basis). In two additional two-year studies in male Fischer and Sprague-Dawley rats, budesonide caused no gliomas at an oral dose of 50 mcg/kg (approximately 0.3 times the MRHDID in adults and children 6 to 17 years of age, respectively, on a mcg/m basis). However, in the male Sprague-Dawley rats, budesonide caused a statistically significant increase in the incidence of hepatocellular tumors at an oral dose of 50 mcg/kg (approximately 0.3 times the MRHDID in adults and children 6 to 17 years of age on a mcg/m2 basis). The concurrent reference corticosteroids (prednisone and triamcinolone acetonide) in these two studies showed similar findings. There was no evidence of a carcinogenic effect when budesonide was administered orally for 91 weeks to mice at doses up to 200 mcg/kg/day (approximately 0.7 times the MRHDID in adults and children 6 to 17 years of age on a mcg/m basis). Budesonide was not mutagenic or clastogenic in six different test systems: Ames Salmonella/microsome plate test, mouse micronucleus test, mouse lymphoma test, chromosome aberration test in human lymphocytes, sex-linked recessive lethal test in Drosophila melanogaster, and DNA repair analysis in rat hepatocyte culture. Fertility and reproductive performance were unaffected in rats at subcutaneous doses up to 80 mcg/kg (approximately 0.5 times the MRHDID in adults on a mcg/m2 basis). At a subcutaneous dose of 20 mcg/kg/day (approximately 0.1 times the maximum recommended daily inhalation dose in adults on a mcg/m2 basis), decreases in maternal body weight gain, prenatal viability, and viability of the young at birth and during lactation were observed. No such effects were noted at 5 mcg/kg (approximately 0.03 times the MRHDID in adults on a mcg/m2 basis). The safety and efficacy of PULMICORT FLEXHALER were evaluated in two 12-week, double-blind, randomized, parallel-group, placebo-controlled clinical studies conducted at sites in the United States and Asia involving 1137 patients aged 6 to 80 years with mild to moderate asthma. Study 1 evaluated PULMICORT FLEXHALER 180 mcg, PULMICORT TURBUHALER 200 mcg, and placebo, each administered as 1 inhalation once daily or 2 inhalations twice daily in patients 18 years of age and older with mild to moderate asthma previously treated with inhaled corticosteroids. The delivered dose of PULMICORT FLEXHALER 180 mcg and PULMICORT TURBUHALER 200 mcg are the same; each delivers 160 mcg from the mouthpiece. Study 2 evaluated PULMICORT FLEXHALER 90 mcg, 2 inhalations once daily or 4 inhalations twice daily, PULMICORT TURBUHALER 200 mcg, 1 inhalation once daily or 2 inhalations twice daily, and placebo in pediatric patients aged 6 to 17 years with mild to moderate asthma. Both of the studies had a 2-week placebo treatment run-in period followed by a 12-week randomized treatment period. The primary endpoint was the difference between baseline and the mean of the treatment-period FEV (adults) or FEV % predicted (children). This study enrolled 621 patients aged ≥18 to 80 years with mild-to-moderate asthma (mean baseline % predicted FEV 64.3%) whose symptoms were previously controlled on inhaled corticosteroids. Mean change from baseline in FEV in the PULMICORT FLEXHALER 180 mcg, 2 inhalations twice-daily group was 0.28 liters, as compared to 0.10 liters in the placebo group (p<0.001). Secondary endpoints of morning and evening peak expiratory flow rate, daytime asthma symptom severity, nighttime asthma symptom severity, daily rescue medication use, and the percentage of patients who met predefined asthma related withdrawal criteria showed differences from baseline favoring PULMICORT FLEXHALER over placebo (p<0.001). 12-Week Trial in Adult Patients with Mild to Moderate Asthma (Study 1) Mean Change from Baseline in FEV (L) Footnote: PULMICORT TURBUHALER; a different PULMICORT DPI. Statistical model is analysis of covariance with treatment and region (US/Asia) as factors and the baseline value as the covariate. This study enrolled 516 patients aged 6 to 17 years with mild asthma (mean baseline % predicted FEV 84.9%). The study population included patients previously treated with inhaled corticosteroids for no more than 30 days before the study began (4%) and patients who were naïve to inhaled corticosteroids (96%). Mean change from baseline in % predicted FEV during the 12-week treatment period in the PULMICORT FLEXHALER 90 mcg, 4 inhalations twice daily treatment group was 5.6 compared with 0.2 in the placebo group (p<0.001). Secondary endpoints of morning and evening PEF showed differences from baseline favoring PULMICORT FLEXHALER over placebo (p<0.001). 12-Week Trial in Pediatric Patients With Mild Asthma (Study 2) Mean Change from Baseline in Percent Predicted FEV Footnote: PULMICORT TURBUHALER; a different PULMICORT DPI. Statistical model is analysis of covariance with treatment and region (US/Asia) as factors and the baseline value as the covariate. PULMICORT FLEXHALER is available as a dry powder for inhalation containing budesonide in the following 2 strengths: 90 mcg and 180 mcg. Each dosage strength contains 60 or 120 actuations per device. 180 mcg/dose (NDC 0186-0916-12) with a target fill weight of 225 mg (range 200-250), and 90 mcg/dose, 60 dose (NDC 0186-0917-06) with a target fill weight of 165 mg (range 140-190). PULMICORT FLEXHALER consists of a number of assembled plastic details, the main parts being the dosing mechanism, the storage unit for drug substance, and the mouthpiece. The inhaler is protected by a white outer tubular cover screwed onto the inhaler. The body of the inhaler is white and the turning grip is brown. The PULMICORT FLEXHALER inhaler cannot be refilled and should be discarded when empty. The number in the middle of the dose indicator window shows how many doses are left in the inhaler. The inhaler is empty when the number zero (“0”) on the red background reaches the middle of the window. If the unit is used beyond the point at which the zero reaches the middle of the window, the correct amount of medication may not be obtained and the unit should be discarded. Store in a dry place at controlled room temperature 20-25°C (68-77°F) [see USP] with the cover tightly in place. Keep out of the reach of children. Patients being treated with PULMICORT FLEXHALER should receive the following information and instructions. This information is intended to aid the patient in the safe and effective use of the medication. It is not a disclosure of all possible adverse or intended effects. For proper use of PULMICORT FLEXHALER and to attain maximum improvement, the patient should read and follow the accompanying Patients should be advised that localized infections with occurred in the mouth and pharynx in some patients. If oropharyngeal candidiasis develops, it should be treated with appropriate local or systemic (i.e., oral) antifungal therapy while still continuing therapy with PULMICORT FLEXHALER, but at times therapy with PULMICORT FLEXHALER may need to be temporarily interrupted under close medical supervision. Rinsing the mouth after inhalation is advised . PULMICORT FLEXHALER is not meant to relieve acute asthma symptoms and extra doses should not be used for that purpose. Acute symptoms should be treated with an inhaled, short-acting beta-agonist such as albuterol (the physician should provide the patient with such medication and instruct the patient in how it should be used). Patients should be instructed to notify their physician immediately if they experience any of the following: Decreasing effectiveness of inhaled, short-acting beta-agonists Need for more inhalations than usual of inhaled, short-acting beta-agonists Significant decrease in lung function as outlined by the physician Patients should not stop therapy with PULMICORT FLEXHALER without physician/provider guidance since symptoms may recur after discontinuation . Hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis, rash, contact dermatitis, urticaria, angioedema, and bronchospasm have been reported with use of PULMICORT FLEXHALER. Discontinue PULMICORT FLEXHALER if such reactions occur [see , , ]. PULMICORT FLEXHALER contains small amounts of lactose, which contains trace levels of milk proteins. It is possible that cough, wheezing, or bronchospasm may occur in patients who have a severe milk protein allergy . Patients who are on immunosuppressant doses of corticosteroids should be warned to avoid exposure to chickenpox or measles and, if exposed, to consult their physician without delay. Patients should be informed of potential worsening of existing tuberculosis, fungal, bacterial, viral, or parasitic infections, or ocular herpes simplex . Patients should be advised that PULMICORT FLEXHALER may cause systemic corticosteroid effects of hypercorticism and adrenal suppression. Additionally, patients should be instructed that deaths due to adrenal insufficiency have occurred during and after transfer from systemic corticosteroids. Patients should taper slowly from systemic corticosteroids if transferring to PULMICORT FLEXHALER . Patients who are at an increased risk for decreased BMD should be advised that the use of corticosteroids may pose an additional risk . Patients should be informed that orally inhaled corticosteroids, including budesonide inhalation powder, may cause a reduction in growth velocity when administered to pediatric patients. Physicians should closely follow the growth of children and adolescents taking corticosteroids by any route . Long-term use of inhaled corticosteroids may increase the risk of some eye problems (cataracts or glaucoma); regular eye examinations should be considered . Patients should be advised to use PULMICORT FLEXHALER at regular intervals, since its effectiveness depends on regular use. Maximum benefit may not be achieved for 1 to 2 weeks or longer after starting treatment. If symptoms do not improve in that time frame or if the condition worsens, patients should be instructed to contact their physician. Patients should be carefully instructed on the use of this drug product to assure optimal dose delivery. The patient may not sense the presence of any medication entering their lungs when inhaling from PULMICORT FLEXHALER. This lack of sensation does not mean that they did not get the medication. They should not repeat their inhalation even if they did not feel the medication when inhaling [see ]. This medicine is to only be inhaled through the mouth (by oral inhalation only). Read the Patient Information that comes with PULMICORT FLEXHALER before you start using it and each time you get a refill. There may be new information. This leaflet does not take the place of talking to your healthcare provider about your medical condition or treatment. PULMICORT FLEXHALER is an inhaled corticosteroid medicine. PULMICORT FLEXHALER is used for long-term (maintenance) treatment of asthma and to prevent asthma symptoms in adults and children 6 years of age and older. Inhaled corticosteroids help to decrease inflammation in the lungs. Inflammation in the lungs can lead to asthma symptoms. PULMICORT FLEXHALER helps reduce inflammation and helps keep the airways open to reduce asthma symptoms. PULMICORT FLEXHALER does not treat the symptoms of a sudden asthma attack. Always have a short-acting beta-agonist medicine (rescue inhaler) with you to treat sudden symptoms. If you do not have an inhaled, short-acting bronchodilator, call your healthcare provider to have one prescribed for you. It is not known if PULMICORT FLEXHALER is safe and effective in children younger than 6 years of age. if you have a severe allergy to milk proteins. PULMICORT FLEXHALER contains a small amount of lactose (milk sugar). People with severe allergies to milk protein may have symptoms of an allergic reaction with PULMICORT FLEXHALER including: cough, wheezing, trouble breathing or feeling like your throat is closing. What should I tell my healthcare provider before using PULMICORT FLEXHALER? Before using PULMICORT FLEXHALER, tell your healthcare provider if you: have any allergies. See the section “Who should not use PULMICORT FLEXHALER”. There is a complete list of ingredients in PULMICORT FLEXHALER at the end of this leaflet. have or had chicken pox or measles, or have recently been near anyone with chicken pox or measles. have or had tuberculosis of your respiratory tract. have certain kinds of serious infections that have not been treated, including: herpes simplex infection of the eye (ocular herpes simplex) PULMICORT FLEXHALER may not be right for people who have or had any of these types of infections. You are at risk for decreased bone mineral density if you: are a woman going through menopause or are past menopause (“the change of life”) take bone thinning medicines (such as anticonvulsant medicines or corticosteroids) for a long time. have eye problems such as increased pressure in the eye, glaucoma, or cataracts are pregnant or plan to become pregnant. It is not known if PULMICORT FLEXHALER may harm your unborn baby are breast-feeding or plan to breast-feed. PULMICORT FLEXHALER can pass into breast milk. You and your healthcare provider should decide if you will use PULMICORT FLEXHALER or breast-feed Tell your healthcare provider about all the medicines you take, including prescription and non-prescription medicines, vitamins, and herbal supplements. Using PULMICORT FLEXHALER with certain other medicines may affect each other causing side effects. Especially tell your healthcare provider if you take: medicines that suppress your immune system (immunosuppressant) ketoconazole (Nizoral), other medicines that affect how your liver works. Ask your healthcare provider or pharmacist if you are not sure if your medicine is one listed above. Know the medicines you take. Keep a list of them and show it to your healthcare provider and pharmacist when you get a new medicine. Use PULMICORT FLEXHALER exactly as prescribed by your healthcare provider. You must use PULMICORT FLEXHALER regularly for it to work. PULMICORT FLEXHALER comes in two strengths. Your healthcare provider has prescribed the strength that is best for you. Be sure you know the difference between PULMICORT FLEXHALER and any other inhaled medicines that are prescribed for you, including what you use them for (prescribed use) and what they look like. Do not stop using PULMICORT FLEXHALER, even if your symptoms get better. Your healthcare provider will change your medicines as needed. Do not change or stop any medicines used to control or treat your breathing problems, unless your healthcare provider tells you to. Rinse your mouth with water and spit the water out after each dose of PULMICORT FLEXHALER. Do not swallow the water. This will lessen the chance of getting a fungal infection (thrush) in the mouth. If you miss a dose, just take your next regularly scheduled dose when it is due. Do not use PULMICORT FLEXHALER more often or use more puffs than you have been prescribed. Make sure you always have a short-acting beta-agonist medicine with you. Use your short acting beta-agonist medicine if you have breathing problems between doses of PULMICORT FLEXHALER or if a sudden asthma   attack happens. Call your healthcare provider right away if: your short-acting rescue medicine does not work as well for relieving asthma symptoms. you need to use your short-acting rescue medicines more often than usual. your breathing problems worsen with PULMICORT FLEXHALER. If you use another inhaled medicine by mouth to treat your asthma, talk with your healthcare provider for instructions about when to use the other medicine and when to use your PULMICORT FLEXHALER. If you have used corticosteroid medicines for a long time and the dose is now being lowered or stopped, you should carry a medical alert card. The medical alert card should state that you may need increased corticosteroids during times of stress or during an asthma attack that does not get better with bronchodilator medicines. Your healthcare provider may check your breathing, do blood tests and eye exams during treatment with PULMICORT FLEXHALER. Be sure to read, understand and follow the detailed Patient Instructions for Use at the end of this leaflet. These Instructions for Use tell you how to prime and use your PULMICORT FLEXHALER the right way. What are the possible side effects of PULMICORT FLEXHALER? PULMICORT FLEXHALER can cause serious side effects, including: thrush (candida), a fungal infection in your mouth and throat. Tell your healthcare provider if you have any redness or white colored patches in your mouth or throat. . Tell your healthcare provider or get medical help right away if you have: Immune system effects and a higher chance of infections. You are more likely to get infections if you take medicines that weaken your immune system. Avoid contact with people who have contagious diseases such as chicken pox or measles while using PULMICORT FLEXHALER. Symptoms of infection may include: fever, pain, aches, chills, feeling tired, nausea and vomiting. Tell your healthcare provider about any signs of infection while you are using PULMICORT FLEXHALER. Adrenal insufficiency is a condition in which the adrenal glands do not make enough steroid hormones. Symptoms of adrenal insufficiency include: tiredness, weakness, nausea and vomiting and low blood pressure. Your healthcare provider should check you for this during treatment with PULMICORT FLEXHALER. A child’s growth should be checked regularly while using PULMICORT FLEXHALER. You should have regular eye exams while using PULMICORT FLEXHALER. Increased wheezing right after taking PULMICORT FLEXHALER. Always have a short-acting beta-agonist medicine (rescue inhaler) with you to treat sudden wheezing. Call your healthcare provider or get medical help right away if you have symptoms of any of the serious side effects listed above. Common side effects reported by patients using PULMICORT FLEXHALER include: viral irritation and inflammation of the stomach and intestine (gastroenteritis). Symptoms may include stomach area pain, diarrhea, nausea and vomiting, loss of appetite, headaches, and weakness. Tell your healthcare provider about any side effect that bothers you or that does not go away. These are not all of the side effects of PULMICORT FLEXHALER. Ask your healthcare provider or pharmacist for more information. Call your healthcare provider for medical advice about side effects. You may report side effects to AstraZeneca at 1-800-236-9933 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or . Store PULMICORT FLEXHALER at 68° to 77°F (20° to 25°C). Keep your PULMICORT FLEXHALER with the cover tightly in place when not in use. Keep your PULMICORT FLEXHALER and all medicines out of the reach of children. Medicines are sometimes prescribed for conditions that are not mentioned in Patient Information Leaflets. Do not use PULMICORT FLEXHALER for a condition for which it was not prescribed. Do not give PULMICORT FLEXHALER to other people, even if they have the same symptoms that you have. It may harm them. This Patient Information leaflet summarizes the most important information about PULMICORT FLEXHALER. If you would like more information, talk with your healthcare provider. You can ask your pharmacist or healthcare provider for information about PULMICORT FLEXHALER that is written for health professionals. For more information, go to or call 1- 800-236-9933. Before you use a new PULMICORT FLEXHALER for the first time, you must prime it. To prime your PULMICORT FLEXHALER, follow the steps below: Hold the inhaler by the brown grip so that the white cover points upward (upright position). With the other hand, turn the white cover and lift it off (see Figure 2). Continue to hold your PULMICORT FLEXHALER upright as shown in Figure 1. Use your other hand to hold the inhaler in the middle. Do not hold the inhaler at the top of the mouthpiece. Twist the brown grip as far as it will go in one direction and then fully back again in the other direction until it stops (it does not matter which way you turn it first). You will hear a “click” during one of the twisting movements (see Figures 3 and 4). Repeat Step 3. Your PULMICORT FLEXHALER is now primed. You are ready to load your first dose. You do not have to prime your PULMICORT FLEXHALER again after this even if you do not use it for a long period of time. Hold your PULMICORT FLEXHALER upright as described above. With your other hand, twist the white cover and lift it off (see Figure 2). Continue to hold your PULMICORT FLEXHALER upright to be sure that the right dose of medicine is loaded. Use your other hand to hold the inhaler in the middle. Do not hold the mouthpiece when you load the inhaler. Twist the brown grip fully in one direction as far as it will go. Twist it fully back again in the other direction as far as it will go (it does not matter which way you turn it first) [see Figure 3]. You will hear a “click” during one of the twisting movements (see Figure 4). PULMICORT FLEXHALER will only give one dose at a time, no matter how often you click the brown grip, but the dose indicator will continue to move (advance). This means that if you continue to move the brown grip, it is possible for the indicator to show fewer doses or zero doses even if more doses are left in the inhaler. Turn your head away from the inhaler and breathe out (exhale). If you accidentally blow into your inhaler after loading a dose, follow the instructions for loading a new dose. Place the mouthpiece in your mouth and close your lips around the mouthpiece. Breathe in (inhale) deeply and forcefully through the inhaler (see Figure 5). You may not sense the presence of any medication entering your lungs when inhaling from PULMICORT FLEXHALER. This lack of sensation does not mean that you did not get the medication. You should not repeat your inhalations even if you did not feel the medication when inhaling. Remove the inhaler from your mouth and exhale. Do not blow or exhale into the mouthpiece. If more than one dose is prescribed repeat the steps above. When you are finished taking your dose place the white cover back on the inhaler and twist shut. Rinse your mouth with water after each dose to decrease your risk of getting thrush. Do not swallow the water. The label on the box or cover will tell you how many doses are in your PULMICORT FLEXHALER. Your PULMICORT FLEXHALER has a dose indicator window just below the mouthpiece. The dose indicator tells you about how many doses are left in the inhaler. Look at the middle of the window to find out about how many doses are left in your inhaler (see Figure 6). The dose indicator is connected to the turning grip and moves (counts down) every time a dose is loaded. It is not likely that you will see the dose indicator move with each dose. You can usually see the indicator move each time you use about 5 doses. The dose indicator starts with either the number 60 or 120 when full, depending upon the strength of the inhaler. The indicator is marked in intervals of 10 doses. Markings are either with numbers or dashes (alternating), counting down to “0”. Dose indicator starts at 60 or 120 depending on strength (90 mcg or 180 mcg) of the inhaler and counts down to 0. Do not put your PULMICORT FLEXHALER in water (do not immerse it) to find out if it is empty. Check the dose indicator window to see how many doses are left. Refill your PULMICORT FLEXHALER prescription before your medicine runs out. You will get a new inhaler each time you refill your prescription. Keep your PULMICORT FLEXHALER clean and dry at all times. Do not immerse it in water. Wipe the outside of the mouthpiece one time each week with a dry tissue. Do not use water or liquids when cleaning the mouthpiece. Do not use your PULMICORT FLEXHALER if it has been damaged or if the mouthpiece has become detached.

See 17 for PATIENT COUNSELING INFORMATION and FDA-approved patient labeling. 13.1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis, Impairment Of Fertility Sections or subsections omitted from the full prescribing information are not listed. Serious neuropsychiatric (NP) events have been reported with the use of montelukast sodium tablets. The types of events reported were highly variable, and included, but were not limited to, agitation, aggression, depression, sleep disturbances, suicidal thoughts and behavior (including suicide). The mechanisms underlying NP events associated with montelukast sodium tablets use are currently not well understood Because of the risk of NP events, the benefits of montelukast sodium tablets may not outweigh the risks in some patients, particularly when the symptoms of disease may be mild and adequately treated with alternative therapies. Reserve use of montelukast sodium tablets for patients with allergic rhinitis who have an inadequate response or intolerance to alternative therapies In patients with asthma or exercise-induced bronchoconstriction, consider the benefits and risks before prescribing montelukast sodium tablets. Discuss the benefits and risks of montelukast sodium tablets with patients and caregivers when prescribing montelukast sodium tablets. Advise patients and/ or caregivers to be alert for changes in behavior or new NP symptoms when taking montelukast sodium tablets. If changes in behavior are observed or if new NP symptoms or suicidal thoughts and/ or behavior occur, advise patients to discontinue montelukast sodium tablets immediately Montelukast sodium tablets are indicated for the prophylaxis and chronic treatment of asthma in patients 15 years of age and older. Montelukast sodium tablets are indicated for prevention of exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (EIB) in patients 15 years of age and older. Montelukast sodium tablets are  indicated for the relief of symptoms of seasonal allergic rhinitis in patients 15 years of age and older and perennial allergic rhinitis in patients 15 years of age and older. Because the benefits of montelukast sodium tablets may not outweigh the risk of neuropsychiatric symptoms in patients with allergic rhinitis reserve use for patients who have an inadequate response to alternative therapies. Montelukast sodium should be taken once daily in the evening. The following dose is recommended:For adults and adolescents 15 years of age and older: one 10-mg tablet. Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients less than 12 months of age with asthma have not been established. Patients who miss a dose should take the next dose at their regular time and should not take 2 doses at the same time. There have been no clinical trials in patients with asthma to evaluate the relative efficacy of morning versus evening dosing. The pharmacokinetics of montelukast are similar whether dosed in the morning or evening. Efficacy has been demonstrated for asthma when montelukast was administered in the evening without regard to time of food ingestion. For prevention of EIB, a single 10 mg dose of montelukast should be taken at least 2 hours before exercise. The following dose is recommended :For adults and adolescents 15 years of age and older: one 10-mg tablet. An additional dose of montelukast should not be taken within 24 hours of a previous dose. Patients already taking montelukast sodium daily for another indication (including chronic asthma) should not take an additional dose to prevent EIB. All patients should have available for rescue a short-acting ß-agonist. Safety and efficacy in patients younger than 15 years of age have not been established. Daily administration of montelukast sodium for the chronic treatment of asthma has not been established to prevent acute episodes of EIB. For allergic rhinitis, montelukast sodium should be taken once daily. Efficacy was demonstrated for seasonal allergic rhinitis when montelukast was administered in the morning or the evening without regard to time of food ingestion. The time of administration may be individualized to suit patient needs.The following dose for the treatment of symptoms of seasonal allergic rhinitis are recommended:For adults and adolescents 15 years of age and older: one 10-mg tablet.Safety and efficacy in pediatric patients younger than 2 years of age with seasonal allergic rhinitis have not been established.The following dose for the treatment of symptoms of perennial allergic rhinitis are recommended:For adults and adolescents 15 years of age and older: one 10-mg tablet.Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients younger than 6 months of age with perennial allergic rhinitis have not been established. Patients who miss a dose should take the next dose at their regular time and should not take 2 doses at the same time. Patients with both asthma and allergic rhinitis should take only one montelukast sodium dose daily in the evening. Patients who miss a dose should take the next dose at their regular time and should not take 2 doses at the same time. Montelukast sodium Film-Coated Tablets, USP 10 mg, are beige, rounded square-shaped biconvex tablets, debossed 'CL 26' on one side of the tablet and having plain surface on other side. Hypersensitivity to any component of this product. Serious neuropsychiatric (NP) events have been reported with the use of montelukast sodium. These post-marketing reports have been highly variable and included, but were not limited to, agitation, aggressive behavior or hostility, anxiousness, depression, disorientation, disturbance in attention, dream abnormalities, dysphemia (stuttering), hallucinations, insomnia, irritability, memory impairment, obsessive-compulsive symptoms, restlessness, somnambulism, suicidal thoughts and behavior (including suicide), tic, and tremor. NP events have been reported in adult, adolescent, and pediatric patients with and without a previous history of psychiatric disorder. NP events have been reported mostly during montelukast sodium treatment, but some were reported after montelukast sodium discontinuation. Animal studies showed that montelukast distributes into the brain in rats however, the mechanisms underlying montelukast sodium-associated NP events are currently not well understood. Based upon the available data, it is difficult to identify risk factors for or quantify the risk of NP events with montelukast sodium use. Because of the risks of NP events, the benefits of montelukast sodium may not outweigh the risks in some patients, particularly when the symptoms of disease may be mild and adequately treated with alternative therapies. Reserve use of montelukast sodium for patients with allergic rhinitis who have an inadequate response or intolerance to alternative therapies In patients with asthma or exercised-induced bronchoconstriction, consider the benefits and risks before prescribing montelukast sodium. Discuss the benefits and risks of montelukast sodium use with patients and caregivers when prescribing montelukast sodium. Advise patients and/ or caregivers to be alert for changes in behavior or for new NP symptoms when taking montelukast sodium. If changes in behavior are observed, or if new NP symptoms or suicidal thoughts and/or behavior occur, advise patients to discontinue montelukast sodium and contact a healthcare provider immediately. In many cases, symptoms resolved after stopping montelukast sodium therapy; however, in some cases symptoms persisted after discontinuation of montelukast sodium. Therefore, continue to monitor and provide supportive care until symptoms resolve. Re-evaluate the benefits and risks of restarting treatment with montelukast sodium if such events occur. Montelukast sodium is not indicated for use in the reversal of bronchospasm in acute asthma attacks, including status asthmaticus. Patients should be advised to have appropriate rescue medication available. Therapy with montelukast sodium can be continued during acute exacerbations of asthma. Patients who have exacerbations of asthma after exercise should have available for rescue a short-acting inhaled ß-agonist. While the dose of inhaled corticosteroid may be reduced gradually under medical supervision, montelukast sodium should not be abruptly substituted for inhaled or oral corticosteroids. Patients with known aspirin sensitivity should continue avoidance of aspirin or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents while taking montelukast sodium. Although montelukast sodium is effective in improving airway function in asthmatics with documented aspirin sensitivity, it has not been shown to truncate bronchoconstrictor response to aspirin and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in aspirin-sensitive asthmatic patients Patients with asthma on therapy with montelukast sodium may present with systemic eosinophilia, sometimes presenting with clinical features of vasculitis consistent with Churg-Strauss syndrome, a condition which is often treated with systemic corticosteroid therapy. These events have been sometimes associated with the reduction of oral corticosteroid therapy. Physicians should be alert to eosinophilia, vasculitic rash, worsening pulmonary symptoms, cardiac complications, and/or neuropathy presenting in their patients. A causal association between montelukast sodium and these underlying conditions has not been established [see ()]. Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. In the following description of clinical trials experience, adverse reactions are listed regardless of causality assessment.The most common adverse reactions (incidence ≥5% and greater than placebo; listed in descending order of frequency) in controlled clinical trials were: upper respiratory infection, fever, headache, pharyngitis, cough, abdominal pain, diarrhea, otitis media, influenza, rhinorrhea, sinusitis, otitis. Adults and Adolescents 15 Years of Age and Older with Asthma Montelukast sodium has been evaluated for safety in approximately 2950 adult and adolescent patients 15 years of age and older in clinical trials. In placebo-controlled clinical trials, the following adverse experiences reported with montelukast occurred in greater than or equal to 1% of patients and at an incidence greater than that in patients treated with placebo: Table 1: Adverse Experiences Occurring in ≥1% of Patients with an Incidence Greater than that in Patients Treated with Placebo Montelukast 10 mg/day (%) (n=1955) Number of patients tested (montelukast sodium and placebo, respectively): ALT and AST, 1935, 1170; pyuria, 1924, 1159. The frequency of less common adverse events was comparable between montelukast sodium and placebo.The safety profile of montelukast sodium, when administered as a single dose for prevention of EIB in adult and adolescent patients 15 years of age and older, was consistent with the safety profile previously described for montelukast sodium.Cumulatively, 569 patients were treated with montelukast sodium for at least 6 months, 480 for one year, and 49 for two years in clinical trials. With prolonged treatment, the adverse experience profile did not significantly change. Adults and Adolescents 15 Years of Age and Older with Seasonal Allergic Rhinitis Montelukast sodium has been evaluated for safety in 2199 adult and adolescent patients 15 years of age and older in clinical trials. Montelukast sodium administered once daily in the morning or in the evening had a safety profile similar to that of placebo. In placebo-controlled clinical trials, the following event was reported with montelukast sodium with a frequency ≥ 1% and at an incidence greater than placebo: upper respiratory infection, 1.9% of patients receiving montelukast sodium vs. 1.5% of patients receiving placebo. In a 4-week, placebo-controlled clinical study, the safety profile was consistent with that observed in 2-week studies. The incidence of somnolence was similar to that of placebo in all studies. Adults and Adolescents 15 Years of Age and Older with Perennial Allergic Rhinitis Montelukast sodium has been evaluated for safety in 3357 adult and adolescent patients 15 years of age and older with perennial allergic rhinitis of whom 1632 received montelukast sodium in two, 6-week, clinical studies. Montelukast sodium administered once daily had a safety profile consistent with that observed in patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis and similar to that of placebo. In these two studies, the following events were reported with montelukast sodium with a frequency ≥ 1% and at an incidence greater than placebo: sinusitis, upper respiratory infection, sinus headache, cough, epistaxis, and increased ALT. The incidence of somnolence was similar to that of placebo. The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of montelukast sodium. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Blood and lymphatic system disorders: increased bleeding tendency, thrombocytopenia.Immune system disorders: hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis, hepatic eosinophilic infiltration.Psychiatric disorders: including but not limited to agitation, aggressive behavior or hostility, anxiousness, depression, disorientation, disturbance in attention, dream abnormalities, dysphemia (stuttering), hallucinations, insomnia, irritability, memory impairment obsessive-compulsive symptoms, restlessness, somnambulism, suicidal thinking and behavior (including suicide), tic, and tremor [].Nervous system disorders: drowsiness, paraesthesia/hypoesthesia, seizures.Cardiac disorders: palpitations.Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders: epistaxis, pulmonary eosinophilia.Gastrointestinal disorders: diarrhea, dyspepsia, nausea, pancreatitis, vomiting.Hepatobiliary disorders: Cases of cholestatic hepatitis, hepatocellular liver-injury, and mixed-pattern liver injury have been reported in patients treated with montelukast sodium. Most of these occurred in combination with other confounding factors, such as use of other medications, or when montelukast sodium was administered to patients who had underlying potential for liver disease such as alcohol use or other forms of hepatitis.Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: angioedema, bruising, erythema multiforme, erythema nodosum, pruritus, Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis, urticaria.Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders: arthralgia, myalgia including muscle cramps.Renal and urinary disorders: enuresis in children.General disorders and administration site conditions: edema.Patients with asthma on therapy with montelukast sodium may present with systemic eosinophilia, sometimes presenting with clinical features of vasculitis consistent with Churg-Strauss syndrome, a condition which is often treated with systemic corticosteroid therapy. These events have been sometimes associated with the reduction of oral corticosteroid therapy. Physicians should be alert to eosinophilia, vasculitic rash, worsening pulmonary symptoms, cardiac complications, and/or neuropathy presenting in their patients []. No dose adjustment is needed when montelukast sodium is co-administered with theophylline, prednisone, prednisolone, oral contraceptives, terfenadine, digoxin, warfarin, gemfibrozil, itraconazole, thyroid hormones, sedative hypnotics, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents, benzodiazepines, decongestants, and Cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme inducers [see ]. Available data from published prospective and retrospective cohort studies over decades with montelukast use in pregnant women have not established a drug-associated risk of major birth defects [see Data]. In animal reproductions studies, no adverse developmental effects were observed with oral administration of Montelukast to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis at doses approximately 100 and 110 times, respectively, the maximum recommended human daily oral dose (MRHDOD) based on AUCs [see Data]. The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S general populations, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognizes pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. Disease-associated maternal and/or embryo/fetal risk Poorly or moderately controlled asthma in pregnancy increases the maternal risk of perinatal adverse outcomes such as preeclampsia and infant prematurity, low birth weight, and small for gestational age. Published data from prospective and retrospective cohort studies have not identified an association with montelukast sodium use during pregnancy and major birth defects. Available studies have methodologic limitations, including small sample size, in some cases retrospective data collection, and inconsistent comparator groups. In embryo-fetal development studies, montelukast administered to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis (gestation days 6 to 17 in rats and 6 to 18 in rabbits) did not cause any adverse developmental effects at maternal oral doses up to 400 and 300mg/kg/day in rats and rabbits, respectively (approximately 100 and 110 times the AUC in humans at the MRHDOD, respectively). A published clinical lactation study reports the presence of montelukast in human milk. Data available on the effects of the drug on infants, either directly [see ] or through breast milk, do not suggest a significant risk of adverse events from exposure to montelukast sodium. The effects of the drug on milk production are unknown. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother’s clinical need for montelukast sodium and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from montelukast sodium or from the underlying maternal condition. The safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of 12 months with asthma and 6 months with perennial allergic rhinitis have not been established. The safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of 6 years with exercise-induced bronchoconstriction have not been established. Of the total number of subjects in clinical studies of montelukast, 3.5% were 65 years of age and over, and 0.4% were 75 years of age and over. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out. The pharmacokinetic profile and the oral bioavailability of a single 10-mg oral dose of montelukast are similar in elderly and younger adults. The plasma half-life of montelukast is slightly longer in the elderly. No dosage adjustment in the elderly is required. No dosage adjustment is required in patients with mild-to-moderate hepatic insufficiency [see ]. No dosage adjustment is recommended in patients with renal insufficiency [see ]. No specific information is available on the treatment of overdosage with montelukast sodium. In the event of overdose, it is reasonable to employ the usual supportive measures; e.g., remove unabsorbed material from the gastrointestinal tract, employ clinical monitoring, and institute supportive therapy, if required. It is not known whether montelukast is removed by peritoneal dialysis or hemodialysis. Montelukast sodium,  USP the active ingredient in montelukast sodium tablets, is a selective and orally active leukotriene receptor antagonist that inhibits the cysteinyl leukotriene CysLT receptor.Montelukast sodium, USP is described chemically as [R-(E)]-1-[[[1-[3-[2-(7-chloro-2-quinolinyl)ethenyl] phenyl]-3-[2-(1-hydroxy-1-methylethyl)phenyl] propyl]thio]methyl]cyclopropaneacetic  acid, monosodium salt.The molecular formula is CHClNNaOS, and its molecular weight is 608.18. The structural formula is: Montelukast sodium, USP is a hygroscopic, optically active, white to off-white powder. Montelukast sodium is freely soluble in ethanol, methanol, and water and practically insoluble in acetonitrile.Each 10-mg film-coated montelukast tablet, USP contains 10.4 mg montelukast sodium, USP which is equivalent to 10 mg of montelukast, and the following inactive ingredients: microcrystalline cellulose, lactose monohydrate, croscarmellose sodium, hydroxypropyl cellulose, disodium edetate and magnesium stearate. The film coating consists of: hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, hydroxypropyl cellulose, titanium dioxide, red ferric oxide and yellow ferric oxide. The cysteinyl leukotrienes (LTC, LTD, LTE) are products of arachidonic acid metabolism and are released from various cells, including mast cells and eosinophils. These eicosanoids bind to cysteinyl leukotriene (CysLT) receptors. The CysLT type-1 (CysLT) receptor is found in the human airway (including airway smooth muscle cells and airway macrophages) and on other pro-inflammatory cells (including eosinophils and certain myeloid stem cells). CysLTs have been correlated with the pathophysiology of asthma and allergic rhinitis. In asthma, leukotriene-mediated effects include airway edema, smooth muscle contraction, and altered cellular activity associated with the inflammatory process. In allergic rhinitis, CysLTs are released from the nasal mucosa after allergen exposure during both early- and late-phase reactions and are associated with symptoms of allergic rhinitis.Montelukast is an orally active compound that binds with high affinity and selectivity to the CysLT receptor (in preference to other pharmacologically important airway receptors, such as the prostanoid, cholinergic, or β-adrenergic receptor). Montelukast inhibits physiologic actions of LTD at the CysLT receptor without any agonist activity. Montelukast causes inhibition of airway cysteinyl leukotriene receptors as demonstrated by the ability to inhibit bronchoconstriction due to inhaled LTD in asthmatics. Doses as low as 5 mg cause substantial blockage of LTD-induced bronchoconstriction. In a placebo-controlled, crossover study (n=12), montelukast sodium inhibited early- and late-phase bronchoconstriction due to antigen challenge by 75% and 57%, respectively.The effect of montelukast sodium on eosinophils in the peripheral blood was examined in clinical trials. In patients with asthma aged 2 years and older who received montelukast, a decrease in mean peripheral blood eosinophil counts ranging from 9% to 15% was noted, compared with placebo, over the double-blind treatment periods. In patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis aged 15 years and older who received montelukast sodium, a mean increase of 0.2% in peripheral blood eosinophil counts was noted, compared with a mean increase of 12.5% in placebo-treated patients, over the double-blind treatment periods; this reflects a mean difference of 12.3% in favor of montelukast sodium. The relationship between these observations and the clinical benefits of montelukast noted in the clinical trials is not known [see ]. Montelukast is rapidly absorbed following oral administration. After administration of the 10-mg film-coated tablet to fasted adults, the mean peak montelukast plasma concentration (C) is achieved in 3 to 4 hours (T). The mean oral bioavailability is 64%. The oral bioavailability and C are not influenced by a standard meal in the morning.The safety and efficacy of montelukast sodium in patients with asthma were demonstrated in clinical trials in which the 10-mg film-coated tablet formulation was administered in the evening without regard to the time of food ingestion. The safety and efficacy of montelukast sodium in patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis were demonstrated in clinical trials in which the 10-mg film-coated tablet was administered in the morning or evening without regard to the time of food ingestion.The comparative pharmacokinetics of montelukast when administered as two 5-mg chewable tablets versus one 10-mg film-coated tablet have not been evaluated. Montelukast is more than 99% bound to plasma proteins. The steady state volume of distribution of montelukast averages 8 to 11 liters. Orally administered montelukast distributes into the brain in rats. Montelukast is extensively metabolized. In studies with therapeutic doses, plasma concentrations of metabolites of montelukast are undetectable at steady state in adults and pediatric patients. studies using human liver microsomes indicate that CYP3A4, 2C8, and 2C9 are involved in the metabolism of montelukast. At clinically relevant concentrations, 2C8 appears to play a major role in the metabolism of montelukast. The plasma clearance of montelukast averages 45 mL/min in healthy adults. Following an oral dose of radiolabeled montelukast, 86% of the radioactivity was recovered in 5-day fecal collections and <0.2% was recovered in urine. Coupled with estimates of montelukast oral bioavailability, this indicates that montelukast and its metabolites are excreted almost exclusively via the bile.In several studies, the mean plasma half-life of montelukast ranged from 2.7 to 5.5 hours in healthy young adults. The pharmacokinetics of montelukast are nearly linear for oral doses up to 50 mg. During once-daily dosing with 10-mg montelukast, there is little accumulation of the parent drug in plasma (14%). : Patients with mild-to-moderate hepatic insufficiency and clinical evidence of cirrhosis had evidence of decreased metabolism of montelukast resulting in 41% (90% CI=7%, 85%) higher mean montelukast AUC following a single 10-mg dose. The elimination of montelukast was slightly prolonged compared with that in healthy subjects (mean half-life, 7.4 hours).No dosage adjustment is required in patients with mild-to-moderate hepatic insufficiency. The pharmacokinetics of montelukast in patients with more severe hepatic impairment or with hepatitis have not been evaluated. : Since montelukast and its metabolites are not excreted in the urine, the pharmacokinetics of montelukast were not evaluated in patients with renal insufficiency. No dosage adjustment is recommended in these patients. r: The pharmacokinetics of montelukast are similar in males and females. : Pharmacokinetic differences due to race have not been studied. : Pharmacokinetic studies evaluated the systemic exposure of the 10-mg film-coated tablets in young adults and adolescents ≥ 15 years of age.The plasma concentration profile of montelukast following administration of the 10-mg film-coated tablet is similar in adolescents ≥ 15 years of age and young adults. The 10-mg film-coated tablet is recommended for use in patients ≥ 15 years of age. : Montelukast sodium has been administered with other therapies routinely used in the prophylaxis and chronic treatment of asthma with no apparent increase in adverse reactions. In drug-interaction studies, the recommended clinical dose of montelukast did not have clinically important effects on the pharmacokinetics of the following drugs: theophylline, prednisone, and prednisolone. Montelukast at a dose of 10 mg once daily dosed to pharmacokinetic steady state, did not cause clinically significant changes in the kinetics of a single intravenous dose of theophylline [predominantly a cytochrome P450 (CYP) 1A2 substrate]. Montelukast at doses of ≥ 100 mg daily dosed to pharmacokinetic steady state, did not cause any clinically significant change in plasma profiles of prednisone or prednisolone following administration of either oral prednisone or intravenous prednisolone. Oral Contraceptives, Terfenadine, Digoxin, and Warfarin: In drug interaction studies, the recommended clinical dose of montelukast did not have clinically important effects on the pharmacokinetics of the following drugs: oral contraceptives (norethindrone 1 mg/ethinyl estradiol 35 mcg), terfenadine, digoxin, and warfarin. Montelukast at doses of ≥ 100 mg daily dosed to pharmacokinetic steady state did not significantly alter the plasma concentrations of either component of an oral contraceptive containing norethindrone 1 mg/ ethinyl estradiol 35 mcg. Montelukast at a dose of 10 mg once daily dosed to pharmacokinetic steady state did not change the plasma concentration profile of terfenadine (a substrate of CYP3A4) or fexofenadine, the carboxylated metabolite, and did not prolong the QTc interval following co-administration with terfenadine 60 mg twice daily; did not change the pharmacokinetic profile or urinary excretion of immunoreactive digoxin; did not change the pharmacokinetic profile of warfarin (primarily a substrate of CYP2C9, 3A4 and 1A2) or influence the effect of a single 30-mg oral dose of warfarin on prothrombin time or the International Normalized Ratio (INR). Thyroid Hormones, Sedative Hypnotics, Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Benzodiazepines, and Decongestants: Although additional specific interaction studies were not performed, montelukast was used concomitantly with a wide range of commonly prescribed drugs in clinical studies without evidence of clinical adverse interactions. These medications included thyroid hormones, sedative hypnotics, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents, benzodiazepines, and decongestants. : Phenobarbital, which induces hepatic metabolism, decreased the area under the plasma concentration curve (AUC) of montelukast approximately 40% following a single 10-mg dose of montelukast. No dosage adjustment for montelukast sodium is recommended. It is reasonable to employ appropriate clinical monitoring when potent CYP enzyme inducers, such as phenobarbital or rifampin, are co-administered with montelukast sodium. Effect of Montelukast on Cytochrome P450 (CYP) Enzymes: Montelukast is a potent inhibitor of CYP2C8 . However, data from a clinical drug-drug interaction study involving montelukast and rosiglitazone (a probe substrate representative of drugs primarily metabolized by CYP2C8) in 12 healthy individuals demonstrated that the pharmacokinetics of rosiglitazone are not altered when the drugs are coadministered, indicating that montelukast does not inhibit CYP2C8 . Therefore, montelukast is not anticipated to alter the metabolism of drugs metabolized by this enzyme (e.g., paclitaxel, rosiglitazone, and repaglinide). Based on further in vitro results in human liver microsomes, therapeutic plasma concentrations of montelukast do not inhibit CYP 3A4, 2C9, 1A2, 2A6, 2C19, or 2D6. studies have shown that montelukast is a substrate of CYP 2C8, 2C9, and 3A4. Co-administration of montelukast with itraconazole, a strong CYP 3A4 inhibitor, resulted in no significant increase in the systemic exposure of montelukast. Data from a clinical drug-drug interaction study involving montelukast and gemfibrozil (an inhibitor of both CYP 2C8 and 2C9) demonstrated that gemfibrozil, at a therapeutic dose, increased the systemic exposure of montelukast by 4.4-fold. Co-administration of itraconazole, gemfibrozil, and montelukast did not further increase the systemic exposure of montelukast. Based on available clinical experience, no dosage adjustment of montelukast is required upon co-administration with gemfibrozil []. 13.1 Carcinogenesis , Mutagenesis, Impairment Of Fertility No evidence of tumorigenicity was seen in carcinogenicity studies of either 2 years in Sprague-Dawley rats or 92 weeks in mice at oral gavage doses up to 200 mg/kg/day or 100 mg/kg/day, respectively. The estimated exposure in rats was approximately 120 and 75 times the AUC for adults and children, respectively, at the maximum recommended daily oral dose. The estimated exposure in mice was approximately 45 and 25 times the AUC for adults and children, respectively, at the maximum recommended daily oral dose.Montelukast demonstrated no evidence of mutagenic or clastogenic activity in the following assays: the microbial mutagenesis assay, the V-79 mammalian cell mutagenesis assay, the alkaline elution assay in rat hepatocytes, the chromosomal aberration assay in Chinese hamster ovary cells, and in the mouse bone marrow chromosomal aberration assay.In fertility studies in female rats, montelukast produced reductions in fertility and fecundity indices at an oral dose of 200 mg/kg (estimated exposure was approximately 70 times the AUC for adults at the maximum recommended daily oral dose). No effects on female fertility or fecundity were observed at an oral dose of 100 mg/kg (estimated exposure was approximately 20 times the AUC for adults at the maximum recommended daily oral dose). Montelukast had no effects on fertility in male rats at oral doses up to 800 mg/kg (estimated exposure was approximately 160 times the AUC for adults at the maximum recommended daily oral dose). Adults and Adolescents 15 Years of Age and Older with Asthma Clinical trials in adults and adolescents 15 years of age and older demonstrated there is no additional clinical benefit to montelukast doses above 10 mg once daily.The efficacy of montelukast sodium for the chronic treatment of asthma in adults and adolescents 15 years of age and older was demonstrated in two (U.S. and Multinational) similarly designed, randomized, 12-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials in 1576 patients (795 treated with montelukast sodium, 530 treated with placebo, and 251 treated with active control). The median age was 33 years (range 15 to 85); 56.8% were females and 43.2% were males. The ethnic/racial distribution in these studies was 71.6% Caucasian, 17.7% Hispanic, 7.2% other origins and 3.5% Black. Patients had mild or moderate asthma and were non-smokers who required approximately 5 puffs of inhaled β-agonist per day on an “as-needed” basis. The patients had a mean baseline percent of predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV) of 66% (approximate range, 40 to 90%). The co-primary endpoints in these trials were FEV and daytime asthma symptoms. In both studies after 12 weeks, a random subset of patients receiving montelukast sodium was switched to placebo for an additional 3 weeks of double-blind treatment to evaluate for possible rebound effects.The results of the U.S. trial on the primary endpoint, morning FEV, expressed as mean percent change from baseline averaged over the 12-week treatment period, are shown in FIGURE 2. Compared with placebo, treatment with one montelukast sodium 10-mg tablet daily in the evening resulted in a statistically significant increase in FEV percent change from baseline (13.0%-change in the group treated with montelukast sodium vs. 4.2%-change in the placebo group, p<0.001); the change from baseline in FEV for montelukast sodium was 0.32 liters compared with 0.10 liters for placebo, corresponding to a between-group difference of 0.22 liters (p<0.001, 95% CI 0.17 liters, 0.27 liters). The results of the Multinational trial on FEV were similar. Figure 2: FEV Mean Percent Change from Baseline (U.S. Trial: Montelukast Sodium N=406; Placebo N=270) (ANOVAModel) The effect of montelukast sodium on other primary and secondary endpoints, represented by the Multinational study is shown in TABLE 2.Results on these endpoints were similar in the US study. Table 2: Effect of Montelukast sodium on Primary and Secondary Endpoints in a Multinational Placebo-controlled Trial (ANOVA Model) Both studies evaluated the effect of montelukast sodium on secondary outcomes, including asthma attack (utilization of health-care resources such as an unscheduled visit to a doctor's office, emergency room, or hospital; or treatment with oral, intravenous, or intramuscular corticosteroid), and use of oral corticosteroids for asthma rescue. In the Multinational study, significantly fewer patients (15.6% of patients) on montelukast sodium experienced asthma attacks compared with patients on placebo (27.3%, p < 0.001). In the US study, 7.8% of patients on montelukast sodium and 10.3% of patients on placebo experienced asthma attacks, but the difference between the two treatment groups was not significant (p = 0.334). In the Multinational study, significantly fewer patients (14.8% of patients) on montelukast sodium were prescribed oral corticosteroids for asthma rescue compared with patients on placebo (25.7%, p < 0.001). In the US study, 6.9% of patients on montelukast sodium and 9.9% of patients on placebo were prescribed oral corticosteroids for asthma rescue, but the difference between the two treatment groups was not significant (p = 0.196). In each placebo-controlled trial in adults, the treatment effect of montelukast sodium, measured by daily diary card parameters, including symptom scores, “as-needed” ß-agonist use, and PEFR measurements, was achieved after the first dose and was maintained throughout the dosing interval (24 hours). No significant change in treatment effect was observed during continuous once-daily evening administration in non-placebo-controlled extension trials for up to one year. Withdrawal of montelukast sodium in asthmatic patients after 12 weeks of continuous use did not cause rebound worsening of asthma. Effects in Patients on Concomitant Inhaled Corticosteroids Separate trials in adults evaluated the ability of montelukast sodium to add to the clinical effect of inhaled corticosteroids and to allow inhaled corticosteroid tapering when used concomitantly.One randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trial (n=226) enrolled adults with stable asthma with a mean FEV of approximately 84% of predicted who were previously maintained on various inhaled corticosteroids (delivered by metered-dose aerosol or dry powder inhalers). The median age was 41.5 years (range 16 to 70); 52.2% were females and 47.8% were males.The ethnic/racial distribution in this study was 92.0% Caucasian, 3.5% Black, 2.2% Hispanic, and 2.2% Asian. The types of inhaled corticosteroids and their mean baseline requirements included beclomethasone dipropionate (mean dose, 1203 mcg/day), triamcinolone acetonide (mean dose, 2004 mcg/day), flunisolide (mean dose, 1971 mcg/day), fluticasone propionate (mean dose, 1083 mcg/day), or budesonide (mean dose, 1192 mcg/day). Some of these inhaled corticosteroids were non-U.S.-approved formulations, and doses expressed may not be ex-actuator. The pre-study inhaled corticosteroid requirements were reduced by approximately 37% during a 5- to 7-week placebo run-in period designed to titrate patients toward their lowest effective inhaled corticosteroid dose. Treatment with montelukast sodium resulted in a further 47% reduction in mean inhaled corticosteroid dose compared with a mean reduction of 30% in the placebo group over the 12-week active treatment period (p ≤ 0.05). It is not known whether the results of this study can be generalized to patients with asthma who require higher doses of inhaled corticosteroids or systemic corticosteroids. In another randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trial (n=642) in a similar population of adult patients previously maintained, but not adequately controlled, on inhaled corticosteroids (beclomethasone 336 mcg/day), the addition of  montelukast sodium to beclomethasone resulted in statistically significant improvements in FEV compared with those patients who were continued on beclomethasone alone or those patients who were withdrawn from beclomethasone and treated with montelukast or placebo alone over the last 10 weeks of the 16-week, blinded treatment period. Patients who were randomized to treatment arms containing beclomethasone had statistically significantly better asthma control than those patients randomized to montelukast sodium alone or placebo alone as indicated by FEV, daytime asthma symptoms, PEFR, nocturnal awakenings due to asthma, and “as-needed” ß-agonist requirements. In adult patients with asthma with documented aspirin sensitivity, nearly all of whom were receiving concomitant inhaled and/or oral corticosteroids, a 4-week, randomized, parallel-group trial (n=80) demonstrated that montelukast sodium, compared with placebo, resulted in significant improvement in parameters of asthma control. The magnitude of effect of montelukast sodium in aspirin-sensitive patients was similar to the effect observed in the general population of asthma patients studied. The effect of montelukast sodium on the bronchoconstrictor response to aspirin or other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in aspirin-sensitive asthmatic patients has not been evaluated [see ]. Exercise-Induced Bronchoconstriction(Adults and Adolescents 15 years of age and older) The efficacy of montelukast sodium, 10 mg, when given as a single dose 2 hours before exercise for the prevention of EIB was investigated in three (U.S. and Multinational), randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover studies that included a total of 160 adult and adolescent patients 15 years of age and older with EIB. Exercise challenge testing was conducted at 2 hours, 8.5 or 12 hours, and 24 hours following administration of a single dose of study drug (montelukast 10 mg or placebo). The primary endpoint was the mean maximum percent fall in FEV following the 2 hours post-dose exercise challenge in all three studies (Study A, Study B, and Study C). In Study A, a single dose of montelukast sodium 10 mg demonstrated a statistically significant protective benefit against EIB when taken 2 hours prior to exercise. Some patients were protected from EIB at 8.5 and 24 hours after administration; however, some patients were not. The results for the mean maximum percent fall at each timepoint in Study A are shown in TABLE 3 and are representative of the results from the other two studies. Table 3: Mean Maximum Percent Fall in FEV Following Exercise Challenge in Study A (N=47) ANOVA Model *Least squares-mean The efficacy of montelukast for prevention of EIB in patients below 6 years of age has not been established.Daily administration of montelukast for the chronic treatment of asthma has not been established to prevent acute episodes of EIB.In a 12-week, randomized, double-blind, parallel group study of 110 adult and adolescent asthmatics 15 years of age and older, with a mean baseline FEV percent of predicted of 83% and with documented exercise-induced exacerbation of asthma, treatment with montelukast sodium, 10 mg, once daily in the evening, resulted in a statistically significant reduction in mean maximal percent fall in FEV and mean time to recovery to within 5% of the pre-exercise FEV. Exercise challenge was conducted at the end of the dosing interval (i.e., 20 to 24 hours after the preceding dose). This effect was maintained throughout the 12-week treatment period indicating that tolerance did not occur. Montelukast sodium did not, however, prevent clinically significant deterioration in maximal percent fall in FEV after exercise (i.e., ≥ 20% decrease from pre-exercise baseline) in 52% of patients studied. In a separate crossover study in adults, a similar effect was observed after two once-daily 10-mg doses of montelukast sodium. The efficacy of montelukast sodium tablets for the treatment of seasonal allergic rhinitis was investigated in 5 similarly designed, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo- and active-controlled (loratadine) trials conducted in North America. The 5 trials enrolled a total of 5029 patients, of whom 1799 were treated with montelukast sodium tablets. Patients were 15 to 82 years of age with a history of seasonal allergic rhinitis, a positive skin test to at least one relevant seasonal allergen, and active symptoms of seasonal allergic rhinitis at study entry. The period of randomized treatment was 2 weeks in 4 trials and 4 weeks in one trial. The primary outcome variable was mean change from baseline in daytime nasal symptoms score (the average of individual scores of nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, nasal itching, sneezing) as assessed by patients on a 0-3 categorical scale. Four of the five trials showed a significant reduction in daytime nasal symptoms scores with montelukast sodium 10-mg tablets compared with placebo. The results of one trial are shown below. The median age in this trial was 35.0 years (range 15 to 81); 65.4% were females and 34.6% were males. The ethnic/racial distribution in this study was 83.1% Caucasian, 6.4% other origins, 5.8% Black, and 4.8% Hispanic. The mean changes from baseline in daytime nasal symptoms score in the treatment groups that received montelukast tablets, loratadine, and placebo are shown in TABLE 5. The remaining three trials that demonstrated efficacy showed similar results. Table 5: Effects of Montelukast on Daytime Nasal Symptoms Score* in a Placebo- and Active-controlled Trial in Patients with Seasonal Allergic Rhinitis (ANCOVA Model) * Average of individual scores of nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, nasal itching, sneezing as assessed by patients on a 0-3 categorical scale. † Statistically different from placebo (p≤0.001). ‡ The study was not designed for statistical comparison between montelukast sodium and the active control (loratadine). The efficacy of montelukast sodium tablets for the treatment of perennial allergic rhinitis was investigated in 2 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies conducted in North America and Europe. The two studies enrolled a total of 3357 patients, of whom 1632 received montelukast sodium 10-mg tablets. Patients 15 to 82 years of age with perennial allergic rhinitis as confirmed by history and a positive skin test to at least one relevant perennial allergen (dust mites, animal dander, and/or mold spores), who had active symptoms at the time of study entry, were enrolled. In the study in which efficacy was demonstrated, the median age was 35 years (range 15 to 81); 64.1% were females and 35.9% were males. The ethnic/racial distribution in this study was 83.2% Caucasian, 8.1% Black, 5.4% Hispanic, 2.3% Asian, and 1.0% other origins. Montelukast sodium 10-mg tablets once daily was shown to significantly reduce symptoms of perennial allergic rhinitis over a 6-week treatment period (TABLE 6); in this study the primary outcome variable was mean change from baseline in daytime nasal symptoms score (the average of individual scores of nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, and sneezing). Table 6: Effects of Montelukast sodium on Daytime Nasal Symptoms Score* in a Placebo-controlled Trial in Patients with Perennial Allergic Rhinitis (ANCOVA Model) * Average of individual scores of nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, sneezing as assessed by patients on a 0-3 categorical scale. †Statistically different from placebo (p ≤ 0.001). The other 6-week study evaluated montelukast 10 mg (n=626), placebo (n=609), and an active-control (cetirizine 10 mg; n=120). The primary analysis compared the mean change from baseline in daytime nasal symptoms score for montelukast vs. placebo over the first 4 weeks of treatment; the study was not designed for statistical comparison between montelukast sodium and the active-control. The primary outcome variable included nasal itching in addition to nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, and sneezing. The estimated difference between montelukast sodium and placebo was -0.04 with a 95% CI of (-0.09, 0.01). The estimated difference between the active-control and placebo was -0.10 with a 95% CI of (-0.19, -0.01).

Montelukast sodium tablet is indicated for the prophylaxis and chronic treatment of asthma in adults and pediatric patients 15 years of age and older. Montelukast sodium tablet is indicated for prevention of exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (EIB) in patients 15 years of age and older. Montelukast sodium tablet is indicated for the relief of symptoms of seasonal allergic rhinitis in patients 15 years of age and older and perennial allergic rhinitis in patients 15 years of age and older. Montelukast sodium tablets should be taken once daily in the evening. The following doses are recommended: For adults and adolescents 15 years of age and older: one 10-mg tablet. Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients less than 12 months of age with asthma have not been established. There have been no clinical trials in patients with asthma to evaluate the relative efficacy of morning versus evening dosing. The pharmacokinetics of montelukast are similar whether dosed in the morning or evening. Efficacy has been demonstrated for asthma when montelukast was administered in the evening without regard to time of food ingestion. 2.2 Exercise-Induced Bronchoconstriction (EIB) in Patients 15 Years of Age and Older For prevention of EIB, a single 10 mg dose of montelukast should be taken at least 2 hours before exercise. An additional dose of montelukast should not be taken within 24 hours of a previous dose. Patients already taking montelukast sodium tablets daily for another indication (including chronic asthma) should not take an additional dose to prevent EIB. All patients should have available for rescue a short-acting β-agonist. Safety and efficacy in patients younger than 15 years of age have not been established. Daily administration of montelukast sodium tablets for the chronic treatment of asthma has not been established to prevent acute episodes of EIB. For allergic rhinitis, montelukast sodium tablets should be taken once daily. Efficacy was demonstrated for seasonal allergic rhinitis when montelukast was administered in the morning or the evening without regard to time of food ingestion. The time of administration may be individualized to suit patient needs. The following doses for the treatment of symptoms of seasonal allergic rhinitis are recommended: For adults and adolescents 15 years of age and older: one 10-mg tablet. Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients younger than 2 years of age with seasonal allergic rhinitis have not been established. The following doses for the treatment of symptoms of perennial allergic rhinitis are recommended: For adults and adolescents 15 years of age and older: one 10-mg tablet. Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients younger than 6 months of age with perennial allergic rhinitis have not been established. Patients with both asthma and allergic rhinitis should take only one montelukast sodium tablet dose daily in the evening. Montelukast sodium tablets, USP 10 mg are beige coloured, rounded square, biconvex, film coated tablet debossed “M10” on one side and plain on the other side. Hypersensitivity to any component of this product. Montelukast sodium is not indicated for use in the reversal of bronchospasm in acute asthma attacks, including status asthmaticus. Patients should be advised to have appropriate rescue medication available. Therapy with montelukast sodium can be continued during acute exacerbations of asthma. Patients who have exacerbations of asthma after exercise should have available for rescue a short-acting inhaled β-agonist. While the dose of inhaled corticosteroid may be reduced gradually under medical supervision, montelukast sodium should not be abruptly substituted for inhaled or oral corticosteroids. Patients with known aspirin sensitivity should continue avoidance of aspirin or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents while taking montelukast sodium. Although montelukast sodium is effective in improving airway function in asthmatics with documented aspirin sensitivity, it has not been shown to truncate bronchoconstrictor response to aspirin and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in aspirin-sensitive asthmatic patients [see ] . Neuropsychiatric events have been reported in adult, adolescent, and pediatric patients taking montelukast sodium. Post-marketing reports with montelukast sodium use include, but are not limited to, agitation, aggressive behavior or hostility, anxiousness, depression, disorientation, disturbance in attention, dream abnormalities, dysphemia (stuttering), hallucinations, insomnia, irritability, memory impairment, obsessive-compulsive symptoms, restlessness, somnambulism, suicidal thinking and behavior (including suicide), tic, and tremor. The clinical details of some post-marketing reports involving montelukast sodium appear consistent with a drug-induced effect. Patients and prescribers should be alert for neuropsychiatric events. Patients should be instructed to notify their prescriber if these changes occur. Prescribers should carefully evaluate the risks and benefits of continuing treatment with montelukast sodium if such events occur . Patients and prescribers should be alert for neuropsychiatric events. Patients should be instructed to notify their prescriber if these changes occur. Prescribers should carefully evaluate the risks and benefits of continuing treatment with montelukast sodium if such events occur [see ] . Patients with asthma on therapy with montelukast sodium may present with systemic eosinophilia, sometimes presenting with clinical features of vasculitis consistent with Churg-Strauss syndrome, a condition which is often treated with systemic corticosteroid therapy. These events have been sometimes associated with the reduction of oral corticosteroid therapy. Physicians should be alert to eosinophilia, vasculitic rash, worsening pulmonary symptoms, cardiac complications, and/or neuropathy presenting in their patients. A causal association between montelukast sodium and these underlying conditions has not been established [see ]. Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. In the following description of clinical trials experience, adverse reactions are listed regardless of causality assessment. The most common adverse reactions (incidence ≥5% and greater than placebo; listed in descending order of frequency) in controlled clinical trials were: upper respiratory infection, fever, headache, pharyngitis, cough, abdominal pain, diarrhea, otitis media, influenza, rhinorrhea, sinusitis, otitis. Adults and Adolescents 15 Years of Age and Older with Asthma Montelukast sodium has been evaluated for safety in approximately 2950 adult and adolescent patients 15 years of age and older in clinical trials. In placebo-controlled clinical trials, the following adverse experiences reported with montelukast sodium occurred in greater than or equal to 1% of patients and at an incidence greater than that in patients treated with placebo: Table 1: Adverse Experiences Occurring in ≥1% of Patients with an Incidence Greater than that in Patients Treated with Placebo Montelukast 10 mg/day (%) (n=1955) Placebo (%) (n=1180) Number of patients tested (montelukast sodium and placebo, respectively): ALT and AST, 1935, 1170; pyuria, 1924, 1159.     Pain, abdominal     Asthenia/fatigue     Fever     Trauma 2.9 1.8 1.5 1.0 2.5 1.2 0.9 0.8     Dyspepsia     Pain, dental     Gastroenteritis, infectious 2.1 1.7 1.5 1.1 1.0 0.5     Headache     Dizziness 18.4 1.9 18.1 1.4     Influenza     Cough     Congestion, nasal 4.2 2.7 1.6 3.9 2.4 1.3     Rash 1.6 1.2     ALT increased     AST increased     Pyuria 2.1 1.6 1.0 2.0 1.2 0.9 The frequency of less common adverse events was comparable between montelukast sodium and placebo. The safety profile of montelukast sodium, when administered as a single dose for prevention of EIB in adult and adolescent patients 15 years of age and older, was consistent with the safety profile previously described for montelukast sodium. Cumulatively, 569 patients were treated with montelukast sodium for at least 6 months, 480 for one year, and 49 for two years in clinical trials. With prolonged treatment, the adverse experience profile did not significantly change. Adults and Adolescents 15 Years of Age and Older with Seasonal Allergic Rhinitis Montelukast sodium has been evaluated for safety in 2199 adult and adolescent patients 15 years of age and older in clinical trials. Montelukast sodium administered once daily in the morning or in the evening had a safety profile similar to that of placebo. In placebo-controlled clinical trials, the following event was reported with montelukast sodium with a frequency ≥1% and at an incidence greater than placebo: upper respiratory infection, 1.9% of patients receiving montelukast sodium vs. 1.5% of patients receiving placebo. In a 4-week, placebo-controlled clinical study, the safety profile was consistent with that observed in 2-week studies. The incidence of somnolence was similar to that of placebo in all studies. Adults and Adolescents 15 Years of Age and Older with Perennial Allergic Rhinitis Montelukast sodium has been evaluated for safety in 3357 adult and adolescent patients 15 years of age and older with perennial allergic rhinitis of whom 1632 received montelukast sodium in two, 6-week, clinical studies. Montelukast sodium administered once daily had a safety profile consistent with that observed in patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis and similar to that of placebo. In these two studies, the following events were reported with montelukast sodium with a frequency ≥1% and at an incidence greater than placebo: sinusitis, upper respiratory infection, sinus headache, cough, epistaxis, and increased ALT. The incidence of somnolence was similar to that of placebo. The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of montelukast sodium. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Blood and lymphatic system disorders: increased bleeding tendency, thrombocytopenia. Immune system disorders: hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis, hepatic eosinophilic infiltration. Psychiatric disorders: including, but not limited to, agitation, aggressive behavior or hostility, anxiousness, depression, disorientation, disturbance in attention, dream abnormalities, dysphemia (stuttering), hallucinations, insomnia, irritability, memory impairment, obsessive-compulsive symptoms, restlessness, somnambulism, suicidal thinking and behavior (including suicide), tic, and tremor [see ] . Nervous system disorders: drowsiness, paraesthesia/hypoesthesia, seizures. Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders: epistaxis, pulmonary eosinophilia. Gastrointestinal disorders: diarrhea, dyspepsia, nausea, pancreatitis, vomiting. Hepatobiliary disorders: Cases of cholestatic hepatitis, hepatocellular liver-injury, and mixed-pattern liver injury have been reported in patients treated with montelukast sodium. Most of these occurred in combination with other confounding factors, such as use of other medications, or when montelukast sodium was administered to patients who had underlying potential for liver disease such as alcohol use or other forms of hepatitis. Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: angioedema, bruising, erythema multiforme, erythema nodosum, pruritus, Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis, urticaria. Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders: arthralgia, myalgia including muscle cramps. Renal and urinary disorders: enuresis in children. General disorders and administration site conditions: edema. Patients with asthma on therapy with montelukast sodium may present with systemic eosinophilia, sometimes presenting with clinical features of vasculitis consistent with Churg-Strauss syndrome, a condition which is often treated with systemic corticosteroid therapy. These events have been sometimes associated with the reduction of oral corticosteroid therapy. Physicians should be alert to eosinophilia, vasculitic rash, worsening pulmonary symptoms, cardiac complications, and/or neuropathy presenting in their patients [see ] . No dose adjustment is needed when montelukast sodium is co-administered with theophylline, prednisone, prednisolone, oral contraceptives, terfenadine, digoxin, warfarin, gemfibrozil, itraconazole, thyroid hormones, sedative hypnotics, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents, benzodiazepines, decongestants, and Cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme inducers [see ] . Available data from published prospective and retrospective cohort studies over decades with montelukast use in pregnant women have not established a drug-associated risk of major birth defects . In animal reproduction studies, no adverse developmental effects were observed with oral administration of montelukast to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis at doses approximately 100 and 110 times, respectively, the maximum recommended human daily oral dose (MRHDOD) based on AUCs . The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Disease-associated maternal and/or embryo/fetal risk Poorly or moderately controlled asthma in pregnancy increases the maternal risk of perinatal adverse outcomes such as preeclampsia and infant prematurity, low birth weight, and small for gestational age. Published data from prospective and retrospective cohort studies have not identified an association with montelukast sodium use during pregnancy and major birth defects. Available studies have methodologic limitations, including small sample size, in some cases retrospective data collection, and inconsistent comparator groups. In embryo-fetal development studies, montelukast administered to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis (gestation days 6 to 17 in rats and 6 to 18 in rabbits) did not cause any adverse developmental effects at maternal oral doses up to 400 and 300 mg/kg/day in rats and rabbits, respectively (approximately 100 and 110 times the AUC in humans at the MRHDOD, respectively). A published clinical lactation study reports the presence of montelukast in human milk. Data available on the effects of the drug on infants, either directly [see ] or through breast milk, do not suggest a significant risk of adverse events from exposure to montelukast sodium. The effects of the drug on milk production are unknown. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother’s clinical need for montelukast sodium and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from montelukast sodium or from the underlying maternal condition. The safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of 12 months with asthma and 6 months with perennial allergic rhinitis have not been established. The safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of 6 years with exercise-induced bronchoconstriction have not been established. Of the total number of subjects in clinical studies of montelukast, 3.5% were 65 years of age and over, and 0.4% were 75 years of age and over. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out. The pharmacokinetic profile and the oral bioavailability of a single 10-mg oral dose of montelukast are similar in elderly and younger adults. The plasma half-life of montelukast is slightly longer in the elderly. No dosage adjustment in the elderly is required. No dosage adjustment is required in patients with mild-to-moderate hepatic insufficiency [see ] . No dosage adjustment is recommended in patients with renal insufficiency [see ]. No specific information is available on the treatment of overdosage with montelukast sodium. In chronic asthma studies, montelukast has been administered at doses up to 200 mg/day to adult patients for 22 weeks and, in short-term studies, up to 900 mg/day to patients for approximately a week without clinically important adverse experiences. In the event of overdose, it is reasonable to employ the usual supportive measures; e.g., remove unabsorbed material from the gastrointestinal tract, employ clinical monitoring, and institute supportive therapy, if required. There have been reports of acute overdosage in post-marketing experience and clinical studies with montelukast sodium. These include reports in adults and children with a dose as high as 1000 mg. The clinical and laboratory findings observed were consistent with the safety profile in adults and pediatric patients. There were no adverse experiences in the majority of overdosage reports. The most frequently occurring adverse experiences were consistent with the safety profile of montelukast sodium and included abdominal pain, somnolence, thirst, headache, vomiting and psychomotor hyperactivity. It is not known whether montelukast is removed by peritoneal dialysis or hemodialysis. Montelukast sodium, the active ingredient in montelukast sodium tablets, is a selective and orally active leukotriene receptor antagonist that inhibits the cysteinyl leukotriene CysLT receptor. Montelukast sodium is described chemically as [ -( )]-1-[[[1-[3-[2-(7-chloro-2-quinolinyl)ethenyl]phenyl]-3-[2-(1-hydroxy-1-methylethyl)phenyl]propyl]thio]methyl]cyclopropaneacetic acid, monosodium salt. The empirical formula is C H ClNNaO S, and its molecular weight is 608.18. The structural formula is: Montelukast sodium is a hygroscopic, optically active, white to off-white powder. Montelukast sodium is freely soluble in ethanol, methanol, and water and practically insoluble in acetonitrile. Each 10-mg film-coated montelukast sodium tablet, USP contains 10.4 mg montelukast sodium, USP, which is equivalent to 10 mg of montelukast, and the following inactive ingredients: microcelac 100, croscarmellose sodium, low substituted hydroxypropyl cellulose, and magnesium stearate. The film coating consists of hypromellose, hydroxypropyl cellulose, titanium dioxide, polyethylene glycol 6000, iron oxide red and iron oxide yellow. The cysteinyl leukotrienes (LTC , LTD , LTE ) are products of arachidonic acid metabolism and are released from various cells, including mast cells and eosinophils. These eicosanoids bind to cysteinyl leukotriene (CysLT) receptors. The CysLT type-1 (CysLT ) receptor is found in the human airway (including airway smooth muscle cells and airway macrophages) and on other pro-inflammatory cells (including eosinophils and certain myeloid stem cells). CysLTs have been correlated with the pathophysiology of asthma and allergic rhinitis. In asthma, leukotriene-mediated effects include airway edema, smooth muscle contraction, and altered cellular activity associated with the inflammatory process. In allergic rhinitis, CysLTs are released from the nasal mucosa after allergen exposure during both early- and late-phase reactions and are associated with symptoms of allergic rhinitis. Montelukast is an orally active compound that binds with high affinity and selectivity to the CysLT receptor (in preference to other pharmacologically important airway receptors, such as the prostanoid, cholinergic, or β-adrenergic receptor). Montelukast inhibits physiologic actions of LTD at the CysLT receptor without any agonist activity. Montelukast causes inhibition of airway cysteinyl leukotriene receptors as demonstrated by the ability to inhibit bronchoconstriction due to inhaled LTD in asthmatics. Doses as low as 5 mg cause substantial blockage of LTD -induced bronchoconstriction. In a placebo-controlled, crossover study (n=12), montelukast sodium inhibited early- and late-phase bronchoconstriction due to antigen challenge by 75% and 57%, respectively. The effect of montelukast sodium on eosinophils in the peripheral blood was examined in clinical trials. In patients with asthma aged 2 years and older who received montelukast sodium, a decrease in mean peripheral blood eosinophil counts ranging from 9% to 15% was noted, compared with placebo, over the double-blind treatment periods. In patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis aged 15 years and older who received montelukast sodium, a mean increase of 0.2% in peripheral blood eosinophil counts was noted, compared with a mean increase of 12.5% in placebo-treated patients, over the double-blind treatment periods; this reflects a mean difference of 12.3% in favor of montelukast sodium. The relationship between these observations and the clinical benefits of montelukast noted in the clinical trials is not known [see ]. Montelukast is rapidly absorbed following oral administration. After administration of the 10-mg film-coated tablet to fasted adults, the mean peak montelukast plasma concentration (C ) is achieved in 3 to 4 hours (T ). The mean oral bioavailability is 64%. The oral bioavailability and C are not influenced by a standard meal in the morning. The safety and efficacy of montelukast sodium in patients with asthma were demonstrated in clinical trials in which the 10-mg film-coated tablet and 5-mg chewable tablet formulations were administered in the evening without regard to the time of food ingestion. The safety of montelukast sodium in patients with asthma was also demonstrated in clinical trials in which the 4 mg chewable tablet and 4 mg oral granule formulations were administered in the evening without regard to the time of food ingestion. The safety and efficacy of montelukast sodium in patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis were demonstrated in clinical trials in which the 10-mg film-coated tablet was administered in the morning or evening without regard to the time of food ingestion. The comparative pharmacokinetics of montelukast when administered as two 5 mg chewable tablets versus one 10 mg film-coated tablet have not been evaluated. Montelukast is more than 99% bound to plasma proteins. The steady state volume of distribution of montelukast averages 8 to 11 liters. Studies in rats with radiolabeled montelukast indicate minimal distribution across the blood-brain barrier. In addition, concentrations of radiolabeled material at 24 hours postdose were minimal in all other tissues. Montelukast is extensively metabolized. In studies with therapeutic doses, plasma concentrations of metabolites of montelukast are undetectable at steady state in adults and pediatric patients. studies using human liver microsomes indicate that CYP3A4, 2C8 and 2C9 are involved in the metabolism of montelukast. At clinically relevant concentrations, 2C8 appears to play a major role in the metabolism of montelukast. The plasma clearance of montelukast averages 45 mL/min in healthy adults. Following an oral dose of radiolabeled montelukast, 86% of the radioactivity was recovered in 5-day fecal collections and <0.2% was recovered in urine. Coupled with estimates of montelukast oral bioavailability, this indicates that montelukast and its metabolites are excreted almost exclusively via the bile. In several studies, the mean plasma half-life of montelukast ranged from 2.7 to 5.5 hours in healthy young adults. The pharmacokinetics of montelukast are nearly linear for oral doses up to 50 mg. During once-daily dosing with 10-mg montelukast, there is little accumulation of the parent drug in plasma (14%). Patients with mild-to-moderate hepatic insufficiency and clinical evidence of cirrhosis had evidence of decreased metabolism of montelukast resulting in 41% (90% CI=7%, 85%) higher mean montelukast AUC following a single 10-mg dose. The elimination of montelukast was slightly prolonged compared with that in healthy subjects (mean half-life, 7.4 hours). No dosage adjustment is required in patients with mild-to-moderate hepatic insufficiency. The pharmacokinetics of montelukast sodium in patients with more severe hepatic impairment or with hepatitis have not been evaluated. Since montelukast and its metabolites are not excreted in the urine, the pharmacokinetics of montelukast were not evaluated in patients with renal insufficiency. No dosage adjustment is recommended in these patients. The pharmacokinetics of montelukast are similar in males and females. Pharmacokinetic differences due to race have not been studied. Pharmacokinetic studies evaluated the systemic exposure of the 4-mg oral granule formulation in pediatric patients 6 to 23 months of age, the 4 mg chewable tablets in pediatric patients 2 to 5 years of age, the 5 mg chewable tablets in pediatric patients 6 to 14 years of age, and the 10-mg film-coated tablets in young adults and adolescents ≥15 years of age. The plasma concentration profile of montelukast following administration of the 10-mg film-coated tablet is similar in adolescents ≥15 years of age and young adults. The 10-mg film-coated tablet is recommended for use in patients ≥15 years of age. Montelukast sodium has been administered with other therapies routinely used in the prophylaxis and chronic treatment of asthma with no apparent increase in adverse reactions. In drug-interaction studies, the recommended clinical dose of montelukast did not have clinically important effects on the pharmacokinetics of the following drugs: theophylline, prednisone, and prednisolone. Montelukast at a dose of 10 mg once daily dosed to pharmacokinetic steady state, did not cause clinically significant changes in the kinetics of a single intravenous dose of theophylline [predominantly a cytochrome P450 (CYP) 1A2 substrate]. Montelukast at doses of ≥100 mg daily dosed to pharmacokinetic steady state, did not cause any clinically significant change in plasma profiles of prednisone or prednisolone following administration of either oral prednisone or intravenous prednisolone. Oral Contraceptives, Terfenadine, Digoxin, and Warfarin: In drug interaction studies, the recommended clinical dose of montelukast did not have clinically important effects on the pharmacokinetics of the following drugs: oral contraceptives (norethindrone 1 mg/ethinyl estradiol 35 mcg), terfenadine, digoxin, and warfarin. Montelukast at doses of ≥100 mg daily dosed to pharmacokinetic steady state did not significantly alter the plasma concentrations of either component of an oral contraceptive containing norethindrone 1 mg/ethinyl estradiol 35 mcg. Montelukast at a dose of 10 mg once daily dosed to pharmacokinetic steady state did not change the plasma concentration profile of terfenadine (a substrate of CYP3A4) or fexofenadine, the carboxylated metabolite, and did not prolong the QTc interval following co-administration with terfenadine 60 mg twice daily; did not change the pharmacokinetic profile or urinary excretion of immunoreactive digoxin; did not change the pharmacokinetic profile of warfarin (primarily a substrate of CYP2C9, 3A4 and 1A2) or influence the effect of a single 30-mg oral dose of warfarin on prothrombin time or the International Normalized Ratio (INR). Thyroid Hormones, Sedative Hypnotics, Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Benzodiazepines, and Decongestants: Although additional specific interaction studies were not performed, montelukast was used concomitantly with a wide range of commonly prescribed drugs in clinical studies without evidence of clinical adverse interactions. These medications included thyroid hormones, sedative hypnotics, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents, benzodiazepines, and decongestants. Phenobarbital, which induces hepatic metabolism, decreased the area under the plasma concentration curve (AUC) of montelukast approximately 40% following a single 10-mg dose of montelukast. No dosage adjustment for montelukast sodium is recommended. It is reasonable to employ appropriate clinical monitoring when potent CYP enzyme inducers, such as phenobarbital or rifampin, are co-administered with montelukast sodium. Effect of Montelukast on Cytochrome P450 (CYP) Enzymes: Montelukast is a potent inhibitor of CYP2C8 However, data from a clinical drug-drug interaction study involving montelukast and rosiglitazone (a probe substrate representative of drugs primarily metabolized by CYP2C8) in 12 healthy individuals demonstrated that the pharmacokinetics of rosiglitazone are not altered when the drugs are coadministered, indicating that montelukast does not inhibit CYP2C8 Therefore, montelukast is not anticipated to alter the metabolism of drugs metabolized by this enzyme (e.g., paclitaxel, rosiglitazone, and repaglinide). Based on further results in human liver microsomes, therapeutic plasma concentrations of montelukast do not inhibit CYP 3A4, 2C9, 1A2, 2A6, 2C19, or 2D6. studies have shown that montelukast is a substrate of CYP 2C8, 2C9, and 3A4. Co-administration of montelukast with itraconazole, a strong CYP 3A4 inhibitor, resulted in no significant increase in the systemic exposure of montelukast. Data from a clinical drug-drug interaction study involving montelukast and gemfibrozil (an inhibitor of both CYP 2C8, and 2C9) demonstrated that gemfibrozil, at a therapeutic dose, increased the systemic exposure of montelukast by 4.4-fold. Co-administration of itraconazole, gemfibrozil, and montelukast did not further increase the systemic exposure of montelukast. Based on available clinical experience, no dosage adjustment of montelukast is required upon co-administration with gemfibrozil [see . 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility No evidence of tumorigenicity was seen in carcinogenicity studies of either 2 years in Sprague-Dawley rats or 92 weeks in mice at oral gavage doses up to 200 mg/kg/day or 100 mg/kg/day, respectively. The estimated exposure in rats was approximately 120 and 75 times the AUC for adults and children, respectively, at the maximum recommended daily oral dose. The estimated exposure in mice was approximately 45 and 25 times the AUC for adults and children, respectively, at the maximum recommended daily oral dose. Montelukast demonstrated no evidence of mutagenic or clastogenic activity in the following assays: the microbial mutagenesis assay, the V-79 mammalian cell mutagenesis assay, the alkaline elution assay in rat hepatocytes, the chromosomal aberration assay in Chinese hamster ovary cells, and in the mouse bone marrow chromosomal aberration assay. In fertility studies in female rats, montelukast produced reductions in fertility and fecundity indices at an oral dose of 200 mg/kg (estimated exposure was approximately 70 times the AUC for adults at the maximum recommended daily oral dose). No effects on female fertility or fecundity were observed at an oral dose of 100 mg/kg (estimated exposure was approximately 20 times the AUC for adults at the maximum recommended daily oral dose). Montelukast had no effects on fertility in male rats at oral doses up to 800 mg/kg (estimated exposure was approximately 160 times the AUC for adults at the maximum recommended daily oral dose). Adults and Adolescents 15 Years of Age and Older with Asthma Clinical trials in adults and adolescents 15 years of age and older demonstrated there is no additional clinical benefit to montelukast doses above 10 mg once daily. The efficacy of montelukast sodium for the chronic treatment of asthma in adults and adolescents 15 years of age and older was demonstrated in two (U.S. and Multinational) similarly designed, randomized, 12-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials in 1576 patients (795 treated with montelukast sodium, 530 treated with placebo, and 251 treated with active control). The median age was 33 years (range 15 to 85); 56.8% were females and 43.2% were males. The ethnic/racial distribution in these studies was 71.6% Caucasian, 17.7% Hispanic, 7.2% other origins and 3.5% Black. Patients had mild or moderate asthma and were non-smokers who required approximately 5 puffs of inhaled β-agonist per day on an “as-needed” basis. The patients had a mean baseline percent of predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV ) of 66% (approximate range, 40 to 90%). The co-primary endpoints in these trials were FEV and daytime asthma symptoms. In both studies after 12 weeks, a random subset of patients receiving montelukast sodium was switched to placebo for an additional 3 weeks of double-blind treatment to evaluate for possible rebound effects. The results of the U.S. trial on the primary endpoint, morning FEV , expressed as mean percent change from baseline averaged over the 12-week treatment period, are shown in FIGURE 1. Compared with placebo, treatment with one montelukast sodium 10-mg tablet daily in the evening resulted in a statistically significant increase in FEV percent change from baseline (13.0%-change in the group treated with montelukast sodium vs. 4.2%-change in the placebo group, p<0.001); the change from baseline in FEV for montelukast sodium was 0.32 liters compared with 0.10 liters for placebo, corresponding to a between-group difference of 0.22 liters (p<0.001, 95% CI 0.17 liters, 0.27 liters). The results of the Multinational trial on FEV were similar. The effect of montelukast sodium on other primary and secondary endpoints, represented by the Multinational study is shown in TABLE 2. Results on these endpoints were similar in the US study. Table 2: Effect of montelukast sodium on Primary and Secondary Endpoints in a Multinational Placebo-controlled Trial (ANOVA Model) -0.49 -1.65 25.03 20.13 -2.03 Both studies evaluated the effect of montelukast sodium on secondary outcomes, including asthma attack (utilization of health-care resources such as an unscheduled visit to a doctor's office, emergency room, or hospital; or treatment with oral, intravenous, or intramuscular corticosteroid), and use of oral corticosteroids for asthma rescue. In the Multinational study, significantly fewer patients (15.6% of patients) on montelukast sodium experienced asthma attacks compared with patients on placebo (27.3%, p < 0.001). In the US study, 7.8% of patients on montelukast sodium and 10.3% of patients on placebo experienced asthma attacks, but the difference between the two treatment groups was not significant (p = 0.334). In the Multinational study, significantly fewer patients (14.8% of patients) on montelukast sodium were prescribed oral corticosteroids for asthma rescue compared with patients on placebo (25.7%, p < 0.001). In the US study, 6.9% of patients on montelukast sodium and 9.9% of patients on placebo were prescribed oral corticosteroids for asthma rescue, but the difference between the two treatment groups was not significant (p = 0.196). In each placebo-controlled trial in adults, the treatment effect of montelukast sodium measured by daily diary card parameters, including symptom scores, “as-needed” β-agonist use, and PEFR measurements, was achieved after the first dose and was maintained throughout the dosing interval (24 hours). No significant change in treatment effect was observed during continuous once-daily evening administration in non-placebo-controlled extension trials for up to one year. Withdrawal of montelukast sodium in asthmatic patients after 12 weeks of continuous use did not cause rebound worsening of asthma. Effects in Patients on Concomitant Inhaled Corticosteroids Separate trials in adults evaluated the ability of montelukast sodium to add to the clinical effect of inhaled corticosteroids and to allow inhaled corticosteroid tapering when used concomitantly. One randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trial (n=226) enrolled adults with stable asthma with a mean FEV of approximately 84% of predicted who were previously maintained on various inhaled corticosteroids (delivered by metered-dose aerosol or dry powder inhalers). The median age was 41.5 years (range 16 to 70); 52.2% were females and 47.8% were males. The ethnic/racial distribution in this study was 92.0% Caucasian, 3.5% Black, 2.2% Hispanic, and 2.2% Asian. The types of inhaled corticosteroids and their mean baseline requirements included beclomethasone dipropionate (mean dose, 1203 mcg/day), triamcinolone acetonide (mean dose, 2004 mcg/day), flunisolide (mean dose, 1971 mcg/day), fluticasone propionate (mean dose, 1083 mcg/day), or budesonide (mean dose, 1192 mcg/day). Some of these inhaled corticosteroids were non-U.S.-approved formulations, and doses expressed may not be ex-actuator. The pre-study inhaled corticosteroid requirements were reduced by approximately 37% during a 5- to 7-week placebo run-in period designed to titrate patients toward their lowest effective inhaled corticosteroid dose. Treatment with montelukast sodium resulted in a further 47% reduction in mean inhaled corticosteroid dose compared with a mean reduction of 30% in the placebo group over the 12-week active treatment period (p≤0.05). It is not known whether the results of this study can be generalized to patients with asthma who require higher doses of inhaled corticosteroids or systemic corticosteroids. In another randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trial (n=642) in a similar population of adult patients previously maintained, but not adequately controlled, on inhaled corticosteroids (beclomethasone 336 mcg/day), the addition of montelukast sodium to beclomethasone resulted in statistically significant improvements in FEV compared with those patients who were continued on beclomethasone alone or those patients who were withdrawn from beclomethasone and treated with montelukast or placebo alone over the last 10 weeks of the 16-week, blinded treatment period. Patients who were randomized to treatment arms containing beclomethasone had statistically significantly better asthma control than those patients randomized to montelukast sodium alone or placebo alone as indicated by FEV , daytime asthma symptoms, PEFR, nocturnal awakenings due to asthma, and “as-needed” β-agonist requirements. In adult patients with asthma with documented aspirin sensitivity, nearly all of whom were receiving concomitant inhaled and/or oral corticosteroids, a 4-week, randomized, parallel-group trial (n=80) demonstrated that montelukast sodium, compared with placebo, resulted in significant improvement in parameters of asthma control. The magnitude of effect of montelukast sodium in aspirin-sensitive patients was similar to the effect observed in the general population of asthma patients studied. The effect of montelukast sodium on the bronchoconstrictor response to aspirin or other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in aspirin-sensitive asthmatic patients has not been evaluated [see ] . Exercise-Induced Bronchoconstriction (Adults and Adolescents 15 years of age and older) The efficacy of montelukast 10 mg, when given as a single dose 2 hours before exercise for the prevention of EIB was investigated in three (U.S. and Multinational), randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover studies that included a total of 160 adult and adolescent patients 15 years of age and older with EIB. Exercise challenge testing was conducted at 2 hours, 8.5 or 12 hours, and 24 hours following administration of a single dose of study drug (montelukast 10 mg or placebo). The primary endpoint was the mean maximum percent fall in FEV following the 2 hours post-dose exercise challenge in all three studies (Study A, Study B, and Study C). In Study A, a single dose of montelukast sodium 10 mg demonstrated a statistically significant protective benefit against EIB when taken 2 hours prior to exercise. Some patients were protected from EIB at 8.5 and 24 hours after administration; however, some patients were not. The results for the mean maximum percent fall at each timepoint in Study A are shown in TABLE 3 and are representative of the results from the other two studies. Table 3: Mean Maximum Percent Fall in FEV Following Exercise Challenge in Study A (N=47) ANOVA Model Time of exercise challenge following medication administrationMean Maximum percent fall in FEV Treatment difference % for Montelukast Sodium versus Placebo (95%CI) The efficacy of montelukast sodium for prevention of EIB in patients below 6 years of age has not been established. Daily administration of montelukast sodium for the chronic treatment of asthma has not been established to prevent acute episodes of EIB. In a 12-week, randomized, double-blind, parallel group study of 110 adult and adolescent asthmatics 15 years of age and older, with a mean baseline FEV percent of predicted of 83% and with documented exercise-induced exacerbation of asthma, treatment with montelukast sodium, 10 mg, once daily in the evening, resulted in a statistically significant reduction in mean maximal percent fall in FEV and mean time to recovery to within 5% of the pre-exercise FEV . Exercise challenge was conducted at the end of the dosing interval (i.e., 20 to 24 hours after the preceding dose). This effect was maintained throughout the 12-week treatment period indicating that tolerance did not occur. Montelukast sodium did not, however, prevent clinically significant deterioration in maximal percent fall in FEV after exercise (i.e., ≥20% decrease from pre-exercise baseline) in 52% of patients studied. In a separate crossover study in adults, a similar effect was observed after two once-daily 10-mg doses of montelukast sodium. In pediatric patients 6 to 14 years of age, using the 5 mg chewable tablet, a 2 day crossover study demonstrated effects similar to those observed in adults when exercise challenge was conducted at the end of the dosing interval (i.e., 20 to 24 hours after the preceding dose). The efficacy of montelukast sodium tablets for the treatment of seasonal allergic rhinitis was investigated in 5 similarly designed, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo- and active-controlled (loratadine) trials conducted in North America. The 5 trials enrolled a total of 5029 patients, of whom 1799 were treated with montelukast sodium tablets. Patients were 15 to 82 years of age with a history of seasonal allergic rhinitis, a positive skin test to at least one relevant seasonal allergen, and active symptoms of seasonal allergic rhinitis at study entry. The period of randomized treatment was 2 weeks in 4 trials and 4 weeks in one trial. The primary outcome variable was mean change from baseline in daytime nasal symptoms score (the average of individual scores of nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, nasal itching, sneezing) as assessed by patients on a 0-3 categorical scale. Four of the five trials showed a significant reduction in daytime nasal symptoms scores with montelukast sodium 10-mg tablets compared with placebo. The results of one trial are shown below. The median age in this trial was 35.0 years (range 15 to 81); 65.4% were females and 34.6% were males. The ethnic/racial distribution in this study was 83.1% Caucasian, 6.4% other origins, 5.8% Black, and 4.8% Hispanic. The mean changes from baseline in daytime nasal symptoms score in the treatment groups that received montelukast sodium tablets, loratadine, and placebo are shown in TABLE 4. The remaining three trials that demonstrated efficacy showed similar results. TABLE 4: Effects of Montelukast Sodium on Daytime Nasal Symptoms Score in a Placebo- and Active-controlled Trial in Patients with Seasonal Allergic Rhinitis (ANCOVA Model) Baseline Mean Score Difference Between Treatment and Placebo (95% CI) Least-Squares Mean Average of individual scores of nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, nasal itching, sneezing as assessed by patients on a 0 to 3 categorical scale. The study was not designed for statistical comparison between Montelukast Sodium and the active control (loratadine). -0.13 (-0.21, -0.06) Active Control (Loratadine 10 mg) (599) -0.24 (-0.31, -0.17) The efficacy of montelukast sodium tablets for the treatment of perennial allergic rhinitis was investigated in 2 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies conducted in North America and Europe. The two studies enrolled a total of 3357 patients, of whom 1632 received montelukast sodium 10-mg tablets. Patients 15 to 82 years of age with perennial allergic rhinitis as confirmed by history and a positive skin test to at least one relevant perennial allergen (dust mites, animal dander, and/or mold spores), who had active symptoms at the time of study entry, were enrolled. In the study in which efficacy was demonstrated, the median age was 35 years (range 15 to 81); 64.1% were females and 35.9% were males. The ethnic/racial distribution in this study was 83.2% Caucasian, 8.1% Black, 5.4% Hispanic, 2.3% Asian, and 1.0% other origins. Montelukast sodium 10-mg tablets once daily was shown to significantly reduce symptoms of perennial allergic rhinitis over a 6-week treatment period (TABLE 5); in this study the primary outcome variable was mean change from baseline in daytime nasal symptoms score (the average of individual scores of nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, and sneezing). Table 5: Effects of Montelukast Sodium on Daytime Nasal Symptoms Score in a Placebo-controlled Trial in Patients with Perennial Allergic Rhinitis (ANCOVA Model) Baseline Mean Score Difference Between Treatment and Placebo (95% CI) Least-Squares Mean Average of individual scores of nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, sneezing as assessed by patients on a 0-3 categorical scale. -0.08 (-0.12, -0.04) The other 6-week study evaluated montelukast 10 mg (n=626), placebo (n=609), and an active-control (cetirizine 10 mg; n=120). The primary analysis compared the mean change from baseline in daytime nasal symptoms score for montelukast sodium vs. placebo over the first 4 weeks of treatment; the study was not designed for statistical comparison between montelukast sodium and the active-control. The primary outcome variable included nasal itching in addition to nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, and sneezing. The estimated difference between montelukast sodium and placebo was -0.04 with a 95% CI of (-0.09, 0.01). The estimated difference between the active-control and placebo was -0.10 with a 95% CI of (-0.19, -0.01).

Patients who have exacerbations of asthma after exercise should be instructed to have available for rescue a short-acting inhaled β-agonist. Daily administration of montelukast sodium for the chronic treatment of asthma has not been established to prevent acute episodes of EIB. Patients should be advised that, while using montelukast sodium, medical attention should be sought if short-acting inhaled bronchodilators are needed more often than usual, or if more than the maximum number of inhalations of short-acting bronchodilator treatment prescribed for a 24-hour period are needed. Patients receiving montelukast sodium should be instructed not to decrease the dose or stop taking any other anti-asthma medications unless instructed by a physician. Patients should be instructed to notify their physician if neuropsychiatric events occur while using montelukast sodium. Patients with known aspirin sensitivity should be advised to continue avoidance of aspirin or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents while taking montelukast sodium.                                                                                                    Patient Information                                                                                               Montelukast Sodium Tablets                                                                                              (mon te loo′ kast soe′ dee um)   Read the Patient Information Leaflet that comes with montelukast sodium tablets before you start taking it and each time you get a refill.

What tablets are and what they are used for This medicine has been prescribed for you for the relief of moderate to severe pain over a period of 12 hours. It contains oxycodone which belongs to a class of medicines called opioids, which are ‘pain relievers’. This medicine has been prescribed for you and should not be given to anyone else. Opioids can cause addiction and you may get withdrawal symptoms if you stop taking it suddenly. Your prescriber should have explained how long you will be taking it for and when it is appropriate to stop, how to do this safely. 2. What you need to know before you take tablets are allergic (hypersensitive) to oxycodone, or any of the other ingredients of the tablets (listed in section 6); have breathing problems, such as severe obstructive lung disease, severe bronchial asthma or severe respiratory depression. Your doctor will have told you if you have any of these conditions. Symptoms may include breathlessness, coughing or breathing more slowly or weakly than expected; have a condition where the small bowel does not work properly (paralytic ileus), your stomach empties more slowly than it should (delayed gastric emptying) or you have severe pain in your abdomen; have a heart problem after long-term lung disease (cor pulmonale); have moderate to severe liver problems. If you have other long-term liver problems you should only take these tablets if recommended by your doctor; Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking these tablets if you: are or have ever been addicted to opioids, alcohol, prescription medicines or illegal drugs; have previously suffered from withdrawal symptoms such as agitation, anxiety, shaking or sweating, when you have stopped taking alcohol or drugs; feel you need to take more tablets to get the same level of pain relief, this may mean you are becoming tolerant to the effects of this medicine or are becoming addicted to it.

Re-evaluate the benefits and risks of restarting treatment with sodium if such events occur. Montelukast sodium is not indicated for use in the reversal of bronchospasm in acute asthma attacks, including status asthmaticus. Patients should be advised to have appropriate rescue medication available. Therapy with montelukast sodium can be continued during acute exacerbations of asthma. Patients who have exacerbations of asthma after exercise should have available for rescue a short-acting inhaled β-agonist. While the dose of inhaled corticosteroid may be reduced gradually under medical supervision, montelukast sodium should not be abruptly substituted for inhaled or oral corticosteroids. Patients with known aspirin sensitivity should continue avoidance of aspirin or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents while taking montelukast sodium. Although montelukast sodium is effective in improving airway function in asthmatics with documented aspirin sensitivity, it has not been shown to truncate bronchoconstrictor response to aspirin and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in aspirin-sensitive asthmatic patients Patients with asthma on therapy with montelukast sodium may present with systemic eosinophilia, sometimes presenting with clinical features of vasculitis consistent with Churg-Strauss syndrome, a condition which is often treated with systemic corticosteroid therapy. These events have been sometimes associated with the reduction of oral corticosteroid therapy. Physicians should be alert to eosinophilia, vasculitic rash, worsening pulmonary symptoms, cardiac complications, and/or neuropathy presenting in their patients. A causal association between montelukast sodium and these underlying conditions has not been established Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. In the following description of clinical trials experience, adverse reactions are listed regardless of causality assessment.   The most common adverse reactions (incidence ≥5% and greater than placebo; listed in descending order of frequency) in controlled clinical trials were: upper respiratory infection, fever, headache, pharyngitis, cough, abdominal pain, diarrhea, otitis media, influenza, rhinorrhea, sinusitis, otitis. Adults and Adolescents 15 Years of Age and Older with Asthma  Montelukast sodium has been evaluated for safety in approximately 2950 adult and adolescent patients 15 years of age and older in clinical trials. In placebo-controlled clinical trials, the following adverse experiences reported with montelukast sodium occurred in greater than or equal to 1% of patients and at an incidence greater than that in patients treated with placebo:  Table 1: Adverse Experiences Occurring in ≥1% of Patients with an Incidence Greater than that in Patients Treated with Placebo      Pain, abdominal     Asthenia/fatigue           Fever      Trauma       Dyspepsia *Number of patients tested (montelukast sodium and placebo, respectively): ALT and AST, 1935, 1170; pyuria, 1924, 1159.   The frequency of less common adverse events was comparable between montelukast sodium and placebo.   The safety profile of montelukast sodium, when administered as a single dose for prevention of EIB in adult and adolescent patients 15 years of age and older, was consistent with the safety profile previously described for montelukast sodium.   Cumulatively, 569 patients were treated with montelukast sodium for at least  6 months, 480 for one year, and 49 for two years in clinical trials. With prolonged treatment, the adverse experience profile did not significantly change.  Adults and Adolescents 15 Years of Age and Older with Seasonal Allergic Rhinitis Montelukast sodium has been evaluated for safety in 2199 adult and adolescent patients 15 years of age and older in clinical trials. Montelukast sodium administered once daily in the morning or in the evening had a safety profile similar to that of placebo. In placebo-controlled clinical trials, the following event was reported with montelukast sodium with a frequency ≥1% and at an incidence greater than placebo: upper respiratory infection, 1.9% of patients receiving montelukast sodium vs. 1.5% of patients receiving placebo. In a 4-week, placebo-controlled clinical study, the safety profile was consistent with that observed in 2-week studies. The incidence of somnolence was similar to that of placebo in all studies. Adults and Adolescents 15 Years of Age and Older with Perennial Allergic Rhinitis Montelukast sodium has been evaluated for safety in 3357 adult and adolescent patients 15 years of age and older with perennial allergic rhinitis of whom 1632 received montelukast sodium in two, 6-week, clinical studies. Montelukast sodium administered once daily had a safety profile consistent with that observed in patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis and similar to that of placebo. In these two studies, the following events were reported with montelukast sodium with a frequency ≥1% and at an incidence greater than placebo: sinusitis, upper respiratory infection, sinus headache, cough, epistaxis, and increased ALT. The incidence of somnolence was similar to that of placebo. The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of montelukast sodium. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Blood and lymphatic system disorders: increased bleeding tendency, thrombocytopenia. Immune system disorders: hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis, hepatic eosinophilic infiltration. Psychiatric disorders: including, but not limited to, agitation, aggressive behavior or hostility, anxiousness, depression, disorientation, disturbance in attention, dream abnormalities, dysphemia (stuttering), hallucinations, insomnia, irritability, memory impairment, obsessive-compulsive symptoms, restlessness, somnambulism, suicidal thinking and behavior (including suicide), tic, and tremor Nervous system disorders: drowsiness, paraesthesia/hypoesthesia, seizures. Cardiac disorders: palpitations. Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders: epistaxis, pulmonary eosinophilia. Gastrointestinal disorders: diarrhea, dyspepsia, nausea, pancreatitis, vomiting. Hepatobiliary disorders: Cases of cholestatic hepatitis, hepatocellular liver-injury, and mixed-pattern liver injury have been reported in patients treated with montelukast sodium. Most of these occurred in combination with other confounding factors, such as use of other medications, or when montelukast sodium was administered to patients who had underlying potential for liver disease such as alcohol use or other forms of hepatitis. Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: angioedema, bruising, erythema multiforme, erythema nodosum, pruritus, Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis, urticaria. Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders: arthralgia, myalgia including muscle cramps. Renal and urinary disorders: enuresis in children. General disorders and administration site conditions: edema. Patients with asthma on therapy with montelukast sodium may present with systemic eosinophilia, sometimes presenting with clinical features of vasculitis consistent with Churg-Strauss syndrome, a condition which is often treated with systemic corticosteroid therapy. These events have been sometimes associated with the reduction of oral corticosteroid therapy. Physicians should be alert to eosinophilia, vasculitic rash, worsening pulmonary symptoms, cardiac complications, and/or neuropathy presenting in their patients No dose adjustment is needed when montelukast sodium is co-administered with theophylline, prednisone, prednisolone, oral contraceptives, terfenadine, digoxin, warfarin, gemfibrozil, itraconazole, thyroid hormones, sedative hypnotics, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents, benzodiazepines, decongestants, and Cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme inducers   Available data from published prospective and retrospective cohort studies over decades with montelukast use in pregnant women have not established a drug-associated risk of major birth defects In animal reproduction studies, no adverse developmental effects were observed with oral administration of montelukast to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis at doses approximately 100 and 110 times, respectively, the maximum recommended human daily oral dose (MRHDOD) based on AUCs The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2 to 4% and 15 to 20%, respectively. Disease-associated maternal and/or embryo/fetal risk Poorly or moderately controlled asthma in pregnancy increases the maternal risk of perinatal adverse outcomes such as preeclampsia and infant prematurity, low birth weight, and small for gestational age. Published data from prospective and retrospective cohort studies have not identified an association with montelukast sodium use during pregnancy and major birth defects. Available studies have methodologic limitations, including small sample size, in some cases retrospective data collection, and inconsistent comparator groups. In embryo-fetal development studies, montelukast administered to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis (gestation days 6 to 17 in rats and 6 to 18 in rabbits) did not cause any adverse developmental effects at maternal oral doses up to 400 and 300 mg/kg/day in rats and rabbits, respectively (approximately 100 and 110 times the AUC in humans at the MRHDOD, respectively). A published clinical lactation study reports the presence of montelukast in human milk. Data available on the effects of the drug on infants, either directlyor through breast milk, do not suggest a significant risk of adverse events from exposure to montelukast sodium. The effects of the drug on milk production are unknown. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for montelukast sodium and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from montelukast sodium or from the underlying maternal condition. The safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of 12 months with asthma, 6 months with perennial allergic rhinitis, and 6 years with exercise-induced bronchoconstriction have not been established. Of the total number of subjects in clinical studies of montelukast, 3.5% were 65 years of age and over, and 0.4% were 75 years of age and over. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out. The pharmacokinetic profile and the oral bioavailability of a single 10 mg oral dose of montelukast are similar in elderly and younger adults. The plasma half-life of montelukast is slightly longer in the elderly. No dosage adjustment in the elderly is required. No dosage adjustment is required in patients with mild-to-moderate hepatic insufficiency No dosage adjustment is recommended in patients with renal insufficiency No specific information is available on the treatment of overdosage with montelukast sodium. In the event of overdose, it is reasonable to employ the usual supportive measures; e.g., remove unabsorbed material from the gastrointestinal tract, employ clinical monitoring, and institute supportive therapy, if required. It is not known whether montelukast is removed by peritoneal dialysis or hemodialysis. Montelukast sodium USP, the active ingredient in montelukast sodium tablets, is a selective and orally active leukotriene receptor antagonist that inhibits the cysteinyl leukotriene CysLT1 receptor. Montelukast sodium USP is described chemically as [R-(E)]-1-[[[1-[3-[2-(7-chloro-2-quinolinyl)ethenyl]phenyl]-3-[2-(1-hydroxy-1-methylethyl)phenyl]propyl]thio]methyl]   cyclopropaneacetic acid, monosodium salt.      The empirical formula is CHCINNaOS, and its molecular weight is 608.17. The structural formula is: Montelukast sodium USP is a hygroscopic, optically active, white or almost white powder. Montelukast sodium USP is freely soluble in water and methylene chloride, freely soluble to very soluble in alcohol. Each 10 mg film-coated montelukast sodium tablet contains 10.4 mg montelukast sodium USP, which is equivalent to 10 mg of montelukast, and the following inactive ingredients: croscarmellose sodium, hydroxypropyl cellulose, lactose monohydrate, magnesium stearate, mannitol and microcrystalline cellulose. The tablets are coated with opadry yellow which contains carnauba wax, hydroxypropyl cellulose, hypromellose, red iron oxide, titanium dioxide and yellow iron oxide. The cysteinyl leukotrienes (LTC, LTD, LTE) are products of arachidonic acid metabolism and are released from various cells, including mast cells and eosinophils. These eicosanoids bind to cysteinyl leukotriene (CysLT) receptors. The CysLT type-1 (CysLT) receptor is found in the human airway (including airway smooth muscle cells and airway macrophages) and on other pro-inflammatory cells (including eosinophils and certain myeloid stem cells). CysLTs have been correlated with the pathophysiology of asthma and allergic rhinitis. In asthma, leukotriene-mediated effects include airway edema, smooth muscle contraction, and altered cellular activity associated with the inflammatory process. In allergic rhinitis, CysLTs are released from the nasal mucosa after allergen exposure during both early- and late-phase reactions and are associated with symptoms of allergic rhinitis. Montelukast is an orally active compound that binds with high affinity and selectivity to the CysLT receptor (in preference to other pharmacologically important airway receptors, such as the prostanoid, cholinergic, or β-adrenergic receptor). Montelukast inhibits physiologic actions of  LTD at the CysLT receptor without any agonist activity. Montelukast causes inhibition of airway cysteinyl leukotriene receptors as demonstrated by the ability to inhibit bronchoconstriction due to inhaled LTD in asthmatics. Doses as low as 5 mg cause substantial blockage of LTD-induced bronchoconstriction. In a placebo-controlled, crossover study (n=12), montelukast sodium inhibited early- and late-phase bronchoconstriction due to antigen challenge by 75% and 57%, respectively. The effect of montelukast sodium on eosinophils in the peripheral blood was examined in clinical trials. In patients with asthma aged 2 years and older who received montelukast sodium, a decrease in mean peripheral blood eosinophil counts ranging from 9% to 15% was noted, compared with placebo, over the double-blind treatment periods. In patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis aged 15 years and older who received montelukast sodium, a mean increase of 0.2% in peripheral blood eosinophil counts was noted, compared with a mean increase of 12.5% in placebo-treated patients, over the double-blind treatment periods; this reflects a mean difference of 12.3% in favor of montelukast sodium. The relationship between these observations and the clinical benefits of montelukast noted in the clinical trials is not known Montelukast is rapidly absorbed following oral administration. After administration of the 10 mg film-coated tablet to fasted adults, the mean peak montelukast plasma concentration (C) is achieved in 3 to 4 hours (T). The mean oral bioavailability is 64%. The oral bioavailability and Care not influenced by a standard meal in the morning. The safety and efficacy of montelukast sodium in patients with asthma were demonstrated in clinical trials in which the 10 mg film-coated tablet formulation was administered in the evening without regard to the time of food ingestion. The safety and efficacy of montelukast sodium in patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis were demonstrated in clinical trials in which the 10 mg film-coated tablet was administered in the morning or evening without regard to the time of food ingestion. The comparative pharmacokinetics of montelukast when administered as two 5 mg chewable tablets versus one 10 mg film-coated tablet have not been evaluated. Montelukast is more than 99% bound to plasma proteins. The steady state volume of distribution of montelukast averages 8 to 11 liters. Orally administered montelukast distributes into the brain in rats. Montelukast is extensively metabolized. In studies with therapeutic doses, plasma concentrations of metabolites of montelukast are undetectable at steady state in adults and pediatric patients. studies using human liver microsomes indicate that CYP3A4, 2C8, and 2C9 are involved in the metabolism of montelukast. At clinically relevant concentrations, 2C8 appears to play a major role in the metabolism of montelukast. The plasma clearance of montelukast averages 45 mL/min in healthy adults. Following an oral dose of radiolabeled montelukast, 86% of the radioactivity was recovered in 5-day fecal collections and <0.2% was recovered in urine. Coupled with estimates of montelukast oral bioavailability, this indicates that montelukast and its metabolites are excreted almost exclusively via the bile. In several studies, the mean plasma half-life of montelukast ranged from 2.7 to 5.5 hours in healthy young adults. The pharmacokinetics of montelukast are nearly linear for oral doses up to 50 mg. During once-daily dosing with 10 mg montelukast, there is little accumulation of the parent drug in plasma (14%). Patients with mild-to-moderate hepatic insufficiency and clinical evidence of cirrhosis had evidence of decreased metabolism of montelukast resulting in 41% (90% CI=7%, 85%) higher mean montelukast AUC following a single 10 mg dose. The elimination of montelukast was slightly prolonged compared with that in healthy subjects (mean half-life, 7.4 hours). No dosage adjustment is required in patients with mild-to-moderate hepatic insufficiency. The pharmacokinetics of montelukast sodium in patients with more severe hepatic impairment or with hepatitis have not been evaluated. Renal Insufficiency: Since montelukast and its metabolites are not excreted in the urine, the pharmacokinetics of montelukast was not evaluated in patients with renal insuffciency. No dosage adjustment is recommended in these patients. The pharmacokinetics of montelukast is similar in males and females. Pharmacokinetic differences due to race have not been studied. Adolescents and Pediatric Patients: Pharmacokinetic studies evaluated the systemic exposure of the 10 mg film-coated tablets in young adults and adolescents ≥15 years of age. The plasma concentration profile of montelukast following administration of the 10 mg film-coated tablet is similar in adolescents ≥15 years of age and young adults. The 10 mg film-coated tablet is recommended for use in patients ≥15 years of age.   Montelukast sodium has been administered with other therapies routinely used in the prophylaxis and chronic treatment of asthma with no apparent increase in adverse reactions. In drug-interaction studies, the recommended clinical dose of montelukast did not have clinically important effects on the pharmacokinetics of the following drugs: theophylline, prednisone, and prednisolone. Montelukast at a dose of 10 mg once daily dosed to pharmacokinetic steady state, did not cause clinically significant changes in the kinetics of a single intravenous dose of theophylline [predominantly a cytochrome P450 (CYP) 1A2 substrate].  Montelukast at doses of ≥100 mg daily dosed to pharmacokinetic steady state, did not cause any clinically significant change in plasma profiles of prednisone or prednisolone following administration of either oral prednisone or intravenous prednisolone. Oral Contraceptives, Terfenadine, Digoxin, and Warfarin: In drug interaction studies, the recommended clinical dose of montelukast did not have clinically important effects on the pharmacokinetics of the following drugs: oral contraceptives (norethindrone 1 mg/ ethinyl estradiol 35 mcg), terfenadine, digoxin, and warfarin. Montelukast at doses of ≥100 mg daily dosed to pharmacokinetic steady state did not significantly alter the plasma concentrations of either component of an oral contraceptive containing norethindrone 1 mg/ethinyl estradiol 35 mcg. Montelukast at a dose of 10 mg once daily dosed to pharmacokinetic steady state did not change the plasma concentration profile of terfenadine (a substrate of CYP3A4) or fexofenadine, the carboxylated metabolite, and did not prolong the QTc interval following co-administration with terfenadine 60 mg twice daily; did not change the pharmacokinetic profile or urinary excretion of immunoreactive digoxin; did not change the pharmacokinetic profile of warfarin (primarily a substrate of CYP2C9, 3A4 and 1A2) or influence the effect of a single 30 mg oral dose of warfarin on prothrombin time or the International Normalized Ratio (INR). Thyroid Hormones, Sedative Hypnotics, Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Benzodiazepines, and Decongestants: Although additional specific interaction studies were not performed, montelukast sodium was used concomitantly with a wide range of commonly prescribed drugs in clinical studies without evidence of clinical adverse interactions. These medications included thyroid hormones, sedative hypnotics, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents, benzodiazepines, and decongestants. Phenobarbital, which induces hepatic metabolism, decreased the area under the plasma concentration curve (AUC) of montelukast approximately 40% following a single 10 mg dose of montelukast. No dosage adjustment for montelukast sodium is recommended. It is reasonable to employ appropriate clinical monitoring when potent CYP enzyme inducers, such as phenobarbital or rifampin, are co-administered with montelukast sodium. Effect of Montelukast on Cytochrome P450 (CYP) Enzymes: Montelukast is a potent inhibitor of CYP2C8 in vitro. However, data from a clinical drug-drug interaction study involving montelukast and rosiglitazone (a probe substrate representative of drugs primarily metabolized by CYP2C8) in 12 healthy individuals demonstrated that the pharmacokinetics of rosiglitazone are not altered when the drugs are coadministered, indicating that montelukast does not inhibit CYP2C8 in vivo. Therefore, montelukast is not anticipated to alter the metabolism of drugs metabolized by this enzyme (e.g., paclitaxel, rosiglitazone, and repaglinide). Based on further in vitro results in human liver microsomes, therapeutic plasma concentrations of montelukast do not inhibit CYP 3A4, 2C9, 1A2, 2A6, 2C19, or 2D6. In vitro studies have shown that montelukast is a substrate of CYP 2C8, 2C9, and 3A4. Co-administration of montelukast with itraconazole, a strong CYP 3A4 inhibitor, resulted in no significant increase in the systemic exposure of montelukast. Data from a clinical drug-drug interaction study involving montelukast and gemfibrozil (an inhibitor of both CYP 2C8 and 2C9) demonstrated that gemfibrozil, at a therapeutic dose, increased the systemic exposure of montelukast by 4.4-fold. Co-administration of itraconazole, gemfibrozil, and montelukast did not further increase the systemic exposure of montelukast. Based on available clinical experience, no dosage adjustment of montelukast is required upon co-administration with gemfibrozil 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility No evidence of tumorigenicity was seen in carcinogenicity studies of either 2 years in Sprague-Dawley rats or 92 weeks in mice at oral gavage doses up to 200 mg/kg/day or 100 mg/kg/day, respectively. The estimated exposure in rats was approximately 120 and 75 times the AUC for adults and children, respectively, at the maximum recommended daily oral dose. The estimated exposure in mice was approximately 45 and 25 times the AUC for adults and children, respectively, at the maximum recommended daily oral dose. Montelukast demonstrated no evidence of mutagenic or clastogenic activity in the following assays: the microbial mutagenesis assay, the V-79 mammalian cell mutagenesis assay, the alkaline elution assay in rat hepatocytes, the chromosomal aberration assay in Chinese hamster ovary cells, and in the in vivo mouse bone marrow chromosomal aberration assay. In fertility studies in female rats, montelukast produced reductions in fertility and fecundity indices at an oral dose of 200 mg/kg (estimated exposure was approximately  70 times the AUC for adults at the maximum recommended daily oral dose). No effects on female fertility or fecundity were observed at an oral dose of 100 mg/kg (estimated exposure was approximately 20 times the AUC for adults at the maximum recommended daily oral dose). Montelukast had no effects on fertility in male rats at oral doses up to 800 mg/kg (estimated exposure was approximately 160 times the AUC for adults at the maximum recommended daily oral dose). Adults and Adolescents 15 Years of Age and Older with Asthma Clinical trials in adults and adolescents 15 years of age and older demonstrated there is no additional clinical benefit to montelukast doses above 10 mg once daily. The efficacy of montelukast sodium for the chronic treatment of asthma in adults and adolescents 15 years of age and older was demonstrated in two (U.S. and Multinational) similarly designed, randomized, 12-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials in 1576 patients (795 treated with montelukast sodium, 530 treated with placebo, and 251 treated with active control). The median age was 33 years (range 15 to 85); 56.8% were females and 43.2% were males. The ethnic/racial distribution in these studies was 71.6% Caucasian, 17.7% Hispanic, 7.2% other origins and 3.5% Black. Patients had mild or moderate asthma and were non-smokers who required approximately 5 puffs of inhaled β-agonist per day on an ""as-needed"" basis. The patients had a mean baseline percent of predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV) of 66% (approximate range, 40 to 90%). The co-primary endpoints in these trials were FEV Rand daytime asthma symptoms. In both studies after 12 weeks, a random subset of patients receiving montelukast sodium was switched to placebo for an additional 3 weeks of double-blind treatment to evaluate for possible rebound effects. The results of the U.S. trial on the primary endpoint, morning FEV, expressed as mean percent change from baseline averaged over the 12-week treatment period, are shown in FIGURE 2. Compared with placebo, treatment with one montelukast sodium 10 mg tablet daily in the evening resulted in a statistically significant increase in FEV percent change from baseline (13.0%-change in the group treated with montelukast sodium vs. 4.2%-change in the placebo group, p<0.001); the change from baseline in FEV for montelukast sodium was 0.32 liters compared with 0.10 liters for placebo, corresponding to a between-group difference of 0.22 liters (p<0.001, 95% CI 0.17 liters, 0.27 liters). The results of the Multinational trial on FEV were similar.                                                               Figure 2: FEV Mean Percent Change from Baseline (U.S. Trial: Montelukast sodium N=406; Placebo N=270)   The effect of montelukast sodium on other primary and secondary endpoints, represented by the Multinational study is shown in TABLE 2. Results on these endpoints were similar in the US study. Table 2: Effect of Montelukast Sodium on Primary and Secondary Endpoints in a Multinational Placebo-controlled Trial (ANOVA Model)                                                       * p<0.001, compared with placebo Both studies evaluated the effect of montelukast sodium on secondary outcomes, including asthma attack (utilization of health-care resources such as an unscheduled visit to a doctor's office, emergency room, or hospital; or treatment with oral, intravenous, or intramuscular corticosteroid), and use of oral corticosteroids for asthma rescue. In the Multinational study, significantly fewer patients (15.6% of patients) on montelukast sodium experienced asthma attacks compared with patients on placebo (27.3%, p<0.001). In the US study, 7.8% of patients on montelukast sodium and 10.3% of patients on placebo experienced asthma attacks, but the difference between the two treatment groups was not significant (p=0.334). In the Multinational study, significantly fewer patients (14.8% of patients) on montelukast sodium were prescribed oral corticosteroids for asthma rescue compared with patients on placebo (25.7%, p<0.001). In the US study, 6.9% of patients on montelukast sodium and 9.9% of patients on placebo were prescribed oral corticosteroids for asthma rescue, but the difference between the two treatment groups was not significant (p=0.196). In each placebo-controlled trial in adults, the treatment effect of montelukast sodium, measured by daily diary card parameters, including symptom scores, ""as-needed"" β-agonist use, and PEFR measurements, was achieved after the first dose and was maintained throughout the dosing interval (24 hours). No significant change in treatment effect was observed during continuous once-daily evening administration in non-placebo-controlled extension trials for up to one year. Withdrawal of montelukast sodium in asthmatic patients after 12 weeks of continuous use did not cause rebound worsening of asthma. Effects in Patients on Concomitant Inhaled Corticosteroids Separate trials in adults evaluated the ability of montelukast sodium to add to the clinical effect of inhaled corticosteroids and to allow inhaled corticosteroid tapering when used concomitantly.      One randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trial (n=226) enrolled adults with stable asthma with a mean FEVof approximately 84% of predicted who were previously maintained on various inhaled corticosteroids (delivered by metered-dose aerosol or dry powder inhalers). The median age was 41.5 years (range 16 to 70); 52.2% were females and 47.8% were males. The ethnic/racial distribution in this study was 92.0% Caucasian, 3.5% Black, 2.2% Hispanic, and 2.2% Asian. The types of inhaled corticosteroids and their mean baseline requirements included beclomethasone dipropionate (mean dose, 1203 mcg/day), triamcinolone acetonide (mean dose, 2004 mcg/day), flunisolide (mean dose, 1971 mcg/day), fluticasone propionate (mean dose, 1083 mcg/day), or budesonide (mean dose, 1192 mcg/day). Some of these inhaled corticosteroids were non-U.S.-approved formulations, and doses expressed may not be ex-actuator. The pre-study inhaled corticosteroid requirements were reduced by approximately 37% during a 5- to 7-week placebo run-in period designed to titrate patients toward their lowest effective inhaled corticosteroid dose. Treatment with montelukast sodium resulted in a further 47% reduction in mean inhaled corticosteroid dose compared with a mean reduction of 30% in the placebo group over the 12-week active treatment period (p≤0.05). It is not known whether the results of this study can be generalized to patients with asthma who require higher doses of inhaled corticosteroids or systemic corticosteroids. In another randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trial (n=642) in a similar population of adult patients previously maintained, but not adequately controlled, on inhaled corticosteroids (beclomethasone 336 mcg/day), the addition of montelukast sodium to beclomethasone resulted in statistically significant improvements in FEV compared with those patients who were continued on beclomethasone alone or those patients who were withdrawn from beclomethasone and treated with montelukast  or placebo alone over the last 10 weeks of the 16-week, blinded treatment period. Patients who were randomized to treatment arms containing beclomethasone had statistically significantly better asthma control than those patients randomized to montelukast sodium alone or placebo alone as indicated by FEV, daytime asthma symptoms, PEFR, nocturnal awakenings due to asthma, and ""as-needed"" β-agonist requirements. In adult patients with asthma with documented aspirin sensitivity, nearly all of whom were receiving concomitant inhaled and/or oral corticosteroids, a 4-week, randomized, parallel-group trial (n=80) demonstrated that montelukast sodium, compared with placebo, resulted in significant improvement in parameters of asthma control. The magnitude of effect of montelukast sodium in aspirin-sensitive patients was similar to the effect observed in the general population of asthma patients studied. The effect of montelukast sodium on the bronchoconstrictor response to aspirin or other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in aspirin-sensitive asthmatic patients has not been evaluated Exercise-Induced Bronchoconstriction (Adults and Adolescents 15 years of age and older) The efficacy of montelukast sodium, 10 mg, when given as a single dose 2 hours before exercise for the prevention of EIB was investigated in three (U.S. and Multinational), randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover studies that included a total of 160 adult and adolescent patients 15 years of age and older with EIB. Exercise challenge testing was conducted at 2 hours, 8.5 or 12 hours, and 24 hours following administration of a single dose of study drug (montelukast sodium 10 mg or placebo). The primary endpoint was the mean maximum percent fall in FEV Rfollowing the 2 hours post-dose exercise challenge in all three studies (Study A, Study B, and   Study C). In Study A, a single dose of montelukast sodium 10 mg demonstrated a statistically significant protective benefit against EIB when taken 2 hours prior to exercise. Some patients were protected from EIB at 8.5 and 24 hours after administration; however, some patients were not. The results for the mean maximum percent fall at each timepoint in Study A are shown in TABLE 3 and are representative of the results from the other two studies.  : Mean Maximum Percent Fall in FEV Following ExerciseChallenge in Study A (N=47) ANOVA Model Time of exercise challenge following medication administration Treatment difference % for Montelukast sodium versus Placebo (95%CI)*     Daily administration of montelukast sodium for the chronic treatment of asthma has not been established to prevent acute episodes of EIB. In a 12-week, randomized, double-blind, parallel group study of 110 adult and adolescent asthmatics 15 years of age and older, with a mean baseline FEVpercent of predicted of 83% and with documented exercise-induced exacerbation of asthma, treatment with montelukast sodium, 10 mg, once daily in the evening, resulted in a statistically significant reduction in mean maximal percent fall in FEV and mean time to recovery to within 5% of the pre-exercise FEV. Exercise challenge was conducted at the end of the dosing interval (i.e., 20 to 24 hours after the preceding dose). This effect was maintained throughout the 12-week treatment period indicating that tolerance did not occur. Montelukast sodium did not, however, prevent clinically significant deterioration in maximal percent fall in FEV after exercise (i.e., ≥20% decrease from pre-exercise baseline) in 52% of patients studied. In a separate crossover study in adults, a similar effect was observed after two once-daily 10 mg doses of montelukast sodium. The efficacy of montelukast sodium tablets for the treatment of seasonal allergic rhinitis was investigated in 5 similarly designed, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo- and active-controlled (loratadine) trials conducted in North America. The 5 trials enrolled a total of 5029 patients, of whom 1799 were treated with montelukast sodium tablets. Patients were 15 to 82 years of age with a history of seasonal allergic rhinitis, a positive skin test to at least one relevant seasonal allergen, and active symptoms of seasonal allergic rhinitis at study entry.   The period of randomized treatment was 2 weeks in 4 trials and 4 weeks in one trial. The primary outcome variable was mean change from baseline in daytime nasal symptoms score (the average of individual scores of nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, nasal itching, sneezing) as assessed by patients on a 0 to 3 categorical scale. Four of the five trials showed a significant reduction in daytime nasal symptoms scores with montelukast sodium 10 mg tablets compared with placebo. The results of one trial are shown below. The median age in this trial was 35.0 years (range 15 to 81); 65.4% were females and 34.6% were males. The ethnic/racial distribution in this study was 83.1% Caucasian, 6.4% other origins, 5.8% Black, and 4.8% Hispanic. The mean changes from baseline in daytime nasal symptoms score in the treatment groups that received montelukast sodium tablets, loratadine, and placebo are shown in TABLE 5. The remaining three trials that demonstrated efficacy showed similar results. Table 5: Effects of Montelukast Sodium on Daytime Nasal Symptoms Score* in a Placebo- and Active-controlled Trial in Patients with Seasonal Allergic Rhinitis Difference Between Treatment and Placebo (95% CI)Least-Squares Mean * Average of individual scores of nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, nasal itching, sneezing as assessed by  Statistically different from placebo (p≤0.001). The study was not designed for statistical comparison between montelukast sodium and the active control (loratadine). The efficacy of montelukast sodium tablets for the treatment of perennial allergic rhinitis was investigated in 2 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies conducted in North America and Europe. The two studies enrolled a total of 3357 patients, of whom 1632 received montelukast sodium 10 mg tablets. Patients 15 to 82 years of age with perennial allergic rhinitis as confirmed by history and a positive skin test to at least one relevant perennial allergen (dust mites, animal dander, and/or mold spores), who had active symptoms at the time of study entry, were enrolled. In the study in which efficacy was demonstrated, the median age was 35 years (range 15 to 81); 64.1% were females and 35.9% were males. The ethnic/racial distribution in this study was 83.2% Caucasian, 8.1% Black, 5.4% Hispanic, 2.3% Asian, and 1.0% other origins. Montelukast sodium 10 mg tablets once daily was shown to significantly reduce symptoms of perennial allergic rhinitis over a 6-week treatment period (TABLE 6); in this study the primary outcome variable was mean change from baseline in daytime nasal symptoms score (the average of individual scores of nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, and sneezing). Table 6: Effects of Montelukast Sodium on Daytime Nasal Symptoms Score* in a Placebo-controlled Trial in Patients with Perennial Allergic Rhinitis Difference Between Treatment and Placebo (95% CI) Least-Squares Mean Average of individual scores of nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, sneezing as assessed by patients on a 0 to 3 categorical scale. Statistically different from placebo (p≤0.001). The other 6-week study evaluated montelukast sodium 10 mg (n=626), placebo (n=609), and an active-control (cetirizine 10 mg; n=120). The primary analysis compared the mean change from baseline in daytime nasal symptoms score for montelukast sodium vs. placebo over the first 4 weeks of treatment; the study was not designed for statistical comparison between montelukast sodium and the active-control. The primary outcome variable included nasal itching in addition to nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, and sneezing. The estimated difference between montelukast sodium and placebo was -0.04 with a 95% CI of (-0.09, 0.01). The estimated difference between the active-control and placebo was -0.10 with a 95% CI of (-0.19, -0.01).

The typesof events reported were highly variable, and included, but were not limited to, agitation, aggression, depression, sleep disturbances, suicidal thoughts and behavior (including suicide). The mechanisms underlying NP events associated with montelukast sodium tablets use are currently not well understood []. Because of the risk of NP events, the benefits of montelukast sodium tablets may not outweigh the risks in somepatients, particularly when the symptoms of disease may be mild and adequately treated with alternative therapies. Reserve use of montelukast sodium tablets for patients with allergic rhinitis who have an inadequate response or intolerance to alternative therapies [)]. In patients with asthma or exercise-induced bronchoconstriction, consider the benefits and risksbefore prescribing montelukast sodium tablets. Discuss the benefits and risks of montelukast sodium tablets with patients and caregivers when prescribing montelukast sodium tablets. Advise patients and/or caregivers to be alert for changes in behavior or new NP symptoms when taking montelukast sodium tablets. If changes in behavior are observed, or if new NP symptomsor suicidal thoughts and/or behavior occur, advise patients to discontinue montelukast sodium tablets and contact a healthcare provider immediately []. Montelukast sodium tablets are indicated for the prophylaxis and chronic treatment of asthma in patients 15 years of age and older. Montelukast sodium tablets are indicated for prevention of exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (EIB) in patients 15 years of age and older. Montelukast sodium tablets are  indicated for the relief of symptoms of seasonal allergic rhinitis in patients 15 years of age and older and perennial allergic rhinitis in patients 15 years of age and older. Because the benefits of montelukast sodium tablets may not outweigh the risk of neuropsychiatric symptoms in patients with allergic reserve use for patients who have an inadequate response or intolerance to alternative therapies.  Montelukast sodium should be taken once daily in the evening. The following dose is are recommended: For adults and adolescents 15 years of age and older: one 10-mg tablet. Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients less than 12 months of age with asthma have not been established. Patients who miss a dose should take the next dose at their regular time and should not take 2 doses at the same time. There have been no clinical trials in patients with asthma to evaluate the relative efficacy of morning versus evening dosing. The pharmacokinetics of montelukast are similar whether dosed in the morning or evening. Efficacy has been demonstrated for asthma when montelukast was administered in the evening without regard to time of food ingestion. For prevention of EIB, a single 10 mg dose of montelukast should be taken at least 2 hours before exercise. The following dose is recommended : For adults and adolescents 15 years of age and older: one 10-mg tablet. An additional dose of montelukast should not be taken within 24 hours of a previous dose. Patients already taking montelukast sodium daily for another indication (including chronic asthma) should not take an additional dose to prevent EIB. All patients should have available for rescue a short-acting ß-agonist. Safety and efficacy in patients younger than 15 years of age have not been established. Daily administration of montelukast sodium for the chronic treatment of asthma has not been established to prevent acute episodes of EIB. allergic rhinitis when montelukast was administered in the morning or the evening without regard to time of food ingestion. The time of administration may be individualized to suit patient needs. The following dose for the treatment of symptoms of seasonal allergic rhinitis are recommended: For adults and adolescents 15 years of age and older: one 10-mg tablet. Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients younger than 2 years of age with seasonal allergic rhinitis have not been established. The following dose for the treatment of symptoms of perennial allergic rhinitis are recommended: For adults and adolescents 15 years of age and older: one 10-mg tablet.  Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients younger than 6 months of age with perennial allergic rhinitis have not been established. Patients who miss a dose should take the next dose at their regular time and should not take 2 doses at the same time. Patients with both asthma and allergic rhinitis should take only one montelukast sodium dose daily in the evening. Patients who miss a dose should take the next dose at their regular time and should not take 2 doses at the same time. Montelukast sodium Film-Coated Tablets, 10 mg are beige, rounded square-shaped biconvex tablets, debossed 'CL 26' on one side of the tablet and having plain surface on other side. Hypersensitivity to any component of this product. Serious neuropsychiatric (NP) events have been reported with use of montelukast sodium. These postmarketing reports have been highly variable and included, but were not limited to, agitation, aggressive behavior or hostility, anxiousness, depression, disorientation, disturbance in attention, dream abnormalities, dysphemia (stuttering), hallucinations, insomnia, irritability, memory impairment, obsessive-compulsive symptoms, restlessness, somnambulism, suicidal thoughts and behavior (including suicide), tic, and tremor. NP events have been reported in adult, adolescent, and pediatric patients with and without a previous history of psychiatric disorder. NP events have been reported mostly during montelukast sodium treatment, but some were reported after montelukast sodium discontinuation. Animal studies showed that montelukast distributes into the brain in rats []; however, the mechanisms underlying montelukast sodium-associated NP events are currently not well understood. Based upon the available data, it is difficult to identify risk factors for or quantify the risk of NP events with montelukast sodium use. Because of the risk of NP events, the benefits of montelukast sodium may not outweigh the risks in some patients, particularly when the symptoms of disease may be mild and adequately treated with alternative therapies. Reserve use of montelukast sodium for patients with allergic rhinitis who have an inadequate response or intolerance to alternative therapies []. In patients with asthma or exercise-induced bronchoconstriction, consider the benefits and risks before prescribing montelukast sodium. Discuss the benefits and risks of montelukast sodium use with patients and caregivers when prescribing montelukast sodium. Advise patients and/or caregivers to be alert for changes in behavior or for new NP symptoms when taking montelukast sodium. If changes in behavior are observed, or if new NP symptoms or suicidal thoughts and/or behavior occur, advise patients to discontinue montelukast sodium and contact a healthcare provider immediately. In many cases, symptoms resolved after stopping montelukast sodium therapy; however, in some cases symptoms persisted after discontinuation of montelukast sodium. Therefore, continue to monitor and provide supportive care until symptoms resolve. Re-evaluate the benefits and risks of restarting treatment with montelukast sodium if such events occur. Montelukast sodium is not indicated for use in the reversal of bronchospasm in acute asthma attacks, including status asthmaticus. Patients should be advised to have appropriate rescue medication available. Therapy with montelukast sodium can be continued during acute exacerbations of asthma. Patients who have exacerbations of asthma after exercise should have available for rescue a short-acting inhaled β-agonist. While the dose of inhaled corticosteroid may be reduced gradually under medical supervision, montelukast sodium should not be abruptly substituted for inhaled or oral corticosteroids. Patients with known aspirin sensitivity should continue avoidance of aspirin or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents while taking montelukast sodium. Although montelukast sodium is effective in improving airway function in asthmatics with documented aspirin sensitivity, it has not been shown to truncate bronchoconstrictor response to aspirin and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in aspirin-sensitive asthmatic patients Patients with asthma on therapy with montelukast sodium may present with systemic eosinophilia, sometimes presenting with clinical features of vasculitis consistent with Churg-Strauss syndrome, a condition which is often treated with systemic corticosteroid therapy. These events have been sometimes associated with the reduction of oral corticosteroid therapy. Physicians should be alert to eosinophilia, vasculitic rash, worsening pulmonary symptoms, cardiac complications, and/or neuropathy presenting in their patients. A causal association between montelukast sodium and these underlying conditions has not been established Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. In the following description of clinical trials experience, adverse reactions are listed regardless of causality assessment. The most common adverse reactions (incidence ≥5% and greater than placebo; listed in descending order of frequency) in controlled clinical trials were: upper respiratory infection, fever, headache, pharyngitis, cough, abdominal pain, diarrhea, otitis media, influenza, rhinorrhea, sinusitis, otitis. Adults and Adolescents 15 Years of Age and Older with Asthma Montelukast sodium has been evaluated for safety in approximately 2950 adult and adolescent patients 15 years of age and older in clinical trials. In placebo-controlled clinical trials, the following adverse experiences reported with montelukast occurred in greater than or equal to 1% of patients and at an incidence greater than that in patients treated with placebo: TABLE 1: Adverse Experiences Occurring in ≥1% of Patients with an Incidence Greater than that in Patients Treated with Placebo Number of patients tested (montelukast sodium and placebo, respectively): ALT and AST, 1935, 1170; pyuria, 1924, 1159. Montelukast 10 mg/day (%) (n=1955) The frequency of less common adverse events was comparable between montelukast sodium and placebo. The safety profile of montelukast sodium, when administered as a single dose for prevention of EIB in adult and adolescent patients 15 years of age and older, was consistent with the safety profile previously described for montelukast sodium. Cumulatively, 569 patients were treated with montelukast sodium for at least 6 months, 480 for one year, and 49 for two years in clinical trials. With prolonged treatment, the adverse experience profile did not significantly change.   Adults and Adolescents 15 Years of Age and Older with Seasonal Allergic Rhinitis Montelukast sodium has been evaluated for safety in 2199 adult and adolescent patients 15 years of age and older in clinical trials. Montelukast sodium administered once daily in the morning or in the evening had a safety profile similar to that of placebo. In placebo-controlled clinical trials, the following event was reported with montelukast sodium with a frequency ≥ 1% and at an incidence greater than placebo: upper respiratory infection, 1.9% of patients receiving montelukast sodium vs. 1.5% of patients receiving placebo. In a 4-week, placebo-controlled clinical study, the safety profile was consistent with that observed in 2-week studies. The incidence of somnolence was similar to that of placebo in all studies.   Adults and Adolescents 15 Years of Age and Older with Perennial Allergic Rhinitis Montelukast sodium has been evaluated for safety in 3357 adult and adolescent patients 15 years of age and older with perennial allergic rhinitis of whom 1632 received montelukast sodium in two, 6-week, clinical studies. Montelukast sodium administered once daily had a safety profile consistent with that observed in patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis and similar to that of placebo. In these two studies, the following events were reported with montelukast sodium with a frequency ≥ 1% and at an incidence greater than placebo: sinusitis, upper respiratory infection, sinus headache, cough, epistaxis, and increased ALT. The incidence of somnolence was similar to that of placebo. The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of montelukast sodium. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Blood and lymphatic system disorders: increased bleeding tendency, thrombocytopenia. Immune system disorders: hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis, hepatic eosinophilic infiltration. Psychiatric disorders: including, but not limited to, agitation, aggressive behavior or hostility, anxiousness, depression, disorientation, disturbance in attention, dream abnormalities, dysphemia (stuttering),  hallucinations, insomnia, irritability, memory impairment, obsessive-compulsive symptoms, restlessness, somnambulism, suicidal thinking and behavior (including suicide), tic, and tremor [see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions ()] Nervous system disorders: drowsiness, paraesthesia/hypoesthesia, seizures. Cardiac disorders: palpitations. Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders: epistaxis, pulmonary eosinophilia. Gastrointestinal disorders: diarrhea, dyspepsia, nausea, pancreatitis, vomiting. Hepatobiliary disorders: Cases of cholestatic hepatitis, hepatocellular liver-injury, and mixed-pattern liver injury have been reported in patients treated with montelukast sodium. Most of these occurred in combination with other confounding factors, such as use of other medications, or when montelukast sodium was administered to patients who had underlying potential for liver disease such as alcohol use or other forms of hepatitis. Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: angioedema, bruising, erythema multiforme, erythema nodosum,pruritus, Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis, urticaria. Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders: arthralgia, myalgia including muscle cramps. Renal and urinary disorders: enuresis in children. General disorders and administration site conditions: edema. Patients with asthma on therapy with montelukast sodium may present with systemic eosinophilia, sometimes presenting with clinical features of vasculitis consistent with Churg-Strauss syndrome, a condition which is often treated with systemic corticosteroid therapy. These events have been sometimes associated with the reduction of oral corticosteroid therapy. Physicians should be alert to eosinophilia, vasculitic rash, worsening pulmonary symptoms, cardiac complications, and/or neuropathy presenting in their patients No dose adjustment is needed when montelukast sodium is co-administered with theophylline, prednisone, prednisolone, oral contraceptives, terfenadine, digoxin, warfarin, gemfibrozil, itraconazole, thyroid hormones, sedative hypnotics, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents, benzodiazepines, decongestants, and Cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme inducers [see ]. Available data from published prospective and retrospective cohort studies over decades with montelukast use in pregnant women have not established a drug-associated risk of major birth defects []. In animal reproduction studies, no adverse developmental  effects were observed with oral administration of montelukast to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis at doses approximately 100 and 110 times, respectively, the maximum recommended human daily oral dose (MRHDOD) based on AUCs . The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. Disease-associated maternal and/or embryo/fetal risk Poorly or moderately controlled asthma in pregnancy increases the maternal risk of perinatal adverse outcomes such as preeclampsia and infant prematurity, low birth weight, and small for gestational age. Published data from prospective and retrospective cohort studies have not identified an association with montelukast sodium use during pregnancy and major birth defects. Available studies have methodologic limitations, including small sample size, in some cases retrospective data collection, and inconsistent comparator groups. In embryo-fetal development studies, montelukast administered to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis (gestation days 6 to 17 in rats and 6 to 18 in rabbits) did not cause any adverse developmental effects at maternal oral doses up to 400 and 300 mg/kg/day in rats and rabbits, respectively (approximately 100 and 110 times the AUC in humans at the MRHDOD, respectively). A published clinical lactation study reports the presence of montelukast in human milk. Data available on the effects of the drug on infants, either directly [] or through breast milk, do not suggest a significant risk of adverse events from exposure to montelukast sodium. The effects of the drug on milk production are unknown. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother’s clinical need for montelukast sodium and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from montelukast sodium or from the underlying maternal condition. The safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of 12 months with asthma, 6 months with perennial allergic rhinitis, and 6 years with exercise-induced bronchoconstriction have not been established. Of the total number of subjects in clinical studies of montelukast, 3.5% were 65 years of age and over, and 0.4% were 75 years of age and over. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out. The pharmacokinetic profile and the oral bioavailability of a single 10-mg oral dose of montelukast are similar in elderly and younger adults. The plasma half-life of montelukast is slightly longer in the elderly. No dosage adjustment in the elderly is required. No dosage adjustment is required in patients with mild-to-moderate hepatic insufficiency [see ]. No dosage adjustment is recommended in patients with renal insufficiency [see ]. No specific information is available on the treatment of overdosage with montelukast sodium. In the event of overdose, it is reasonable to employ the usual supportive measures; e.g., remove unabsorbed material from the gastrointestinal tract, employ clinical monitoring, and institute supportive therapy, if required. It is not known whether montelukast is removed by peritoneal dialysis or hemodialysis. Montelukast sodium,  USP the active ingredient in montelukast sodium tablets, is a selective and orally active leukotriene receptor antagonist that inhibits the cysteinyl leukotriene CysLT receptor. Montelukast sodium, USP is described chemically as [R-(E)]-1-[[[1-[3-[2-(7-chloro-2-quinolinyl)ethenyl] phenyl]-3-[2-(1-hydroxy-1-methylethyl)phenyl] propyl]thio]methyl]cyclopropaneacetic  acid, monosodium salt. The empirical formula is CHClNNaOS, and its molecular weight is 608.18. The structural formula is:   Montelukast sodium, USP is a hygroscopic, optically active, white to off-white powder. Montelukast sodium is freely soluble in ethanol, methanol, and water and practically insoluble in acetonitrile. Each 10-mg film-coated montelukast tablet contains 10.4 mg montelukast sodium, USP which is equivalent to 10 mg of montelukast, and the following inactive ingredients: microcrystalline cellulose, lactose monohydrate, croscarmellose sodium, hydroxypropyl cellulose, disodium edetate and magnesium stearate. The film coating consists of: hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, hydroxypropyl cellulose, titanium dioxide, red ferric oxide and yellow ferric oxide. The cysteinyl leukotrienes (LTC, LTD, LTE) are products of arachidonic acid metabolism and are released from various cells, including mast cells and eosinophils. These eicosanoids bind to cysteinyl leukotriene (CysLT) receptors. The CysLT type-1 (CysLT) receptor is found in the human airway (including airway smooth muscle cells and airway macrophages) and on other pro-inflammatory cells (including eosinophils and certain myeloid stem cells). CysLTs have been correlated with the pathophysiology of asthma and allergic rhinitis. In asthma, leukotriene-mediated effects include airway edema, smooth muscle contraction, and altered cellular activity associated with the inflammatory process. In allergic rhinitis, CysLTs are released from the nasal mucosa after allergen exposure during both early- and late-phase reactions and are associated with symptoms of allergic rhinitis. Montelukast is an orally active compound that binds with high affinity and selectivity to the CysLT receptor (in preference to other pharmacologically important airway receptors, such as the prostanoid, cholinergic, or β-adrenergic receptor). Montelukast inhibits physiologic actions of LTD at the CysLT receptor without any agonist activity. Montelukast causes inhibition of airway cysteinyl leukotriene receptors as demonstrated by the ability to inhibit bronchoconstriction due to inhaled LTD in asthmatics. Doses as low as 5 mg cause substantial blockage of LTD-induced bronchoconstriction. In a placebo-controlled, crossover study (n=12), montelukast sodium inhibited early- and late-phase bronchoconstriction due to antigen challenge by 75% and 57%, respectively. The effect of montelukast sodium on eosinophils in the peripheral blood was examined in clinical trials. In patients with asthma aged 2 years and older who received montelukast, a decrease in mean peripheral blood eosinophil counts ranging from 9% to 15% was noted, compared with placebo, over the double-blind treatment periods. In patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis aged 15 years and older who received montelukast sodium, a mean increase of 0.2% in peripheral blood eosinophil counts was noted, compared with a mean increase of 12.5% in placebo-treated patients, over the double-blind treatment periods; this reflects a mean difference of 12.3% in favor of montelukast sodium. The relationship between these observations and the clinical benefits of montelukast noted in the clinical trials is not known [see ]. Montelukast is rapidly absorbed following oral administration. After administration of the 10-mg film-coated tablet to fasted adults, the mean peak montelukast plasma concentration (C) is achieved in 3 to 4 hours (T). The mean oral bioavailability is 64%. The oral bioavailability and C are not influenced by a standard meal in the morning.The safety and efficacy of montelukast in patients with asthma were demonstrated in clinical trials in which the 10-mg film-coated tablet formulation was administered in the evening without regard to the time of food ingestion. The safety and efficacy of montelukast in patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis were demonstrated in clinical trials in which the 10-mg film-coated tablet was administered in the morning or evening without regard to the time of food ingestion. The comparative pharmacokinetics of montelukast when administered as two 5-mg chewable tablets versus one 10-mg film-coated tablet have not been evaluated. Montelukast is more than 99% bound to plasma proteins. The steady state volume of distribution of montelukast averages 8 to 11 liters. Orally administered montelukast distributes into the brain in rats. Montelukast is extensively metabolized. In studies with therapeutic doses, plasma concentrations of metabolites of montelukast are undetectable at steady state in adults and pediatric patients. studies using human liver microsomes indicate that CYP3A4, 2C8, and 2C9 are involved in the metabolism of montelukast. At clinically relevant concentrations, 2C8 appears to play a major role in the metabolism of montelukast. The plasma clearance of montelukast averages 45 mL/min in healthy adults. Following an oral dose of radiolabeled montelukast, 86% of the radioactivity was recovered in 5-day fecal collections and <0.2% was recovered in urine. Coupled with estimates of montelukast oral bioavailability, this indicates that montelukast and its metabolites are excreted almost exclusively via the bile. In several studies, the mean plasma half-life of montelukast ranged from 2.7 to 5.5 hours in healthy young adults. The pharmacokinetics of montelukast are nearly linear for oral doses up to 50 mg. During once-daily dosing with 10-mg montelukast, there is little accumulation of the parent drug in plasma (14%). : Patients with mild-to-moderate hepatic insufficiency and clinical evidence of cirrhosis had evidence of decreased metabolism of montelukast resulting in 41% (90% CI=7%, 85%) higher mean montelukast AUC following a single 10-mg dose. The elimination of montelukast was slightly prolonged compared with that in healthy subjects (mean half-life, 7.4 hours). No dosage adjustment is required in patients with mild-to-moderate hepatic insufficiency. The pharmacokinetics of montelukast in patients with more severe hepatic impairment or with hepatitis have not been evaluated. : Since montelukast and its metabolites are not excreted in the urine, the pharmacokinetics of montelukast were not evaluated in patients with renal insufficiency. No dosage adjustment is recommended in these patients. r: The pharmacokinetics of montelukast are similar in males and females. : Pharmacokinetic differences due to race have not been studied. : Pharmacokinetic studies evaluated the systemic exposure of the 10-mg film-coated tablets in young adults and adolescents ≥ 15 years of age. The plasma concentration profile of montelukast following administration of the 10-mg film-coated tablet is similar in adolescents ≥ 15 years of age and young adults. The 10-mg film-coated tablet is recommended for use in patients ≥ 15 years of age. : Montelukast sodium has been administered with other therapies routinely used in the prophylaxis and chronic treatment of asthma with no apparent increase in adverse reactions. In drug-interaction studies, the recommended clinical dose of montelukast did not have clinically important effects on the pharmacokinetics of the following drugs: theophylline, prednisone, and prednisolone. Montelukast at a dose of 10 mg once daily dosed to pharmacokinetic steady state, did not cause clinically significant changes in the kinetics of a single intravenous dose of theophylline [predominantly a cytochrome P450 (CYP) 1A2 substrate]. Montelukast at doses of ≥ 100 mg daily dosed to pharmacokinetic steady state, did not cause any clinically significant change in plasma profiles of prednisone or prednisolone following administration of either oral prednisone or intravenous prednisolone. Oral Contraceptives, Terfenadine, Digoxin, and Warfarin: In drug interaction studies, the recommended clinical dose of montelukast did not have clinically important effects on the pharmacokinetics of the following drugs: oral contraceptives (norethindrone 1 mg/ethinyl estradiol 35 mcg), terfenadine, digoxin, and warfarin. Montelukast at doses of ≥ 100 mg daily dosed to pharmacokinetic steady state did not significantly alter the plasma concentrations of either component of an oral contraceptive containing norethindrone 1 mg/ ethinyl estradiol 35 mcg. Montelukast at a dose of 10 mg once daily dosed to pharmacokinetic steady state did not change the plasma concentration profile of terfenadine (a substrate of CYP3A4) or fexofenadine, the carboxylated metabolite, and did not prolong the QTc interval following co-administration with terfenadine 60 mg twice daily; did not change the pharmacokinetic profile or urinary excretion of immunoreactive digoxin; did not change the pharmacokinetic profile of warfarin (primarily a substrate of CYP2C9, 3A4 and 1A2) or influence the effect of a single 30-mg oral dose of warfarin on prothrombin time or the International Normalized Ratio (INR). Thyroid Hormones, Sedative Hypnotics, Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Benzodiazepines, and Decongestants: Although additional specific interaction studies were not performed, montelukast was used concomitantly with a wide range of commonly prescribed drugs in clinical studies without evidence of clinical adverse interactions. These medications included thyroid hormones, sedative hypnotics, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents, benzodiazepines, and decongestants. : Phenobarbital, which induces hepatic metabolism, decreased the area under the plasma concentration curve (AUC) of montelukast approximately 40% following a single 10-mg dose of montelukast. No dosage adjustment for montelukast sodium is recommended. It is reasonable to employ appropriate clinical monitoring when potent CYP enzyme inducers, such as phenobarbital or rifampin, are co-administered with montelukast sodium. Effect of Montelukast on Cytochrome P450 (CYP) Enzymes: Montelukast is a potent inhibitor of CYP2C8 . However, data from a clinical drug-drug interaction study involving montelukast and rosiglitazone (a probe substrate representative of drugs primarily metabolized by CYP2C8) in 12 healthy individuals demonstrated that the pharmacokinetics of rosiglitazone are not altered when the drugs are coadministered, indicating that montelukast does not inhibit CYP2C8 . Therefore, montelukast is not anticipated to alter the metabolism of drugs metabolized by this enzyme (e.g., paclitaxel, rosiglitazone, and repaglinide). Based on further in vitro results in human liver microsomes, therapeutic plasma concentrations of montelukast do not inhibit CYP 3A4, 2C9, 1A2, 2A6, 2C19, or 2D6. studies have shown that montelukast is a substrate of CYP 2C8, 2C9, and 3A4. Co-administration of montelukast with itraconazole, a strong CYP 3A4 inhibitor, resulted in no significant increase in the systemic exposure of montelukast. Data from a clinical drug-drug interaction study involving montelukast and gemfibrozil (an inhibitor of both CYP 2C8 and 2C9) demonstrated that gemfibrozil, at a therapeutic dose, increased the systemic exposure of montelukast by 4.4-fold. Co-administration of itraconazole, gemfibrozil, and montelukast did not further increase the systemic exposure of montelukast. Based on available clinical experience, no dosage adjustment of montelukast is required upon co-administration with gemfibrozil []. 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility No evidence of tumorigenicity was seen in carcinogenicity studies of either 2 years in Sprague-Dawley rats or 92 weeks in mice at oral gavage doses up to 200 mg/kg/day or 100 mg/kg/day, respectively. The estimated exposure in rats was approximately 120 and 75 times the AUC for adults and children, respectively, at the maximum recommended daily oral dose. The estimated exposure in mice was approximately 45 and 25 times the AUC for adults and children, respectively, at the maximum recommended daily oral dose.Montelukast demonstrated no evidence of mutagenic or clastogenic activity in the following assays: the microbial mutagenesis assay, the V-79 mammalian cell mutagenesis assay, the alkaline elution assay in rat hepatocytes, the chromosomal aberration assay in Chinese hamster ovary cells, and in the mouse bone marrow chromosomal aberration assay.In fertility studies in female rats, montelukast produced reductions in fertility and fecundity indices at an oral dose of 200 mg/kg (estimated exposure was approximately 70 times the AUC for adults at the maximum recommended daily oral dose). No effects on female fertility or fecundity were observed at an oral dose of 100 mg/kg (estimated exposure was approximately 20 times the AUC for adults at the maximum recommended daily oral dose). Montelukast had no effects on fertility in male rats at oral doses up to 800 mg/kg (estimated exposure was approximately 160 times the AUC for adults at the maximum recommended daily oral dose). Adults and Adolescents 15 Years of Age and Older with Asthma Clinical trials in adults and adolescents 15 years of age and older demonstrated there is no additional clinical benefit to montelukast doses above 10 mg once daily. The efficacy of montelukast sodium for the chronic treatment of asthma in adults and adolescents 15 years of age and older was demonstrated in two (U.S. and Multinational) similarly designed, randomized, 12-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials in 1576 patients (795 treated with montelukast sodium, 530 treated with placebo, and 251 treated with active control). The median age was 33 years (range 15 to 85); 56.8% were females and 43.2% were males. The ethnic/racial distribution in these studies was 71.6% Caucasian, 17.7% Hispanic, 7.2% other origins and 3.5% Black. Patients had mild or moderate asthma and were non-smokers who required approximately 5 puffs of inhaled β-agonist per day on an “as-needed” basis. The patients had a mean baseline percent of predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV) of 66% (approximate range, 40 to 90%). The co-primary endpoints in these trials were FEV and daytime asthma symptoms. In both studies after 12 weeks, a random subset of patients receiving montelukast sodium was switched to placebo for an additional 3 weeks of double-blind treatment to evaluate for possible rebound effects. The results of the U.S. trial on the primary endpoint, morning FEV, expressed as mean percent change from baseline averaged over the 12-week treatment period, are shown in FIGURE 2. Compared with placebo, treatment with one montelukast sodium 10-mg tablet daily in the evening resulted in a statistically significant increase in FEV percent change from baseline (13.0%-change in the group treated with montelukast sodium vs. 4.2%-change in the placebo group, p<0.001); the change from baseline in FEV for montelukast sodium was 0.32 liters compared with 0.10 liters for placebo, corresponding to a between-group difference of 0.22 liters (p<0.001, 95% CI 0.17 liters, 0.27 liters). The results of the Multinational trial on FEV were similar. FIGURE 2: FEV Mean Percent Change from Baseline (U.S. Trial: Montelukast Sodium N=406; Placebo N=270) (ANOVA The effect of montelukast sodium on other primary and secondary endpoints, represented by the Multinational study is shown in TABLE 2. Results on these endpoints were similar in the US study. TABLE 2: Effect of Montelukast sodium on Primary and Secondary Endpoints in a Multinational Placebo-controlled Trial (ANOVA Model)  Both studies evaluated the effect of montelukast sodium on secondary outcomes, including asthma attack (utilization of health-care resources such as an unscheduled visit to a doctor's office, emergency room, or hospital; or treatment with oral, intravenous, or intramuscular corticosteroid), and use of oral corticosteroids for asthma rescue. In the Multinational study, significantly fewer patients (15.6% of patients) on montelukast sodium experienced asthma attacks compared with patients on placebo (27.3%, p < 0.001). In the US study, 7.8% of patients on montelukast sodium and 10.3% of patients on placebo experienced asthma attacks, but the difference between the two treatment groups was not significant (p = 0.334). In the Multinational study, significantly fewer patients (14.8% of patients) on montelukast sodium were prescribed oral corticosteroids for asthma rescue compared with patients on placebo (25.7%, p < 0.001). In the US study, 6.9% of patients on montelukast sodium and 9.9% of patients on placebo were prescribed oral corticosteroids for asthma rescue, but the difference between the two treatment groups was not significant (p = 0.196). In each placebo-controlled trial in adults, the treatment effect of montelukast sodium, measured by daily diary card parameters, including symptom scores, “as-needed” ß-agonist use, and PEFR measurements, was achieved after the first dose and was maintained throughout the dosing interval (24 hours). No significant change in treatment effect was observed during continuous once-daily evening administration in non-placebo-controlled extension trials for up to one year. Withdrawal of montelukast sodium in asthmatic patients after 12 weeks of continuous use did not cause rebound worsening of asthma.   Effects in Patients on Concomitant Inhaled Corticosteroids Separate trials in adults evaluated the ability of montelukast sodium to add to the clinical effect of inhaled corticosteroids and to allow inhaled corticosteroid tapering when used concomitantly. One randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trial (n=226) enrolled adults with stable asthma with a mean FEV of approximately 84% of predicted who were previously maintained on various inhaled corticosteroids (delivered by metered-dose aerosol or dry powder inhalers). The median age was 41.5 years (range 16 to 70); 52.2% were females and 47.8% were males. The ethnic/racial distribution in this study was 92.0% Caucasian, 3.5% Black, 2.2% Hispanic, and 2.2% Asian. The types of inhaled corticosteroids and their mean baseline requirements included beclomethasone dipropionate (mean dose, 1203 mcg/day), triamcinolone acetonide (mean dose, 2004 mcg/day), flunisolide (mean dose, 1971 mcg/day), fluticasone propionate (mean dose, 1083 mcg/day), or budesonide (mean dose, 1192 mcg/day). Some of these inhaled corticosteroids were non-U.S.-approved formulations, and doses expressed may not be ex-actuator. The pre-study inhaled corticosteroid requirements were reduced by approximately 37% during a 5- to 7-week placebo run-in period designed to titrate patients toward their lowest effective inhaled corticosteroid dose. Treatment with montelukast sodium resulted in a further 47% reduction in mean inhaled corticosteroid dose compared with a mean reduction of 30% in the placebo group over the 12-week active treatment period (p ≤ 0.05). It is not known whether the results of this study can be generalized to patients with asthma who require higher doses of inhaled corticosteroids or systemic corticosteroids. In another randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trial (n=642) in a similar population of adult patients previously maintained, but not adequately controlled, on inhaled corticosteroids (beclomethasone 336 mcg/day), the addition of  montelukast sodium to beclomethasone resulted in statistically significant improvements in FEV1 compared with those patients who were continued on beclomethasone alone or those patients who were withdrawn from beclomethasone and treated with montelukast sodium or placebo alone over the last 10 weeks of the 16-week, blinded treatment period. Patients who were randomized to treatment arms containing beclomethasone had statistically significantly better asthma control than those patients randomized to montelukast alone or placebo alone as indicated by FEV, daytime asthma symptoms, PEFR, nocturnal awakenings due to asthma, and “as-needed” ß-agonist requirements. In adult patients with asthma with documented aspirin sensitivity, nearly all of whom were receiving concomitant inhaled and/or oral corticosteroids, a 4-week, randomized, parallel-group trial (n=80) demonstrated that montelukast sodium, compared with placebo, resulted in significant improvement in parameters of asthma control. The magnitude of effect of montelukast sodium in aspirin-sensitive patients was similar to the effect observed in the general population of asthma patients studied. The effect of montelukast sodium on the bronchoconstrictor response to aspirin or other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in aspirin-sensitive asthmatic patients has not been evaluated [see ]. Exercise-Induced Bronchoconstriction(Adults and Adolescents 15 years of age and older) The efficacy of montelukast sodium, 10 mg, when given as a single dose 2 hours before exercise for the prevention of EIB was investigated in three (U.S. and Multinational), randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover studies that included a total of 160 adult and adolescent patients 15 years of age and older with EIB. Exercise challenge testing was conducted at 2 hours, 8.5 or 12 hours, and 24 hours following administration of a single dose of study drug (montelukast 10 mg or placebo). The primary endpoint was the mean maximum percent fall in FEV following the 2 hours post-dose exercise challenge in all three studies (Study A, Study B, and Study C). In Study A, a single dose of montelukast sodium 10 mg demonstrated a statistically significant protective benefit against EIB when taken 2 hours prior to exercise. Some patients were protected from EIB at 8.5 and 24 hours after administration; however, some patients were not. The results for the mean maximum percent fall at each timepoint in Study A are shown in TABLE 3 and are representative of the results from the other two studies. TABLE 3: Mean Maximum Percent Fall in FEV Following Exercise Challenge in Study A (N=47) ANOVA Model *Least squares-mean The efficacy of montelukast for prevention of EIB in patients below 6 years of age has not been established. Daily administration of montelukast for the chronic treatment of asthma has not been established to prevent acute episodes of EIB. In a 12-week, randomized, double-blind, parallel group study of 110 adult and adolescent asthmatics 15 years of age and older, with a mean baseline FEV percent of predicted of 83% and with documented exercise-induced exacerbation of asthma, treatment with montelukast sodium, 10 mg, once daily in the evening, resulted in a statistically significant reduction in mean maximal percent fall in FEV and mean time to recovery to within 5% of the pre-exercise FEV. Exercise challenge was conducted at the end of the dosing interval (i.e., 20 to 24 hours after the preceding dose). This effect was maintained throughout the 12-week treatment period indicating that tolerance did not occur. Montelukast sodium did not, however, prevent clinically significant deterioration in maximal percent fall in FEV after exercise (i.e., ≥ 20% decrease from pre-exercise baseline) in 52% of patients studied. In a separate crossover study in adults, a similar effect was observed after two once-daily 10-mg doses of montelukast sodium. The efficacy of montelukast sodium tablets for the treatment of seasonal allergic rhinitis was investigated in 5 similarly designed, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo- and active-controlled (loratadine) trials conducted in North America. The 5 trials enrolled a total of 5029 patients, of whom 1799 were treated with montelukast sodium tablets. Patients were 15 to 82 years of age with a history of seasonal allergic rhinitis, a positive skin test to at least one relevant seasonal allergen, and active symptoms of seasonal allergic rhinitis at study entry. The period of randomized treatment was 2 weeks in 4 trials and 4 weeks in one trial. The primary outcome variable was mean change from baseline in daytime nasal symptoms score (the average of individual scores of nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, nasal itching, sneezing) as assessed by patients on a 0-3 categorical scale. Four of the five trials showed a significant reduction in daytime nasal symptoms scores with montelukast sodium 10-mg tablets compared with placebo. The results of one trial are shown below. The median age in this trial was 35.0 years (range 15 to 81); 65.4% were females and 34.6% were males. The ethnic/racial distribution in this study was 83.1% Caucasian, 6.4% other origins, 5.8% Black, and 4.8% Hispanic. The mean changes from baseline in daytime nasal symptoms score in the treatment groups that received montelukast tablets, loratadine, and placebo are shown in TABLE 5. The remaining three trials that demonstrated efficacy showed similar results. TABLE 5: Effects of Montelukast on Daytime Nasal Symptoms Score* in a Placebo- and Active-controlled Trial in Patients with Seasonal Allergic Rhinitis (ANCOVA Model) * Average of individual scores of nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, nasal itching, sneezing as assessed by patients on a 0-3 categorical scale. † Statistically different from placebo (p≤0.001). ‡ The study was not designed for statistical comparison between montelukast sodium and the active control (loratadine). The efficacy of montelukast sodium tablets for the treatment of perennial allergic rhinitis was investigated in 2 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies conducted in North America and Europe. The two studies enrolled a total of 3357 patients, of whom 1632 received montelukast sodium 10-mg tablets. Patients 15 to 82 years of age with perennial allergic rhinitis as confirmed by history and a positive skin test to at least one relevant perennial allergen (dust mites, animal dander, and/or mold spores), who had active symptoms at the time of study entry, were enrolled. In the study in which efficacy was demonstrated, the median age was 35 years (range 15 to 81); 64.1% were females and 35.9% were males. The ethnic/racial distribution in this study was 83.2% Caucasian, 8.1% Black, 5.4% Hispanic, 2.3% Asian, and 1.0% other origins. Montelukast sodium 10-mg tablets once daily was shown to significantly reduce symptoms of perennial allergic rhinitis over a 6-week treatment period (TABLE 6); in this study the primary outcome variable was mean change from baseline in daytime nasal symptoms score (the average of individual scores of nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, and sneezing). TABLE 6: Effects of Montelukast Sodium on Daytime Nasal Symptoms Score* in a Placebo-controlled Trial in Patients with Perennial Allergic Rhinitis (ANCOVA Model)    * Average of individual scores of nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, sneezing as assessed by patients on a 0-3 categorical scale. †Statistically different from placebo (p ≤ 0.001). The other 6-week study evaluated montelukast 10 mg (n=626), placebo (n=609), and an active-control (cetirizine 10 mg; n=120). The primary analysis compared the mean change from baseline in daytime nasal symptoms score for montelukast vs. placebo over the first 4 weeks of treatment; the study was not designed for statistical comparison between montelukast sodium and the active-control. The primary outcome variable included nasal itching in addition to nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, and sneezing. The estimated difference between montelukast sodium and placebo was -0.04 with a 95% CI of (-0.09, 0.01).

The typesof events reported were highly variable, and included, but were not limited to, agitation, aggression, depression, sleep disturbances, suicidal thoughts and behavior (including suicide). The mechanisms underlying NP events associated with montelukast sodium tablets use are currently not well understood []. Because of the risk of NP events, the benefits of montelukast sodium tablets may not outweigh the risks in somepatients, particularly when the symptoms of disease may be mild and adequately treated with alternative therapies. Reserve use of montelukast sodium tablets for patients with allergic rhinitis who have an inadequate response or intolerance to alternative therapies [)]. In patients with asthma or exercise-induced bronchoconstriction, consider the benefits and risksbefore prescribing montelukast sodium tablets. Discuss the benefits and risks of montelukast sodium tablets with patients and caregivers when prescribing montelukast sodium tablets. Advise patients and/or caregivers to be alert for changes in behavior or new NP symptoms when taking montelukast sodium tablets. If changes in behavior are observed, or if new NP symptomsor suicidal thoughts and/or behavior occur, advise patients to discontinue montelukast sodium tablets and contact a healthcare provider immediately []. Montelukast sodium tablets are indicated for the prophylaxis and chronic treatment of asthma in patients 15 years of age and older. Montelukast sodium tablets are indicated for prevention of exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (EIB) in patients 15 years of age and older. Montelukast sodium tablets are  indicated for the relief of symptoms of seasonal allergic rhinitis in patients 15 years of age and older and perennial allergic rhinitis in patients 15 years of age and older. Because the benefits of montelukast sodium tablets may not outweigh the risk of neuropsychiatric symptoms in patients with allergic reserve use for patients who have an inadequate response or intolerance to alternative therapies.  Montelukast sodium should be taken once daily in the evening. The following dose is are recommended: For adults and adolescents 15 years of age and older: one 10-mg tablet. Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients less than 12 months of age with asthma have not been established. Patients who miss a dose should take the next dose at their regular time and should not take 2 doses at the same time. There have been no clinical trials in patients with asthma to evaluate the relative efficacy of morning versus evening dosing. The pharmacokinetics of montelukast are similar whether dosed in the morning or evening. Efficacy has been demonstrated for asthma when montelukast was administered in the evening without regard to time of food ingestion. For prevention of EIB, a single 10 mg dose of montelukast should be taken at least 2 hours before exercise. The following dose is recommended : For adults and adolescents 15 years of age and older: one 10-mg tablet. An additional dose of montelukast should not be taken within 24 hours of a previous dose. Patients already taking montelukast sodium daily for another indication (including chronic asthma) should not take an additional dose to prevent EIB. All patients should have available for rescue a short-acting ß-agonist. Safety and efficacy in patients younger than 15 years of age have not been established. Daily administration of montelukast sodium for the chronic treatment of asthma has not been established to prevent acute episodes of EIB. allergic rhinitis when montelukast was administered in the morning or the evening without regard to time of food ingestion. The time of administration may be individualized to suit patient needs. The following dose for the treatment of symptoms of seasonal allergic rhinitis are recommended: For adults and adolescents 15 years of age and older: one 10-mg tablet. Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients younger than 2 years of age with seasonal allergic rhinitis have not been established. The following dose for the treatment of symptoms of perennial allergic rhinitis are recommended: For adults and adolescents 15 years of age and older: one 10-mg tablet.  Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients younger than 6 months of age with perennial allergic rhinitis have not been established. Patients who miss a dose should take the next dose at their regular time and should not take 2 doses at the same time. Patients with both asthma and allergic rhinitis should take only one montelukast sodium dose daily in the evening. Patients who miss a dose should take the next dose at their regular time and should not take 2 doses at the same time. Montelukast sodium Film-Coated Tablets, 10 mg are beige, rounded square-shaped biconvex tablets, debossed 'CL 26' on one side of the tablet and having plain surface on other side. Hypersensitivity to any component of this product. Serious neuropsychiatric (NP) events have been reported with use of montelukast sodium. These postmarketing reports have been highly variable and included, but were not limited to, agitation, aggressive behavior or hostility, anxiousness, depression, disorientation, disturbance in attention, dream abnormalities, dysphemia (stuttering), hallucinations, insomnia, irritability, memory impairment, obsessive-compulsive symptoms, restlessness, somnambulism, suicidal thoughts and behavior (including suicide), tic, and tremor. NP events have been reported in adult, adolescent, and pediatric patients with and without a previous history of psychiatric disorder. NP events have been reported mostly during montelukast sodium treatment, but some were reported after montelukast sodium discontinuation. Animal studies showed that montelukast distributes into the brain in rats []; however, the mechanisms underlying montelukast sodium-associated NP events are currently not well understood. Based upon the available data, it is difficult to identify risk factors for or quantify the risk of NP events with montelukast sodium use. Because of the risk of NP events, the benefits of montelukast sodium may not outweigh the risks in some patients, particularly when the symptoms of disease may be mild and adequately treated with alternative therapies. Reserve use of montelukast sodium for patients with allergic rhinitis who have an inadequate response or intolerance to alternative therapies []. In patients with asthma or exercise-induced bronchoconstriction, consider the benefits and risks before prescribing montelukast sodium. Discuss the benefits and risks of montelukast sodium use with patients and caregivers when prescribing montelukast sodium. Advise patients and/or caregivers to be alert for changes in behavior or for new NP symptoms when taking montelukast sodium. If changes in behavior are observed, or if new NP symptoms or suicidal thoughts and/or behavior occur, advise patients to discontinue montelukast sodium and contact a healthcare provider immediately. In many cases, symptoms resolved after stopping montelukast sodium therapy; however, in some cases symptoms persisted after discontinuation of montelukast sodium. Therefore, continue to monitor and provide supportive care until symptoms resolve. Re-evaluate the benefits and risks of restarting treatment with montelukast sodium if such events occur. Montelukast sodium is not indicated for use in the reversal of bronchospasm in acute asthma attacks, including status asthmaticus. Patients should be advised to have appropriate rescue medication available. Therapy with montelukast sodium can be continued during acute exacerbations of asthma. Patients who have exacerbations of asthma after exercise should have available for rescue a short-acting inhaled β-agonist. While the dose of inhaled corticosteroid may be reduced gradually under medical supervision, montelukast sodium should not be abruptly substituted for inhaled or oral corticosteroids. Patients with known aspirin sensitivity should continue avoidance of aspirin or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents while taking montelukast sodium. Although montelukast sodium is effective in improving airway function in asthmatics with documented aspirin sensitivity, it has not been shown to truncate bronchoconstrictor response to aspirin and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in aspirin-sensitive asthmatic patients Patients with asthma on therapy with montelukast sodium may present with systemic eosinophilia, sometimes presenting with clinical features of vasculitis consistent with Churg-Strauss syndrome, a condition which is often treated with systemic corticosteroid therapy. These events have been sometimes associated with the reduction of oral corticosteroid therapy. Physicians should be alert to eosinophilia, vasculitic rash, worsening pulmonary symptoms, cardiac complications, and/or neuropathy presenting in their patients. A causal association between montelukast sodium and these underlying conditions has not been established Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice. In the following description of clinical trials experience, adverse reactions are listed regardless of causality assessment. The most common adverse reactions (incidence ≥5% and greater than placebo; listed in descending order of frequency) in controlled clinical trials were: upper respiratory infection, fever, headache, pharyngitis, cough, abdominal pain, diarrhea, otitis media, influenza, rhinorrhea, sinusitis, otitis. Adults and Adolescents 15 Years of Age and Older with Asthma Montelukast sodium has been evaluated for safety in approximately 2950 adult and adolescent patients 15 years of age and older in clinical trials. In placebo-controlled clinical trials, the following adverse experiences reported with montelukast occurred in greater than or equal to 1% of patients and at an incidence greater than that in patients treated with placebo: TABLE 1: Adverse Experiences Occurring in ≥1% of Patients with an Incidence Greater than that in Patients Treated with Placebo Number of patients tested (montelukast sodium and placebo, respectively): ALT and AST, 1935, 1170; pyuria, 1924, 1159. Montelukast 10 mg/day (%) (n=1955) The frequency of less common adverse events was comparable between montelukast sodium and placebo. The safety profile of montelukast sodium, when administered as a single dose for prevention of EIB in adult and adolescent patients 15 years of age and older, was consistent with the safety profile previously described for montelukast sodium. Cumulatively, 569 patients were treated with montelukast sodium for at least 6 months, 480 for one year, and 49 for two years in clinical trials. With prolonged treatment, the adverse experience profile did not significantly change.   Adults and Adolescents 15 Years of Age and Older with Seasonal Allergic Rhinitis Montelukast sodium has been evaluated for safety in 2199 adult and adolescent patients 15 years of age and older in clinical trials. Montelukast sodium administered once daily in the morning or in the evening had a safety profile similar to that of placebo. In placebo-controlled clinical trials, the following event was reported with montelukast sodium with a frequency ≥ 1% and at an incidence greater than placebo: upper respiratory infection, 1.9% of patients receiving montelukast sodium vs. 1.5% of patients receiving placebo. In a 4-week, placebo-controlled clinical study, the safety profile was consistent with that observed in 2-week studies. The incidence of somnolence was similar to that of placebo in all studies.   Adults and Adolescents 15 Years of Age and Older with Perennial Allergic Rhinitis Montelukast sodium has been evaluated for safety in 3357 adult and adolescent patients 15 years of age and older with perennial allergic rhinitis of whom 1632 received montelukast sodium in two, 6-week, clinical studies. Montelukast sodium administered once daily had a safety profile consistent with that observed in patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis and similar to that of placebo. In these two studies, the following events were reported with montelukast sodium with a frequency ≥ 1% and at an incidence greater than placebo: sinusitis, upper respiratory infection, sinus headache, cough, epistaxis, and increased ALT. The incidence of somnolence was similar to that of placebo. The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of montelukast sodium. Because these reactions are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure. Blood and lymphatic system disorders: increased bleeding tendency, thrombocytopenia. Immune system disorders: hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis, hepatic eosinophilic infiltration. Psychiatric disorders: including, but not limited to, agitation, aggressive behavior or hostility, anxiousness, depression, disorientation, disturbance in attention, dream abnormalities, dysphemia (stuttering),  hallucinations, insomnia, irritability, memory impairment, obsessive-compulsive symptoms, restlessness, somnambulism, suicidal thinking and behavior (including suicide), tic, and tremor [see Boxed Warning, Warnings and Precautions ()] Nervous system disorders: drowsiness, paraesthesia/hypoesthesia, seizures. Cardiac disorders: palpitations. Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders: epistaxis, pulmonary eosinophilia. Gastrointestinal disorders: diarrhea, dyspepsia, nausea, pancreatitis, vomiting. Hepatobiliary disorders: Cases of cholestatic hepatitis, hepatocellular liver-injury, and mixed-pattern liver injury have been reported in patients treated with montelukast sodium. Most of these occurred in combination with other confounding factors, such as use of other medications, or when montelukast sodium was administered to patients who had underlying potential for liver disease such as alcohol use or other forms of hepatitis. Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: angioedema, bruising, erythema multiforme, erythema nodosum,pruritus, Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis, urticaria. Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders: arthralgia, myalgia including muscle cramps. Renal and urinary disorders: enuresis in children. General disorders and administration site conditions: edema. Patients with asthma on therapy with montelukast sodium may present with systemic eosinophilia, sometimes presenting with clinical features of vasculitis consistent with Churg-Strauss syndrome, a condition which is often treated with systemic corticosteroid therapy. These events have been sometimes associated with the reduction of oral corticosteroid therapy. Physicians should be alert to eosinophilia, vasculitic rash, worsening pulmonary symptoms, cardiac complications, and/or neuropathy presenting in their patients No dose adjustment is needed when montelukast sodium is co-administered with theophylline, prednisone, prednisolone, oral contraceptives, terfenadine, digoxin, warfarin, gemfibrozil, itraconazole, thyroid hormones, sedative hypnotics, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents, benzodiazepines, decongestants, and Cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme inducers [see ]. Available data from published prospective and retrospective cohort studies over decades with montelukast use in pregnant women have not established a drug-associated risk of major birth defects []. In animal reproduction studies, no adverse developmental  effects were observed with oral administration of montelukast to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis at doses approximately 100 and 110 times, respectively, the maximum recommended human daily oral dose (MRHDOD) based on AUCs . The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. All pregnancies have a background risk of birth defect, loss, or other adverse outcomes. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2-4% and 15-20%, respectively. Disease-associated maternal and/or embryo/fetal risk Poorly or moderately controlled asthma in pregnancy increases the maternal risk of perinatal adverse outcomes such as preeclampsia and infant prematurity, low birth weight, and small for gestational age. Published data from prospective and retrospective cohort studies have not identified an association with montelukast sodium use during pregnancy and major birth defects. Available studies have methodologic limitations, including small sample size, in some cases retrospective data collection, and inconsistent comparator groups. In embryo-fetal development studies, montelukast administered to pregnant rats and rabbits during organogenesis (gestation days 6 to 17 in rats and 6 to 18 in rabbits) did not cause any adverse developmental effects at maternal oral doses up to 400 and 300 mg/kg/day in rats and rabbits, respectively (approximately 100 and 110 times the AUC in humans at the MRHDOD, respectively). A published clinical lactation study reports the presence of montelukast in human milk. Data available on the effects of the drug on infants, either directly [] or through breast milk, do not suggest a significant risk of adverse events from exposure to montelukast sodium. The effects of the drug on milk production are unknown. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother’s clinical need for montelukast sodium and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from montelukast sodium or from the underlying maternal condition. The safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients below the age of 12 months with asthma, 6 months with perennial allergic rhinitis, and 6 years with exercise-induced bronchoconstriction have not been established. Of the total number of subjects in clinical studies of montelukast, 3.5% were 65 years of age and over, and 0.4% were 75 years of age and over. No overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects, and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients, but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out. The pharmacokinetic profile and the oral bioavailability of a single 10-mg oral dose of montelukast are similar in elderly and younger adults. The plasma half-life of montelukast is slightly longer in the elderly. No dosage adjustment in the elderly is required. No dosage adjustment is required in patients with mild-to-moderate hepatic insufficiency [see ]. No dosage adjustment is recommended in patients with renal insufficiency [see ]. No specific information is available on the treatment of overdosage with montelukast sodium. In the event of overdose, it is reasonable to employ the usual supportive measures; e.g., remove unabsorbed material from the gastrointestinal tract, employ clinical monitoring, and institute supportive therapy, if required. It is not known whether montelukast is removed by peritoneal dialysis or hemodialysis. Montelukast sodium,  USP the active ingredient in montelukast sodium tablets, is a selective and orally active leukotriene receptor antagonist that inhibits the cysteinyl leukotriene CysLT receptor. Montelukast sodium, USP is described chemically as [R-(E)]-1-[[[1-[3-[2-(7-chloro-2-quinolinyl)ethenyl] phenyl]-3-[2-(1-hydroxy-1-methylethyl)phenyl] propyl]thio]methyl]cyclopropaneacetic  acid, monosodium salt. The empirical formula is CHClNNaOS, and its molecular weight is 608.18. The structural formula is:   Montelukast sodium, USP is a hygroscopic, optically active, white to off-white powder. Montelukast sodium is freely soluble in ethanol, methanol, and water and practically insoluble in acetonitrile. Each 10-mg film-coated montelukast tablet contains 10.4 mg montelukast sodium, USP which is equivalent to 10 mg of montelukast, and the following inactive ingredients: microcrystalline cellulose, lactose monohydrate, croscarmellose sodium, hydroxypropyl cellulose, disodium edetate and magnesium stearate. The film coating consists of: hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, hydroxypropyl cellulose, titanium dioxide, red ferric oxide and yellow ferric oxide. The cysteinyl leukotrienes (LTC, LTD, LTE) are products of arachidonic acid metabolism and are released from various cells, including mast cells and eosinophils. These eicosanoids bind to cysteinyl leukotriene (CysLT) receptors. The CysLT type-1 (CysLT) receptor is found in the human airway (including airway smooth muscle cells and airway macrophages) and on other pro-inflammatory cells (including eosinophils and certain myeloid stem cells). CysLTs have been correlated with the pathophysiology of asthma and allergic rhinitis. In asthma, leukotriene-mediated effects include airway edema, smooth muscle contraction, and altered cellular activity associated with the inflammatory process. In allergic rhinitis, CysLTs are released from the nasal mucosa after allergen exposure during both early- and late-phase reactions and are associated with symptoms of allergic rhinitis. Montelukast is an orally active compound that binds with high affinity and selectivity to the CysLT receptor (in preference to other pharmacologically important airway receptors, such as the prostanoid, cholinergic, or β-adrenergic receptor). Montelukast inhibits physiologic actions of LTD at the CysLT receptor without any agonist activity. Montelukast causes inhibition of airway cysteinyl leukotriene receptors as demonstrated by the ability to inhibit bronchoconstriction due to inhaled LTD in asthmatics. Doses as low as 5 mg cause substantial blockage of LTD-induced bronchoconstriction. In a placebo-controlled, crossover study (n=12), montelukast sodium inhibited early- and late-phase bronchoconstriction due to antigen challenge by 75% and 57%, respectively. The effect of montelukast sodium on eosinophils in the peripheral blood was examined in clinical trials. In patients with asthma aged 2 years and older who received montelukast, a decrease in mean peripheral blood eosinophil counts ranging from 9% to 15% was noted, compared with placebo, over the double-blind treatment periods. In patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis aged 15 years and older who received montelukast sodium, a mean increase of 0.2% in peripheral blood eosinophil counts was noted, compared with a mean increase of 12.5% in placebo-treated patients, over the double-blind treatment periods; this reflects a mean difference of 12.3% in favor of montelukast sodium. The relationship between these observations and the clinical benefits of montelukast noted in the clinical trials is not known [see ]. Montelukast is rapidly absorbed following oral administration. After administration of the 10-mg film-coated tablet to fasted adults, the mean peak montelukast plasma concentration (C) is achieved in 3 to 4 hours (T). The mean oral bioavailability is 64%. The oral bioavailability and C are not influenced by a standard meal in the morning.The safety and efficacy of montelukast in patients with asthma were demonstrated in clinical trials in which the 10-mg film-coated tablet formulation was administered in the evening without regard to the time of food ingestion. The safety and efficacy of montelukast in patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis were demonstrated in clinical trials in which the 10-mg film-coated tablet was administered in the morning or evening without regard to the time of food ingestion. The comparative pharmacokinetics of montelukast when administered as two 5-mg chewable tablets versus one 10-mg film-coated tablet have not been evaluated. Montelukast is more than 99% bound to plasma proteins. The steady state volume of distribution of montelukast averages 8 to 11 liters. Orally administered montelukast distributes into the brain in rats. Montelukast is extensively metabolized. In studies with therapeutic doses, plasma concentrations of metabolites of montelukast are undetectable at steady state in adults and pediatric patients. studies using human liver microsomes indicate that CYP3A4, 2C8, and 2C9 are involved in the metabolism of montelukast. At clinically relevant concentrations, 2C8 appears to play a major role in the metabolism of montelukast. The plasma clearance of montelukast averages 45 mL/min in healthy adults. Following an oral dose of radiolabeled montelukast, 86% of the radioactivity was recovered in 5-day fecal collections and <0.2% was recovered in urine. Coupled with estimates of montelukast oral bioavailability, this indicates that montelukast and its metabolites are excreted almost exclusively via the bile. In several studies, the mean plasma half-life of montelukast ranged from 2.7 to 5.5 hours in healthy young adults. The pharmacokinetics of montelukast are nearly linear for oral doses up to 50 mg. During once-daily dosing with 10-mg montelukast, there is little accumulation of the parent drug in plasma (14%). : Patients with mild-to-moderate hepatic insufficiency and clinical evidence of cirrhosis had evidence of decreased metabolism of montelukast resulting in 41% (90% CI=7%, 85%) higher mean montelukast AUC following a single 10-mg dose. The elimination of montelukast was slightly prolonged compared with that in healthy subjects (mean half-life, 7.4 hours). No dosage adjustment is required in patients with mild-to-moderate hepatic insufficiency. The pharmacokinetics of montelukast in patients with more severe hepatic impairment or with hepatitis have not been evaluated. : Since montelukast and its metabolites are not excreted in the urine, the pharmacokinetics of montelukast were not evaluated in patients with renal insufficiency. No dosage adjustment is recommended in these patients. r: The pharmacokinetics of montelukast are similar in males and females. : Pharmacokinetic differences due to race have not been studied. : Pharmacokinetic studies evaluated the systemic exposure of the 10-mg film-coated tablets in young adults and adolescents ≥ 15 years of age. The plasma concentration profile of montelukast following administration of the 10-mg film-coated tablet is similar in adolescents ≥ 15 years of age and young adults. The 10-mg film-coated tablet is recommended for use in patients ≥ 15 years of age. : Montelukast sodium has been administered with other therapies routinely used in the prophylaxis and chronic treatment of asthma with no apparent increase in adverse reactions. In drug-interaction studies, the recommended clinical dose of montelukast did not have clinically important effects on the pharmacokinetics of the following drugs: theophylline, prednisone, and prednisolone. Montelukast at a dose of 10 mg once daily dosed to pharmacokinetic steady state, did not cause clinically significant changes in the kinetics of a single intravenous dose of theophylline [predominantly a cytochrome P450 (CYP) 1A2 substrate]. Montelukast at doses of ≥ 100 mg daily dosed to pharmacokinetic steady state, did not cause any clinically significant change in plasma profiles of prednisone or prednisolone following administration of either oral prednisone or intravenous prednisolone. Oral Contraceptives, Terfenadine, Digoxin, and Warfarin: In drug interaction studies, the recommended clinical dose of montelukast did not have clinically important effects on the pharmacokinetics of the following drugs: oral contraceptives (norethindrone 1 mg/ethinyl estradiol 35 mcg), terfenadine, digoxin, and warfarin. Montelukast at doses of ≥ 100 mg daily dosed to pharmacokinetic steady state did not significantly alter the plasma concentrations of either component of an oral contraceptive containing norethindrone 1 mg/ ethinyl estradiol 35 mcg. Montelukast at a dose of 10 mg once daily dosed to pharmacokinetic steady state did not change the plasma concentration profile of terfenadine (a substrate of CYP3A4) or fexofenadine, the carboxylated metabolite, and did not prolong the QTc interval following co-administration with terfenadine 60 mg twice daily; did not change the pharmacokinetic profile or urinary excretion of immunoreactive digoxin; did not change the pharmacokinetic profile of warfarin (primarily a substrate of CYP2C9, 3A4 and 1A2) or influence the effect of a single 30-mg oral dose of warfarin on prothrombin time or the International Normalized Ratio (INR). Thyroid Hormones, Sedative Hypnotics, Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Benzodiazepines, and Decongestants: Although additional specific interaction studies were not performed, montelukast was used concomitantly with a wide range of commonly prescribed drugs in clinical studies without evidence of clinical adverse interactions. These medications included thyroid hormones, sedative hypnotics, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents, benzodiazepines, and decongestants. : Phenobarbital, which induces hepatic metabolism, decreased the area under the plasma concentration curve (AUC) of montelukast approximately 40% following a single 10-mg dose of montelukast. No dosage adjustment for montelukast sodium is recommended. It is reasonable to employ appropriate clinical monitoring when potent CYP enzyme inducers, such as phenobarbital or rifampin, are co-administered with montelukast sodium. Effect of Montelukast on Cytochrome P450 (CYP) Enzymes: Montelukast is a potent inhibitor of CYP2C8 . However, data from a clinical drug-drug interaction study involving montelukast and rosiglitazone (a probe substrate representative of drugs primarily metabolized by CYP2C8) in 12 healthy individuals demonstrated that the pharmacokinetics of rosiglitazone are not altered when the drugs are coadministered, indicating that montelukast does not inhibit CYP2C8 . Therefore, montelukast is not anticipated to alter the metabolism of drugs metabolized by this enzyme (e.g., paclitaxel, rosiglitazone, and repaglinide). Based on further in vitro results in human liver microsomes, therapeutic plasma concentrations of montelukast do not inhibit CYP 3A4, 2C9, 1A2, 2A6, 2C19, or 2D6. studies have shown that montelukast is a substrate of CYP 2C8, 2C9, and 3A4. Co-administration of montelukast with itraconazole, a strong CYP 3A4 inhibitor, resulted in no significant increase in the systemic exposure of montelukast. Data from a clinical drug-drug interaction study involving montelukast and gemfibrozil (an inhibitor of both CYP 2C8 and 2C9) demonstrated that gemfibrozil, at a therapeutic dose, increased the systemic exposure of montelukast by 4.4-fold. Co-administration of itraconazole, gemfibrozil, and montelukast did not further increase the systemic exposure of montelukast. Based on available clinical experience, no dosage adjustment of montelukast is required upon co-administration with gemfibrozil []. 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility No evidence of tumorigenicity was seen in carcinogenicity studies of either 2 years in Sprague-Dawley rats or 92 weeks in mice at oral gavage doses up to 200 mg/kg/day or 100 mg/kg/day, respectively. The estimated exposure in rats was approximately 120 and 75 times the AUC for adults and children, respectively, at the maximum recommended daily oral dose. The estimated exposure in mice was approximately 45 and 25 times the AUC for adults and children, respectively, at the maximum recommended daily oral dose.Montelukast demonstrated no evidence of mutagenic or clastogenic activity in the following assays: the microbial mutagenesis assay, the V-79 mammalian cell mutagenesis assay, the alkaline elution assay in rat hepatocytes, the chromosomal aberration assay in Chinese hamster ovary cells, and in the mouse bone marrow chromosomal aberration assay.In fertility studies in female rats, montelukast produced reductions in fertility and fecundity indices at an oral dose of 200 mg/kg (estimated exposure was approximately 70 times the AUC for adults at the maximum recommended daily oral dose). No effects on female fertility or fecundity were observed at an oral dose of 100 mg/kg (estimated exposure was approximately 20 times the AUC for adults at the maximum recommended daily oral dose). Montelukast had no effects on fertility in male rats at oral doses up to 800 mg/kg (estimated exposure was approximately 160 times the AUC for adults at the maximum recommended daily oral dose). Adults and Adolescents 15 Years of Age and Older with Asthma Clinical trials in adults and adolescents 15 years of age and older demonstrated there is no additional clinical benefit to montelukast doses above 10 mg once daily. The efficacy of montelukast sodium for the chronic treatment of asthma in adults and adolescents 15 years of age and older was demonstrated in two (U.S. and Multinational) similarly designed, randomized, 12-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials in 1576 patients (795 treated with montelukast sodium, 530 treated with placebo, and 251 treated with active control). The median age was 33 years (range 15 to 85); 56.8% were females and 43.2% were males. The ethnic/racial distribution in these studies was 71.6% Caucasian, 17.7% Hispanic, 7.2% other origins and 3.5% Black. Patients had mild or moderate asthma and were non-smokers who required approximately 5 puffs of inhaled β-agonist per day on an “as-needed” basis. The patients had a mean baseline percent of predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV) of 66% (approximate range, 40 to 90%). The co-primary endpoints in these trials were FEV and daytime asthma symptoms. In both studies after 12 weeks, a random subset of patients receiving montelukast sodium was switched to placebo for an additional 3 weeks of double-blind treatment to evaluate for possible rebound effects. The results of the U.S. trial on the primary endpoint, morning FEV, expressed as mean percent change from baseline averaged over the 12-week treatment period, are shown in FIGURE 2. Compared with placebo, treatment with one montelukast sodium 10-mg tablet daily in the evening resulted in a statistically significant increase in FEV percent change from baseline (13.0%-change in the group treated with montelukast sodium vs. 4.2%-change in the placebo group, p<0.001); the change from baseline in FEV for montelukast sodium was 0.32 liters compared with 0.10 liters for placebo, corresponding to a between-group difference of 0.22 liters (p<0.001, 95% CI 0.17 liters, 0.27 liters). The results of the Multinational trial on FEV were similar. FIGURE 2: FEV Mean Percent Change from Baseline (U.S. Trial: Montelukast Sodium N=406; Placebo N=270) (ANOVA The effect of montelukast sodium on other primary and secondary endpoints, represented by the Multinational study is shown in TABLE 2. Results on these endpoints were similar in the US study. TABLE 2: Effect of Montelukast sodium on Primary and Secondary Endpoints in a Multinational Placebo-controlled Trial (ANOVA Model)  Both studies evaluated the effect of montelukast sodium on secondary outcomes, including asthma attack (utilization of health-care resources such as an unscheduled visit to a doctor's office, emergency room, or hospital; or treatment with oral, intravenous, or intramuscular corticosteroid), and use of oral corticosteroids for asthma rescue. In the Multinational study, significantly fewer patients (15.6% of patients) on montelukast sodium experienced asthma attacks compared with patients on placebo (27.3%, p < 0.001). In the US study, 7.8% of patients on montelukast sodium and 10.3% of patients on placebo experienced asthma attacks, but the difference between the two treatment groups was not significant (p = 0.334). In the Multinational study, significantly fewer patients (14.8% of patients) on montelukast sodium were prescribed oral corticosteroids for asthma rescue compared with patients on placebo (25.7%, p < 0.001). In the US study, 6.9% of patients on montelukast sodium and 9.9% of patients on placebo were prescribed oral corticosteroids for asthma rescue, but the difference between the two treatment groups was not significant (p = 0.196). In each placebo-controlled trial in adults, the treatment effect of montelukast sodium, measured by daily diary card parameters, including symptom scores, “as-needed” ß-agonist use, and PEFR measurements, was achieved after the first dose and was maintained throughout the dosing interval (24 hours). No significant change in treatment effect was observed during continuous once-daily evening administration in non-placebo-controlled extension trials for up to one year. Withdrawal of montelukast sodium in asthmatic patients after 12 weeks of continuous use did not cause rebound worsening of asthma.   Effects in Patients on Concomitant Inhaled Corticosteroids Separate trials in adults evaluated the ability of montelukast sodium to add to the clinical effect of inhaled corticosteroids and to allow inhaled corticosteroid tapering when used concomitantly. One randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trial (n=226) enrolled adults with stable asthma with a mean FEV of approximately 84% of predicted who were previously maintained on various inhaled corticosteroids (delivered by metered-dose aerosol or dry powder inhalers). The median age was 41.5 years (range 16 to 70); 52.2% were females and 47.8% were males. The ethnic/racial distribution in this study was 92.0% Caucasian, 3.5% Black, 2.2% Hispanic, and 2.2% Asian. The types of inhaled corticosteroids and their mean baseline requirements included beclomethasone dipropionate (mean dose, 1203 mcg/day), triamcinolone acetonide (mean dose, 2004 mcg/day), flunisolide (mean dose, 1971 mcg/day), fluticasone propionate (mean dose, 1083 mcg/day), or budesonide (mean dose, 1192 mcg/day). Some of these inhaled corticosteroids were non-U.S.-approved formulations, and doses expressed may not be ex-actuator. The pre-study inhaled corticosteroid requirements were reduced by approximately 37% during a 5- to 7-week placebo run-in period designed to titrate patients toward their lowest effective inhaled corticosteroid dose. Treatment with montelukast sodium resulted in a further 47% reduction in mean inhaled corticosteroid dose compared with a mean reduction of 30% in the placebo group over the 12-week active treatment period (p ≤ 0.05). It is not known whether the results of this study can be generalized to patients with asthma who require higher doses of inhaled corticosteroids or systemic corticosteroids. In another randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trial (n=642) in a similar population of adult patients previously maintained, but not adequately controlled, on inhaled corticosteroids (beclomethasone 336 mcg/day), the addition of  montelukast sodium to beclomethasone resulted in statistically significant improvements in FEV1 compared with those patients who were continued on beclomethasone alone or those patients who were withdrawn from beclomethasone and treated with montelukast sodium or placebo alone over the last 10 weeks of the 16-week, blinded treatment period. Patients who were randomized to treatment arms containing beclomethasone had statistically significantly better asthma control than those patients randomized to montelukast alone or placebo alone as indicated by FEV, daytime asthma symptoms, PEFR, nocturnal awakenings due to asthma, and “as-needed” ß-agonist requirements. In adult patients with asthma with documented aspirin sensitivity, nearly all of whom were receiving concomitant inhaled and/or oral corticosteroids, a 4-week, randomized, parallel-group trial (n=80) demonstrated that montelukast sodium, compared with placebo, resulted in significant improvement in parameters of asthma control. The magnitude of effect of montelukast sodium in aspirin-sensitive patients was similar to the effect observed in the general population of asthma patients studied. The effect of montelukast sodium on the bronchoconstrictor response to aspirin or other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in aspirin-sensitive asthmatic patients has not been evaluated [see ]. Exercise-Induced Bronchoconstriction(Adults and Adolescents 15 years of age and older) The efficacy of montelukast sodium, 10 mg, when given as a single dose 2 hours before exercise for the prevention of EIB was investigated in three (U.S. and Multinational), randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover studies that included a total of 160 adult and adolescent patients 15 years of age and older with EIB. Exercise challenge testing was conducted at 2 hours, 8.5 or 12 hours, and 24 hours following administration of a single dose of study drug (montelukast 10 mg or placebo). The primary endpoint was the mean maximum percent fall in FEV following the 2 hours post-dose exercise challenge in all three studies (Study A, Study B, and Study C). In Study A, a single dose of montelukast sodium 10 mg demonstrated a statistically significant protective benefit against EIB when taken 2 hours prior to exercise. Some patients were protected from EIB at 8.5 and 24 hours after administration; however, some patients were not. The results for the mean maximum percent fall at each timepoint in Study A are shown in TABLE 3 and are representative of the results from the other two studies. TABLE 3: Mean Maximum Percent Fall in FEV Following Exercise Challenge in Study A (N=47) ANOVA Model *Least squares-mean The efficacy of montelukast for prevention of EIB in patients below 6 years of age has not been established. Daily administration of montelukast for the chronic treatment of asthma has not been established to prevent acute episodes of EIB. In a 12-week, randomized, double-blind, parallel group study of 110 adult and adolescent asthmatics 15 years of age and older, with a mean baseline FEV percent of predicted of 83% and with documented exercise-induced exacerbation of asthma, treatment with montelukast sodium, 10 mg, once daily in the evening, resulted in a statistically significant reduction in mean maximal percent fall in FEV and mean time to recovery to within 5% of the pre-exercise FEV. Exercise challenge was conducted at the end of the dosing interval (i.e., 20 to 24 hours after the preceding dose). This effect was maintained throughout the 12-week treatment period indicating that tolerance did not occur. Montelukast sodium did not, however, prevent clinically significant deterioration in maximal percent fall in FEV after exercise (i.e., ≥ 20% decrease from pre-exercise baseline) in 52% of patients studied. In a separate crossover study in adults, a similar effect was observed after two once-daily 10-mg doses of montelukast sodium. The efficacy of montelukast sodium tablets for the treatment of seasonal allergic rhinitis was investigated in 5 similarly designed, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo- and active-controlled (loratadine) trials conducted in North America. The 5 trials enrolled a total of 5029 patients, of whom 1799 were treated with montelukast sodium tablets. Patients were 15 to 82 years of age with a history of seasonal allergic rhinitis, a positive skin test to at least one relevant seasonal allergen, and active symptoms of seasonal allergic rhinitis at study entry. The period of randomized treatment was 2 weeks in 4 trials and 4 weeks in one trial. The primary outcome variable was mean change from baseline in daytime nasal symptoms score (the average of individual scores of nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, nasal itching, sneezing) as assessed by patients on a 0-3 categorical scale. Four of the five trials showed a significant reduction in daytime nasal symptoms scores with montelukast sodium 10-mg tablets compared with placebo. The results of one trial are shown below. The median age in this trial was 35.0 years (range 15 to 81); 65.4% were females and 34.6% were males. The ethnic/racial distribution in this study was 83.1% Caucasian, 6.4% other origins, 5.8% Black, and 4.8% Hispanic. The mean changes from baseline in daytime nasal symptoms score in the treatment groups that received montelukast tablets, loratadine, and placebo are shown in TABLE 5. The remaining three trials that demonstrated efficacy showed similar results. TABLE 5: Effects of Montelukast on Daytime Nasal Symptoms Score* in a Placebo- and Active-controlled Trial in Patients with Seasonal Allergic Rhinitis (ANCOVA Model) * Average of individual scores of nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, nasal itching, sneezing as assessed by patients on a 0-3 categorical scale. † Statistically different from placebo (p≤0.001). ‡ The study was not designed for statistical comparison between montelukast sodium and the active control (loratadine). The efficacy of montelukast sodium tablets for the treatment of perennial allergic rhinitis was investigated in 2 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies conducted in North America and Europe. The two studies enrolled a total of 3357 patients, of whom 1632 received montelukast sodium 10-mg tablets. Patients 15 to 82 years of age with perennial allergic rhinitis as confirmed by history and a positive skin test to at least one relevant perennial allergen (dust mites, animal dander, and/or mold spores), who had active symptoms at the time of study entry, were enrolled. In the study in which efficacy was demonstrated, the median age was 35 years (range 15 to 81); 64.1% were females and 35.9% were males. The ethnic/racial distribution in this study was 83.2% Caucasian, 8.1% Black, 5.4% Hispanic, 2.3% Asian, and 1.0% other origins. Montelukast sodium 10-mg tablets once daily was shown to significantly reduce symptoms of perennial allergic rhinitis over a 6-week treatment period (TABLE 6); in this study the primary outcome variable was mean change from baseline in daytime nasal symptoms score (the average of individual scores of nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, and sneezing). TABLE 6: Effects of Montelukast Sodium on Daytime Nasal Symptoms Score* in a Placebo-controlled Trial in Patients with Perennial Allergic Rhinitis (ANCOVA Model)    * Average of individual scores of nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, sneezing as assessed by patients on a 0-3 categorical scale. †Statistically different from placebo (p ≤ 0.001). The other 6-week study evaluated montelukast 10 mg (n=626), placebo (n=609), and an active-control (cetirizine 10 mg; n=120). The primary analysis compared the mean change from baseline in daytime nasal symptoms score for montelukast vs. placebo over the first 4 weeks of treatment; the study was not designed for statistical comparison between montelukast sodium and the active-control. The primary outcome variable included nasal itching in addition to nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, and sneezing. The estimated difference between montelukast sodium and placebo was -0.04 with a 95% CI of (-0.09, 0.01). The estimated difference between the active-control and placebo was -0.10 with a 95% CI of (-0.19, -0.01).

e366bf50-23c0-4ba2-b789-8e159da4cd4c,"Effect of inhaled corticosteroids on episodes of wheezing associated with viral infection in school age children: randomised double blind placebo controlled trial Effect of inhaled corticosteroids on episodes of wheezing associated with viral infection in school age children: randomised double blind placebo controlled trial ; , University Medicine, Centre Block, Southampton General Hospital, Southampton Correspondence to: Dr I J M Doull Cystic Fibrosis Unit, Department of Child Health, University Hospital of Wales, Cardiff CF4 4XW To determine the effect of regular prophylactic inhaled corticosteroids on wheezing episodes associated with viral infection in school age children. Randomised, double blind, placebo controlled trial. 104 children aged 7 to 9 years who had had wheezing in association with symptoms of upper and lower respiratory tract infection in the preceding 12 months. After a run in period of 2–6 weeks children were randomly allocated twice daily inhaled beclomethasone dipropionate 200 μg or placebo through a Diskhaler for 6 months with a wash out period of 2 months. Children were assessed monthly. Forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1); bronchial responsiveness to methacholine (PD20); percentage of days with symptoms of upper and lower respiratory tract infection with frequency, severity, and duration of episodes of upper and lower respiratory symptoms and of reduced peak expiratory flow rate. During the treatment period there was a significant increase in mean FEV1 (1.63 1.53 l; adjusted difference 0.09 l (95% confidence interval 0.04 to 0.14); P=0.001) and methacholine PD20 (12.8 7.2 μmol/l; adjusted ratio of means 1.7 (1.2 to 2.4); P=0.007) in children receiving beclomethasone dipropionate compared with placebo. There were, however, no significant differences in the percentage of days with symptoms or in the frequency, severity, or duration of episodes of upper or lower respiratory symptoms or of reduced peak expiratory flow rate during the treatment period between the two groups. Although lung function is improved with regular beclomethasone dipropionate 400 μg/day, this treatment offers no clinically significant benefit in school age children with wheezing episodes associated with viral infection. Increasing evidence suggests that episodic wheezing in children in association with viral infections is a separate entity from atopic asthma Although inhaled corticosteroids are beneficial in asthma, their role in treating wheezing associated with viral infections is unclear In this study regular inhaled corticosteroids resulted in improved lung function and decreased bronchial responsiveness but did not have any effect on episodes of wheezing Inhaled corticosteroids are of little benefit in children with episodic wheezing associated with viral infection Increasing evidence suggests that recurrent wheezing in children in association with viral infections is a separate entity from atopic asthma. The pattern of wheezing associated with viral infections seems to be discrete episodes of acute respiratory symptoms. These are characterised by symptoms of upper respiratory infection that lead to symptoms of lower respiratory infection and a decrease in lung function and are interspersed between longer asymptomatic periods. A longitudinal prospective study conducted in Southampton in children recruited on the basis of a single wheezing episode in the preceding 12 months showed that 80% of wheezing episodes were precipitated by respiratory viral infection. Although inhaled corticosteroids are of unquestioned benefit in childhood asthma, their role in treating wheezing associated with viral infections is unclear. Systemic corticosteroids decrease the illness associated with such wheezing in adults, but in younger children inhaled corticosteroids are of minimal benefit, either when given at the onset of symptoms or continuously. We determined the effect of regular prophylactic inhaled corticosteroids on wheezing episodes in children aged 7 to 9 years of age, combining subjective reporting of symptoms with objective measures of lung function. The study design and subjects were similar to those of a longitudinal study that documented respiratory viral infections. On the basis of previous longitudinal studies, the treatment period was designed to cover the period of maximum wheezing episodes, from the end of the school summer holiday until the following Easter. The children were recruited on the basis of reported symptoms, not on the basis of asthma diagnosed by a doctor. A simple respiratory questionnaire was sent to the parents of 5727 children aged 7 to 9 years in the Southampton area, resulting in 4830 replies (84.3% response). The entry criteria were more stringent than those previously used. Children were selected on the basis of having either five or more wheezing episodes or an episode of wheezing lasting for three or more days in the preceding year. Exclusion criteria included severe respiratory disease and use of inhaled or oral corticosteroids. A total of 160 children fulfilled the enrolment criteria, of whom 104 children and their parents agreed to participate. At the onset of the study all children were reported to develop lower respiratory tract symptoms in association with upper respiratory tract infections. On the basis of previous longitudinal studies, the study required 112 children to have an 80% power of detecting a difference of one peak expiratory flow episode at the two sided 5% significance level. Atopy was determined by the results of skin prick testing with the allergens , cat fur, and mixed grass; any child with a weal of 3 mm or greater to any allergen was deemed atopic. A diary of respiratory symptoms was recorded daily, with each symptom scored 0 when there were none, 1 when they were mild, 2 when moderate, and 3 when severe. The sum of symptoms of upper respiratory tract infection (blocked nose, runny nose, sore throat, hoarse voice, fever, and watery eyes) constituted a daily score (maximum 18). The sum of symptoms of lower respiratory tract infection (day cough, night cough, day wheeze, night wheeze, and shortness of breath) constituted a daily score (maximum 15). Each morning and evening the highest of three peak expiratory flow rates were recorded. Every month the children were assessed at their local health centre, where the diary cards were collected, drug treatment checked, growth recorded, and lung function (forced expiratory flow in 1 second (FEV1)) measured, including bronchial responsiveness to methacholine (maximum cumulative dose 25.6 μmol). After a run in period of 2 to 6 weeks children were randomly allocated in a double blind manner to either beclomethasone dipropionate 200 μg (Allen and Hanbury, Uxbridge) or placebo twice daily as dry powder through a Diskhaler. There was one further assessment 2 months after discontinuing treatment. Compliance with treatment was calculated by counting the used blisters. The cumulative PD20 for methacholine was calculated by interpolation and extrapolation to one doubling dilution. The PD20 is the provocative dose of methacholine that results in a 20% decrease in FEV1 from baseline. Children who did not have a measurable PD20 were assigned the maximum theoretical dose of methacholine. PD20 values were transformed by taking natural logarithms before analysis. FEV1 and log PD20 measures were averaged over the eight assessments during the treatment period to give summary measures of response for each child. The percentages of days with symptoms (score >0) during the pretreatment and treatment periods were calculated for symptoms of upper and lower respiratory tract infection for each child; they were transformed before analysis by adding 1 and taking the natural logarithm. An episode of upper or lower respiratory symptoms was defined as two or more consecutive days with a total upper or lower respiratory score above the child's median score during treatment, preceded by 1 day and followed by 2 days at or below the median, with the maximum score for the episode being greater than or equal to 2 above the median. The frequency of episodes (expressed as a yearly rate), the average severity of episodes (mean maximum score during episodes), and the average duration of episodes (mean length of episodes in days) during treatment were calculated for each child. Morning peak expiratory flow rates were corrected for each child's growth over the course of the study using standard regression equations to estimate the change in peak expiratory flow rate for a given change in height. The coefficient of variation of peak expiratory flow rate in the morning was calculated for each child during pretreatment and treatment periods. An episode of reduced peak flow rate was defined as two or more consecutive days with a peak expiratory flow rate less than or equal to the child's 10th centile of peak expiratory flow during treatment, preceded by 1 day above the 10th centile and followed by 2 days at or above the median. The frequency of episodes (expressed as a yearly rate), the average severity of episodes (mean minimum peak expiratory flow during episodes), and the average duration of episodes (mean length of episodes in days during the treatment) during the treatment were calculated for each child. Summary outcome measures were compared between treatment groups using analysis of covariance, with adjustment for pretreatment values. Results are presented as the difference in means with 95% confidence interval. For variables that were logarithmically transformed before analysis, differences were antilogged and can be interpreted as the ratio of geometric means with 95% confidence interval. Summary measures for symptom episodes and episodes of reduced peak expiratory flow (frequency, severity, and duration) were compared between treatment groups using two sample tests rather than analysis of covariance because not all children had sufficient pretreatment time to measure episodes in this time. The differing effect of treatment between subgroups was tested by fitting a model with an interaction term between treatment and the subgroup variable. Intention to treat analysis was used. Of the 104 children who entered the study, 52 received beclomethasone dipropionate (37 boys, 15 girls) and 52 placebo (36 boys, 16 girls). Ninety four children completed the study, of whom 50 received beclomethasone dipropionate and 44 placebo. Baseline characteristics at study entry and concomitant drug use were similar in each group (table ). Baseline characteristics, regular drug treatment, and use of oral corticosteroids during study in groups given beclomethasone dipropionate and placebo. Values are numbers of subjects unless stated otherwise Ten children withdrew from the study (two were taking beclomethasone dipropionate, eight placebo; χ=2.78, P=0.1). Eight children withdrew within 6 weeks because of difficulties in attending regularly, one child withdrew during the run in period because of unconnected renal failure, and one child withdrew after 3 months. Mean compliance with treatment was similar, being 74.6% in those given beclomethasone dipropionate and 75.9% in those given placebo (difference 1.3% (95% confidence interval −7.5 to 10.2). Three children (one receiving beclomethasone dipropionate and two placebo) were independently prescribed beclomethasone dipropionate by their general practitioner during the course of the study, but they continued to take their assigned study treatment and their results were analysed in their randomised treatment groups. Mean baseline FEV1 at each assessment in groups given beclomethasone dipropionate and placebo Figure shows changes in FEV1 over the course of the study. Pretreatment mean FEV1 was 1.56 (SD 0.29) l and 1.54 (0.30) l for those taking beclomethasone dipropionate and placebo respectively. During treatment FEV1 was consistently higher in those taking beclomethasone dipropionate, the mean value being 1.63 (0.28) l for beclomethasone dipropionate and 1.53 (0.24) l for placebo. The difference in means (beclomethasone dipropionate minus placebo) adjusted for pretreatment FEV1 was 0.09 (0.04 to 0.14) (94=3.48, P=0.001). This difference did not persist once treatment was discontinued (mean FEV1 1.81 l with beclomethasone dipropionate 1.77 l with placebo). Mean FEV1 increased significantly after discontinuing treatment in both the beclomethasone dipropionate (difference compared with mean value during treatment 0.16 l (0.12 to 0.20); 44=7.79, P<0.001) and placebo groups (0.25 l (0.20 to 0.29); 41=10.93, P<0.001). Figure shows the longitudinal changes in methacholine PD20. Pretreatment geometric mean PD20 was 10.2 μmol for beclomethasone dipropionate and 8.5 μmol for placebo. During treatment PD20 was significantly increased in the group given beclomethasone dipropionate compared with that given placebo, the geometric means being 12.8 and 7.2 μmol respectively. The ratio of geometric means (beclomethasone dipropionate to placebo) adjusted for pretreatment log PD20 was 1.7 (1.2 to 2.4) (94=2.78, P=0.007). This difference did not persist after discontinuation of treatment (geometric mean PD20 9.8 μmol with beclomethasone dipropionate 8.3 μmol with placebo). Geometric mean methacholine PD20 at each assessment in groups given beclomethasone dipropionate and placebo The group given beclomethasone dipropionate had a lower percentage of days with symptoms of upper respiratory tract infection during treatment than did the placebo group (median 10.4% 15.5%) (table ), but the difference was not significant. The ratio of geometric means (beclomethasone dipropionate to placebo) adjusted for percentage of pretreatment symptomatic days was 0.66 (0.43 to 1.04) (91=1.82, P=0.07). There were no significant differences in frequency, severity, and duration of episodes of upper respiratory tract symptoms (table ). Percentages of days with symptoms of upper respiratory tract infection Frequency, average severity, and average duration of episodes of upper respiratory tract infection during treatment The median percentage of days with symptoms of lower respiratory tract infection during treatment was 15.3% for those given beclomethasone dipropionate and 21.3% for those given placebo (table ). The ratio of geometric means (beclomethasone dipropionate to placebo) adjusted for percentage of pretreatment symptomatic days was 0.75 (0.53 to 1.07) (91=1.62, P=0.1). The frequency, severity, and duration of episodes of lower respiratory tract symptoms were similar in both groups (table ). Percentages of days with symptoms of lower respiratory tract infection Frequency, average severity, and average duration of episodes of lower respiratory tract infection during treatment The mean coefficient of variation in morning peak expiratory flow during treatment was 10.1% for beclomethasone dipropionate and 10.4% for placebo. The difference in means (beclomethasone dipropionate minus placebo) adjusted for the pretreatment coefficient of variation was −0.64 (minus;2.08 to 0.81) (t91=0.87, P=0.4). Median and 10th centile peak expiratory flows were 244.9 and 212.8 l/min in the beclomethasone dipropionate group and 232.1 and 198.3 l/min in the placebo group. All children experienced at least one episode of reduced peak expiratory flow during treatment. The frequency, severity, and duration of episodes of decreased peak flow were similar in the two groups (table ). Frequency, average severity, and average duration of episodes of reduced peak expiratory flow during treatment There were no significant interactions between treatment and atopy or treatment and asthma for any outcome variable, and the effects of treatment were similar in these subgroups. Although virus studies were not a component of this study, the characteristics, frequency, duration, and magnitude of the episodes had all the features of those reported in a cohort of similar children. Although regular inhaled beclomethasone dipropionate significantly improved spirometric results and bronchial responsiveness to methacholine, it had little effect on either frequency, duration, or severity of symptoms of lower respiratory tract infection or on episodes of reduced expiratory flow. These findings argue for a comparatively corticosteroid resistant process underlying virus induced wheezing episodes in susceptible children. Wheezing associated with viral infection has no clear definition, and its diagnosis is based on a history of episodic wheeze in association with infection of the upper respiratory tract and asymptomatic intervals. Although at the onset of the study all children reported respiratory symptoms in association with upper respiratory tract infections, the entry criteria were not specific for wheezing associated with viral infection. Some children had features more suggestive of atopic asthma, and the overlap between wheezing associated with viral infection and atopic asthma may be considerable in this age group. Nevertheless, 95% of children had symptoms of lower respiratory tract infection during treatment. How we defined episodes could potentially obscure the beneficial effects of beclomethasone dipropionate during treatment. If the median symptom score were significantly decreased while receiving beclomethasone dipropionate a lower peak symptom score could potentially register an episode of symptoms. The same would apply for episodes of reduced expiratory flow. However, the median symptom score for upper or lower respiratory tract infection and reduced peak expiratory flow between the two groups were not significantly different. In addition, the severity of episodes was measured as absolute maximum symptom score or absolute minimum peak expiratory flow rather than as changes from the median, so both of these outcomes were not dependent on the median. Thus we feel the use of a similar definition to that used by Johnston et al was justified. The FEV1 increased significantly after discontinuing treatment. The children had grown during the study, with a resultant increase in FEV1. Furthermore, the interval between discontinuing treatment and the final assessment was considerably greater than the other intervals, and the assessment was completed during the summer, when respiratory morbidity is at its lowest. Nevertheless, we cannot exclude an adverse effect on lung function due to the regular use of a dry powder inhaler, with rebound improvement when the treatment was discontinued. Prophylactic corticosteroids ameliorate the symptoms of experimental viral infections, and when they are given systematically at the first sign of symptoms of upper respiratory tract infection the number of days of wheezing, attendances at accident and emergency departments, and hospital admissions decreases significantly. In preschool children with recurrent wheeze, however, the therapeutic efficacy of inhaled corticosteroids used either at onset of symptoms or continuously has been modest at best, and this study extends their relative ineffectiveness to school age children. Asthmatic children are reportedly more prone than non-asthmatic children to respiratory tract infections, while atopic children have more severe symptoms of lower respiratory tract infection and more severe episodes of reduced expiratory flow than non-atopic children. In our study we found no benefit from regular treatment with beclomethasone dipropionate when either those children who had been labelled asthmatic or the atopic children were analysed separately. A higher dose of corticosteroid through a superior delivery system might have achieved a greater amelioration of respiratory episodes. Although the Diskhaler is easy to use and all children had satisfactory inhaler technique, delivery is not ideal. Nevertheless, drug delivery was sufficient to improve lung function, and we have previously reported decreased growth in those children who received beclomethasone dipropionate compared with placebo, as have other investigators. Caution should be adopted over the use of inhaled corticosteroids in treating children with mild disease in which episodes of viral infection predominate.

1f6ca9de-dfc3-4833-9e35-c811f4b70f39,"In terms of gas exchange, what is the terminal portion of the lungs? -very close to pulmonary capillaries-allows good gas exchange/mixture of oxy and deoxy blood What system plays a role in removing particles from interstitial spaces of the lung? -alveoli are not a closed system-these pores allow for air mixing What are the differences between Type I and Type II alveolar cells? -Type 1: 95% of alveoli surface; don't divide; form barrier between air inside and wall component-Type II: 5% of alveoli surface; dividing cells - progenerate Type I and Type II; make pulmonary surfactant What is the function of pulmonary surfactant? What produces it? -helps keep lungs compliant; allows lungs to inflate fully-produced by Type II alveolar cells What do the diaphragm and intercostal muscles do during inspiration? -diaphragm: contracts and moves downward when you inspire-intercostal muscles: contract during inspiration to allow expansion and to allow the sternum to move forward for proper inflation What kind of process is expiration? What does the diaphragm do? -passive process-diaphragm recoils to original position Someone who has trouble breathing will start using extra muscles to breath, what are these muscles? -abdominals-accessory muscles: trapezius, scalenus, sternomastoid -subjective feeling of difficulty breathing-mechanism: stimulation of lung receptors-mechanism: increased sensitivity to changes in ventilations perceived through CNS mechanisms-mechanism: reduced ventilatory capacity or breathing reserve-mechanism: stimulation of neural receptors in the muscle fibers of the intercostals and diaphragm Explain how stimulation of lung receptors can cause dyspnea. (hint: 3 diff receptor types) -there are a few different types of receptors in the lungs-stretch receptors sense bronchoconstriction and can lead to the feeling of SOB-irritant receptors are triggered by cold air, cig smoke, etc.-J receptors sense lung congestion (such as in pneumonia), cause feeling of SOB Explain how increased sensitivity to changes in ventilations perceived through CNS mechanisms can cause dyspnea. -we have 2 different centers in the brain (specifically the medulla)-they are CNS centers that send out impulses for breathing -- a change here could trigger SOB Explain how reduced ventilatory capacity or breathing reserve can cause dyspnea. -this is primarily in COPD pts-everyone has a breathing reserve when they are not active/not using lungs fully-COPD pts have obstructive processes and alveoli are destroyed --> they lose their breathing reserve so they never feel like they take a really full breath Explain how stimulation of neural receptors in muscle fibers of the intercostals and diaphragm can cause dyspnea. -our body has neural receptors constantly sensing if we have low O2 or high CO2-their response to either of these conditions is to hyperventilate --> produces SOB feeling + muscles working harder to breathe maximum amount of air that can be rapidly and forcefully exhaled from the lungs after full inspiration What does forced expiratory volume (FEV1) measure? volume of air expired in the first second, expressed as a percentage of the FVC According to the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, what three different things must be occurring in asthma? -airflow obstruction (relates to bronchoconstriction)-bronchial hyperresponsiveness -underlying inflammation reversible (someone w/an acute episode can be given tx to make bronchoconstriction go away) In Missouri, asthma mortality rates are higher in what race? -immediate hypersensitivities -MUST be exposed to an allergen What is IgE? What does it do? (in hypersensitivity rxn) -principal antibody mediator-when exposed to a trigger, B cells produce IgE secreting plasma cells-multiple exposures = IgE detected in blood What do T-helper (T-lymphocyte) cells do? (in hypersensitivity rxn) -recruit eosinophils-memory -- remember previous exposure = faster rxn second time around What are mast cells? What do they do? (in hypersensitivity rxn) -principal effector cells (driver cell in cascade initiation)-filled with vesicles filled with cytokines -- proinflammatory mediators -allergen exposure = binds IgE and degranulation occurs -- cytokines/mediators released from vesicles What is histamine? What does it do? (in hypersensitivity rxn) -most important mediator-H1 receptor is primary driver of hypersensitivity rxn -- may add heartburn med to Benadryl to get H2 receptor too though-causes smooth muscle contraction and vasodilation (leaky vessels; edema) -- induces bronchoconstriction-increases mucosal edema What do alveolar macrophages do? (in hypersensitivity rxn) -scavengers found in large and small airways-initiate inflammatory cascade -release mediators-not as predominate as eosinophils Histamine, prostaglandins, thromboxanes, leukotrienes, and platelet-activating factor are all what? What are they released from? What do they contribute to? -are all hypersensitivity rxn mediators-released from mast cells-all contribute to bronchospasm -induced by exposure to an allergen-develops within 10-20 minutes of exposure-characterized by an early and late phase rxn What are potential triggers for extrinsic (atopic) asthma? -animal danders-cigarette smoke-sulfite containing foods (dried fruit, beer, wine, shrimp)-dust mites-mold-seasonal outdoor allergens What are the 5 ""steps"" in the early-phase of extrinsic (atopic) asthma? 1. fast onset: within minutes of allergen exposure2. trigger = antigen (allergen)3. release of cytokines: antigen binds IgE coated on mast cell, initiating response; epithelial cells of the airway open up and let mast cells and allergens into the airway; degranulation of mast cells occurs = cytokines/mediators released 4. increase in mucus/edema: goblet cells increase mucus production; histamine makes vessels leaky = edema5. bronchospasm: mediators can directly induce bronchospasm; mediators also attract inflammatory cells (part of late-phase) What are the 4 ""steps"" of late-phase extrinsic (atopic) asthma? 1. recruited cells drive the response: can occur 4-8 hrs after early phase; eosinophils and neutrophils were brought to the area by cytokine mediators2. airway epithelial cells also release eotaxin: eotaxin is an activator of eosinophils -- another way of continuing inflammatory cascade 3. epithelial cell injury occurs as a result of this process and further bronchoconstriction occurs: mucus build-up reduces airflow; edema occurs because of histamine and leaky vessels 4. increased airway responsiveness = prolonged asthma symptoms What makes extrinsic (atopic) asthma so dangerous? (hint: late phase) -late phase can occur 4-8 hrs after early phase -late phase can have worse symptoms = dangerous What is intrinsic asthma? What are potential triggers? -non-allergic asthma-triggers: respiratory tract infections; exercise; stress; laughter; cold air; GERD; medications (aspirin, NSAIDs, beta blockers) How do NSAIDs and aspirin relate to the asthma response? -aspirin and NSAIDs decrease prostaglandins but the other side of the pathway is leukotriene production, so we make more of these -leukotrienes are a common mediator of the asthma response What are special considerations for using beta-blockers in asthma and COPD pts? -there are specific and non-specific beta-blockers-non-specific beta blockers work on beta-2, primarily in the lungs = DO NOT use in asthma patients --> would cause bronchoconstriction; would be okay to use in COPD pts What is the clinical presentation of asthma? What is the primary symptom? -cough-wheezing - primary symptom-dyspnea and chest tightness-tachypnea and tachycardia-hypoxemia -primary symptom of asthma-high pitched whistling-usually heard on expiration but can be heard on inspiration too if bad enough; wheezing can disappear entirely if asthma is very bad -cardiac and respiratory system are working much harder to move air -trying to compensate by breathing faster and working the heart harder What system can asthma patients use on their own to determine how much ""trouble"" they are in? -use peak flow meters in the peak flow zone system-green, yellow, and red zones -calculated off personal best peak flow What 5 components do we look at to determine the stage of asthma? -frequency of symptoms -nighttime awakenings-beta-agonist use (albuterol)-interference with activity-lung function (FEV1 and FEV1/FVC) -rescue medications (short-acting beta agonists and oral corticosteroids)-controller medications (mainstay of therapy is inhaled corticosteroids) -- pt takes these all the time What is an asthma exacerbation? What is a moderate vs severe exacerbation? -event characterized by a change from the pt's previous status-moderate: troublesome to patient and prompt a need for change in tx-severe: require urgent action from MD to prevent hospitalization or death -history of severe exacerbations-greater than or equal to 2 hospitalizations for asthma in the past year-greater than or equal to 3 emergency dept visits for asthma in the past year-using more than 2 canisters per month of short-acting beta agonist (SABA)-current oral steroid use-low socioeconomic status (risk factors b/c of access to tx; often use emergency dept) What 8 symptoms/signs do we consider when evaluating an asthma exacerbation? -breathlessness (when does it occur? at some point they can't get a good breath laying down)-talks in (sentences, phrases, words, can't speak)-alertness (agitation; lethargy = v. bad)-respiratory rate -accessory muscle use-wheeze -pulse/minute-PEFR/peak flow -presence of airflow limitation-usually progressive-associated with enhanced, chronic inflammatory response in the airways and the lungs to noxious particles and gases-exacerbations and comorbidities contribute to overall severity in individual patients What two terms are essentially types of COPD but are no longer used and have NO clinical relevance? (i.e., COPD is basically an umbrella term now) -chronic bronchitis: chronic productive cough for 3 months in each of two successive years in a pt in whom other causes of chronic cough have been excluded-emphysema: abnormal permanent enlargement of the airspaces distal to the terminal bronchioles accompanied by destruction of their walls and without obvious fibrosis IRREVERSIBLE (progressive, chronic inflammation and airflow limitations) Compare asthma and COPD. Consider onset, reversibility, symptoms, what drives response, and if genetics plays a role. Asthma:-onset early in life-mostly reversible-intermittent symptoms-atopy and eosinophilia drive response-family history of asthmaCOPD:-onset later in life-not fully reversible-symptoms progressively worsen-neutrophils involved What are risk factors for COPD and which one is major? -smoke, second-hand smoke (>90% of cases - major!)-occupational exposure (industrial pollutants; pesticides)-indoor air pollution (more in third world countries)-low birth weight/history of respiratory infections-heredity (alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency; very rare) True or false: the risk factors for COPD are associations that have been established, NOT cause and effect relationships -helps lungs stay compliant-helps lungs stretch for full expansion when you take a breath What is the function of proteases and antiproteases in the lungs? -proteases digest proteins -- in particular, elastase-antiproteases protect against protease activity -- loss of antiprotease activity = loss of protective effect in lungs -chemotactic factors: attract neutrophils to airway --> leukotriene B4 (LTB4), interleukin-8 (IL-8)-proinflammatory cytokines: cause chronic inflammation --> tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin-6 (IL-6) -growth factors: can cause fibrosis/hardening of small airways --> transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) How do triggers (esp smoking) cause the emphysema component of COPD? -cig smoke attracts inflammatory cells and chemotactic factors to the airway-neutrophils release elastase (a protease that digests elastin, which helps keep lungs stretchable and compliant) -- normally, we try to inhibit elastin action by alpha1-antitrypsin but smoking/irritants decrease alpha1-antritrypsin activity = take away protective effect-overall, destruction of elastic fibers in lung occurs; over time this leads to loss of ability to move air out, hard time exhaling air -- it gets trapped; and can collapse bronchioles and cause alveoli dysfunction-once the damage is done, you can't undo it -exposure to irritants (such as cig smoke) occurs-increased bronchial wall thickness potentiates airflow obstruction-large airways have enlarged submucosal glands which oversecrete mucus-small airways experience an increase in goblet cells = mucus plugging of airway lumen and inflammation = air can't get out -overtime, dysfunction/decrease in cilia = cilia lose their function = more prone to viral, bacterial resp infections -air trapping occurs -- inflammation decreases air in and hyperinflation decreases air out -- hyperinflation occurs because of decreased elastic stretch (don't move in and out, lost elastic recoil) -destruction of alveoli = hypoxemia --> low blood oxygen levels because not moving air well-pulmonary vasoconstriction occurs because the vascular system is trying to trickle blood supply in for better gas exchange --> but you aren't blowing off CO2 = hypercapnia (increased CO2) Explain the ventilation (V) and perfusion (Q) mismatch in COPD. both of the following can happen in different areas of the lung in diff COPD pts low V/Q ratio:-areas of low ventilation-air has low oxygen levels-near normal perfusion-air exchange is bad, blood is okay-get vasoconstriction because body is saying don't send blood here because ventilation supply is not good = hypoxic vasoconstrictionhigh V/Q ratio:-near normal ventilation-large ""dead"" air spaces-areas of no/low perfusion-good airflow but no perfusion to do anything with it so send it to another area, lung tries to compensate = bronchoconstriction -chronic cough-dyspnea-sputum production (more than asthma pts)-chest tightness-wheezing-respiratory failure (in severe cases)-barrel chest (unique to COPD; lungs hyperinflated)-use of accessory muscles What is the difference between blue bloaters and pink puffers in COPD? either will have prolonged expiration (any COPD pt has this)blue bloaters:-cyanosis-right sided heart failure-fluid retention-prolonged expirationpink puffers:-skinnier-use of accessory muscles-pursed-lip breathing (trying to breathe through straw)-tripod position-barrel chest-prolonged expiration How is FEV1 and FEV1/FVC ratio in pulmonary function tests? -decreased FEV1 overall-lower ratio (decreased FVC too) The FEV1/FVC ratio must be less than what for dx? (part of GOLD classification of severity of airflow limitation) What three things do we look at to classify COPD severity? -FEV1/FVC ratio (GOLD classification)-symptoms (subjective)-exacerbation history What is the ONLY therapy that slows COPD progression? What are non-pharm strategies for smoking cessation? -taper each day-brief counseling at each visit-change your routine-surround yourself with great support system worsening of respiratory symptoms that is beyond day-to-day variations and requires a change in medication to treat -bacterial/viral infection-air pollution (indoor or outdoor)-unknown 30% of the time What are the 5 consequences of COPD exacerbations? -negative impact on quality of life -impact on symptoms and lung function-increased economic costs-increased mortality-accelerated lung function decline overall: pt never makes it back to where they were (progressive decline) What are the 3 cardinal symptoms of COPD exacerbations? -increased dyspnea-increased sputum purulence (change in sputum color)-increased sputum volume -1 symptom = mild-2 symptoms = moderate-all 3 symptoms = severe -pulmonary hypertension: because of destroyed alveoli, lost alveolar capillaries, and thickening of smooth muscle in pulmonary vessels -persistent hypoxemia: vasoconstriction of pulmonary vessels; shunt blood to areas that are well ventilated-ultimately --> cor pulmonale -complication of COPD-right-sided heart failure from lung disease-increased resistance in pulm artery means the blood backs up in right side of heart-clinical manifestation: RV hypertrophy, peripheral edema, SOB, decreased exercise tolerance -not as common as cor pulmonale-kidneys sense chronic hypoxemia = increased erythropoietin production-leads to more RBCs produced-consequences: increased risk for blood clots; tx with periodic phlebotomy, oxygen therapy -cor pulmonale-polycythemia vera-acute respiratory failure What is acute respiratory failure as a COPD complication? -gets back to V/Q mismatching and poor gas exchange-retention of CO2 (hypercapnia)-decreased oxygen (hypoxemia)-tachypnea-confusion, somnolence, coma-cyanosis -not for everyone with COPD-indicated in pts with O2 saturation < 88% and polycythemia vera, pulmonary HTN, signs of right-sided heart failure-must be used at least 15 hrs/day or morality benefit-goal O2 sat: >90-92% --> do NOT try to push 97-100% because low O2 levels are driving respiration, could lose this driver if it is suddenly fixed Pathophys, Exam 1: Altered Health in Children (8.2… Pathophys, Exam 3: Schizophrenia & Bipolar Affecti…",112,symptoms of asthma,-12.77750015258789,202
