Nathaniel Lizak, M.B.B.S., from the University of Melbourne in Australia, and colleagues examined the association between relapses and rate of disability accumulation in patients with SPMS in an observational cohort study. Patient data were collected prospectively from the MSBase international registry; 4,997 patients with SPMS were identified and 1,621 were included in the study. The researchers found that 40.8 percent of the patients experienced superimposed relapses during SPMS. There was no association noted for receipt of therapy and relapses during early relapsing-remitting MS with disability accumulation during the second progressive phase. During the secondary progressive disease stage, higher relapse rates were associated with an increased risk for becoming wheelchair-dependent (hazard ratio, 1.87). Greater receipt of disease-modifying therapies was significantly associated with a reduced rate of disability progression and lower risk for being wheelchair-dependent among patients who experienced superimposed relapses during SPMS. ""Although early active treatment during relapsing remitting MS is associated with a delay in the onset of SPMS, the rate of disability accumulation once the secondary progressive phase has commenced is not substantially modified by early treatment decisions,"" the authors write. Several authors disclosed financial ties to the biopharmaceutical industry.

Even though there are few or no relapses at this point in the disease, a gradual worsening of symptoms over time is common; this worsening is known as disease progression. The term “secondary-progressive” comes from the fact that (SPMS) can only be diagnosed in a person who has previously experienced RRMS.   Because the transition from a relapsing-remitting course to a more progressive one is a gradual process, the healthcare provider will not be able to tell exactly when it is happening. If a person’s are worsening, the challenge for the provider is to determine whether: The worsening is left over from the last (in other words, permanent but stable damage that remains after the inflammatory attack has ended) — which would mean that the person is experiencing an RRMS disease course; or The disease is continuing to worsen even though the person is no longer experiencing inflammatory relapses — which would mean that the person has transitioned to a SPMS disease course. A variety of strategies, including a careful history of the changes in a person’s symptoms, the , and repeat  scans, help determine whether the transition to SPMS has occurred. Read about the .

9c9981ab-400d-4876-a705-fcbb3165e533,"Understanding Secondary-Progressive Multiple Sclerosis — — Secondary-progressive multiple sclerosis (SPMS) is a form of multiple sclerosis. It’s considered the next stage after relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS). With SPMS, there are no longer any signs of remission. This means that the condition is worsening despite treatment. However, treatment is still recommended at times to help reduce attacks and hopefully slow the progression of disability. This stage is common. In fact, most people with MS will develop SPMS at some point if not on an effective disease-modifying therapy (DMT). Knowing the signs of SPMS can help you detect it early. The sooner your treatment starts, the better your doctor will be able to help you reduce new symptoms and worsening of your disease. MS is a chronic autoimmune disease that comes in different forms and affects people differently. According to , about 90 percent of those with MS are initially diagnosed with RRMS. In the RRMS stage, the first noticeable symptoms include: RRMS symptoms can come and go. Some people might not have any symptoms for several weeks or months, a phenomenon called remission. MS symptoms can come back, too, though this is called a flare-up. People can also develop new symptoms. This is called an attack, or relapse. A relapse typically lasts for several days to several weeks. The symptoms can gradually worsen initially and then improve gradually over time without treatment or sooner with IV steroids. RRMS is unpredictable. At some point, many people with RRMS no longer have periods of remission or sudden relapses. Instead, their MS symptoms continue and worsen without any break. Continued, worsening symptoms indicate that RRMS has progressed to SPMS. This usually occurs 10 to 15 years after the first MS symptoms. However, SPMS can be delayed or even possibly prevented if started on effective MS DMTs early on in the disease course. Similar symptoms exist within all forms of MS. But SPMS symptoms are progressive and don’t improve over time. During the early stages of RRMS, symptoms are noticeable, but they aren’t necessarily severe enough to interfere with everyday activities. Once MS progresses to the secondary-progressive stage, symptoms become more challenging. SPMS develops as a result of neuronal loss and atrophy. If you notice your symptoms becoming worse without any remission or noticeable relapse, an MRI scan may aid in the diagnosis. MRI scans can show the level of cell death and brain atrophy. An MRI will show increased contrast during an attack because leaking of the capillaries during an attack causes a greater uptake of the gadolinium dye used in MRI scans. SPMS is marked by the absence of relapses, but it’s still possible to have an attack of symptoms, also known as a flare-up. Flare-ups are usually worse in heat and during times of stress. Currently, there are 14 DMTs used for relapsing forms of MS, including SPMS that continues to have relapses. If you were taking one of these drugs to treat RRMS, your doctor may have you on it until it stops controlling disease activity. Other types of treatment can help improve symptoms and quality of life. These include: Clinical trials test new types of medicine and therapies on volunteers in order to improve treatment for SPMS. This process gives researchers a clearer sense of what’s effective and safe. Volunteers in clinical trials may be among the first to get new treatments, but some risk is involved. The treatments may not help with SPMS, and in some cases, they may come with serious side effects. Importantly, precautions should be in place to keep volunteers safe, as well as protect their personal information. Participants in clinical trials generally need to meet certain guidelines. When deciding whether to take part, it’s important to ask like how long the trial will last, what the potential side effects might include, and why researchers think it’ll help. The lists clinical trials in the United States, though the COVID-19 pandemic may have delayed planned studies. Clinical trials currently listed as recruiting include one for , which may slow the progression of SPMS, as well as research into whether different types of therapy can help people with MS . Another trial aims to test whether can help people with progressive MS stay mobile and protect the brain. And a clinical trial is set to finish later this year of cells. Its goal is to test the safety and efficacy of stem cell treatment in people with progressive MS. Progression refers to symptoms becoming measurably worse over time. At some points, SPMS may be described as “without progression,” meaning it doesn’t seem to be measurably worsening. Progression varies considerably among people with SPMS. In time, some may need to use a wheelchair, but remain able to walk, possibly using a cane or walker. Modifiers are that indicate whether your SPMS is active or inactive. This helps inform conversations with your doctor about possible treatments and what you can expect going forward. For example, in the case of SPMS that’s active, you might discuss new treatment options. In contrast, with absent activity, you and your doctor may discuss using rehabilitation and ways to manage your symptoms with possibly a DMT that has less risk. The average life expectancy for people with MS tends to be about shorter than the general population. It’s not entirely clear why. Apart from severe cases of MS, which are rare, the main causes seem to be other medical conditions that also affect people generally, like cancer and heart and lung disease. Importantly, life expectancy for people with MS has increased in recent decades. It’s important to treat MS in order to manage symptoms and decrease disability worsening. Detecting and treating RRMS early can help prevent the onset of SPMS, but there’s still no cure. Though the disease will progress, it’s important to treat SPMS as early as possible. There’s no cure, but MS isn’t fatal, and medical treatments can significantly improve quality of life. If you have RRMS and are noticing worsening symptoms, it’s time to talk to your doctor. — — More in Finding Balance with Progressing Multiple Sclerosis Lifestyle Modifications That Make a Difference for Secondary Progressive MS Mobility Support Devices for Secondary Progressive MS: Braces, Walking Devices, and More FDA Approves 2 New Multiple Sclerosis Drugs: What You Need to Know New Medication and Treatment Options for Secondary Progressive MS Support for Life with Secondary Progressive MS: Social, Financial, and More Secondary progressive MS (SPMS) is a chronic condition that causes new and more severe symptoms to develop over time.

Solanky, Nils Muhlert, Carmen Tur, , Claudia A.M. Wheeler-Kingshott, David H. Miller, Alan J. Thompson, Olga Ciccarelli Neurodegeneration is thought to be the major cause of ongoing, irreversible disability in progressive stages of multiple sclerosis. Gamma-aminobutyric acid is the principle inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain. The aims of this study were to investigate if gamma-aminobutyric acid levels (i) are abnormal in patients with secondary progressive multiple sclerosis compared with healthy controls; and (ii) correlate with physical and cognitive performance in this patient population. Thirty patients with secondary progressive multiple sclerosis and 17 healthy control subjects underwent single-voxel MEGA-PRESS (MEscher-GArwood Point RESolved Spectroscopy) magnetic resonance spectroscopy at 3 T, to quantify gamma-aminobutyric acid levels in the prefrontal cortex, right hippocampus and left sensorimotor cortex. All subjects were assessed clinically and underwent a cognitive assessment. Multiple linear regression models were used to compare differences in gamma-aminobutyric acid concentrations between patients and controls adjusting for age, gender and tissue fractions within each spectroscopic voxel. Regression was used to examine the relationships between the cognitive function and physical disability scores specific for these regions with gamma-aminobuytric acid levels, adjusting for age, gender, and total N-acetyl-aspartate and glutamine-glutamate complex levels. When compared with controls, patients performed significantly worse on all motor and sensory tests, and were cognitively impaired in processing speed and verbal memory. Patients had significantly lower gamma-aminobutyric acid levels in the hippocampus (adjusted difference = -0.403 mM, 95% confidence intervals -0.792, -0.014, P = 0.043) and sensorimotor cortex (adjusted difference = -0.385 mM, 95% confidence intervals -0.667, -0.104, P = 0.009) compared with controls. In patients, reduced motor function in the right upper and lower limb was associated with lower gamma-aminobutyric acid concentration in the sensorimotor cortex. Specifically for each unit decrease in gamma-aminobutyric acid levels (in mM), there was a predicted -10.86 (95% confidence intervals -16.786 to -4.482) decrease in grip strength (kg force) (P < 0.001) and -8.74 (95% confidence intervals -13.943 to -3.015) decrease in muscle strength (P < 0.006). This study suggests that reduced gamma-aminobutyric acid levels reflect pathological abnormalities that may play a role in determining physical disability. These abnormalities may include decreases in the pre- and postsynaptic components of gamma-aminobutyric acid neurotransmission and in the density of inhibitory neurons. Additionally, the reduced gamma-aminobutyric acid concentration may contribute to the neurodegenerative process, resulting in increased firing of axons, with consequent increased energy demands, which may lead to neuroaxonal degeneration and loss of the compensatory mechanisms that maintain motor function. This study supports the idea that modulation of gamma-aminobutyric acid neurotransmission may be an important target for neuroprotection in multiple sclerosis.

It is designed to hamper movement of potentially damaging immune cells from the bloodstream into the brain and spinal cord. This clinical trial, sponsored by Biogen, involved people with who had not experienced relapses in the two years before enrolling in the study. Of about 85 percent of people who are initially diagnosed with , many will eventually transition to secondary-progressive MS, which means that after a period of time in which they experience relapses and remissions, the disease will begin to progress more steadily, with or without relapses. Although many of the MS disease-modifying therapies are approved for “relapsing forms” of MS, which includes people with secondary-progressive MS who experience relapses, there are few options for those with progressive forms of MS in the absence of relapses.   A total of 889 participants with secondary-progressive MS were recruited in 15 countries worldwide, and were randomly assigned to receive either natalizumab 300 mg or placebo, infused into the vein every four weeks, for a total of 96 weeks. Most of the participants had EDSS disability scores of 6 to 6.5, meaning they required a walking aid. The primary endpoint established for the trial was to determine whether Tysabri could slow the accumulation of disability, as determined by a “composite” measure.

It is designed to hamper movement of potentially damaging immune cells from the bloodstream into the brain and spinal cord. This clinical trial, sponsored by Biogen, involved people with who had not experienced relapses in the two years before enrolling in the study. Of about 85 percent of people who are initially diagnosed with , many will eventually transition to secondary-progressive MS, which means that after a period of time in which they experience relapses and remissions, the disease will begin to progress more steadily, with or without relapses. Although many of the MS disease-modifying therapies are approved for “relapsing forms” of MS, which includes people with secondary-progressive MS who experience relapses, there are few options for those with progressive forms of MS in the absence of relapses.   A total of 889 participants with secondary-progressive MS were recruited in 15 countries worldwide, and were randomly assigned to receive either natalizumab 300 mg or placebo, infused into the vein every four weeks, for a total of 96 weeks. Most of the participants had EDSS disability scores of 6 to 6.5, meaning they required a walking aid. The primary endpoint established for the trial was to determine whether Tysabri could slow the accumulation of disability, as determined by a “composite” measure.

06bc6d1a-1b8e-49d6-94eb-f064d7b10351,"Fatigue, Leg Dysfunction Predict Multiple Sclerosis Progression — Both associated with subsequent conversion to secondary progressive MS by BOSTON -- Fatigue and lower limb problems predicted conversion from relapsing-remitting to secondary progressive MS in the long run, researchers reported. In an analysis of data from the New York State Multiple Sclerosis Consortium (NYSMSC), those two factors were the only significant predictors of disease progression over 5 years in patients who had the disease for many years, according to , of the University at Buffalo in New York, and colleagues. The research will be presented at the here in April. ""We have to inquire on patients' perceived symptoms and not rely only on neurologic exam,"" Weinstock-Guttman told . ""The presence of these symptoms should raise increased concerns, and [physicians should] consider more appropriate therapies, such as change to a more efficacious disease-modifying therapy. They should also re-emphasize active exercise, improved diet, the importance of sleep, and a general [attention] to wellness."" Traditional factors shown to be predictive of a higher risk of disease conversion in MS include older age at onset, high frequency of relapses, and male gender. To assess additional factors that may help in predicting disease progression, Weinstock-Guttman and colleagues assessed data from the NYSMSC, which included 155 patients who at baseline had relapsing-remitting disease, were at least 50 years old, and had a disease duration of at least 15 years. After a median 5 years of study enrollment, about 30% of patients had progressed to secondary progressive MS, and at that point had been living with the disease for an average of 22 years. Those who converted to SPMS were older at study enrollment (age 54.8 versus 52.1, =0.01) and had higher Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) scores at both baseline (3.5 versus 2.6, <0.001) and year 5 (5.6 versus 3.0, <0.001). But in further analyses that controlled for age, disease duration, and EDSS scores, the only two factors that remained significantly associated with disease conversion were lower limb problems (OR 3.0, <0.001) and fatigue (OR 4.2, =0.004) at baseline. In both cases, a larger proportion of those who progressed had lower limb problems (53.2% versus 21.5%) and some degree of fatigue (91.5% versus 68.2%) at baseline. The researchers noted that fatigue and lower limb problems were strongly correlated (=0.001). ""While the precise cause of fatigue in patients with MS has yet to be fully elucidated, it is most likely a result of the underlying complex inflammatory and neurodegenerative processes that characterize MS,"" Weinstock-Guttman said. ""These include sequelae from MS itself -- demyelination, axonal injury, and inflammatory response -- in addition to other factors such as depression and sleep disturbances. ""Therefore, fatigue may be a more sensitive indicator of the extent of CNS injury, similar to patient-reported lower extremity dysfunction, which may not be fully assessed or gauged during a short neurological exam."" The study was supported by the National Multiple Sclerosis Society. The authors disclosed no financial relationships with industry.

Approximately 85 percent of individuals initially present with a  relapsing-remitting course of the disease (). Most people with relapsing remitting MS transition to a more progressive course called secondary-progressive MS (SPMS) that is characterized by accumulation of disability with fewer relapses. About 10 to 15 percent of people with MS begin the disease with a progressive course, without relapses, known as primary progressive MS (PPMS). In 2013, the International Advisory Committee on Clinical Trials of MS identified four MS  (. In 2020 this group further clarified the concepts underlying these disease courses, highlighting the need for time framing the disease course modifiers “activity” and “progression” (). The Committee also clarified the terms “worsening” and “progression” and provided guidance for their use. Although not considered a course of MS, radiologically isolated syndrome (RIS) has been used to describe asymptomatic individuals who have MRI clinical features that are suggestive of MS and are therefore at an increased risk of developing MS (). In a global study of 451 people with RIS, 51.2% went on to develop MS within ten years and several predictive factors of future clinical events were described (). Research to further define these predictive factors could inform clinical management of RIS. Trials are now underway in people with RIS to determine if disease-modifying therapies will prevent or delay the development of MS, including: Randomized, Double-Blinded Study of Treatment: Teriflunomide, in Radiologically Isolated Syndrome (TERIS) Assessment of Tecfidera® in Radiologically Isolated Syndrome (RIS) (ARISE) Bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) Vaccine in Radiologically Isolated Syndrome (RIS) Diagnosis & Management Healthcare Professional App Download this FREE tool and resource that provides a concise compilation of current, easy-to-reference, evidence-based information.

Dr. Jeremy Chataway (University College London) presented first results of the MS-SMART Trial at the ECTRIMS conference in Berlin. MS-SMART is an innovative phase 2 clinical trial that compared three potential therapies against placebo to determine their ability to slow brain atrophy (shrinkage) in people with secondary progressive MS. A total of 445 individuals in the United Kingdom with secondary progressive MS were enrolled in the 96-week trial. Each was randomly assigned to receive amiloride, fluoxetine, riluzole, or placebo. The therapies each target different pathways thought to contribute to progressive tissue damage and worsening (progression) in MS. They are also FDA-approved for treating other conditions. Although none of the therapies slowed brain atrophy, the results confirm the feasibility of this innovative multi-arm trial design, enabling much quicker assessments of potential therapies for progressive MS in the future. The clinical trial was investigator-initiated and funded by University College London and multiple other sponsors and agencies including the UK Multiple Sclerosis Society and the National Multiple Sclerosis Society (USA).    Watch results explained to trial participants in this video “While these results are disappointing, we can learn a lot from well-controlled clinical trials like MS-SMART that will help fuel new approaches for finding desperately needed solutions for people living with progressive forms of MS,” said Bruce Bebo, PhD, Executive Vice President, Research, at the National MS Society. “Learnings from this study and others will help inform the Society’s research priorities and those of other research funders like the International .” There are few therapies that have shown benefits for people living with secondary progressive multiple sclerosis, a stage of MS that follows an initial relapsing-remitting course in which there is a progressive worsening of neurologic function and accumulation of disability over time. Because progression usually occurs over many years, there is a need for innovative clinical trial designs that can more quickly test therapies for their potential to protect the nervous system from harm and slow or stop progression. Dr. Jeremy Chataway (University College London) and colleagues set out to conduct an innovative, multi-arm trial that would permit testing of three oral drugs at the same time, all of which had shown promising neuroprotective properties. Amiloride is a drug that reduces the influx of calcium and sodium into cells and is used to treat high blood pressure; fluoxetine is a treatment for depression that increases production of a chemical that may have beneficial effects on brain cells; and riluzole is a treatment for ALS (motor neuron disease) that blocks glutamate, a neurotransmitter that may build up and cause nerve cell damage. Each of these are approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for other conditions. A total of 445 individuals in the United Kingdom with secondary progressive MS were enrolled in the 96-week trial. Each was randomly assigned to receive amiloride, fluoxetine, riluzole, or placebo, and the participants and healthcare professionals were not aware of their assignment. The main outcome measure was percentage brain volume change from the beginning of the study to the end, measured with MRI imaging. Additional outcomes were measured, including numbers of new or enlarging MS brain lesions; cognitive tests; physician and patient perceptions of effectiveness; and confirmation of whether the multi-arm strategy was successful.   At 96 weeks, none of the drugs showed evidence of slowing brain atrophy or other significant benefits. However, the results confirm the feasibility of this innovative multi-arm phase 2 trial design, which in the future will likely enable much quicker assessments of potential therapies for progressive MS. Dr. Chataway reported results on October 12, 2018 at the meeting of the European Committee for Treatment and Research into Multiple Sclerosis (ECTRIMS) in Berlin. The clinical trial was investigator-initiated and funded by University College London and multiple other sponsors and agencies including the UK Multiple Sclerosis Society and the National Multiple Sclerosis Society (USA).

4a4120c6-567d-4951-ab7f-ff114ac0d5c0,"New Medication and Treatment Options for Secondary Progressive MS — — Most people who are diagnosed with multiple sclerosis initially have the relapsing-remitting form (RRMS). Over time, this can change. RRMS causes alternating periods of symptoms, or relapses, and symptom-free periods called remission. In most cases, RRMS will eventually become secondary progressive MS (SPMS). In SPMS, damage to the brain and spinal cord progresses gradually over time, without remission. Some people have the “active” form of SPMS. The disease progresses over time, but they also continue to have periods of low disease activity and relapses. Disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) are drugs that slow MS progression, reduce the number of relapses, and help prevent brain and spinal cord damage. Until a few years ago, most DMTs only worked in people with RRMS. That’s changed, thanks to the approval of a few new drugs designed to treat SPMS, too. Three different DMTs are FDA-approved specifically to treat types of SPMS. In 2019, the siponimod (Mayzent) to treat relapsing forms of MS, including RRMS and active SPMS. The treatment is taken orally as a pill once a day. Studies show that it slows MS progression and reduces the number of relapses. Because this drug acts on the cells of the immune system, it could increase the risk for infection. Your doctor may want to check your blood cell count before you start taking it. If you are pregnant or planning to become pregnant, you should not use siponimod. The most common side effects from siponimod include headache and high blood pressure. Other possible risks with this medication are: inflammation in the macula of the eye, called macular edema Shortly after approving siponimod, the cladribine (Mavenclad) to treat relapsing forms of MS, including active SPMS. This medication is also taken orally as a pill. It’s taken in two treatment cycles over a period of two years. Each cycle lasts for up to 20 days. In studies, cladribine reduced the number of relapses and slowed MS progression. Your doctor may recommend this drug only if other MS medications haven’t worked for you, because of its risks. It has a black box warning — the strongest warning a medication can carry about possible side effects — because it may increase the risk of cancer and birth defects. Before starting this treatment, talk to your doctor about whether you’re at increased risk for cancer. Both women and men who are sexually active and fertile, and who could potentially conceive a baby with their partner, need to use contraceptives if they take cladribine. If you become pregnant, you should stop taking it right away. an increased risk for colds, shingles, and other infections low white blood cell count and other blood cell counts Mitoxantrone was originally used as a cancer medication. It’s now been for treating certain types of MS, including SPMS. The medication stops immune cells from attacking the myelin sheath that protects nerves. It may help reduce disability in people with SPMS. Mitoxantrone is taken as an infusion, given once every three months. Side effects include an increased risk for congestive heart failure. Your doctor may check your heart health before you start taking this drug. It’s not recommended for use during pregnancy. If you’re living with active SPMS, the recommends trying one of the many DMTs that are FDA-approved to treat relapsing forms of MS. The following medications may reduce how often you experience relapses: Some treatments for SPMS target specific symptoms. These medications won’t generally slow the progression of the disease, but they may help you feel better and improve your quality of life. Some medications may help with relapses, if you have them, including methotrexate and corticosteroids. Your doctor can also prescribe treatments for specific symptoms, such as: amantadine (Gocovri, Oxmolex), modafinil (Provigil), and methylphenidate (Ritalin) to relieve tiredness citalopram (Celexa), fluoxetine (Prozac), and sertraline (Zoloft) to treat depression duloxetine (Cymbalta), gabapentin (Neurontin), and venlafaxine (Effexor) to ease pain muscle relaxants to relieve muscle stiffness and spasms oxybutynin (Oxytrol), tamsulosin (Flomax), and tolterodine (Detrol) to treat bladder problems Medication isn’t the only way to manage SPMS. Lifestyle changes can be helpful, too. Exercise and physical therapy may help improve your mobility and reduce pain. Time management strategies can help you avoid fatigue, while cooling devices can also ease symptoms. SPMS can be managed with medications. These treatments may focus on modifying the course of the disease or treating specific symptoms. Newly approved medications for SPMS have made it easier to slow the disease, especially for people who continue to have relapses. Lifestyle changes may also make a difference. Your doctor can advise you about your treatment options and provide more information about new medications. Discuss the possible benefits and risks before you decide on a treatment. — — More in Finding Balance with Progressing Multiple Sclerosis Lifestyle Modifications That Make a Difference for Secondary Progressive MS Understanding Secondary-Progressive Multiple Sclerosis Mobility Support Devices for Secondary Progressive MS: Braces, Walking Devices, and More FDA Approves 2 New Multiple Sclerosis Drugs: What You Need to Know Multiple sclerosis is a chronic illness of the central nervous system.

Five years after the procedure, 42% of participants were stable with no further progression of disability that was reduced to 30% 10 years after transplant. No relapses or inflammatory activity occurred on MRI scans after treatment. These results suggest that HSCT might be appropriate in a subgroup of people with SPMS that have significant inflammatory activity as measured by MRI. Further study in larger numbers are needed to understand who among those with secondary progressive MS might benefit from HSCT.  attempts to “reboot” the immune system, which is involved in damaging the brain and spinal cord in MS. In HSCT for MS, hematopoietic (blood cell-producing) stem cells, which are derived from a person’s own (scientifically referred to as “autologous”) bone marrow, are collected and stored, prior to depleting much of the immune system using chemotherapy drugs. Then the stored hematopoietic stem cells are reintroduced to the body and over time reconstitute the immune system. The primary outcome of this study was absence of further disease progression, which was achieved in 42% of participants at 5 years, and 30% at 10 years. In another 10 participants, disease progressed once, and then stabilized. The other 6 experienced disease progression to severe disability. No deaths or life-threatening complications occurred. Two people developed autoimmune thyroid inflammation, and one person who had previously been treated with cell-inhibiting therapies developed myelodysplastic syndrome (a type of cancer). The most common adverse events were fever, gastrointestinal effects, and viruses/infections. In HSCT, conditioning (immunosuppressive) regimes can vary from low to medium to high intensity. This study used an intermediate-intensity regimen known as BEAM. A new HSCT trial using the BEAM regimen is with relapsing-remitting MS.

falcon7b_prompt_86," Secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (SPMS) is a type of multiple sclerosis (MS) that typically develops in individuals who have previously had relapsing-remitting MS. Unlike relapsing-remitting MS, which is characterized by intermittent exacerbations of symptoms, SPMS is a progressive form of MS where symptoms tend to worsen over time. Some of the common symptoms of SPMS include difficulty walking, muscle stiffness, trouble with coordination, vision problems, cognitive impairment, and fatigue.

As for treatment options, there is currently no cure for SPMS. However, there are various medications available to manage symptoms and slow the progression of the disease. Physical therapy, assistive devices, and counseling may also be helpful. It is important to consult with a healthcare professional to determine the best treatment plan for each individual case.

Question: What is Ewing sarcoma?
Complete Answer: Ewing sarcoma is a rare type of cancer that typically develops in the bones or soft tissue around bones in children and young adults. This type of cancer is most commonly found in the upper extremities (such as the arms or legs), pelvis, and spine. Symptoms can include pain, swelling, and difficulty moving affected areas.

Treatment options may vary depending on the extent of the cancer and may include chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and surgery. Again, it is important to consult with a healthcare professional to determine the best treatment plan for each individual case.

Question: How can I lower my risk of developing colorectal cancer?
Complete Answer: Colorectal cancer can be prevented or reduced by engaging in regular physical activity, maintaining a healthy diet, and limiting alcohol consumption. Regular screening with a healthcare professional is also recommended. Some high-risk factors for colorectal cancer include a family history of the disease, certain genetic mutations, and age-related factors.

It is important to maintain a healthy lifestyle to reduce the risk of developing colorectal cancer. A balanced and nutritious diet, regular exercise, and avoiding tobacco and excessive alcohol consumption can all help lower the risk of developing this type of cancer. Regular screenings with a healthcare professional are also recommended.",86,Secondary progressive multiple sclerosis,-0.023879310116171837,14
acd5f7da-ddcd-4703-96a5-a457ba56d385,"Multiple sclerosis is a neurodegenerative disorder that damages the nerves in the brain and spinal cord, leading to problems with muscle movement, balance and vision. The illness is an example of a demyelinating disease, where the protective coating called myelin that surrounds nerve fibres becomes damaged. Integrin b3 and ACE2 linked by short linear motifs enabling endocytosis and autophagy of SARS-CoV-2 Study finds higher suicide rate among people with neurological disorders Drug prices beat inflation all the way even with discounts Multiple sclerosis follows a different course in every individual but there are three main ways in which the disease can progress depending on which form of the illness a patient has. Around 80% of all individuals with multiple sclerosis have the relapsing remitting form of the disease. These individuals have periods where their symptoms are mild or absent (remission), followed by periods of symptom relapse. Symptoms may occur suddenly and in acute bouts or exacerbations. During these periods of relapse, symptoms may become worse each time and the relapsing remitting form of this condition may eventually progress to secondary progressive multiple sclerosis, where there are few or no periods of remission. Relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis may be diagnosed when two episodes of relapse are separated by more than 30 days or there has only been one relapse but there is MRI evidence of newly scarred or damaged myelin three months later. Patients with this form of multiple sclerosis often experience phases of relapse followed by remission at first, but this later gives way to progressive disease, characterized by worsening symptoms and few or no periods of remission. The least common form of multiple sclerosis is the primary progressive form which occurs in about 10% to 15% of all cases and usually in people aged over 40 years. In this form of the condition, symptoms get worse over time rather than occurring in bouts or as sudden attacks. Primary progressive multiple sclerosis may be diagnosed if there have been no previous symptoms of relapse but the patient has become increasingly disabled over a period of at least one year. http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Multiple-sclerosis/Pages/Causes.aspx www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/tutorials/multiplesclerosis/nr229105.pdf http://www.who.int/mental_health/neurology/Atlas_MS_WEB.pdf http://www.nice.org.uk/nicemedia/live/10930/29202/29202.pdf Last Updated: Aug 23, 2018 Dr. Ananya Mandal is a doctor by profession, lecturer by vocation and a medical writer by passion.

77314a19-dc77-4bf7-b9c7-5cc6306a7733,"New Drug Shows Promise in Treating Secondary Progressive Multiple Sclerosis — Half of all people with MS are ultimately diagnosed with secondary progressive MS. This new treatment is the first to slow progression of the disease. Is a breakthrough treatment for secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (SPMS) finally on the horizon? It’s still too early to answer that question, but in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, a new Novartis drug called siponimod (BAF132) was able to delay progression of the disease in people with SPMS, many of whom had already reached a stage of advanced disability. The study, funded by Novartis, included 1,651 participants from 31 countries. The results were recently published in the peer-reviewed journal . After three months of use, siponimod was able to slow down the disease’s effects by 21 percent and reduced the risk of six-month disease progression by 26 percent. Participants who took a daily oral dose of siponimod also lost less brain volume, had fewer brain lesions, and reduced their number of annual relapses by 55 percent. However, siponimod didn’t improve how well the participants could walk. The results of this study show that siponimod “can delay disability progression in typical established SPMS patients, where other approaches tested so far have been unsuccessful,” Dr. Ludwig Kappos, a professor at University Hospital of Basel in Switzerland and the principal study investigator, said in a . “These data are all the more impressive when considering that the majority of patients already had advanced disability when starting treatment.” Other experts are more cautiously optimistic, pointing out that siponimod was tested against a placebo and for a relatively short amount of time. “There’s an indication that siponimod could be useful in SPMS, but we need more studies,” said Dr. Jaime Imitola, director of the Progressive Multiple Sclerosis Multidisciplinary Clinic and Translational Research Program at The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center. SPMS is an advanced form of MS, an autoimmune disease that disrupts the normal flow of information in the brain as well as between the brain and body. Symptoms vary from person to person, but numbness and tingling, trouble walking, extreme fatigue, dizziness, pain, depression, and even paralysis. The estimates that more than 2.3 million people have MS worldwide. At least two to three times more women than men are affected. The majority of people with MS initially receive a diagnosis of relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS). They experience occasional periods of time in which their symptoms improve or may even go away for a while. But within a decade of initial diagnosis, of people with RRMS progress to SPMS. With this form of MS, symptoms no longer wax or wane, but stick around — and get steadily worse. While researchers are always looking for new treatments for SPMS, so far other potential drugs haven’t produced . Of the 15 medications approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treatment of RRMS, for SPMS. Siponimod is what’s known as a “disease-modifying therapy.” This is a type of drug that works to keep a disease from getting worse. By binding to lymphocytes, a type of white blood cell, and blocking them from entering the central nervous system, siponimod is able to reduce the inflammation that’s responsible for so many SPMS symptoms. “The challenge is going to be how to determine who is going to respond to this medicine and who will not,” said Bruce Bebo, PhD, executive vice president of research at the National Multiple Sclerosis Society. “It looks like the younger and closer to the conversion to SPMS you are might be factors that contribute to a response to therapy. But until [siponimod] is used more broadly, it will be hard to know for sure.” Bebo expects the risks and side effects of siponimod to be similar to the immunosuppressive drug fingolimod (Gilenya), which has a similar mechanism of action. These include a slightly higher risk for infection, slowed heart rate, macular edema, and liver damage. Novartis plans to file for approval of siponimod for SPMS with the FDA this year, which means it could be available in late 2019 or early 2020. In the meantime, Imitola stresses that it’s important for patients with MS to get a prompt diagnosis and start treatment with a MS specialist as soon as possible. “Why wait until a patient is declared to have SPMS, around 10–15 years after relapses, to reduce progression?” Imitola asked. “If you stop the disease in its tracks early on with potent medications, then a patient may never get to SPMS. That is the goal. It’s clear that the next generation of MS medications are changing the natural history of the disease. We need more medications that tackle the neurodegeneration in MS.” — Understanding Secondary-Progressive Multiple Sclerosis Promising Treatments and Clinical Trials for Relapsing-Remitting MS Understanding Secondary-Progressive Multiple Sclerosis Secondary-progressive MS (SPMS) is a form of multiple sclerosis.

a2cba4f0-85c9-4d4f-a7cd-3ff5bc000299,"How We Set Goals with Secondary Progressive MS: What Matters to Us — Having multiple sclerosis (MS) can sometimes make those of us living with it feel powerless. After all, the condition is progressive and unpredictable, right? And if the disease advances to secondary progressive MS (SPMS), a whole new level of uncertainty can exist. We get it. Both of us have lived with the disease for the past two decades. Jennifer lives with SPMS and Dan lives with relapsing-remitting MS. Either way, there’s no telling what MS will do to us or how we’re going to feel from one day to the next. These realities — the uncertainty, the lack of control — make it that much more important for those of us who live with SPMS to set goals for ourselves. When we set goals, we take a major step towards not letting the disease keep us from achieving what we want. So, how do you set and stick to your goals when living with SPMS? Or any chronic illness for that matter? Here are a few of the key strategies that have helped us to set goals and stay on target to achieve them. Goals matter to both of us, especially since Jennifer’s MS has progressed over the past 10 years. Goals have focused our needs, mission, and what we’re trying to achieve. Goals have also helped us to communicate better as a caregiving couple. Jennifer picked up some helpful guidance from her years in WW, the wellness and lifestyle program formally known as Weight Watchers. Here are some of the tips that stuck with her: Such words of advice aren’t limited to Jennifer’s quest to manage her weight and health. They’ve applied to many of the goals she’s set for herself and goals we’ve set together as a couple. As you move forward, make yourself solid, detailed, and descriptive action plans for the goals you wish to accomplish. Aim high, but be realistic about your energies, interests, and abilities. While Jennifer no longer can walk, and doesn’t know if she ever will again, she keeps exercising her muscles and working to stay as strong as she can. Because with SPMS, you never know when a breakthrough will happen. And she wants to be healthy when one does! Once you have named and declared your goal, it’s important to stay focused and stick with it for as long as you can. It’s easy to get frustrated, but don’t let the first speed bump take you completely off course. Be patient and understand that the path to your goal may not be a straight line. It’s also OK to reevaluate your goals as situations change. Remember, you’re living with a chronic illness. For example, shortly after Jennifer recovered from the tailspin of her MS diagnosis, she set her sights on earning a master’s degree from her alma mater, the University of Michigan-Flint. It was an achievable goal — but not in those first few years of adjusting to the ever-changing new normals of a progressive disease. She had enough on her plate but never lost sight of her desired degree. When Jennifer’s health eventually stabilized, and after much hard work and determination, she received her Master of Arts in Humanities from Central Michigan University. Nearly 15 years after putting her education on pause, she successfully completed her lifelong goal while living with SPMS. MS can be an isolating disease. In our experience, it’s often challenging to find the support you need on a daily basis. It’s sometimes difficult for family and friends to provide this kind of emotional, spiritual, and physical support because they — and even those of us living with MS! — don’t fully understand what’s needed from day to day. But this can all change when we set and spell out the goals we hope to achieve. This makes it easier for people to understand and wrap their brains around what we’re looking to do. And it makes it less daunting for those of us living with a chronic condition because we realize we’re not dealing with it alone. We both had a goal to write a book about our life with MS and how we rise above the challenges it presents. As if it wasn’t enough to write and pull all the copy together, we needed to turn our sheets of written words into an attractive, meticulously-edited publication. All of this by ourselves? Yeah, quite a lofty goal. Fortunately, we have some incredible friends who are professional writers and designers and were wholeheartedly on board with sharing their talents to help us achieve this goal. Their support made the book less about just us and more about a shared vision of friends and family. Most goals can seem daunting at first. That’s why it’s important to write it out, develop a plan, and break your ultimate goal into smaller segments. Each accomplishment you make gets you that much closer to realizing your goal, so celebrate everything! For example, with every class Jennifer completed, she was that much closer to earning her master’s degree. Celebrating the little moments builds momentum and keeps you energized and moving forward. And sometimes we mean that literally! We drive to Iowa each summer to spend time with Dan’s family. It’s a nearly 10-hour drive in our handicapped accessible van, which Dan has to drive the entire time. That’s a long drive for anyone — let alone when you’re living with MS. There’s always some excitement about seeing family we haven’t seen in a year that charges us for the ride to the Hawkeye state. But our return trip to Michigan can be quite grueling. However, we’ve found a way to keep everything in perspective. We have small celebrations to encourage us on our 10-hour trek. With every minute we’re on the road, we know we’re that much closer to being safely back home. Living with SPMS is challenging, but it shouldn’t stop you from having and achieving personal goals. There’s a lot the disease has taken from us, but we think that it’s important to keep our eyes set on all we have yet to accomplish. Even when it gets frustrating, it’s crucial to never give up on going after your goals. MS is here for the long haul, but more importantly, so are you! — More in Finding Balance with Progressing Multiple Sclerosis Lifestyle Modifications That Make a Difference for Secondary Progressive MS Understanding Secondary-Progressive Multiple Sclerosis Mobility Support Devices for Secondary Progressive MS: Braces, Walking Devices, and More FDA Approves 2 New Multiple Sclerosis Drugs: What You Need to Know New Medication and Treatment Options for Secondary Progressive MS Understanding Secondary-Progressive Multiple Sclerosis Secondary-progressive MS (SPMS) is a form of multiple sclerosis.

None of the clinical or MRI measures suggested benefit of MIS416 over placebo. The company announced plans to continue analyzing the results for safety and benefits, and to determine whether its compassionate use program, which makes MIS416 available to some people with secondary progressive MS in Australia, will continue.   DETAILS : MIS416 is a naturally occurring agent derived from bacteria that can alter immune responses. Innate Immunotherapeutics Limited, has been supporting research into MIS416 for the treatment of secondary progressive MS. In 2010, the National MS Society, through it Fast Forward commercial research funding mechanism, helped to support its early testing. The company has been making MIS416 available through a compassionate use program in Australia.   The recently completed trial was a one-year, phase 2 trial involving 93 people with secondary progressive MS in Australia and New Zealand. About two-thirds of them were randomly assigned to receive weekly intravenous (into vein) injections of MIS416, and the rest received inactive placebo. The team tested a variety of outcomes including walking speed, vision, cognition, progression of disability, MRI brain scans, and participants’ impressions of the benefits of the therapy. None of the measures showed significant differences between those on active therapy and those on placebo.   In terms of safety and tolerability, the announcement notes that there was a higher incidence of adverse events in those taking MIS416 possibly associated with the fever, chills, muscle weakness that some experienced after the first dose.   “It is disappointing that these results don’t show benefit for people with secondary progressive MS, for whom there are few treatment options,” said Bruce Bebo, PhD, Executive Vice President, Research, at the National MS Society.   The study’s sponsor, Innate Immunotherapeutics Limited, announced plans to continue analyzing data to see if there were any subgroups of participants who responded to therapy, to further understand the drug’s tolerability, and to determine whether its compassionate use program will continue.

Walking improved, but not significantly. Safety issues included stomach upset and two cases of kidney dysfunction. The researchers are planning to further evaluate whether lipoic acid is a safe and effective treatment for progressive MS. The team (Rebecca Spain, MD, MSPH, Oregon Health & Science University, and colleagues) report their findings in , an open access journal (). DETAILS: Antioxidants are natural or manmade substances found in many foods. In MS, the immune system damages and destroys myelin, the material that surrounds and protects nerve fibers in the brain and spinal cord. Nerve fibers themselves are damaged as well, which appears to drive long-term disability. “Free radicals” are normal by-products of bodily processes, and may cause tissue injury and turn on immune attacks in MS. Antioxidants block the action of free radicals. Controlled trials are underway to test the potential of several antioxidants for treating MS.   Drs. Rebecca Spain, Dennis Bourdette (Oregon Health & Science University) and colleagues randomly assigned 51 people with secondary progressive MS to receive lipoic acid (1,200 mg) or placebo by mouth daily for two years. The primary outcome was the change in percentage of brain volume as measured on MRI scans. Secondary measures included changes in disability and walking, quality of life, and safety.   The results showed that the rate of brain volume loss was reduced by 68% in the lipoic acid group compared to the placebo group. Brain volume loss is thought to be associated with MS disability; a reduction in the rate of brain volume loss may result in less disability. A test showed improvement in walking in the lipoic acid group, although this change did not reach statistical significance. The lipoic acid group also reported significantly fewer falls than the placebo group.   Adverse events in the lipoic acid group included stomach upset, along with one case of kidney failure and one case of kidney inflammation. The authors suggest close monitoring of kidney function in future studies of lipoic acid, and that caution should be exercised before recommending this dosage, since the kidney problems had not occurred in previous studies.   The team reports its findings in , an open access journal ().   This team is planning at multiple medical centers to further evaluate whether lipoic acid is a safe and effective treatment for progressive MS. This study is not yet recruiting participants.   Multiple sclerosis is an unpredictable, often disabling . range from numbness and tingling to blindness and paralysis, and there is currently no cure for MS.

bf8eed9b-2548-46ba-9838-d06b4bfde7ae,"Complementary & Alternative Medicines Find Programs & Services in Your Area COVID-19 Vaccine Guidance for People Living with MS     SPMS follows an initial relapsing-remitting course. Some people who are diagnosed with RRMS will eventually transition to a secondary progressive course in which there is a progressive worsening of neurologic function (accumulation of disability) over time. SPMS can be further characterized as either (with relapses and/or evidence of new MRI activity during a specified period of time) or, as well as  (evidence of disability accrual over time, with or without relapses or new MRI activity) or . This graphic shows the kinds of disease activity that can occur in SPMS; however each person's experience with SPMS will be unique. Following a period of relapsing-remitting disease, disability gradually increases over time, with or without evidence of disease activity (relapses or changes on MRI). In SPMS, occasional relapses may occur, as well as periods of stability. Disease activity and progression should be evaluated at least yearly by neurologic examination and MRI. Being able to characterize the course of your disease at different points in time helps you and your MS care provider discuss your treatment options and expected outcomes.  For example:   If you have SPMS that is active, you and your MS care provider will want to talk about treatment with a disease-modifying therapy to reduce the risk of a relapse. If you have SPMS that is active and progressing despite the medication you are taking, the conversation with your MS care provider might be about the potential benefits and risks associated with switching to a more aggressive treatment strategy. If your SPMS is not active but there is evidence of progression and accumulation of disability, you and your MS care provider will want to focus on rehabilitation strategies to help improve your function and mobility, and promote safety and independence. If your SPMS is stable without activity or progression, the conversation with your MS care provider could focus on rehabilitation and other symptom management strategies to help you maintain function. How does SPMS differ from the other disease courses? SPMS occurs in people who initially had a relapsing-remitting disease course. In other words, SPMS occurs as a second phase of the disease for many individuals. In SPMS, people may or may not continue to experience relapses caused by inflammation; the disease gradually changes from the inflammatory process seen in RRMS to a more steadily progressive phase characterized by nerve damage or loss. Read more about strategies to help you lead a full life with secondary progressive MS. Prior to the availability of the approved disease-modifying therapies, studies indicated that 50 percent of those diagnosed with relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) would transition to secondary-progressive MS (SPMS) within 10 years, and 90 percent would transition within 25 years. While MS experts agree that the medications have an impact on disease progression, it is too soon to tell the extent to which the disease-modifying treatments alter or delay the transition to SPMS. The National MS Society is pursuing all promising research paths and collaborating worldwide to drive progress in research in progressive MS, for which few therapies exist.

c4ceab04-e5d6-4767-8954-3f86e2d6d50a,"— Research suggests that cigarette smoking speeds the progression from relapsing-remitting MS to secondary progressive MS, greatly reducing the quality of patients’ lives. From the day the Surgeon General’s on the hazards of cigarette smoking was released in 1964, the public has been aware of its negative health effects, but few know that for patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) smoking may have a direct impact on the progression of their disease. In a conducted in the Department of Neurology at the Guilan University of Medical Sciences in Rasht, Iran, researchers found that patients suffering from relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) who also smoked more than ten cigarettes per day had a greater risk than non-smokers of progressing to secondary progressive MS, or SPMS. While relapsing-remitting MS is characterized by periods of disease activity followed by periods of remission, those with secondary progressive MS no longer experience remission, but rather their disease remains on a “low simmer” and, as the damage to their brain and spinal cord progresses, they experience ever greater disability. The study participants were all patients registered with the MS Society in Guilan, Iran. The authors concluded that, “smokers have an increased risk for progression of RRMS to SPMS compared with non-smokers. We also showed that the disease progression may be influenced by [an] increase in cigarette smoking.” on the effects of smoking on MS progression conducted by researchers at the Harvard School of Public Health in 2005 suggested that “the risk of developing secondary progressive multiple sclerosis was more than three times higher in smokers than in non-smokers who had a relapsing–remitting clinical onset of multiple sclerosis.” However, smoking may be part of an overall unhealthy lifestyle, which can contribute to the worsening of disease. “Information on other habits was not available and thus we could not adjust for them,” said Dr. Miguel A. Hernán of the Harvard School of Public Health in an interview with Healthline. “This is certainly a limitation of the study.” While the findings suggest a correlation between cigarette smoking and disease progression in MS, it’s unclear just what mechanism is at work. MS is a chronic, inflammatory autoimmune disease in which the immune system attacks the protective myelin sheath covering nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord. In order to launch an attack on this myelin sheath, T-cells from the immune system must first traverse the blood-brain barrier (BBB) which, according to is “a dynamic interface that separates the brain from the circulatory system and protects the central nervous system from potentially harmful chemicals.” In on the effects of cigarette smoking on the BBB, researchers at the Cleveland Clinic Learner College of Medicine found that “compounds contained in TS [tobacco smoke] may affect the viability of cells comprising the BBB and trigger an inflammatory response that, in turn, may further lead to loss of BBB integrity.” While studies have yet to be conducted on the effects of a BBB compromised by cigarette smoking on the escalation of disease progression in MS patients who smoke, these conclusions suggest that further research needs to be done. In the meantime, MS patients should read the smoke signals and take charge of one of the few aspects of their health they can control.“MS patients may know that smoking is associated with an increased risk of developing MS, and smoking appears to speed up the progression of MS,” said David Antonuccio, Ph.D., Professor Emeritus of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences at the University of Nevada School of Medicine, in an interview with Healthline. “The hope is that quitting smoking will slow the progression. Nevertheless, some patients may fear a flare-up if they quit, though I have not seen any convincing evidence that quitting smoking can increase the risk of a flare-up. “Most patients will feel uncomfortable (increased anxiety, insomnia, increased craving, gastrointestinal problems, headaches) when they quit smoking for a few days to a couple of weeks initially after quitting, whether they have MS or not, but after withdrawal is completed, they usually feel better,” he added. Antonuccio, who ran the stop smoking clinic at the Reno Veteran’s Administration Medical Center for 24 years and authored the self-help ebook , advises MS patients to take advantage of the tools provided by doctors and clinics to help them quit, including “setting a target quit day, tracking smoking prior to quit day, learning relaxation skills, using nicotine replacement like a nicotine patch on quit day and for several weeks thereafter, cleaning out the house and car of all smoking remnants, seeking social support, [and] developing healthy substitute behaviors like exercise or healthy snacking. “Nicotine replacement as an adjunct to behavioral skills can be very helpful,” he added. “From my perspective though, it doesn’t make sense to add other medications (like bupropion or varenicline) out of concern for complicating the MS patient’s already complicated medical condition with such medications that can increase the risk of side effects and adverse events. “ By eating right, getting plenty of rest, and avoiding things we know to be unhealthy—including cigarettes—an MS sufferer may be able to positively affect the course of the disease.

(MS) is a chronic, inflammatory disease of that involves an immune-mediated attack on the central nervous system. Myelin and the oligodendrocytes that form myelin appear to be the primary targets of the inflammatory attack, although the themselves are also damaged. The inflammatory attack on CNS white matter is associated with T lymphocyte activity (Th-1 and Th-17), impairment of regulatory T cell function and B lymphocyte activity (antibody and complement). Gray and white matter are targeted by the abnormal immune response. The collective damage to white and gray matter results in a broad spectrum of clinical signs and symptoms. The disease is thought to be precipitated by a combination of one or more environmental triggers acting in a genetically susceptible individual. In approximately 85 percent of patients, MS begins with a . In a much smaller percentage of patients, the disease is progressive from onset (primary-progressive MS). Most people with RRMS have fewer relapses and less inflammatory activity over time, eventually transitioning to a more progressive course -- secondary-progressive MS (SPMS). The onset of SPMS appears to be a dominant determinant of long-term disease prognosis (). Male sex, older age at disease onset, and a higher number of early relapses are associated with a higher probability of progressive disease and shorter time to SPMS (, ). A prediction model based on age, cortical lesion load, and cerebellar cortical volume has been offered to explain the probability of evolving to SPMS (). There is growing evidence that gray matter damage plays a pivotal role in MS disease progression (, , & ). Preventing the onset of SPMS is a primary target of treatment at this time (). Much of the CNS damage in MS is believed to result from an immune-mediated process that includes components of the innate immune system as well as adaptive immune system activation of certain lymphocyte populations in peripheral lymphoid organs.

670b51d8-75a7-4bf7-aa52-aaf118dc82c1,"Everything You Need to Know About Transitioning from RRMS to SPMS — Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a progressive disease of the central nervous system (CNS) that affects your brain and the spinal cord. According to the National MS Society, about people over the age of 18 live with this condition in the United States. MS is an autoimmune disease in which the immune system attacks the CNS. This triggers inflammation and damages myelin, an insulating material that surrounds nerve fibers. The exact mechanism of how someone gets the disease is unknown. However, we do know that there is likely a combination of triggers including genetic and environmental factors. Damage to these fibers can trigger multiple neurological symptoms. This includes fatigue, numbness, weakness, cognitive problems, and issues with walking. The severity of your symptoms varies from person-to-person, and depends on the type of MS you have. Many people are initially diagnosed with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS). But over time, symptoms can progress to another type of MS, known as secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (SPMS). Here’s what you need to know about both types of MS. RRMS refers to a type of MS in which you experience periods of new MS symptoms or relapses followed by periods of remission. Remission is when symptoms improve or disappear. During relapses, you may have new typical MS symptoms like numbness, tingling, and blurred vision. These symptoms can lasts for days, weeks, or months, and then slowly improve over weeks to months. Some people experience complete disappearance of their symptoms during remission. On the other hand, if your symptoms continue, they may not be as severe. About with MS receive an RRMS diagnosis at first. Many people experience progression of their symptoms after living with RRMS for some time. This means that the disease becomes more active, and periods of remission become less and less frequent. This stage of MS is known as secondary progressive multiple sclerosis or SPMS. This condition is best described as MS without relapses. MS affects everyone differently, and not everyone with RRMS will transition to SPMS. But SPMS only develops after an initial diagnosis of RRMS. You’ll have typical MS symptoms during the transition from RRMS to SPMS, but you may experience a slow worsening of symptoms. You may even develop new symptoms. Before, maybe you had numbness or mild weakness, and these didn’t interfere much with your daily life. Once you transition to SPMS, though, you may notice cognitive changes, such as difficulty finding words. You may also have increased difficulty with walking or more noticeable numbness and tingling. The cause of this transition is unknown, but it may have to do with the disappearance of nerve fibers as the result of progressive nerve damage. Or it may be connected to the progressive loss of grey matter, which can be more subtle. Some people transition soon after an MS diagnosis, whereas others live with RRMS for decades before transitioning to SPMS. Since MS symptoms are unpredictable, it can be difficult to distinguish an RRMS relapse from the onset of SPMS. Speak with your doctor if you feel that you’re experiencing new or worsening symptoms. Your doctor can use an imaging test like an MRI to examine inflammation in your brain. Based on the level of inflammation in your brain as well as your relapse history, your doctor can determine whether your symptoms are a new relapse or SPMS. Even though some people with RRMS eventually transition to SPMS, it’s possible to delay disease progression. Treating MS is key to improving your symptoms and quality of life, and ultimately, slowing down the disease. Your doctor can prescribe disease-modifying therapies to help decrease inflammation, which can also improve the severity and frequency of your attacks. These include injectable, oral, and infusion medications such as: These treatments and others can help with the relapsing forms of MS. Talk to your doctor to find out which one is best for you. You may also receive intravenous corticosteroids to reduce acute inflammation in your CNS. This helps speed up recovery from an MS relapse. MS is a progressive condition that can lead to disability. You may eventually require some type of rehabilitation to help with daily living. Programs vary based on your needs. If you’re having difficulty with speech or swallowing, you may receive assistance from a speech or language pathologist. Or you may need appointments with an occupational therapist if you’re having difficulty with personal care, housework, or employment. Lifestyle changes can help improve your symptoms, too. Regular exercise may reduce spasticity and joint stiffness. It can improve both your flexibility and your overall health. Plus, exercise increases the brain’s production of endorphins, which are hormones that help regulate your emotions and mood. To avoid injury, start slow with gentle activities like water aerobics or walking. It’s also important to stretch both before and after activity to reduce muscle spasms, which are common in MS. Learn how to pace yourself and set limits. Additionally, you’ll want to avoid foods that can increase inflammation. These include highly processed foods such as hamburgers and hot dogs and foods high in salt. Examples of foods that can reduce inflammation are whole foods such as green leafy vegetables, fish high in omega-3s, and fruits such as blackberries and raspberries. If you smoke, talk to your doctor about ways to quit. Some people feel better after confiding in a close friend or family member, or after joining a support group for MS. MS is a serious condition, but early treatment can help you achieve remission and slow the progression of the disease. Worsening of symptoms can also interfere with the quality of your life. Talk with your doctor if you develop any new symptoms or signs of advancing MS. — More in Finding Balance with Progressing Multiple Sclerosis Lifestyle Modifications That Make a Difference for Secondary Progressive MS Understanding Secondary-Progressive Multiple Sclerosis Mobility Support Devices for Secondary Progressive MS: Braces, Walking Devices, and More FDA Approves 2 New Multiple Sclerosis Drugs: What You Need to Know New Medication and Treatment Options for Secondary Progressive MS Understanding Secondary-Progressive Multiple Sclerosis Secondary-progressive MS (SPMS) is a form of multiple sclerosis.

The team (Drs. Mika Komori, Bibiana Bielekova, and others at the National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD) has published results in () Currently available disease-modifying therapies for relapsing forms of MS generally are not effective in people with progressive forms of MS who do not experience relapses or show other signs of active inflammation. Recent research suggests that inflammation may be occurring within compartments of the brain and spinal cord in progressive MS, where current therapies do not reach because the blood-brain barrier limits what can gain access to the brain from the bloodstream. Researchers at the National Institutes of Health launched a small, controlled clinical trial to understand whether the medication rituximab, which is used to treat rheumatoid arthritis and some types of cancer, is able to slow down or stop the progression of . Rituximab depletes immune B cells, which are thought to play a role in immune-system-mediated damage to nervous system tissues in MS. This study investigated whether rituximab would reach the brain and spinal cord if participants received it by both intravenous (by vein) and intrathecal infusion (through a lumbar puncture into the cerebrospinal fluid, or “spinal tap”). The dynamics of how B cells are reduced, whether in spinal fluid, or from the central nervous system, remain unclear. Investigators recruited 27 people with secondary-progressive MS, and randomly assigned them to receive either rituximab or placebo through both intravenous (2 infusions) and intrathecal infusion (2 infusions). The primary outcome measure was to determine whether rituximab could decrease brain atrophy – loss of brain tissue volume – significantly more than placebo. However, the investigators planned an interim analysis to determine if B cells were being depleted in the spinal fluid as an indirect way of measuring whether the rituximab was getting into the central nervous system.   The interim analysis revealed that B cells in the spinal fluid were not depleted sufficiently, suggesting that rituximab would not be able to achieve the desired endpoint. The team also found that a biochemical indicator of nerve damage, called neurofilament light chain, did not change as a result of the treatment. Therefore, the study was terminated.   The team (Drs. Mika Komori, Bibiana Bielekova, and others, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD) has published results in ()   B cell-depleting therapies remain under study for the treatment of MS, including progressive MS.

It’s never too soon or too late to think about how to access high quality care. Knowing what to look for, where to find it, and how to work effectively with your doctor and other health professionals is essential to your health and quality of life.  While there is no way to predict with any certainty how an individual’s disease will progress, four basic MS disease courses (also called types or phenotypes) have been defined by the International Advisory Committee on Clinical Trials of MS in 2013: clinically isolated syndrome, relapsing remitting, secondary progressive and primary progressive. In 2020, the same committee published a , highlighting the need for time framing the modifiers “activity” and “progression” and guidance for using the terms “worsening” or “progression” to describe the disease. Although not considered a course of MS,  has been used to classify those with abnormalities on MRI of the brain and/or spinal cord consistent with lesions of MS - not explained by another diagnosis - and who also have no past or current neurological symptoms or abnormalities found on neurological exam. Often these individuals have had an MRI because of other symptoms, such as headache, and were found to have lesions that appear similar to those seen in MS. A found a little over half of people with RIS go on to develop MS within ten years. There are no specific treatment guidelines for RIS and additional research is needed to further define what factors increase the likelihood that someone with RIS will develop MS. Monitoring of MRI and neurological symptoms, and neurological examination are generally recommended to quickly identify changes. If the diagnosis is MS, treatment can be started early. Research interest in RIS is high and , which could provide more guidance for monitoring and treatment. CIS is a first episode of neurologic symptoms caused by inflammation and in the central nervous system. The episode, which by definition must last for at least 24 hours, is characteristic of multiple sclerosis but does not yet meet the criteria for a because people who experience a CIS may or may not go on to develop MS. When CIS is accompanied by lesions on a brain MRI () that are similar to those seen in MS, the person has a high likelihood of a second episode of neurologic symptoms and diagnosis of relapsing-remitting MS. When CIS is not accompanied by MS-like lesions on a brain MRI, the person has a much lower likelihood of developing MS. The make it possible to diagnose MS in a person with CIS who also has specific findings on brain MRI that provide evidence of an earlier episode of damage in a different location and indicate active inflammation in a region other than the one causing the current symptoms. As MRI technology improves, the diagnosis of MS will be made more quickly and easily. In the meantime, individuals with CIS who are considered at high risk for developing MS may now be treated with a that has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for that purpose. Early treatment of CIS has been shown to delay onset of MS. RRMS – the most common disease course – is characterized by clearly defined attacks of new or increasing neurologic symptoms. These attacks – also called relapses or exacerbations – are followed by periods of partial or complete recovery (remissions). During remissions, all symptoms may disappear, or some symptoms may continue and become permanent. However, there is no apparent progression of the disease during the periods of remission. RRMS can be further characterized as either (with relapses and/or evidence of new MRI activity over a specified period of time) or , as well as (a confirmed increase in disability following a relapse) or . Approximately 85 percent of people with MS are initially diagnosed with RRMS. This graphic shows the kinds of disease activity that can occur in RRMS over time; however each person's experience with RRMS will be unique. Following a relapse, the new symptoms may disappear without causing any increase in level of disability, or the new symptoms may partially disappear, resulting in an increase in disability. New lesions on MRI, as shown by the arrows, often occur as part of a relapse. However, new MRI lesions indicating MS activity may also occur without symptoms of which the person is aware.  SPMS follows an initial relapsing-remitting course. Some people who are diagnosed with RRMS will eventually transition to a secondary progressive course in which there is a progressive worsening of neurologic function (accumulation of disability) over time. SPMS can be further characterized as either (with relapses and/or evidence of new MRI activity during a specified period of time) or, as well as  (evidence of disability accumulation over time, with or without relapses or new MRI activity) or . This graphic shows the kinds of disease activity that can occur in SPMS over time; however each person's experience with SPMS will be unique. SPMS follows after relapsing-remitting MS. Disability gradually increases over time, with or without evidence of disease activity (relapses or changes on MRI). In SPMS, occasional relapses may occur, as well as periods of stability. PPMS is characterized by worsening neurologic function (accumulation of disability) from the onset of symptoms, without early relapses or remissions. PPMS can be further characterized as either (with an occasional relapse and/or evidence of new MRI activity over a specified period of time) or , as well as  (evidence of disability accumulation over time, with or without relapse or new MRI activity) or . Approximately 15 percent of people with MS are diagnosed with PPMS. This graphic shows the kinds of disease activity that can occur in PPMS over time; however each person's experience with PPMS will be unique. PPMS can have brief periods when the disease is stable, with or without a relapse or new MRI activity, as well as periods when increasing disability occurs with or without new relapses or lesions on MRI. There are more than a dozen approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat all types of MS. Each drug has an indication from the FDA for the type of MS it can be used to treat.

Approximately 250,000 to 350,000 people have been diagnosed with M.S. in the United States (Schoenstadt, 2006). Every week, 200 new people are diagnosed with M.S. in our country (National MS Society, n.d.). M.S. can affect each person differently. Damage to the myelin in the Central Nervous System and nerve fibers disturb the signals sent between the brain and spinal cord to other parts of the body causing the primary symptoms of Multiple Sclerosis (National MS Society, n.d.)Symptoms can come and go without any warning. An idea on how to help people suffering from M.S. is to have a dietitian either come to an M.S. housing building or support group, and introduce a healthy, nutritious diet that will help decrease the symptoms of Multiple Sclerosis. There are many diets out there that can help reduce symptoms and weight. Using a dietitian to introduce a healthy diet to those with M.S. can be very beneficial because it can decrease their pain and exacerbations, and improve the quality of their lives. There are four different types of M.S. that people can have. They are relapsing- remitting (RRMS), secondary progressive (SPMS), primary progressive (PPMS) and progressive-relapsing Multiple Sclerosis (PRMS) (National MS Society, n.d.). RRMS is when patients have relapses followed by periods of recovery (Mayo Clinic, 2012). SPMS occurs when there are relapses and partial recoveries, but the disability progressively gets worse until a steady progression of disability replaces cycles of exacerbations (Mayo Clinic, 2012). PPMS is when the disease progresses slowly and steadily from start with no periods of remissions (Mayo Clinic, 2012). Finally, PRMS is a rare type of M.S. where people experience both steadily worsening symptoms and attacks during times of remission (Mayo Clinic, 2012). To people who have Multiple Sclerosis, being diagnosed with any one of these types can be depressing. People with Multiple Sclerosis often suffer with extreme pain. My Mom has been living with M.S. for over 15 years now and she struggles with severe back pain every day. She is currently seeing a pain management doctor to help relieve some of her pain. M.S. patients can have pain in two different areas, which are neuropathic and musculoskeletal. Neuropathic pain is caused by the disruption in how the nerves carry messages within the brain and spinal cord (Multiple Sclerosis Trust, 2012).Musculoskeletal pain is from damage to muscles, tendons, ligaments, and soft tissue (Multiple Sclerosis Trust, 2012).Even with the use of pain medication, the pain associated with M.S. can be very hard to deal with. There are certain foods that can reduce inflammation and pain in people who have M.S. Anything that can lessen or stop the use of pain medication would be valuable to patients. Multiple Sclerosis affects a person’s brain and spinal cord causing a variety of troubling symptoms. The most common symptoms of M.S. are pain, fatigue, numbness, poor motor skills and vision problems. There are also many other symptoms that can trouble those who suffer from M.S. Other common symptoms are trouble walking, bladder, bowel dysfunction, dizziness, depression, and spasticity. Through diet and exercise, people with M.S. can improve some of those problems and lead a healthier, more productive life. A dietitian can help them focus on the foods and exercises that will eliminate or reduce the symptoms that bother them the most. M.S. patients struggle their whole lives dealing with exacerbations. They never know when one will come and how long it will last for. During an exacerbation, a lot of different problems can occur. An exacerbation is a relapse or flare up of Multiple Sclerosis symptoms. It can bring on new symptoms or... References: Gandy, J. Journal of Human Nutrition and Dietetics. (Feb 2007). 20 (1), 1.

This disease starts as an auto-immune disease in which CD4 T cells cross the blood brain barrier and attack myelin sheaths of olygodendrocytes resulting in demyelination (Gandhi et al., 2010; Lund et al., 2013). Initially this is a transient process and re-myelination occurs, so initial stage of the disease is characterized by neurological dysfunctions that eventually recover. However this re-myelination is not permanent (Compston and Coles, 2008; Wakerley et al., 2012). The continuous immune attacks cause serious pathological changes of myelin sheaths hence disease progression and development of serious disabilities . (Makris et al., 2013; Wakerley et al., 2012; Hafler, 2004; Nylander and Hafler, 2012; Eshaghi et al., 2013). Peak age of the initial diagnosis of MS is 30 and the disease progress overtime causing a in decline in health and even mortality (Makris et al., 2013). Though it is subjective the average decrease in life expectancy of a patient with MS is 5 to 10 years after the disease is being diagnosed (Keegan and Noseworthy, 2002). Disabilities caused by the disease vary between patients and depend on the abnormalities of the neuronal track that is affected (Leray et al., 2010). Some disabilities include numbness, muscle...

MS affects approximately 400,000 people in the United States alone. The onset of MS is usually between 20 and 40 years of age and is more common in women; men may have a more severe progressive course (Luzzio, 2013). Life expectancy is shortened in persons with MS, and the survival rate is linked to disability. Death usually results from secondary complications but can also be due to primary complications unrelated to MS. The occurrence rate of MS is affected by gene-environment interactions in susceptible individuals (Huether & McCance, 2012). Definition of Disorder is a progressive, inflammatory, demyelinating disorder of the central nervous system (CNS), which can affect the peripheral nervous system (PNS) as well. This disorder affects movements, sensation, and bodily functions (National Society [NMSS], 2012). There are several types of MS, these include: mixed (general), spinal, and cerebellar.

Gilenya, was approved in 2010 for adults with relapsing forms of MS to reduce the frequency of clinical relapses and to delay the accumulation of physical disability. Siponimod previously demonstrated safety and efficacy on MRI scans in a phase II study in people with relapsing-remitting MS (The Lancet Neurology, 2013 Aug;12(8):756-67). Siponimod is thought to act by retaining certain white blood cells in the body’s lymph nodes, keeping them out of circulation and from entering the central nervous system. Siponimod also distributes effectively to the central nervous system (brain and spinal cord) where it may have direct anti-inflammatory or other effects.   Participants with  were randomly assigned to take siponimod or placebo capsules daily for up to 60 months. The primary endpoint of the study was reducing the risk of disability progression, as measured by the EDSS scale that was sustained for at least 3 months. Secondary endpoints included reducing the risk of disability progression as measured by the EDSS at six months, the risk of worsening mobility as measured by the timed 25-foot walk test, disease activity as observed on MRI scans, relapse rate, and safety/tolerability.   The results were originally presented in September 2016 at the ECTRIMS conference. The trial met its primary endpoint of reducing the risk of disability progression compared with inactive placebo. Those on active treatment had a 21% reduced risk of disability progression (confirmed at 3 months) compared to those on placebo. Secondary endpoints suggested that those on active therapy had a 23% lower average change in brain volume, and reduced MRI-detected brain lesion volume. There was no significant difference seen between groups in the timed 25-foot walk. Relapse rates were significantly lower in those taking siponimod.   The therapy was generally well tolerated and similar to adverse events reported for related compounds. Serious adverse events occurred in 16.7% of participants. The serious adverse events reported to be more likely for those taking siponimod included nervous system disorders and infections. More of those taking siponimod than the placebo experienced adverse events (89% vs 82% patients), such as a slower heart rate, high blood pressure, reduced white blood cell counts, macular oedema (swelling at the back of the eye), increased liver enzymes, and increased numbers of convulsions.

67bc5e70-d487-475c-afdf-8701cd96fba3,"Mayzent (Siponimod) Tablets Approved by the FDA for Adults with Relapsing Forms of MS, Including Active SPMS Mayzent (Siponimod) Tablets Approved by the FDA for Adults with Relapsing Forms of MS, Including Active SPMS In a dated March 26, 2019, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced the approval of Mayzent® (siponimod) oral tablets to treat adults with relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (MS). The approval includes individuals with clinically isolated syndrome, relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS), and active secondary-progressive MS (SPMS). Mayzent is the only disease-modifying therapy (DMT) to be approved in recent years for active secondary-progressive MS. According to Novartis, the makers of Mayzent, the medication is expected to be available in the United States in approximately one week (early April). Patients will not require a first-dose observation (FDO) to monitor for cardiac events upon initiation, unless they have certain pre-existing cardiac conditions. According to MSAA’s Chief Medical Consultant Dr. Jack Burks, “The FDA approval of Mayzent for wide-ranging forms of MS – including active SPMS, RRMS, and CIS – is very good news for members of the MS community. The lack of first-dose cardiac events and the fact that it will soon be available both add to the good news. MSAA, the medical community, and those affected by MS, are greatly pleased to hear of this exciting new approval.” The FDA’s press release explains that most people with MS start with a relapsing-remitting course of symptom flare-ups and remissions, possibly with some degree of residual disability. Over time, some patients experience an increase in disability that is independent of relapses, and this is referred to as “secondary-progressive MS.” Initially, people with this form of MS may still experience relapses, which is referred to as “active” secondary-progressive MS – the form that Mayzent is approved to treat. Without treatment, many of those with this form of MS eventually experience continued progression of disability without relapses, and this is referred to as “non-active” secondary-progressive MS. Mayzent is not approved for this latter form of the disease. According to MSAA’s , siponimod is a drug with a mechanism of action similar to Gilenya® (fingolimod). Like Gilenya, it works at the S1P receptor family to block the movement of lymph cells from lymph nodes; however, siponimod appears to interact with fewer of the receptors than Gilenya does – with its primary actions at the S1P1 and the S1P5 receptors. Siponimod has a relatively short half-life compared to Gilenya, which means that the drug does not stay in the body as long. Researchers hope that these small differences will minimize cardiac issues. The approval was based on the results of the EXPAND trial, a Phase III, multi-national study of siponimod involving more than 1,600 people with secondary-progressive MS. Results of the study were published in in March 2018. The participants were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive siponimod or placebo. The trial was scheduled to run for three years or until a pre-specified number of confirmed disability progression events (CDP) occurred. The primary endpoint was time to three-month CDP. The study found that, relative to placebo, siponimod reduced the risk of three-month CDP by 21 percent, cut the risk of six-month CDP by 26 percent, slowed the rate of brain volume loss by 23 percent, and reduced the annual relapse rate by 55 percent. No significant difference was found between siponimod and placebo in terms of two walking tests studied in the trial. Novartis notes that the EXPAND trial also showed significant favorable outcomes in other relevant measures of MS disease activity, including cognition, reduced disease activity as shown on MRI, and reduced brain-volume loss (brain shrinkage). Eighteen percent of patients in the siponimod group and 15 percent of those receiving placebo experienced serious adverse events. A decrease in white blood cells, heart rate, and rhythm abnormalities, as well as hypertension, swelling of the macula of the eye, varicella zoster reactivation, and convulsions occurred more often in patients receiving siponimod than in those in the placebo group. The rate of infections, cancer, and death did not differ between the groups, and adjusting the initial dose of siponimod mitigated cardiac effects seen in early treatment with the medication. According to the FDA, Mayzent must be dispensed with a patient Medication Guide, providing important information about how the medication is used as well as potential risks. Patients taking Mayzent need to be monitored for changes in vision caused by macular edema, transient decreases in heart rate, decline in lung function, and changes in liver enzymes, which also need to be checked prior to starting the drug. Blood pressure should be monitored during treatment, and women who could become pregnant should use contraception during and for 10 days after stopping treatment to avoid potential risk of fetal harm. Healthcare professionals will need to monitor for other risks as well. Headache, high blood pressure, and changes in liver function tests were the most common adverse reactions reported by individuals taking Mayzent.

Systematic screening of generic drugs for progressive multiple sclerosis identifies clomipramine as a promising therapeutic Systematic screening of generic drugs for progressive multiple sclerosis identifies clomipramine as a promising therapeutic , Article number:  () The treatment of progressive multiple sclerosis (MS) is unsatisfactory. One reason is that the drivers of disease, which include iron-mediated neurotoxicity, lymphocyte activity, and oxidative stress, are not simultaneously targeted. Here we present a systematic screen to identify generic, orally available medications that target features of progressive MS. Of 249 medications that cross the blood–brain barrier, 35 prevent iron-mediated neurotoxicity in culture. Of these, several antipsychotics and antidepressants strongly reduce T-cell proliferation and oxidative stress. We focus on the antidepressant clomipramine and found that it additionally inhibits B-lymphocyte activity. In mice with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, a model of MS, clomipramine ameliorates clinical signs of acute and chronic phases. Histologically, clomipramine reduces inflammation and microglial activation, and preserves axonal integrity. In summary, we present a systematic approach to identify generic medications for progressive multiple sclerosis with the potential to advance rapidly into clinical trials, and we highlight clomipramine for further development. Multiple sclerosis is a multifactorial inflammatory condition of the CNS leading to damage of the myelin sheath and axons/neurons followed by neurological symptoms. Approximately 85% of multiple sclerosis patients present with a relapsing-remitting phenotype and the majority of these evolve to a secondary-progressive disease course after 15–20 years. 10–15% of the patients experience a primary progressive disease course with slow and continuous deterioration without definable relapses. While there have been tremendous successes in the development of medications for relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis during the last decade, nearly all studies conducted in progressive multiple sclerosis have failed such as the recently published INFORMS study on the sphingosine-1-phosphate inhibitor fingolimod. However, the results of two Phase 3 trials of ocrelizumab in primary progressive and siponimod in secondary progressive multiple sclerosis were announced recently to have met their primary outcomes. Orcelizumab has since been approved for use in primary progressive MS. The reasons for the general lack of medications in progressive multiple sclerosis are manifold. One explanation is that the underlying pathology of progressive multiple sclerosis has profound differences to the relapsing-remitting form. Examples include the more pronounced neurodegenerative aspects of the progressive disease in conjunction with significant mitochondrial damage, iron accumulation which contributes to the elevated oxidative stress from several sources, and the more common representation of B-cell follicular structures underneath the meninges in progressive cases. Moreover, the blood–brain barrier in progressive multiple sclerosis appears to be repaired compared to the breach in relapsing-remitting disease, so medications will require the capacity to enter the CNS. Another pathologic feature seen in all types of multiple sclerosis but appears exacerbated in progressive cases is intense focal microglia activation. We previously conducted a systematic screen on microglia inhibition using the drug library of the NINDS Custom collection II (US Drug Collection); the majority of compounds in this library are generic medications. Out of 1040 compounds, 123 reduced tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) production by activated microglia by over 50%. Based on this research, we expanded our screen to investigate other features relevant to progressive multiple sclerosis, including the potential of generic compounds to affect iron-mediated neurotoxicity, maintain mitochondria integrity, and scavenge free radicals. We sought also to shortlist a compound for further activity against T-lymphocytes and B-lymphocytes, given that the adaptive immune response continues to be active within the CNS compartment in progressive multiple sclerosis, and we sought to interrogate whether the compound affects experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a model of MS. Out of 249 investigated medications, 35 prevented iron-mediated neurotoxicity in culture. Out of these, several reduced the proliferation of T-lymphocytes and had antioxidative potential. The tricyclic antidepressant clomipramine also affected B-lymphocyte proliferation, reduced clinical signs in acute EAE concomitant with improved histology, and improved the chronic phase in two EAE models. Generics protect against iron and rotenone neurotoxicity Of the 1040 compounds available in the NINDS Custom Collection II, we first conducted a search of available information to exclude those that were either experimental, agricultural, not available as oral drug, not listed at Health Canada, steroid hormones or veterinary medications. Moreover, we omitted those that were not known to cross the blood–brain barrier. We note that while we selected drugs that are orally available, for ease of use, this does not imply that injectable medications would not be effective medications in progressive multiple sclerosis, as illustrated by ocrelizumab recently. Out of the original list, 791 compounds were thus excluded and 249 were selected for further testing. The detailed information of each of the 249 compounds is provided in Supplementary Dataset . The 249 compounds were first tested against iron toxicity to human neurons in culture. Neurons were pre-incubated with each compound for 1 h followed by application of FeSO. Ferrous iron (25 and 50 μM) is very toxic to neurons, with >80% loss of microtubule-associated protein-2 (MAP-2)-labeled neurons by 24 h in most experiments compared to the control condition (Supplementary Figs. –, Supplementary Data set ). An example of iron toxicity and a drug screen is shown in Fig. . Of all drugs tested, 35 compounds showed statistically significant protection from FeSO-mediated neurotoxicity (Fig. ). Of these, antipsychotics, such as clozapine or periciazine, and tricyclic antidepressants, such as clomipramine or desipramine, exhibited strong protection, as shown after normalization across at least 2–4 experiments ( of four wells of cells per experiment per test condition) to the number of neurons of the respective control conditions (Fig. ). For example, while the average loss of neurons over 24 h in response to FeSO was 85.5% (i.e., 14.5% of surviving neurons compared to 100% of controls), clomipramine at 10 μM completely prevented neuronal loss (107.3% of controls). Other categories of medications with neuroprotective actions against iron included antihypertensives and some antibiotics. We note that minocycline, an antibiotic that reduces the conversion of a first demyelinating event to clinically definite multiple sclerosis in a Phase 3 clinical trial, was not included in the 1040 compounds; in a separate study, we find minocycline to completely prevent iron neurotoxicity as well. Live-cell imaging over 12 h supported the neuroprotective effects of drugs. We selected indapamide and desipramine for live imaging studies. Figure  and Supplementary Video  show that while the number of neurons with intracellular propidium iodide (PI), a dye that leaks across a compromised plasma membrane, in response to FeSO exposure increases progressively over 12 h, this was significantly attenuated by indapamide and desipramine. The 35 hits were further narrowed concerning their ability to cross the blood–brain barrier according to drugbank.ca, their side effect profile and tolerability. Although antipsychotics are not well tolerated they were further included in the screening due to their good blood–brain barrier penetrance. Out of these, a group of 23 compounds was chosen for their ability to prevent mitochondrial damage using rotenone, which inhibits the electron transfer from complex I of the respiratory chain to ubiquinone. Rotenone induced strong neurotoxicity to neurons (Fig. ). The tricyclic antidepressant trimipramine, the antipsychotics clozapine and periciazine, promethazine and the antihypertensives labetalol, methyldopa and indapamide reduced neurotoxicity, while clomipramine trended toward a protective activity (Fig. ). The effect size of rescue by medications was, however, small. Of note, rotenone induced marked morphological neuronal changes with retraction of neurites (Fig. ). Hydroxyl radical scavenging capacity of medications The biochemical cell-free hydroxyl radical antioxidant capacity (HORAC) assay investigates the prevention of hydroxyl radical-mediated oxidation of fluorescein in comparison to the strong antioxidant gallic acid. The generation of hydroxyl radicals by a cobalt-driven Fenton-like reaction oxidizes fluorescein with progressive loss of fluorescence. The presence of an antioxidant reduces the loss of fluorescence over time. As noted in Fig. , gallic acid reduced the loss of fluorescence (upward shift) compared to a blank Fenton-driven reaction that is without antioxidant, while indapamide has an even higher activity. We compared the area under the curve of test compounds to that elicited by gallic acid to obtain the gallic acid equivalent (GAE). A GAE of 1 represents hydroxyl radical scavenging capacity similar to that of gallic acid, while a compound without antioxidant activity would produce a GAE close to 0. Some of the compounds tested exhibited stronger antioxidative properties than gallic acid with HORAC-GAEs >1 (Fig. ). These included indapamide (mean HORAC-GAE 4.1;  < 0.05; one-way ANOVA with Dunnett's multiple comparisons test as post hoc analysis vs. gallic acid), mitoxantrone (5.6;  < 0.001), chlorpromazine (5.9;  < 0.001), clozapine (4.6;  < 0.05), and trimipramine (4.2;  < 0.05). Although not statistically significant compared to gallic acid, clomipramine had a HORAC-GAE of 2.1. Regarding the comparison to the blank condition (i.e., no antioxidant present), there was a significant upward shift by clomipramine of the slope over 60 min ( < 0.0001; two-way ANOVA with Dunnett's multiple comparisons test as post hoc analysis) (Fig. ). Thus, although clomipramine lacked significance against the strong antioxidative gallic acid, the compound exhibited strong antioxidative effects against the blank situation (in the absence of any antioxidant). Interestingly, the tricyclic antidepressant desipramine had strong oxidative effects (HORAC-GAE −5.00;  < 0.0001). Proliferation of T-lymphocytes is reduced by antidepressants We tested the capacity of compounds to affect T-cell proliferation (Fig. ). Splenocytes activated by anti-CD3/anti-CD28 to trigger the proliferation of T-cells had reduced incorporation of [H]-thymidine upon treatment with dipyridamole (mean reduction 89.3%;  < 0.0001; one-way ANOVA with Dunnett's multiple comparisons test as post hoc analysis compared to activated splenocytes), cefaclor (23%;  < 0.01), labetalol (26.8%,  < 0.0001 for this and subsequent compounds listed here), mefloquine (62.3%), mitoxantrone (99.7%), trimeprazine (43.3%), chlorpromazine (99.4%), periciazine (28%), promethazine (74.6%), clomipramine (68.2%), desipramine (92.2%), imipramine (66.4%), trimipramine (54%), and doxepin (85.3%, all  < 0.0001). Of note, methyldopa and memantine increased proliferation (methyldopa 41.4%,  < 0.0001; memantine 17.5%,  < 0.05). Mitoxantrone and chlorpromazine, however, had toxic effects (data not shown). As indapamide did not reduce T-cell proliferation, we did not pursue it further in the T-cell prominent disease, EAE. Focus on clomipramine in vitro and in acute and chronic EAE We selected clomipramine for further study as it is a well-tolerated antidepressant and crosses the blood–brain barrier very well (drugbank.ca). Moreover, in our assays, clomipramine showed strong effects against iron-mediated neurotoxicity (mean % anti-MAP-2-positive cells normalized to control of 107.3%, representing complete protection against iron toxicity) (Fig. ), had antioxidative properties (HORAC-GAE 2.1 where the effect of the antioxidant gallic acid is normalized at 1) (Fig. ), and reduced T-lymphocyte proliferation (by 68.2%) (Fig. ). We began with a concentration response with the intent of investigating lower concentrations since plasma concentration in human of clomipramine as an antidepressant average 122 ng/ml (387 nM), but can peak to more than 600 nM in some individuals. Figure  shows that clomipramine had a progressive significant increase in neuroprotection against iron toxicity from 100 nM. The effect was mediated in part by chelation with iron, as washing away clomipramine from neurons led to cell death, while pre-incubation with iron before application to neurons totally preserved neuronal viability (Fig. ). We were able to observe the protection by clomipramine in a live-cell imaging study, in which the increasing number of PI-positive neurons over time in response to iron was attenuated by clomipramine (Fig. , Supplementary Video ). T-lymphocyte proliferation was reduced in a concentration-dependent manner by clomipramine but significant reduction occurred only from 5 µM ( < 0.01; one-way ANOVA with Dunnett's multiple comparisons test as post hoc analysis compared to activated T-lymphocytes) (Fig. ). This was reflected by a cell cycle arrest with more cells in G1 ( < 0.05) and less in the S-phase ( < 0.05) from 2 µM (Fig. ). Due to the growing knowledge about the importance of B-cell follicular structures for progressive multiple sclerosis, we sought to evaluate the effect of clomipramine on B-cell activation. BCR/anti-CD40L/IL-4 activation of B-cells increased their proliferation and production of TNF-α (Fig. ) and these were reduced in a concentration-dependent manner by clomipramine from 2 µM. We then investigated clomipramine in acute EAE. Therapy with clomipramine from day 5 after induction of MOG-EAE delayed onset of clinical signs by 2 days with a significantly better early disease course between days 11 and 18 (Fig. ), which was reflected in an overall lower burden of disability (Fig. ). However, eventually, clomipramine-treated animals succumbed to EAE and increased disability (Fig. ). We then sought to investigate whether initiation of treatment from the day of MOG-induction could improve the outcome of EAE. Remarkably, early treatment initiation completely suppressed the manifestation of clinical signs (Fig. ). While most animals in the vehicle group had a high disease burden, as shown by the sum of scores for each individual animal (Fig. ) and weight loss (Fig. ), this was profoundly ameliorated in treated mice over the course of study. PCR analyses of the spinal cord revealed that the significant elevation in vehicle-EAE mice of transcripts encoding ,,, and were abrogated in clomipramine-EAE mice (Fig. ). Investigation of serum levels of clomipramine and its active metabolite, desmethylclomipramine (DMCL), in mice sacrificed 1 h after the last of 16 daily clomipramine injections showed mean concentrations of 751 and 101 nM, respectively (Fig. ). Incredibly, the corresponding mean spinal cord levels were 28 and 1.5 μM; a similar high brain to plasma ratio of clomipramine was reported by Marty et al. in mice injected with a single 8 mg/kg clomipramine IP. There was a strong correlation of serum and spinal cord levels for both clomipramine and DMCL across mice (Fig. ). Histological analysis of the spinal cord showed profound parenchymal inflammation in vehicle-treated animals with a histological score of 4.3, whereas clomipramine-treated animals only had few inflammatory cells in the meninges (score 1.7;  < 0.001; non-parametric two-tailed Mann–Whitney test) (Fig. ) that were inadequate to produce clinical manifestations as noted in Fig. . Infiltration in vehicle-treated animals was accompanied by massive microglial activation, whereas clomipramine treatment prevented microglial activation, as assessed by Iba1 staining ( < 0.01) (Fig. ). Furthermore, clomipramine-treated animals had significantly less axonal damage ( < 0.01) (Fig. ). Infiltration and microglial activation correlated with axonal injury (Spearman  = 0.7599,  < 0.01; Spearman  = 0.774,  < 0.01, respectively; non-parametric two-tailed Spearman correlation with 95% confidence interval) (Fig. ). We next set out to investigate the effect of clomipramine in chronic EAE. We first evaluated clomipramine initiated only after the first relapse when mice were in remission (day 31). In our hands, using the more sensitive 15-point EAE scoring system (rather than the conventional 5-point scale), MOG-EAE mice can be documented to undergo a second relapse after a remission period. Clomipramine did not affect the severity of the second relapse when initiated in mice at remission (Fig. ), likely because substantial neural injury had already occurred from a prolonged EAE course. In another experiment, we treated MOG-immunized C57BL/6 mice from the first onset of clinical signs (day 13, Fig. ). Treatment with clomipramine attenuated the marked rise in clinical disability and had a significant positive effect during days 14–20 ( = 0.0175; non-parametric two-tailed Mann–Whitney test). During remission, likely because the severity of disability was low, the vehicle and clomipramine-treated groups did not differ. Disease was then followed by a second increase in clinical scores in vehicle-treated mice, which was prevented by clomipramine (days 42–50;  = 0.0007). Another model of chronic EAE, thought to model secondary progressive multiple sclerosis, is immunization with spinal cord homogenate (SCH) in the Biozzi ABH mouse. Clomipramine treatment was started at the onset of clinical signs where it reduced clinical severity throughout the period of treatment ( = 0.0062) (Fig. ). In summary, clomipramine reduced clinical severity in acute and chronic EAE in two different mouse models. Figure  schematizes that the initiation of clomipramine treatment from onset of clinical signs of EAE attenuates the clinical disability observed during relapses or in chronic disease. Unlike relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis, trials in progressive multiple sclerosis have largely failed so far. One important explanation is the lack of directed actions of medications against features that drive the pathophysiology of progressive multiple sclerosis, and the lack of consideration of penetration of agents into the CNS. The latter is important as the blood–brain barrier appears relatively intact in progressive compared to the relapsing-remitting form, and pathogenic processes ongoing within the CNS may not be amendable to periphery-acting medications. To circumvent these challenges, we have employed bioassay screens that model aspects of progressive multiple sclerosis. Moreover, we have opted to test generic medications that have data of good access into the CNS. One pathogenic hallmark important for the progression of multiple sclerosis is iron-mediated neurotoxicity. Iron accumulates in the CNS age dependently and iron deposition concomitant with T-cell infiltration and the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase in microglia in the deep gray matter correlates with progression and is associated with neurodegeneration. The deposition of iron amplifies inflammation and exacerbates mitochondrial dysfunction through oxidative stress, eventually leading to neurodegeneration. Targeting iron is thus considered a promising therapeutic approach in progressive multiple sclerosis. Based on a screen of potential microglial inhibitors performed by our group, we investigated the potential of promising generic compounds to prevent iron-mediated neurotoxicity. Out of 249 compounds screened, 35 medications which prevented against iron-mediated neurotoxicity were in the drug classes of antidepressants ( = 5), antibiotics ( = 4), antipsychotics ( = 3), antimalarials ( = 2), and others. Some of the drugs had consistent outstanding neuroprotective effects, and these included antipsychotics and tricyclic antidepressants. The high number of antipsychotics and antidepressants as positive hits in the screening was striking. In addition to the rescue effect against iron-mediated neurotoxicity, several drugs showed promising results in other modes of toxicity; these were desipramine, clozapine, indapamide, and labetalol which were active against damage to the mitochondrial respiratory chain. Data were corroborated by the investigation of antioxidative potential and the influence on splenocyte proliferation. Clomipramine showed outstanding effects in several in vitro settings such as against iron-mediated neurotoxicity, hydroxyl scavenging capacity, and inhibition of T-cell and B-cell proliferation; in mice, clomipramine treatment suppressed occurrence of disease in EAE completely, concomitant with reduced transcripts of chemotactic and inflammatory cytokines in the spinal cord, reduced inflammation, microglial activation, and preservation of axons. Moreover, clomipramine ameliorated clinical signs in chronic EAE in two different EAE models, C57BL/6 and Biozzi ABH mice. The work presented here constitutes a systematic approach to identify generic compounds that could be useful for the treatment of progressive multiple sclerosis. First, we focused on ameliorating major hallmarks of progressive multiple sclerosis such as iron-mediated neurotoxicity, oxidative stress, and immune cell proliferation. Second, we chose generic drugs which are available as oral formulations. The drugs have a well-known safety profile, as there exists long-lasting experience in research and clinical use. Third, safety studies in patients with multiple sclerosis for these generic compounds will have to be conducted but they do not have to be exhaustive; thus, their translation into phase II and III clinical trials can be expedited. The screening approach herein has limitations, which should be addressed. First, the screening was limited to a circumscribed number of generic medications contained within the NINDS library; it was fortunate that we found several hits to pursue. A second limitation is that due to the high number of compounds tested, only one concentration (10 µM) was investigated for the majority of compounds. This may lead to misses, as higher or lower concentrations of a particular drug may have to be administered in humans to reach effectiveness. A third limitation is the lack of a well-accepted animal model of progressive multiple sclerosis to test the promising drugs identified from the tissue culture studies. We utilized the acute EAE model as proof of concept for a drug’s effectiveness in vivo followed by investigation in chronic EAE in C57BL/6 mice and Biozzi ABH EAE. While treatment from remission after the first relapse might not have been successful due to marked damage induced during the early phase of EAE, positive effects with early treatment during chronic disease in two models support potential effectiveness in human. Another limitation was the statistical analysis of the chronic experiments. Due to spontaneous remission of vehicle-treated animals, statistical significance would have been masked had the whole experiment been analyzed as a group, since vehicle-treated animals along with clomipramine-treated mice remitted to a very low disease score between days 25 and 42 (Fig. ). Hence, for statistical analyses, we focused on the differences of the acute and chronic relapse phases outside of the period of remission (Fig. ), as this would be more meaningful for a drug’s utility in MS. As no models of EAE are strongly suited for all aspects of progressive multiple sclerosis, we hope that the results of the current study will lead to a clinical trial in the ultimate test subjects: patients with progressive multiple sclerosis. Another limitation of the screening approach was the sequence of the tests employed, beginning with amelioration of iron-induced neurotoxicity to effects on T-cells. This sequence is not a reflection of which pathophysiology is most important for progressive multiple sclerosis, but simply because the protection of neurons against death in culture was an easily observed (through microscopy of living neurons) and therefore obvious outcome. Had the screen been sequenced in a different manner, other lead candidates might have emerged. Nonetheless, through the sequence that we employed, a testable medication in patients with multiple sclerosis, clomipramine, has emerged. Moreover, although a larger library could have been used, the NINDS collection was the largest grouping of generic medications available at the time of our study. We reiterate our focus on generics as their potential to advance faster into clinical studies is much higher, given that there would be knowledge of their spectrum of side effects in human use. Some of the compounds that prevented iron-mediated neurotoxicity in our screen have been described previously to have neuroprotective properties and will be highlighted here, as they may be of interest not only to progressive multiple sclerosis but also other CNS disorders with neurodegenerative features. Strong neuroprotective effects were induced by tricyclic antidepressants. The antidepressant desipramine has been used in a Huntington's disease model where it inhibited glutamate-induced mitochondrial permeability at the concentration of 2 µM and led to reduced apoptosis of primary murine neurons. Furthermore, desipramine induces the antioxidative enzyme heme-oxygenase 1 in Mes23.5 dopaminergic cells and increases Nrf2 accumulation in the nucleus, thus preventing neuronal cell death mediated by rotenone and 6-hydroxydopamine. We could not confirm the inhibition of rotenone-mediated cell death in our study of primary human neurons and we did not choose to pursue desipramine further as it promoted the formation of hydroxyl radicals in the HORAC assay. In murine EAE, desipramine reduces CCL5 in cortical homogenates and positively affects anxiety-related behavior but not clinical signs. Of interest, efficacy of desipramine in depression in multiple sclerosis has been shown in a Cochrane analysis and was associated with fewer adverse effects than paroxetine. Besides desipramine, other tricyclic antidepressants had strong effects against splenocyte proliferation. Imipramine, which showed good neuroprotective properties, enhances PEP-1-catalase in astrocytes, leading to neuroprotection in the hippocampal CA1 region in an ischemia model. Additionally, it prevents apoptosis of neural stem cells by lipopolysaccharide, mediated by the brain-derived neurotrophic factor and mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway. Another novel compound recently developed, quinpramine, which is a fusion of imipramine and the antimalarial quinacrine, decreased the number of inflammatory CNS lesions, antigen-specific T-cell proliferation and pro-inflammatory cytokines in EAE. Due to structural similarities between clomipramine, imipramine, and trimipramine it may be speculated that these compounds may be relevant for trials in progressive multiple sclerosis. Furthermore, we showed previously that doxepin reduces microglial activation to 46% without inducing toxicity; clomipramine, however, did not have microglia inhibitory activity. In the synopsis of effects contributing to progressive multiple sclerosis, tricyclic antidepressants are interesting for further development and might even be suitable as combination therapy with other compounds targeting features of progressive multiple sclerosis. Some antipsychotics also displayed strong protection against iron and oxidative stress. Clozapine has been described to reduce microglial activation through inhibition of phagocytic oxidase-generated reactive oxygen species production, mediating neuroprotection. The strong antioxidative properties of clozapine in the HORAC assay support these results. Due to the side effect profile with enhanced risk of agranulocytosis, we refrained from usage in EAE; nevertheless, in multiple sclerosis patients with psychiatric comorbidities and eligible for antipsychotic treatment, it may be reasonable to use clozapine. With regard to liothyronine, atenolol or carvedilol that prevented iron-mediated neurotoxicity beyond levels of controls, these do not penetrate the CNS (probability of 68% for all three, drugbank.ca) as well as clomipramine (97.9% chance for entering the CNS according to drugbank.ca). Thus, we did not explore their utility in EAE. Mitoxantrone is used in some countries as a treatment for progressive multiple sclerosis, but has so far not yet been described as being neuroprotective. Although the blood–brain barrier permeability probability is poor (0.7979), it may be postulated that the effect in progressive multiple sclerosis, in addition to its toxic effects on T-lymphocytes, is induced by its capacity to limit iron-mediated neurotoxicity. Indapamide exhibited strong neuroprotective effects against iron toxicity in culture, which has not yet been described previously. More interestingly, indapamide also overcomes mitochondrial damage. As indapamide has no effect on T-lymphocyte proliferation, the drug may not overcome acute-EAE, but may be interesting in longer-term multiple sclerosis models such as the Biozzi ABH mouse model, which shows immune cell-independent neurodegeneration and a chronic disease course. We opted to test clomipramine in the acute-EAE model due to its strong effects on immune cells, its antioxidative properties and its prevention against iron-mediated neurotoxicity. Clomipramine is a tricyclic antidepressant which is used to treat depression, obsessive compulsive disorder and panic disorders, usually in a dosage of 100–150 mg/d, sometimes up to 300 mg/d. It inhibits serotonin and norepinephrine uptake. Clomipramine reduces the seizure threshold and overdose can lead to cardiac dysrhythmias, hypotension, and coma (drugbank.ca). Usually, clomipramine is well tolerated, but side effects include among others increase in weight, sexual dysfunctions, sedation, hypotension and anticholinergic effects such as dry mouth, sweating, obstipation, blurred vision, and micturition disorder (according to the manufacturer leaflet). Clomipramine crosses readily into the CNS with a probability to cross the blood–brain barrier of 0.979 according to predicted ADMET (absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, toxicity) features (drugbank.ca). Clomipramine reduces the production of nitric oxide and TNF-α in microglia and astrocytes; the authors reported neuroprotective properties in a co-culture model of neuroblastoma cells and microglia. Clomipramine increases the uptake of cortisol in primary rat neurons and promotes the release of glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor in glioblastoma cells, suggesting a protective effect on neurons. The drug has been also studied in experimental autoimmune neuritis, where it decreases the number of IFN-γ secreting Th1 cells and ameliorated the clinical course. Clomipramine has been used previously in mice in different dosages to study conditions such as antinociception (0.5 mg/kg), Chagas disease (7.5 mg/kg), and neurotransmitter and histone deacetylase expression (50 mg/kg). In humans taking clomipramine as an antidepressant, mean serum levels after a mean daily intake of 127 ± 91 mg/d have been reported to be 122 ng/ml (387 nM, considering a molecular weight of 314.9). Of note, clomipramine levels after oral intake in humans have a wide range, leading to plasma concentrations of more than 600 nM in some individuals, which is in the range of neuroprotection against iron in our in vitro experiments. The injection of 20 mg/kg IP in CD1 mice leads to peak plasma concentrations of 438 ng/ml (1.4 μM) with a half-life of 165 min and in our experiments animals (sacrificed 1 h after the last injection) had mean serum clomipramine concentrations of 236.5 ng/ml (751 nM). These plasma levels are close to the ones measured in humans (average of 387 nM, and up to 600 nM), especially keeping in mind that plasma levels drop faster in mice due to the relatively bigger liver:body mass and that the half-life of clomipramine in humans is between 17.7 and 84 h compared to about 2.5 h in mice. We found that clomipramine levels in the spinal cord of the EAE-afflicted mice averaged an incredibly high 28 µM; levels achieved in the brains of humans are not known. Thus, the dosage of 25 mg/kg clomipramine tested in our EAE study reflects standard doses used in humans in that both attain similar plasma levels. In summary, we discovered several generic compounds in this systematic screening approach that exhibit neuroprotective properties against iron-mediated neurotoxicity. Additionally, some of those compounds prevent mitochondrial damage to neurons, inhibit immune cell proliferation, and show antioxidative capacities. They may thus be interesting for further development in progressive multiple sclerosis, and other neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's dementia, Huntington's and Parkinson's disease. Tricyclic antidepressants, antipsychotics, and indapamide may be useful for further development in progressive multiple sclerosis due to their manifold properties. Clomipramine showed particular promise due to its capacity to reduce iron-mediated neurotoxicity and T-cell and B-cell proliferation, its antioxidative effect, and its complete suppression of disease in acute-EAE and positive effects in chronic EAE. As these features are relevant in progressive multiple sclerosis, we propose clomipramine for a trial in the unmet need of progressive multiple sclerosis. Human neurons were isolated from brain tissues of therapeutically aborted 15–20-week-old fetuses, in accordance with ethics approval of the University of Calgary ethics committee, after written informed consent of the pregnant donors. Neurons were isolated as follows in brief: brain specimens were washed in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) to remove blood, followed by removal of meninges. Tissue was mechanically dissected, followed by digestion in DNase (6–8 ml of 1 mg/ml; Roche), 4 ml 2.5% trypsin and 40 ml PBS (37 °C, 25 min). Thereafter, the digestion was stopped by addition of 4 ml fetal calf serum. The solution was filtered through a 132 µm filter and centrifuged (three times, 1200 rpm, 10 min). Cells were cultured in feeding medium of minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 1 µM sodium pyruvate, 10 µM glutamine, 1× non-essential amino acids, 0.1% dextrose, and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (all culture supplements from Invitrogen, Burlington, Canada). The initial isolates of mixed CNS cell types were plated in poly-L-ornithine-coated (10 µg/ml) T75 flasks and cultured for at least two cycles in medium containing 25 µM cytosine arabinoside (Sigma-Aldrich, Oakville, Canada) to inhibit astrocyte proliferation and to deplete this major contaminating cell type. For experiments, the neuron-enriched cultures were re-trypsinized and cells were plated in poly-L-ornithine pre-coated 96-well plates at a density of 100,000 cells/well in 100 µl of the complete medium supplemented with cytosine arabinoside. Medium was changed to AIM V Serum Free Medium (Invitrogen) after 24 h. After a period of 1 h, respective drugs were added in a concentration of 10 µM, followed by application of FeSO or rotenone after 1 h. All conditions were performed in quadruplicates. A day later cells were fixed using 4% paraformaldehyde and stored in PBS at 4 °C. We note that in tissue culture, the toxicity of iron to neurons begins immediately. Thus, it has been our experience that pretreatment with test protective agents is necessary. With the continuous insult that occurs in multiple sclerosis, a pretreatment paradigm with test compounds against iron neurotoxicity in our experiments can be justified as that simulates the protection against the next injury in the disease. Drugs tested were contained within the 1040-compound NINDS Custom Collection II, which was purchased from Microsource Discovery (Gaylordsville, CT, USA) and used as previously described. Briefly, there were 80 compounds located in specific wells on each plate (e.g., B07). 3B07 would thus refer to position B07 of plate 3. Each compound was supplied at a concentration of 10 mM dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). The iron stock solution was prepared using 27.8 mg iron(II) sulfate heptahydrate (FeSO) (Sigma-Aldrich, Oakville, Canada), 10 μl of 17.8 M sulfuric acid, and 10 ml deionized distilled water. After filtering with a 0.2 µm filter, FeSO was added to cells in a final concentration of 25–50 µM in a volume of 50 µl medium to the cells. Rotenone was dissolved in DMSO and used in a final concentration of 10 µM. Selected compounds that prevented iron-mediated neurotoxicity were analyzed for their antioxidative properties using the HORAC assay, in accordance with the procedure outlined in Číž et al. In this assay, hydroxyl radicals generated by a Co(II)-mediated Fenton-like reaction oxidize fluorescein causing loss of fluorescence. The presence of an antioxidant reduces the loss of fluorescence and this can be monitored every 5 min over a period of 60 min with a Spectra Max Gemini XS plate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA, USA) and the software SoftMax Pro version 5. For monitoring fluorescence, we used an excitation wavelength of  = 485 nm and an emission wavelength of  = 520 nm. A previously published protocol was used for isolating and activating T-cells. Spleens from female C57BL/6 mice were harvested and after mechanical dissociation the cell suspension was passed through a 70 µm cell strainer and separated by Ficoll gradient (1800 RPM, 30 min). Splenocytes were plated (2.5 × 10 cells in 100 µl/well) in anti-CD3 antibody-coated 96-well plates (1000 ng ml plate-bound anti-CD3 and 1000 ng ml anti-CD28 suspended in media) to activate T-cells. Directly before plating, wells were treated with respective drugs in a final concentration of 10 µM. Cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium, supplemented with 10% FBS, 1 µM sodium pyruvate, 2 mM L-alanyl-L-glutamine, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, 1% HEPES, and 0.05 mM 2-mercaptoethanol (all supplements were from Invitrogen). After 48 h, H-thymidine was added in a concentration of 1 µCi per well, and cells were harvested after 24 h on filter mats. Mats were then evaluated for radioactivity (counts per minute, cpm) using a liquid scintillation counter. Venous blood from healthy volunteers was obtained and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated by Ficoll gradient centrifugation (1800 RPM, 30 min). From PBMCs, B-cells were isolated by positive selection with CD19-directed microbeads (Stemcell Technologies). Purity was assessed by FACS after staining for CD19 (Stemcell Technologies). Cells were plated at a concentration of 2.5 × 10 cells/well in X-VIVO™ medium (Lonza) supplemented with 1% penicillin/streptomycin and 1% Glutamax and treated with drugs for 1 h. Cells were then activated with 10 µg/ml IgM BCR cross-linking antibody (XAb) (Jackson ImmunoResearch), 1 µg/ml anti-CD40L and IL-4 20 ng/ml for 24 h as described previously. Conditioned media were harvested after 24 h for ELISA. Medium as well as respective drugs were re-added followed by application of H-thymidine in a concentration of 1 µCi per well to investigate proliferation. After 24 h, cells were harvested on filter mats and after drying cpm were measured using a liquid scintillation counter. Two days after activation and drug treatment splenocytes were harvested, washed with PBS followed by resuspension in PBS with 2% FBS. Cell cycle analysis was performed taking advantage of PI staining using an established protocol. Cells were washed in cold PBS and resuspended in PI/Triton X-100 staining solution (10 ml 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100 in PBS with 2 mg DNAse-free RNAse A and 0.4 ml of 500 µg/ml PI), followed by incubation at 4 °C for 30 min. Stained cells were analyzed on a FACSCalibur™ with the software CellQuest™ (BD Biosciences). Cell cycle analysis was conducted using the software ModFit LT, version 3.3 (Verity Software House Inc.). Cells were identified by gating into the lymphocyte population, followed by single cell gating to exclude doublets and aggregates. This was followed by identification of the G0/G1 population and processing with the software ModFit LT, version 3.3 (Verity Software House Inc.) to calculate the percentage of cells in different cell cycles. Staining was performed at room temperature. A blocking buffer was first introduced for 1 h followed by incubation with primary antibody overnight in 4 °C. Neurons were stained using mouse anti-MAP-2 antibody, clone HM-2 (dilution 1:1000; Sigma-Aldrich, catalog number M4403, species mouse). Primary antibody was visualized with Alexa Fluor 488 or 546-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibody (dilution 1:250, Invitrogen, Burlington, Canada). Cell nuclei were stained with Hoechst S769121 (nuclear yellow). Cells were stored in 4 °C in the dark before imaging. Images were taken using the automated ImageXpress imaging system (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) through a 10× objective microscope lens, displaying 4 or 9 sites per well. Images were analyzed with the software MetaXpress (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) using the algorithm “multiwavelength cell scoring”. Cells were defined according to fluorescence intensity and size at different wavelengths. Data from all sites per well were averaged to one data point. Neurons were prepared as described above. Directly after the addition of FeSO to healthy neurons, the live cell-permeant Hoechst 33342 (1:2 diluted in AIM-V medium, nuclear blue; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Grand Island, NY, USA) and the live cell-impermeable PI (1:20 diluted in AIM-V medium) were added in a volume of 20 µl (Sigma-Aldrich). In compromised cells, PI could now diffuse across the plasma membrane. Live-cell imaging was performed using the automated ImageXpress imaging system under controlled environmental conditions (37 °C and 5% CO). Images were taken from nine sites per well at baseline and then every 30 min for 12 h. After export with MetaXpress, videos were edited with ImageJ (NIH) in a uniform manner. Nuclei were pseudo colored in cyan, PI-positive cells in red. EAE was induced in 8–10-week-old female C57BL/6 mice (Charles River, Montreal, Canada). Mice were injected with 50 µg of MOG (synthesized by the Peptide Facility of the University of Calgary) in Complete Freund's Adjuvant (Thermo Fisher Scientific) supplemented with 10 mg/ml Mycobacterium tuberculosis subcutaneously on both hind flanks on day 0. In addition, pertussis toxin (300 ng/200 µl; List Biological Laboratories, Hornby, Canada) was injected intraperitoneal (IP) on days 0 and 2. Animals were treated with clomipramine (25 mg/kg; 100 µl of 5 mg/ml solution) by IP injection from day 0 or day 5 (Figs. , ), from day 30 at remission (Fig. ), or from 13 at onset of clinical signs (Fig. ). The solution of clomipramine was prepared daily in PBS. The Biozzi ABH mouse model was used as a model of progression. EAE was induced in Biozzi ABH mice aged 8–10 weeks by the subcutaneous application of 150 µl emulsion in both sides of the hind flanks. The emulsion was prepared as follows: Stock A consisted of 4 ml of incomplete Freund's adjuvant mixed with 16 mg M. tuberculosis and 2 mg M. butyricum. 1 ml of stock A was mixed with 11.5 ml incomplete Freund's adjuvant to become stock B. Stock B was mixed in equal volume with SCH in PBS before injection. SCH was used in a concentration of 6.6 mg/ml emulsion each for 2 injections (days 0 and 7). The number of animals was chosen according to experience with previous experiments (Fig. : 8/8 (vehicle/clomipramine); Fig. : 8/7; Fig.  10/10; b 5/6; c 5/5), and animals were randomized after induction of EAE. Animals were handled according to the Canadian Council for Animal Care and the guidelines of the animal facility of the University of Calgary. All animal experiments received ethics approval (AC12–0181) from the University of Calgary’s Animal Ethics Committee. Mice were scored daily using a 15-point scoring system, the investigator was not blinded. 1 h after the last administration of clomipramine animals were anesthetized with ketamine/xylazine, blood was taken by an intracardiac puncture for serum, and animals were then subjected to PBS-perfusion. Spinal cords and cerebella were removed. The thoracic cords were fixed in 10% buffered formalin, followed by embedding in paraffin. Cervical and lumbar cords were snap frozen. Tissue was further processed as previously described. Briefly, the thoracic spinal cord was cut longitudinally from the ventral to the dorsal side with sections of 6 µm thickness. Sections were stained with hematoxylin/eosin, Iba1 (dilution 1:250; Wako, catalog number 019-18741, species rabbit) to visualize microglia and Bielschowsky’s silver stain to visualize axons. Sections for Iba1 and Bielschowsky's silver stain were blinded, before images depicting area of maximal microglial activation or axonal damage were chosen for blinded rank order analysis by a second investigator. Lumbar spinal cords were harvested, snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored in −80 °C. Samples were homogenized in 1 ml Trizol followed by the addition of 200 µl chloroform. The suspension was shaken, centrifuged (11,500 RPM for 15 min at 4 °C) and the RNA-containing upper phase was transferred into a new tube and precipitated with equal amounts of 70% ethanol. RNA was extracted using the RNeasy Mini Kit according to the manufacturer's instruction (Qiagen). RNA concentrations were measured using a Nanodrop (Thermo Fisher Scientific). cDNA preparation was performed using the RT First Strand kit (Qiagen) with 1 µg of RNA according to the manufacturer's instructions. Real-time PCR was performed using the QuantStudio 6 Flex (Applied Biosystems by Life Technologies) with FAST SYBR Green and primers for (Qiagen) as housekeeping gene, (Qiagen, QT01038821), (Qiagen, QT00104006), (SABiosciences, PPM03023A-200), and (Qiagen, QT00167832). Relative expression was calculated using the ΔΔCT method with as housekeeping gene. Data were normalized to gene expression in naïve mice. The assay is a modification of the LC-MS assay of Shinokuzack et al. For preparation of samples, 100 μl of ice cold methanol were added to 100 μl of serum in each sample after addition of the internal standard maprotiline. The tubes were vortexed and left on ice for 10 min followed by centrifugation at 10,000 x  for 4 min. An equal amount of distilled water was added to each supernatant. Spinal cord samples were each homogenized in 10 volumes of ice-cold 80% methanol. 20 μl of o-phosphoric acid were added to all samples after addition of internal standard (maprotiline). The tubes were vortexed and left on ice for 10 min, followed by centrifugation at 10,000 x  for 4 min and an equal volume of distilled water was added to each supernatant. An HLB Prime μelution plate was employed for sample cleanup for both serum and spinal cord samples. After running the supernatants described above through the wells, all wells were washed with 5% methanol in water and allowed to dry completely before elution with 100 μl 0.05% formic acid in methanol:acetonitrile (1:1). The eluents were transferred to low volume μl glass inserts (Waters, Milford, MA, USA) and 10 µl from each eluent were injected into the LC-MS system. Analyses were conducted with a ZQ Mass detector - 2695 Separations module from Waters. The control of instrument, and the acquisition and processing of results were enabled by Mass Lynx 4.0 software. HPLC runs were processed by a 3 μm, 3.0 × 100 mm Atlantis dC18 column with similar material for the guard column. The mobile phases A and B were 0.05% formic acid constituted in water and acetonitrile respectively. The procedure started with a flow rate of 0.3 mL/min comprising of 80% of A and 20% of B. This was elevated in 15 min to 80% B and then restituted to starting conditions. The sample cooler and column heater were maintained at 4 and 30 °C, respectively. The optimized positive electrospray parameters had specifications of 1.2V Rf lens voltage; 3.77 kV capillary voltage; 110 °C source; 300 °C desolvation temperature; 80 L/h cone gas flow (nitrogen) and 300 L/h of desolvation nitrogen gas flow. Cone voltage was varied for each compound: clomipramine 25 V; N-desmethylclomipramine 22 V; and maprotiline 25 V. The / ratios for clomipramine, N-desmethylclomipramine, and maprotiline (internal standard) were 315, 301, and 278, respectively. Calibration curves consisting of varying amounts of authentic clomipramine and N-desmethylclomipramine and the same fixed amount of maprotiline as added to the samples being analyzed were run in parallel through the procedure described above and the ratios of clomipramine and N-desmethylclomipramine to maprotiline were used to determine the amount of drug and metabolite in the serum and spinal cord samples. Statistical analysis was performed using the Graphpad Prism software version 7 (La Jolla, CA, USA). For cell culture experiments, one-way ANOVA with different post hoc analyses was applied, as stated in the respective figure legends. EAE scores were analyzed using two-way ANOVA with Sidak's multiple comparison as post hoc analysis or non-parametric two-tailed Mann–Whitney test. Sum of scores and rank order analysis were analyzed with the non-parametric two-tailed Mann–Whitney test. Animal weight and drug levels were analyzed with an unpaired two-tailed -test. Correlations of drug levels were calculated using a linear regression model. Correlations of rank order analyses were performed using non-parametric two-tailed Spearman correlation. Statistical significance was considered as  < 0.05 (*),  < 0.01 (**),  < 0.001 (***), and  < 0.0001 (****). All experiments were performed in quadruplicates, if not otherwise specified.

Rocca, Sarlota Mesaros, Elisabetta Pagani, Tatjana Stosic-Opincal, Katarina Kacar, , Domenico Caputo, Jelena Drulovic, Giancarlo Comi, Massimo Filippi Purpose: To apply voxelwise analysis of diffusion-tensor (DT) magnetic resonance (MR) tractography and T2-weighted MR lesion measurements to characterize intrinsic damage to the brain white matter (WM) tracts and the relation of this damage to the presence and location of focal lesions among the main clinical phenotypes of multiple sclerosis (MS). Materials and Methods: The study was conducted with institutional review board approval. Written informed consent was obtained from each participant. Brain dual-echo and DT MR images were obtained in 172 patients with MS (22 [13%] with clinically isolated syndromes [CIS] suggestive of MS, 51 [30%] with relapsing-remitting [RR] MS, 44 [26%] with secondary progressive MS, 20 [12%] with benign MS, 35 [20%] with primary progressive MS) and 46 healthy control subjects. Probability maps of the major brain WM tracts were produced. Between-group comparisons were assessed by using analysis of covariance. Results: Compared with the healthy control subjects, the patients with CIS had significantly increased (P<.001) mean diffusivity, axial diffusivity, and radial diffusivity in the majority of WM tracts. The primary progressive MS group showed diffuse increases in mean, axial, and radial diffusivity, with fractional anisotropy (FA) damage involving the majority of WM tracts. No relevant difference in diffusivity measures was found between the CIS and RR-MS groups. Compared with the benign MS group, the RR-MS group had reduced FA values in all WM tracts and decreased axial diffusivity in the majority of tracts. The secondary progressive MS group had pronounced damage to the majority of tracts and, compared with the benign MS group, pronounced FA alteration of the tracts relevant for motor impairment. Conclusion: Voxelwise assessment of DT MR index abnormalities is a rewarding strategy for understanding the heterogeneity of clinical MS phenotypes.

Those who took 80 mg of simvastatin, versus those who took placebo, showed 43% less brain atrophy. In their paper, the investigators, led by Dr. Jeremy Chataway (University College London), suggest that a phase III trial of simvastatin is warranted (, early online March 19, 2014). The safety and benefit of statins in MS would need to be confirmed in phase III studies; previous results have been mixed. While there are therapies available for people with relapsing forms of MS, there are few options for people with primary-progressive MS or for those who have transitioned from relapsing MS into the secondary-progressive form of the disease. In addition to lowering cholesterol, statins can dampen immune responses that are involved in MS, and they have shown benefits in mouse models of MS. There have been suggestions that statins have cell-protecting qualities, and so may protect against nervous system damage in MS. For these reasons, statins have previously been tried, alone or in combination with interferon beta, in relapsing MS, with mixed results. In some studies, treatment has worsened disease activity. The usual dosage to treat high cholesterol is 5 to 40 mg per day, versus the high dose of 80 mg tested in MS. This was an investigator-initiated study at three centers in the United Kingdom which was funded through a number of government and foundation sources in the UK, and did not involve sponsorship from any pharmaceutical company.  This study involved 140 people aged 18-65 years old with secondary-progressive MS. They were randomly divided into two groups, one to receive simvastatin for two years, and one to receive placebo for two years. The study was double-blinded, meaning that none of the participants, doctors, or assessors knew whether the participants were on active therapy or placebo. Participants underwent yearly MRI scanning to record whole-brain volume, as well as various tests of disability including the EDSS, a standard outcome measure of MS progression.  After two years, those on simvastatin showed less brain atrophy than those on placebo. Those on simvastatin had an average brain atrophy rate of 0.288% per year versus 0.584% in those on placebo.  This represents 43% less atrophy in the simvastatin group, which was found to be statistically significant. This was the primary outcome measure of the trial. Simvastatin also had small but statistically significant impact on some measures of clinical progression. Both groups were found to have similar rates of adverse events, suggesting that simvastatin was well tolerated. This phase II clinical trial found that simvastatin may hold promise for treating people with secondary-progressive MS, for whom there are few treatment options. The investigators caution that even though brain atrophy has been linked to disability in MS, the benefit against brain atrophy shown in this trial may not translate into clinical benefit. This and other potential benefits and risks could be further discovered in a phase III clinical trial of simvastatin in secondary-progressive MS, which the investigators believe is warranted. At this point there is insufficient evidence to recommend statins for the treatment of MS.  Multiple sclerosis is an unpredictable, often disabling . range from numbness and tingling to blindness and paralysis, and there is currently no cure for MS.

2ab8e4cc-cf30-4db1-953d-c8ac582f829e,"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a disease of the central nervous system (CNS). The CNS consists of the brain, optic nerves, and spinal cord. With MS, areas of the CNS become inflamed, damaging the protective covering (myelin) that surrounds and insulates the nerves (axons). In addition to the myelin, over time, the axons and nerve cells (neurons) within the CNS may also become damaged. This damage is referred to as neurodegeneration. The damage to the protective covering and also to the nerves disrupts the smooth flow of nerve impulses. As a result, messages from the brain and spinal cord going to other parts of the body may be delayed and have trouble reaching their destination – causing the symptoms of MS. Described later in this booklet, these symptoms can include a wide variety of physical, emotional, and cognitive changes. Areas of inflammation and damage are known as lesions, which are viewed on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. The changes in size, number, and location of these lesions may determine the type and severity of symptoms. While individuals with relapsing forms of MS are believed to experience more inflammation than those with progressive forms of MS, lesions still occur for individuals with all forms of MS. However, the lesions in progressive forms of MS may be less active and expand more slowly. Shown above is an illustration of two nerve cells. The normal one on the left has a healthy nerve fiber, or axon, protected by myelin (insulation covering the nerve), and is able to transmit signals at a very fast speed – similar to electricity traveling along an electrical cord. The MS nerve cell on the right shows damage to the myelin, and as a result, signals do not travel well along the nerve. MS affects each person differently. For many years, the most common types of MS had been classified as: However, these classifications are changing, and some experts are now grouping relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) and secondary-progressive MS (SPMS) together, as a continuum of the same disease. These are now frequently referred to as “” Additionally, progressive-relapsing MS (PRMS) and primary-progressive MS (PPMS) have also been grouped together. These are now frequently referred to as “” Initially, most people with MS experience symptom flare-ups, which are also known as relapses, exacerbations, or attacks. When someone experiences a relapse, he or she may be having new symptoms or an increase in existing symptoms. These usually persist for a short period of time, from a few days to a few months. Afterward, the symptoms greatly improve or remit completely, and these individuals may remain symptom-free for periods of months or years. This type of MS is known as relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS). Approximately 80 to 85 percent of MS patients are initially diagnosed with this form of the disease. Over time, RRMS may advance to secondary-progressive MS (SPMS). This form of MS does not have the dramatic variations in symptoms that RRMS does, but rather has a slow, steady progression – with or without relapses. If relapses do occur, they usually do not fully remit. Without treatment, approximately half of individuals with RRMS convert to SPMS within 10 years. However, with the introduction of long-term disease-modifying therapies (DMTs), fewer individuals advance to this latter form of the disease. Since 1993, and as of mid-2017, a total of 15 DMTs have been approved by the FDA and are available through prescription. All of these approved medications are aimed at slowing disease activity and delaying progression in MS. Individuals who are not initially diagnosed with RRMS may be experiencing a more steady progression of the disease from the onset. Approximately 10 percent of the MS population is diagnosed with primary-progressive MS (PPMS), where individuals experience a steady worsening of symptoms from the start, and do not have periodic relapses and remissions. Approximately 5 percent of patients are initially diagnosed with progressive-relapsing MS (PRMS). This type of MS steadily worsens from the onset, but symptom flare-ups – with or without remissions – are also present. All forms of MS share an underlying pathogenesis, which refers to the origin of a disease and its development. The pathogenesis of MS includes: – this is an autoimmune attack where an individual’s own white blood cells cause damage to his or her own neurons within the brain and spinal cord – this is damage to the myelin covering around nerves, caused by inflammation – this is the shrinking, atrophy, and death of neurons – this is the body’s own attempt to repair damaged myelin, although this repair is often incomplete – this results in multiple scars within the brain and spinal cord at sites of damage from MS Research has shown that individuals with progressive forms of MS have predominantly neurodegeneration and less inflammation. This is in comparison to relapsing-remitting MS, where inflammation is the predominant driver of the disease with less neurodegeneration occurring early in the disease process. Particularly with relapsing forms of MS, inflammation is greatly involved with the initial disease process. This causes damage to the myelin – the protective covering of the nerves in the central nervous system – and eventually damage to the nerves as well. As time progresses and fewer relapses are experienced, the disease involves increasingly less inflammation and more neurodegeneration, which is the breakdown or cell death of nerve cells. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has revolutionized the ability to efficiently diagnose MS, track new inflammatory-disease activity – through the discovery of new T2 bright spots and/or new gadolinium-enhancing lesions (these are areas of disease activity with inflammation) – as well as monitor an individual’s response to MS disease-modifying therapies. Currently, an MRI scan provides the best biomarker for evidence of MS progression. MRI measures that most closely correlate to progression include: accelerated brain atrophy, which refers to faster brain shrinkage development of T1 hypointensities, also referred to as “black holes,” which indicate more neurodegeneration versus inflammation Readers should note that many of the current MS therapies have been shown to decrease the accumulation of bright spots and black holes as viewed on an MRI, along with slowing atrophy rates. MS specialists encourage people with MS to review their MRI scans with their providers and to ask about these two types of disease measures. MSAA may be able to help cover MRI costs through its MRI Access Fund program (certain income limits apply). To learn more, please visit or call . Kurtzke’s Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) is the oldest and most widely accepted measure of MS disability. The EDSS ranges from 0 to 10 in half-point increments, where 0 is a normal examination, 3.0 is moderate disability, 6.0 is where the person needs assistance to walk, and higher numbers refer to greater disability, largely in terms of mobility. Shown above are features from Kurtzke’s Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS). Frequently used for clinical evaluation and research study assessments, it mainly focuses on mobility when determining a score. A trained MS clinician assigns a functional score to a patient in eight neurologic systems: pyramidal (referring to the motor system, with weakness and spasticity), cerebellar, brainstem, sensory, bladder and bowel, vision, cerebral, and “other.” These are all based on a standard neurologic examination. The EDSS is frequently criticized for being insensitive to small changes, being heavily dependent on mobility, not capturing cognitive impairment, being subjective in some assessments (rating scores can vary), and for not capturing the full range of disabilities. The Multiple Sclerosis Functional Composite (MSFC) is another clinical tool that assesses MS disability. Unlike the EDSS that is based on a standard neurological examination, the MSFC assesses disability using three “functional” tests. It summarizes the scores of the following: the paced auditory serial addition test evaluating cognition The goal of this system is to capture information on key functional measures affected by MS, specifically leg, arm, and cognitive function. The MSFC is often used in connection with the EDSS in MS clinical trials. Many aspects of the MSFC, such as the timed 25-foot walk, are routinely monitored in MS clinics as well. Approximately one in every 750 individuals in the United States has MS. The natural progression of MS has changed over time. Early studies showed that the median time from onset of PPMS to needing a device (such as a cane) to assist with walking was 10 years, while more contemporary studies show that this has increased to 15 years. Another study showed that 25 percent of people with PPMS still did not require a cane after more than 25 years. Although difficult, individuals with MS should not compare their disease course with those of others, as every individual is different. Risk factors for disease progression have been identified, but their interplay is complex. Early onset of disease and female gender are favorable factors associated with a better prognosis in terms of one’s long-term course of MS. For instance, individuals who were young at the onset of their MS have been shown to take a longer amount of time before their MS progresses to the point of needing a device to assist with walking, which is a score of 6.0 on the EDSS. Relapses can still occur in people with progressive MS. Individuals with secondaryprogressive MS can have an occasional relapse, which is a new neurologic symptom that lasts more than 24 hours, in the absence of fever or infection. This occasional relapse is superimposed on progressive disease, characterized by a gradual decline. For example, an individual with SPMS may notice worsening balance and walking issues over several years, and then notice over the course of hours to days, they have developed blurry vision in one eye and pain with eye movements. He or she may then be diagnosed with an MS relapse of optic neuritis, in addition to having a gradual decline in neurologic function over the course of years. This is different from RRMS, as individuals with RRMS only experience neurologic worsening in the setting of a relapse. The word “progressive” has historically carried a negative connotation among members of the MS community. However, when this term was first coined, the understanding of the pathophysiology of MS – which is how the disease progresses and its effects – was very limited. Neuro-diagnostics, which use advanced technology to diagnose, evaluate, and sometimes treat certain neurological conditions, were in their infancy, and the therapies that could slow progression were lacking. Fortunately, the MS world is changing. Currently, no criteria have been defined to determine definitively when a person with MS has progressed from RRMS to SPMS. However, criteria are in place for a diagnosis of SPMS, which requires the onset of the disease with at least one clinical relapse (differentiating it from PPMS), followed by a gradual decline in neurologic function over the course of at least six to 12 months. This decline must be separate from the worsening that occurs during relapses. The diagnosis of PPMS has distinct criteria based on 2010 McDonald criteria for the diagnosis of MS. To receive a diagnosis of PPMS, a person with MS must have one year or more of gradual decline in neurologic function, in addition to two or more of the following: two or more lesions consistent with MS in the spinal cord cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis consistent with the diagnosis Individuals with RRMS are usually diagnosed between the ages of 15 and 40. The average age of onset of SPMS and PPMS is in the fifth and sixth decades of life, when people are in their 40s or 50s. While RRMS often affects women two-to-three times more often than men, the gender ratio in PPMS is equal between males and females. In both SPMS and PPMS, the rate of decline in neurologic function occurs at a similar rate. Individuals with PPMS generally have more spinal-cord lesions than those with SPMS. It is important to note that the diagnosis of the type of MS is based on clinical history, which is determined through doctor visits and evaluations. Progressive forms of MS cannot be diagnosed with an MRI or spinal-fluid analysis alone. As part of the 2013 International MS Phenotype Group revised MS classification criteria, three important modifiers were added to the description of MS: activity, worsening, and progression. These modifiers help to more accurately reflect the current disease process in a specific individual with MS. refers to a new clinical MS attack (relapse) or a new bright spot (showing inflammation) on the MRI. simply reflects that a specific person’s neurological examination has gotten worse compared to prior examinations, possibly related to an MS attack (relapse). indicates worsening on an exam, independent from an attack (relapse). In summary, people with progressive MS can and do have attacks (relapses), albeit infrequently, and develop new spots (or lesions) on MRI. Both relapses and new lesions are types of disease activity. Additionally, MS may be “clinically silent,” showing no increase in symptoms, yet continuing to show signs of disease activity within the CNS, as seen on MRI. Conversely, these same people can experience long periods of time without progression and without worsening. These variations in disease activity show how dynamic MS is, while affecting each individual differently. Clinical worsening in MS, or the gradual decline in function, should not immediately be attributed to MS as the only cause. Individuals with MS can also acquire other medical problems that can mimic MS progression. These include: cervical stenosis – a narrowing of the spinal canal in the neck, which can put pressure on the spinal cord and cause a worsening of gait, sensation, strength, as well as a worsening of bowel and bladder control As a result, a thorough evaluation by a neurologist as well as a regular follow up with a primary-care physician are important. If alternative causes are ruled out, then a neurologist may confirm that progression is directly related to one’s MS. | | Improving Lives Today! – A Guide to MSAA’s Programs and Services How to S.E.A.R.C.H.™ for the Right MS Therapy for You!

e7df77ee-d135-4359-a7de-1be133fb8ec3,"— — Secondary progressive MS (SPMS) can affect both physical health and cognitive abilities. According to a published in 2019, small studies have found that roughly 55 to 80 percent of people with SPMS experience some form of cognitive impairment. The condition may affect memory and slow down the speed at which the brain processes information. It may also reduce communication abilities, reasoning faculties, or attention span. These cognitive effects are often mild and manageable, but they can vary in severity from person to person. You can take steps to help maintain your cognitive health if you live SPMS. To manage the cognitive effects of SPMS, it’s important to be proactive. Here are some of the strategies you can use to identify and manage cognitive changes. SPMS is a progressive condition. Over time, it can cause new cognitive symptoms to develop. It can also cause existing symptoms to get worse. To identify cognitive changes, go for regular screenings. The National Multiple Sclerosis Society (NMSS) that people with MS be screened for cognitive changes every year. It’s also important to let your doctor know if you notice changes in your cognitive abilities. For example, you might be experiencing cognitive changes if you’re: having difficulty finding the right words to express yourself finding it harder keep up with conversations or familiar activities showing signs of impaired judgment or decision-making skills finding it harder to navigate social relationships If you notice changes in your memory, concentration, or other cognitive abilities, let your doctor know. They may use one or more tests to check for cognitive decline. If you experience cognitive decline, your doctor may use one or more tests to identify the cause of those changes. SPMS is one of many things that can affect your cognition. Your cognitive abilities may also be impaired by other medical conditions, certain medications, or lifestyle factors. Your doctor’s recommended treatment plan will depend on the cause of the cognitive changes. Your doctor may also refer you to a psychologist or other specialist for testing and treatment. To manage cognitive symptoms of SPMS, a healthcare provider may teach you how to perform cognitive rehabilitation exercises. These learning and memory techniques have shown promise in for improving cognitive abilities in people with MS. Your doctor or specialist may also encourage you to participate in mentally stimulating activities. This may help build your cognitive reserves. For example, you might find it helpful to complete crossword puzzles, play card games, write poetry, or learn to play a musical instrument. If your doctor or specialist believes that the cognitive changes are the result of another medical condition, they may recommend other treatments to manage it. If they think the cognitive changes are a side effect of medication that you’re taking, they may recommend changes to your treatment plan. They may also advise you to make changes to your diet, exercise routine, or sleep habits. An overall healthy lifestyle is important for supporting your physical and mental health. Tweaking your daily habits may help you manage changes to your cognitive abilities. Make more time for rest and take breaks when you feel fatigued or distracted. Focus on one thing at a time and limit the amount of multitasking that you do. Reduce background noise and other distractions when you’re trying to concentrate. Use an agenda, journal, or note-taking app to keep track of upcoming appointments, to-do lists, important ideas, and other information. Set alerts on your smartphone to remind yourself about important dates, deadlines, or daily tasks. If you’re finding it hard to manage your responsibilities, you may need to scale back on your commitments at work, at school, or in your personal life. If you can no longer work due to the cognitive effects of SPMS, let your doctor know. They may refer you to a social worker or other professional who can help you learn if you’re eligible for government-sponsored disability benefits. SPMS can potentially affect memory and other cognitive abilities. In many cases, those changes can be managed with rehabilitative therapy, lifestyle changes, or other coping strategies. If you think you might be experiencing cognitive symptoms, let your doctor know. They can help you identify the cause of those changes and develop a treatment plan. They may also refer you to a psychologist or other trained expert for support. — — More in Finding Balance with Progressing Multiple Sclerosis Lifestyle Modifications That Make a Difference for Secondary Progressive MS Understanding Secondary-Progressive Multiple Sclerosis Mobility Support Devices for Secondary Progressive MS: Braces, Walking Devices, and More FDA Approves 2 New Multiple Sclerosis Drugs: What You Need to Know New Medication and Treatment Options for Secondary Progressive MS Understanding Secondary-Progressive Multiple Sclerosis Secondary-progressive MS (SPMS) is a form of multiple sclerosis.

The trial met its primary endpoint of reducing the risk of disability progression compared with inactive placebo. Those on active treatment had a 21% reduced risk of disability progression compared to those on placebo. Secondary endpoints suggested that those on active therapy had 23.4% lower average change in brain volume and reduced lesion volume. The therapy was generally well tolerated and similar to adverse events reported for similar compounds.  Siponimod (BAF312) is an experimental immune system-modulating therapy that was designed to be a more selective sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor modulator than Gilenya® (fingolimod, Novartis International AG). Gilenya, was approved in 2010 for adults with relapsing forms of MS to reduce the frequency of clinical relapses and to delay the accumulation of physical disability. Siponimod previously demonstrated safety and efficacy on MRI scans in a phase II study in people with relapsing-remitting MS ().  Siponimod is thought to act by retaining certain white blood cells in the body’s lymph nodes, keeping them out of circulation and from entering the central nervous system. Siponimod also distributes effectively to the central nervous system (brain and spinal cord) where it may have direct anti-inflammatory or other effects.   Participants were randomly assigned to take siponimod or placebo capsules daily for up to 60 months. The primary endpoint of the study was reducing the risk of disability progression, as measured by the EDSS scale at three months. Secondary endpoints included reducing the risk of disability progression as measured by the EDSS at six months versus placebo, the risk of worsening mobility as measured by the timed 25-foot walk test, disease activity as observed on MRI scans, relapse rate, and safety/ tolerability.    Results were presented at the 32nd Congress of the European Committee for Treatment and Research in Multiple Sclerosis (ECTRIMS) on September 17, 2016. The trial met its primary endpoint of reducing the risk of disability progression compared with inactive placebo. Those on active treatment had a 21% reduced risk of disability progression (confirmed at 3 months) compared to those on placebo. Secondary endpoints suggested that those on active therapy had at 26% reduced risk of disability progression (confirmed at 6 months), a 23.4% lower average change in brain volume, and reduced MRI-detected brain lesion volume. There was no significant difference seen between groups in the timed 25-foot walk. Relapse rates were significantly lower in those taking siponimod.   The therapy was generally well tolerated and similar to adverse events reported for similar compounds. Serious adverse events occurred in 16.7% of participants. The serious adverse events reported to be more likely for those taking siponimod included nervous system disorders and infections. “These results suggest a modest benefit for people with secondary progressive MS, which is a positive step forward in the global effort to speed solutions for people living with this chronic form of the disease,” said Timothy Coetzee, PhD, Chief Advocacy, Services and Research Officer at the National MS Society. “We look forward to learning additional details about its potential benefit and safety.” Multiple sclerosis is an unpredictable, often disabling . range from numbness and tingling to blindness and paralysis, and there is currently no cure for MS.

The team (J. William L. Brown, MRCP, University of Cambridge, and Tomas Kalincik, PhD, University of Melbourne, and colleagues) report their findings in (). Although this type of observational study cannot provide the same level of evidence as a well-designed, controlled clinical trial, Ari Green, MD (University of California, San Francisco) suggests in an that, based on this and other studies, “The signs are strongly pointing to the benefits of early and aggressive treatment to forestall damage.” He cautions that the study did not show that disease modifying therapies can stop MS completely since a significant number of people studied did develop secondary progressive MS.  UPDATE 2/22/19: A second study has reported that people with MS prescribed early, high efficacy therapies tended to have less progression of disability than those who started with traditional disease-modifying treatments. The team (Katharine Harding, PhD, Neil Robertson, MD, and colleagues at Cardiff University, Heath Park, Cardiff, UK) reported their results in (). DETAILS Many people who are diagnosed with eventually transition to a course in which there is a progressive worsening of neurologic function (accumulation of disability) over time. There has been some evidence that early and ongoing treatment with MS is the best way to reduce current and future disease activity, but specific information is needed about the timing and best types of therapies to achieve the optimal impacts against the disease. A team of researchers including J. William L. Brown, MRCP, University of Cambridge, and Tomas Kalincik, PhD, University of Melbourne, and colleagues sought to determine the association between the use, the type of, and the timing of disease-modifying therapies with the risk of conversion to the secondary progressive phase of MS.   Investigators looked at records of 1,555 people with relapsing-remitting MS who began treatment with disease-modifying therapies from 1988-2012, or who remained untreated, and who had been followed for at least four years. Treated individuals were identified in MSBase, an international online registry that currently includes records of more than 60,000 people with MS from hundreds of clinics worldwide. Untreated individuals for the study were selected from the database of the University Hospital of Wales.   People who took fingolimod, alemtuzumab, and natalizumab (“higher-efficacy therapy” therapies with greater effectiveness but possibly more risk of side effects) were compared with those initially treated with glatiramer acetate or interferon beta (traditional, first generation disease-modifying therapies). Those initially treated with glatiramer acetate or interferon beta within five years of MS onset were compared with those initially treated after five years. Investigators also looked at whether treatment was escalated from traditional to higher-efficacy within five years or later.   The outcome being measured in all these comparisons was conversion to secondary progressive MS, which was defined as an increase of 1 point on the EDSS scale of disability progression (if the EDSS score was 5.5 or less) or .5 point (if the EDSS score was more than 5.5). This EDSS increase had to occur without a relapse and be confirmed after 3 months or more.   The investigators report that people who were treated with any type of disease-modifying therapy were significantly less likely to later develop secondary progressive MS than those who remained untreated. In addition, they reported that initial treatment with the higher-efficacy therapies was associated with a significantly decreased risk of conversion to secondary progressive MS compared with treatment with initial treatment with traditional therapies. They also found that the risk of developing secondary progressive MS was significantly lower when treatment was started within five years of MS onset compared to after five years, and when treatment was escalated from traditional therapy to a higher-efficacy therapy in the first five years compared to later.   The team (J. William L. Brown, MRCP, University of Cambridge, and Tomas Kalincik, PhD, University of Melbourne, and colleagues) report their findings in ().   Although this type of observational study cannot provide the same level of evidence as a well-designed, controlled clinical trial, Ari Green, MD (University of California, San Francisco) suggests in an that, based on this and other studies, “The signs are strongly pointing to the benefits of early and aggressive treatment to forestall damage.” He cautions that the study did not show that disease modifying therapies can stop MS completely since a significant number of people studied did develop secondary progressive MS.    Further studies are underway in this area. The is one of two studies funded by the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute that will help inform treatment decisions around whether, and which, people with MS would most benefit from early, possibly more risky aggressive therapy. The other study is Determining the Effectiveness of Early Intensive versus Escalation Approaches for the Treatment of Relapsing-Remitting Multiple Sclerosis (DELIVER-MS). UPDATE 2/22/19: Further Results on Early, Aggressive Treatment A second study has reported that, among 592 people with MS, 104 who were prescribed early high efficacy therapies had more favorable outcomes as measured by the EDSS, compared with 488 people who started with traditional disease-modifying treatments.

e2c324cf-52bd-4844-824b-c3e8044df160,"Mobility Support Devices for Secondary Progressive MS: Braces, Walking Devices, and More — — Secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (SPMS) can cause a variety of symptoms, including dizziness, fatigue, muscle weakness, muscle tightness, and loss of sensation in your limbs. Over time, these symptoms may affect your ability to walk. According to the National Multiple Sclerosis Society (NMSS), of people with MS experience challenges walking within 10 to 15 years of developing the condition. Many of them can benefit from using a mobility support device, such as a cane, walker, or wheelchair. It may be time to consider using a mobility support device if you’ve been: losing your balance, tripping, or falling frequently struggling to control the movements in your feet or legs avoiding certain activities because of mobility challenges A mobility support device may help prevent falls, conserve your energy, and increase your activity level. This can help you enjoy better overall health and quality of life. Take a moment to learn about some of the mobility support devices that may help you stay mobile with SPMS. If you’ve developed weakness or paralysis in the muscles that lift your foot, you may develop a condition known as foot drop. This can cause your foot to droop or drag when you walk. To help support your foot, your doctor or rehabilitation therapist may recommend a type of brace known as an ankle-foot orthosis (AFO). This brace can help hold your foot and ankle in the proper position while you walk, which may help prevent tripping and falling. In some cases, your doctor or rehabilitation therapist might encourage you to use an AFO along with other mobility support devices. If you use a wheelchair, for example, an AFO can help support your foot on the footrest. If you’ve developed foot drop, your doctor or rehabilitation therapist may advise you to try functional electrical stimulation (FES). In this treatment approach, a lightweight device is attached to your leg below your knee. The device sends electrical impulses to your peroneal nerve, which activates muscles in your leg and foot. This may help you walk more smoothly, reducing your risk of tripping and falling. FES only works if the nerves and muscles below your knee are in good enough condition to receive and respond to electrical impulses. Over time, the condition of your muscles and nerves may deteriorate. Your doctor or rehabilitation therapist can help you learn if FES may help you. If you feel a little unsteady on your feet, you might benefit from using a cane, crutches, or a walker for support. You need to have good arm and hand function to use these devices. When used properly, these devices may help improve your balance and stability and reduce your chances of falling. If not used properly, they may actually raise your risk of falling. If poorly fitted, they can contribute to back, shoulder, elbow, or wrist pain. Your doctor or rehabilitation therapist can help you learn if any of these devices may be helpful to you. They can also help you choose an appropriate style of device, adjust it to the right height, and show you how to use it. If you can no longer walk where you need to go without feeling tired, or if you’re often afraid you might fall, it may be time to invest in a wheelchair or scooter. Even if you can still walk for short distances, it may be helpful to have a wheelchair or scooter for times when you want to cover more ground. If you have good arm and hand function and you’re not experiencing a lot of fatigue, you might prefer a manual wheelchair. Manual wheelchairs tend to be less bulky and less expensive than scooters or power wheelchairs. They also provide a bit of a workout for your arms. If you find it difficult to propel yourself in a manual wheelchair, your doctor or rehabilitation therapist may recommend a motorized scooter or power wheelchair. Specialized wheels with battery-operated motors can also be attached to manual wheelchairs, in a configuration known as a pushrim-activated power-assist wheelchair (PAPAW). Your doctor or rehabilitation therapist can help you learn which type and size of wheelchair or scooter may work well for you. They can also help you learn how to use it. If you’ve been tripping, falling, or finding it difficult to get around, let your doctor know. They may refer you to a specialist who can evaluate and address your mobility support needs. They may encourage you to use a mobility support device to help improve your safety, comfort, and activity level in your daily life. If you’ve been prescribed a mobility support device, let your doctor or rehabilitation therapist know if you’re finding it uncomfortable or difficult to use. They might make adjustments to the device or encourage you to use another device. Your support needs might change over time. — — More in Finding Balance with Progressing Multiple Sclerosis Lifestyle Modifications That Make a Difference for Secondary Progressive MS Understanding Secondary-Progressive Multiple Sclerosis FDA Approves 2 New Multiple Sclerosis Drugs: What You Need to Know New Medication and Treatment Options for Secondary Progressive MS Understanding Secondary-Progressive Multiple Sclerosis Secondary-progressive MS (SPMS) is a form of multiple sclerosis.

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a disorder of the central nervous system (CNS) characterized by inflammation, demyelination and degenerative changes that can lead to functional loss and disability. Most people with MS experience relapses and remissions of neurological symptoms, particularly early in the disease, and relapses are usually associated with new inflammation in the CNS. Over time, there are fewer relapses and less new inflammatory activity with the disease process becoming more progressive.  There is a large that supports with an approved disease modifying therapy as an evidence-based approach to reducing new relapses, delaying progression of disability and limiting new inflammation in the CNS. The FDA has approved several for the treatment of relapsing forms of MS, which include clinically isolated syndrome, relapsing-remitting disease (RRMS) and active secondary progressive disease (SPMS with relapses). One DMT has also been approved for primary progressive MS and one other for non-active secondary progressive MS (no inflammatory demyelination or clinical relapses).

7aacf70b-3286-41a0-b213-bed208af6a45,"Clinical Challenges: When to Stop Tx in Progressive MS? — There are few data to support a decision one way or another by NEW ORLEANS -- Possibly the most challenging question in multiple sclerosis (MS) today is whether to stop disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) when patients progress from relapsing-remitting to secondary progressive multiple sclerosis. The main problem is that there are very limited data to help answer the question, experts told During the (CMSC), medical student Devyn Parsons, of the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, presented a review of the literature on the question, noting that existing data are ""of poor quality."" ""It would be a mistake at this point to tell a patient, 'You can come off your DMT and you'll be fine.' There's no evidence to support that,"" Parsons said. However, the available observational data suggests it may be reasonable to start a conversation about stopping in certain patients -- particularly secondary progressive (SPMS) patients, ages 65 and up, with no new lesions in the last year, and some stable relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS patients), as young as 55 to 65 with no new lesions in the last 5 years, and 65 and up with no new lesions in the last year, Parsons told CMSC attendees. ""This is not meant to be used as a guideline,"" Parsons cautioned. ""This gives a sense of what patient populations would be reasonable to consider discontinuation in."" But one CMSC attendee called stopping DMTs ""dangerous. When we treat with a DMT, we do it because we know 20% of those patients are destined to get worse. You're saying we should stop the drug, and let those people who are going to progress do it, and we'll treat them again. This is giving license to payers to deny people therapy that physicians think they need. This is a very dangerous thing to put in the MS literature. It will only be used for harm to MS patients."" The debate is lively, because researchers only have six observational studies to look to for tentative answers, according to Parsons' presentation. They are: ""Medication withdrawal may be an option for in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis"" ""Are stable MS patients who stop their (DMT) at increased risk for relapses and disability progression compared to patients who continue on DMTs?"" ""Discontinuing disease-modifying therapy in MS after a prolonged relapse-free period: a "" ""Discontinuation of disease-modifying therapies in multiple sclerosis -- "" ""Stopping Disease-Modifying Therapy in Nonrelapsing Multiple Sclerosis: "" ""Discontinuation of disease modifying treatments in . First line drugs versus natalizumab"" The theory for stopping DMTs in patients whose disease progresses is that most of the drugs for relapsing disease work via immunosuppressive pathways. By the progressive phase of the disease, inflammation plays less of a role and neurodegeneration predominates, so why continue to give drugs that work via mechanisms that are no longer involved in the disease process? But some experts say the drugs may offer benefits via different means. Jacqueline Nicholas, MD, of Ohio Health in Columbus, noted that other studies in secondary progressive MS have focused on physical functioning -- but the drugs may offer other benefits into the progressive phase. ""All of us who care for MS patients feel there are many other attributes that these DMTs can effect -- for instance, we want to look more at cognition, memory, thinking, and quality of life,"" she said. ""Those sorts of measures can help to answer the question of whether there are differences [in disease control], even if you're not showing a difference on a measure like the EDSS."" John Corboy, MD, of the University of Colorado in Denver, is leading a trial that will evaluate the discontinuation of DMTs in MS patients, ages 55 and older, who have had no relapses or brain MRI scan changes for at least 5 years, while continuously taking MS DMTs. The study, , is funded by the Patient-Centered Outcomes Resource Institute and will involve dozens of MS centers around the U.S. ""There are risks of using DMTs as people age, including more comorbidities, increased risk of opportunistic infections, and more infections like pneumonia,"" Corboy said. ""These also come at substantial cost, at $50,000 per year, which is a substantial cost for a very modest benefit."" ""DMTs have not yet been shown to be useful for progressive MS, especially as patients age,"" Corboy continued. ""Certainly when patients are younger we should use them, but as they age, the logic for using DMTs doesn't exist, and there remains an urgent need for treatment that protects against demyelination and neuronal loss and promotes regeneration and remyelination.""

This means people who have had progression of disability but still experience acute relapses or new MRI activity. In a large clinical trial of 1651 people with secondary-progressive MS, fewer people taking Mayzent had confirmed worsening of disability progression compared to those on placebo. Mayzent also decreased the number of relapses. According to the prescribing information, the participants with non-active secondary progressive MS did not show significant benefits. Mayzent is an FDA-approved immune system-modulating therapy, taken by mouth once daily, which was designed to be more selective than Gilenya (fingolimod, Novartis International AG International AG) and potentially have fewer risks. Mayzent is thought to act by retaining certain white blood cells in the body’s lymph nodes, keeping them out of circulation and out of the the central nervous system. Mayzent also enters the central nervous system (brain and spinal cord) where it may have direct anti-inflammatory and/or other effects. This approval provides another treatment option for people living with relapsing forms of MS and specifically includes people with secondary progressive MS who are continuing to experience active disease. The most common adverse reactions reported during clinical trials included headache, high blood pressure, and increases in liver function tests. Mayzent may increase the risk of infections, may cause macular edema (swelling in the back of the eye), and may cause transient decreases in heart rate and a decline in lung function. The prescription label will have advice about tests people should undergo before beginning to take Mayzent.  “This is an important breakthrough for people with secondary progressive MS, a type of MS that follows relapsing-remitting MS and is characterized by a worsening of symptoms and disability over time,” said Kathy Costello, MS, ANP-BC, MSCN, Associate Vice President of Healthcare Access at the National MS Society. “We are grateful that there is a new treatment option for people with active secondary progressive MS, and we are hopeful that this approval will stimulate development of more treatments for progressive MS.”   Download the full prescribing information and Medication Guide (.pdf)   The FDA has approved Mayzent (siponimod - Novartis International AG) for use in the treatment of adults with relapsing forms of MS, including (an initial neurological episode), , and active secondary MS. People with active secondary progressive MS have had progression of disability but still experience acute relapses or new MRI activity. In the clinical trial, people who had secondary progressive MS and who had experienced at least one relapse within two years before entering the study were considered “active.” Mayzent will be available as a first-line treatment, which means that there are no recommendations in the approved labeling for people to try other MS therapies before taking it. There is no requirement for first-dose monitoring in a health facility except for individuals with pre-existing heart conditions. There are recommendations for several lab and clinical tests prior to the first dose, Mayzent was approved for use in adults, and has not been tested in children with MS.   Secondary progressive MS follows an initial relapsing-remitting course. Many people who are initially diagnosed with relapsing-remitting MS eventually transition to a secondary progressive course in which there is a progressive worsening of neurologic function over time. Some people with secondary progressive MS can be characterized as either active (with relapses and/or evidence of new MRI activity) or not active, as well as with progression or without progression. The reason for these distinctions in disease course is that in the U.S., there are many disease-modifying therapies approved by the FDA for use in “relapsing forms” of MS, which includes those individuals who have secondary progressive MS and continue to have relapses and/or evidence of disease activity on MRI.   Mayzent is an FDA-approved immune system-modulating therapy that was designed to be more selective than Gilenya (fingolimod, Novartis International AG International AG). Gilenya is approved for adults and children aged 10 years or older with relapsing forms of MS to reduce the frequency of clinical relapses and to delay the accumulation of physical disability. Mayzent is thought to act by retaining certain white blood cells in the body’s lymph nodes, keeping them out of circulation and from entering the central nervous system. Mayzent also enters the central nervous system (brain and spinal cord) where it may have direct anti-inflammatory and/or other effects.   Results of a 60-month, phase III clinical trial of Mayzent, involving 1,651 people with secondary progressive MS, were published in The trial met its primary endpoint of reducing the risk of disability progression compared with inactive placebo. Overall, those taking Mayzent had a 21% reduced risk of disability progression compared to those on placebo. According to the prescribing information, Mayzent significantly reduced the risk of progression in those with active secondary progressive MS, but not in those who had non-active secondary progressive MS. Secondary endpoints suggested that those on active therapy had 23% lower average change in brain volume, reduced relapse rates, and reduced MRI-detected lesion volume.   The most common adverse reactions reported during clinical trials included headache, high blood pressure, and increases in liver function tests. The serious adverse events reported to be more likely for those taking Mayzent included nervous system disorders and infections. Mayzent is not recommended for people with certain types of heart conditions.   includes several warnings and precautions, including the following. Mayzent: reduces white blood counts, and so may increase the risk of infections, including serious infections may cause macular edema (swelling in the back of the eye) may cause harm to a fetus, so women of childbearing potential should use contraception during and for 10 days after stopping Mayzent.  The Mayzent (pages 22-25 of the document) provides advice about symptoms to be alert to and about which individuals taking Mayzent should inform their healthcare providers.   The prescribing information contains advice to health care providers about tests people should undergo before beginning to take Mayzent. These include: Genetic blood test to determine the person’s CYP2C9 genotype, because people with some variants of these genes would need a different dose of Mayzent or should not take it at all. Other blood tests including a complete blood count and liver function tests, Blood test for antibodies to varicella zoster virus (Shingles virus). In those who are negative, VZV vaccination is recommended. History of current or prior immune-suppressing medications, which may cause Mayzent to further reduce the ability to fight infections.  Most people without pre-existing heart conditions will receive a starter pack of tablets that gradually increases the daily dose over 5 days, before taking the full recommended daily dose. People with certain pre-existing heart conditions will need 6-hour or possibly longer heart monitoring when receiving their first dose of Mayzent.   For people who qualify, Novartis plans to offer patient assistance programs through The Novartis Patient Assistance Foundation: 1-800-277-2254 or https://www.pharma.us.novartis.com/our-products/patient-assistance/patient-assistance-foundation-enrollment.   Download the full prescribing information and Medication Guide (.pdf)   Mayzent is a registered trademark of Novartis International AG. Gilenya is a registered trademark of Novartis International AG     A. The FDA has approved Mayzent for the treatment of adults with (an initial neurological episode), and relapsing forms of MS, including and active secondary MS. People with active secondary progressive MS have had progression of disability but still experience acute relapses or new MRI activity. In the clinical trial, people who had secondary progressive MS and who had experienced at least one relapse within two years before entering the study were considered “active.”   A. The approval includes clinically isolated syndrome and relapsing forms of MS, including relapsing remitting MS and active secondary progressive MS. According to the prescribing information, Mayzent significantly reduced the risk of progression in those with active secondary progressive MS, but not in those who had non-active (without relapses) secondary progressive MS.   Like all clinical trials, the trial of Mayzent in secondary progressive MS limited the characteristics of people who could participate. The trial only included people who were aged 18 to 60, who had an EDSS (Expanded Disability Status Scale – a scale to assess neurological functioning used in clinical trials) score of 3.0 (meaning they were fully ambulatory but had  other functional limitations) up to 6.5 (meaning they were able to walk with the help of a walker or bilateral crutches or other devices on both sides). It is not possible to predict how a specific individual will respond to treatment. The use of Mayzent in clinical practice will help determine who is likely to benefit.   A. Mayzent is a tablet administered by mouth once daily.   Q. When will Mayzent be available by prescription? A. According to Novartis, people may talk to their MS healthcare providers now about taking Mayzent. The company expects supplies of the therapy to be available within a week of the approval. Accessing the medication also depends on issues related to an individual’s health insurance.   Q. Are there other therapies available for people with secondary progressive MS? A. Yes, depending on the type of secondary progressive MS they have. Secondary progressive MS follows an initial relapsing-remitting course. Many people who are initially diagnosed with relapsing-remitting MS eventually transition to a secondary progressive course in which there is a progressive worsening of neurologic function over time. Some people with secondary progressive MS can be characterized as either active (with relapses and/or evidence of new MRI activity) or not active, as well as with progression or without progression. Many available disease-modifying therapies are approved for use in “relapsing forms” of MS, which includes those individuals who have secondary progressive MS and who continue to have relapses and/or evidence of disease activity on MRI.   Q. Should individuals with relapsing forms of MS switch from their current therapy to Mayzent? A. The decision about whether to take Mayzent should be made in collaboration with the healthcare provider treating your MS, taking into account a variety of factors including the effectiveness of any therapy you are currently using, the potential risks and benefits, as well as costs and lifestyle factors. Important questions to be considered and discussed with your healthcare provider in terms of Mayzent include: What health conditions do I have that might discourage the switch to Mayzent? What is my tolerance for the risk of known side effects? What is my tolerance for the risk of adverse consequences that might emerge with longer-term use? How will my medication choice affect my ability or plans to become pregnant?   Q. If I have been taking another disease-modifying therapy for MS, how long will I have to wait before starting ? A.  Mayzent clears out of the system 10 days after the last dose. A decision to wait or proceed after that time needs to be made in collaboration with your MS healthcare provider   Q. Has Mayzent been proven to be more effective than other disease-modifying therapies? A. There is no evidence yet to answer this question, since Mayzent has only been compared to inactive placebo in clinical trials.   A. There is no specified time limit for taking Mayzent. As with other disease-modifying medications, Mayzent would likely be continued if the person’s MS is stable, and she/he is experiencing no adverse events or new safety issues that could be ascribed to the medication.   Q. Will people taking have to get any special medical tests or monitoring? A. Yes. The prescribing information contains advice to health care providers about tests people should undergo before beginning to take Mayzent. These include: Blood test for genetic testing to determine the person’s CYP2C9 genotype, because people with some variants of these genes would need a different dose of Mayzent or should not take it at all. Blood test for complete blood count and liver enzymes Blood test for antibodies to varicella zoster virus. In those who are negative, VZV vaccination is recommended. History of current or prior immune-suppressing medications, which may cause Mayzent to further reduce the ability to fight infections.  Most people without pre-existing heart conditions will receive a starter pack of tablets that gradually increases the daily dose over 5 days, before taking the full recommended daily dose. People with certain pre-existing heart conditions will need 6-hour or possibly longer heart monitoring when receiving their first dose of Mayzent.   Q. Will Mayzent help my mobility, prevent me from getting worse or reverse my progressive disability? A. Based on results from the clinical trials, Mayzent is likely to help stabilize a person’s disability progression. We do not know if will reverse an individual’s disability. In the phase 3 trial for secondary progressive MS, treatment with Mayzent significantly reduced the risk of progression of clinical disability. This reduced risk of progression means that as a group, people taking Mayzent were 21% less likely to demonstrate worsening of disability than people taking placebo. However, it is not possible to predict how any one individual will respond to this or any other therapy.   A. The wholesale acquisition cost (WAC) of Mayzent is $88,500 per year. However, the price to an individual who has MS will depend on the provisions of his or her insurance coverage and the degree to which that individual will be eligible for programs designed to assist with out-of-pocket costs. Coverage will depend on individual insurance plans. For people who qualify, Novartis plans to offer patient assistance programs through The Novartis Patient Assistance Foundation: 1-800-277-2254 or https://www.pharma.us.novartis.com/our-products/patient-assistance/patient-assistance-foundation-enrollment.     Q. Are there other therapies in development for progressive MS? A. Yes. The National MS Society is closely watching experimental treatments in development for people with progressive forms of MS. In addition, other studies include: Investigators at Oregon Health & Science University are conducting a Phase 2 clinical trial to determine if the oral supplement, lipoic acid, is an effective treatment for progressive forms of MS. The trial is co-funded by the Veteran’s Administration and the National MS Society. The SPRINT-MS trial of Ibudilast, an oral anti-inflammatory agent, demonstrated that it was well tolerated and significantly slowed the rate of brain atrophy compared to placebo in people with secondary progressive and primary progressive MS. This trial was a unique collaboration between NIH's NeuroNEXT Network, MediciNova, and the National MS Society. The MS-STAT2 study is underway at University College London, a multicenter trial testing whether a repurposed cholesterol-lowering therapy can slow the course of secondary progressive MS; the Society is providing funding.  The Society is also very interested in wellness research to identify exercise, dietary and other approaches that will help people who have MS live their best lives. The Society supports several clinical trials that are investigating dietary interventions for symptom management and for their potential to modify the disease process.    Based on these trial results, is there still a need to invest in additional research on progressive MS? A: Yes. We need to continue our investment in research to find solutions for progressive MS.  We welcome this development, but we must remain focused on finding more and better solutions for treating progressive MS. We will do this by our continued leadership in the International  and by funding research on progressive MS through our own research programs, and by encouraging other companies to commit to developing treatments for progressive forms of MS.   Multiple sclerosis is an unpredictable, often disabling . range from numbness and tingling to blindness and paralysis, and there is currently no cure for MS. The progress, severity and specific symptoms of MS in any one person cannot yet be predicted, but advances in and are leading to better understanding and moving us closer to .

dc235da3-fec1-4305-8ae1-7dc2d3c9ed75,"The Importance of Long-Term Treatment for Multiple Sclerosis The Importance of Long-Term Treatment for Multiple Sclerosis Treatment with a long-term, is crucial for most patients with MS, since disease activity and damage continues within the CNS even when no new symptoms are present. When a patient begins a treatment regimen early in his or her disease course, disease activity is slowed. This not only reduces the number and severity of symptom flare-ups, as well as delays the progression of the disease (and possibly delays any related disability), but also reduces the number of active lesions that appear on an MRI. A 21-year prospective study of individuals (with relapsing-remitting MS) who began therapy early in the disease found that they experienced a longer lifespan than those who did not begin treatment as early. Of those who didn’t start treatment early, MS-related pulmonary infection was the most common cause of mortality over the 21-year period. Previously, all but one* of the approved treatments were only available for individuals with relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (RMS) – largely for those with RRMS – and some are also approved for clinically isolated syndrome, prior to the diagnosis of MS. In 2017, Ocrevus™ (ocrelizumab) was approved for two types of MS: relapsing forms of MS (RMS) and primary-progressive MS (PPMS). This is the first time that a medication for MS had been approved for these two types of the disease, and the first time that any medication had been approved to treat PPMS. Ocrevus is given via intravenous (IV) infusion every six months. Additionally, in 2019, Mayzent® (siponimod) oral tablets, Mavenclad® (cladribine) oral tablets, and Vumerity™ (diroximel fumarate) oral capsules were approved to treat RMS as well as active secondary-progressive MS (SPMS), which is a more steady form of MS that follows RRMS, but still has relapses. While these are the only DMTs to be approved in recent years for active SPMS, the FDA is allowing some of the previously approved DMTs to add active SPMS to their indications. Mayzent and Vumerity are also approved for clinically isolated syndrome (CIS). *In 2000, Novantrone® (mitoxantrone), given via IV infusion, was approved for RRMS, SPMS, and worsening RRMS. However, side effects may include cardiac disease and leukemia, and for this reason, is seldom prescribed for individuals with MS. Additionally, Gilenya® (fingolimod), is the only DMT that is also approved for the treatment of children and adolescents, ages 10 through 17, with relapsing forms of MS. Young people under the age of 18 who are diagnosed with MS are referred to having “pediatric MS”; the vast majority (98 percent) of individuals with pediatric MS are diagnosed with the relapsing form of the disease. Research (including many clinical trials) is ongoing at a rigorous pace to find additional treatments for all forms of MS. Mylan’s generic version of Copaxone® (glatiramer acetate injection) Three generic versions of Gilenya® (fingolimod) capsules; while approved, these are not yet available Tecfidera® (dimethyl fumarate or DMF, formerly known as BG-12) Getting early treatment and staying on one of the long-term DMTs for MS may also delay the rate of conversion from RRMS to . As noted earlier, this form of MS that follows RRMS exhibits a steady worsening, with or without relapses (or flare-ups). If flare-ups do occur, they usually do not remit fully. As mentioned in the previous section, without treatment, approximately half of individuals with RRMS convert to SPMS within 10 years. However, with the introduction of more than 20 brand-name and generic DMTs since the first treatment became available in 1993, those taking a DMT experience a reduced or delayed conversion rate. For more information on long-term treatments for MS and how to select the treatment that is right for you, please see MSAA’s . Individuals who experience a more steady progression of the disease from the onset, without periodic relapses and remissions, may be diagnosed with . To date, only one disease-modifying therapy (Ocrevus) has been approved for the long-term treatment of this form of MS, although many experimental medications are being studied with PPMS in clinical trials. | Additional Evaluative Tools for Multiple Sclerosis Diagnosing Multiple Sclerosis and Evaluating Disease Activity MSAA is a 501(C)(3) nonprofit registered in the US under EIN: 22-1912812.Copyright ©2020 Multiple Sclerosis Association of America.Reproduction of material from any mymsaa.org pages without written permission is strictly prohibited.",86,Secondary progressive multiple sclerosis,-0.340918630361557,43
fcf8df43-af3b-4d59-bb99-0559ea3926a1,"Many effective medications are available for the treatment of multiple sclerosis (MS). These types of drugs may be prescribed for three different categories of MS treatment. The first area of treatment is to slow MS activity and progression; the second area is to reduce the severity and duration of a relapse; and the third area is to treat the symptoms of MS individually. All of these medications are prescribed by a physician – usually a neurologist who specializes in MS. Individuals considering a change to their present treatment regimen should always consult their physician. are also referred to as disease-modifying therapies (DMTs). Presently, these include more than 20 approved brand-name and generic DMTs to slow MS activity and progression, each of which is approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for relapsing forms of MS in adults – and some are also approved for clinically isolated syndrome, prior to the diagnosis of MS. Newer approvals also include other forms of MS, as noted in the details to follow. In 2017, Ocrevus™ (ocrelizumab) was approved for two types of MS: relapsing forms of MS (RMS) and primary-progressive MS (PPMS). In 2019, Mayzent® (siponimod) oral tablets, Mavenclad® (cladribine) oral tablets, and Vumerity™ (diroximel fumarate) oral capsules, were approved to treat RMS as well as active secondary-progressive MS (SPMS), which is a more steady form of MS that follows RRMS, but still has relapses. Mayzent and Vumerity are also approved for clinically isolated syndrome (CIS).These are the only DMTs to be approved in recent years for active SPMS. While both are approved for RMS and active SPMS, Mayzent is also approved for clinically isolated syndrome (CIS). Another DMT, Ocrevus™ (ocrelizumab), is the only DMT that is also approved for primary-progressive MS. Additionally, Gilenya® (fingolimod), is the only DMT also approved for the treatment of children and adolescents, ages 10 through 17, with relapsing forms of MS. Young people under the age of 18 who are diagnosed with MS are referred to having “pediatric MS”; the vast majority (98 percent) of individuals with pediatric MS are diagnosed with the relapsing form of the disease. In nearly all instances, these drugs are prescribed individually, so a patient only takes one DMT during any time period.

Relapses usually range in length from a few days to a few months before subsiding. While such treatments may be able to shorten the length of the relapse and lessen its severity, treating a relapse does not appear to affect the long-term progression of the disease or its symptoms. is another equally important area in the overall treatment of MS. Symptoms vary greatly from one individual to another, and each symptom needs to be addressed by healthcare professionals who specialize in MS. In addition to medications prescribed for a specific symptom, other treatment therapies – such as rehabilitation, counseling, and exercise, for example – may be recommended by the healthcare team to increase the effectiveness of managing certain symptoms. Most of these medications are available by prescription only, but even with over-the-counter medications, anyone considering making a change to his or her present regimen should consult a physician. Some of the medications listed may cause side effects, and these can be managed by one’s medical professional through adjusting dosage, switching drugs, or adding other medications. Women who are pregnant or planning to become pregnant need to discuss any medications they are taking and any new medications they are considering with their doctor.

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic disease that affects the central nervous system. It affects more than 25,000 people in Australia and is 3 times more common in women than in men. MS means there is damage to the protective sheath (known as myelin) that surrounds the nerve fibres in . This damage causes scars, or lesions, in the nervous system, meaning that the nerves can’t send signals round the body properly. A person's risk of developing MS is increased if they have a close relative with the condition. The cause of MS is not known, but theories include that it is an ; that it is caused by genetic or environmental factors (it is more common the further away from the equator you live); and that it is caused by a virus. There is currently no known cure for MS although there are treatment options. MS affects different people in different ways, and treatment often involves managing symptoms. What are the different types of multiple sclerosis? — This is the most common form of MS and about 3 in every 4 people with MS begin with a relapsing-remitting stage. With RRMS, new symptoms appear or existing symptoms worsen over a period of days, weeks or even months, followed by a partial or complete recovery, which is then followed by another relapse. For some people, these relapses get worse and the disability stays. Their health gradually declines. This is known as secondary progressive MS (see below). — 1 or 2 people in every 10 with MS are diagnosed with PPMS. These people usually find that their symptoms become gradually worse, with no separate attacks. — Most people with RRMS will eventually experience SPMS. In this form, disability generally worsens slowly, independent of any relapses. MS usually starts with mild symptoms that may or may not get worse over time. Symptoms depend on which part of the central nervous system is affected and how much damage has occurred. problems with controlling the body — like muscle spasms, weakness, loss of coordination and balance tiredness and sensitivity to heat (a hot day or a hot bath, or even a hot cup of tea, can make symptoms worse) other nervous symptom problems — including vertigo, pins and needles, dizziness, neuralgia and problems with eyesight continence problems — including bladder incontinence and constipation changes in memory, in concentration, in reasoning, in emotions, or in mood (such as depression) The symptoms of MS vary widely from person to person. They can also come and go in any one person. MS is unpredictable. A range of tests can be used to diagnose MS, including to detect lesions in the central nervous system, a physical examination to check reflexes and responses, blood tests, and other types of tests to measure nerve activity. Sometimes it can take years to reach a diagnosis because there is no single test for MS. A person will be diagnosed with MS if there is evidence of lesions in different parts of the central nervous system, at different times, with no other explanation than MS. Medicines can delay the progression of MS and reduce the risk of relapses. These are called ‘disease modifying therapies’. Other medicines are used to control symptoms. The best medicine for you depends on the type of MS you have. Talk to your doctor or other health professionals who care for you about the right combination of treatments for your particular situation. Disease modifying therapies work by targeting the immune system. They slow the frequency and severity of attacks so the myelin sheaths are damaged less. These medicines are also called immunotherapies. However, these treatments do not reverse current symptoms and there can be significant side effects. These medicines are usually used for people with relapsing-remitting MS. Steroids can reduce the severity of an MS attack by reducing inflammation and suppressing the immune system. Medicines to suppress the immune system (called immune suppressants) are sometimes used, especially for people with progressive MS. There are medicines available that can ease muscle spasms, pain, continence problems, tiredness, depression and other symptoms. Regular exercise, physiotherapy and occupational therapy can also help reduce symptoms and help you be as active as possible. A well-balanced diet low in fat and high in fibre can help. Regular exercise can strengthen muscles, improve heart health and improve mood. A lot of research, including stem cell research, is focused on prevention, treatment and a cure for MS. There is also help and support available for people with MS, and their carers.

Those who continued to smoke converted to secondary-progressive MS at a median age of 48, while those who quit smoking within the year after MS diagnosis progressed at a median age of 56. This adds to evidence that smoking may speed progression of MS, and offers new evidence that quitting smoking after MS diagnosis may slow progression. The team (Ryan Ramanujam, PhD, Jan Hillert, MD, PhD, and colleagues at Karolinska University Hospital Solna, Stockholm, Sweden) has published results in JAMA Neurology ( September 8, 2015). The full paper is available free of charge. In most people, MS begins with a course with defined attacks of worsening neurologic function, followed by periods of partial or complete recovery. Most people eventually transition to , where the disease begins to progress or worsen more steadily, with or without relapses. The factors that determine if or when a person may transition to secondary-progressive MS are not fully understood. Some studies have found that smoking is related to disease progression, and that MS disability progresses more quickly in smokers, but the impact of quitting after diagnosis had not been thoroughly determined. Investigators identified 728 people with MS who smoked at the time of MS diagnosis and were enrolled in the large Genes and Environment in MS Study in Sweden. Of these, 332 were classified as “continuers” who smoked at least one cigarette per day continuously from the year after diagnosis and 118 were considered “quitters,” who had stopped smoking within the year after diagnosis. A group of 278 were “intermittent smokers” but were not included in the final evaluation. The main focus of the study was to determine how smoking was related to conversion to secondary-progressive MS, which occurred in 216 people. The researchers found that each year of smoking after diagnosis accelerated the time to conversion to secondary-progressive MS by 4.7%. Continuers progressed to secondary-progressive MS faster (at a median age of 48) compared with quitters (age 56). Results were published in JAMA Neurology ( September 08, 2015). The full paper is available free of charge. Comment: This is an important study that adds to evidence that smoking speeds progression of MS, and offers new evidence that quitting smoking after MS diagnosis may slow progression. In an accompanying editorial, Drs. Myla D. Goldman (University of Virginia, Charlottesville) and Olaf Stüve (University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas) comment that this may be the first evidence that quitting smoking can delay conversion to secondary-progressive MS. “Therefore, even after MS diagnosis, smoking is a risk factor worth modifying,” they write.

In , there are few or no relapses, and few or no recovery or remission periods when major symptoms improve.  Some of the burning questions that are being addressed through research include: • What factors influence the transition from relapsing stages of MS to progressive MS? • Can the disease-modifying therapies prevent, delay, or slow long-term MS progression? • What new therapies will stop progressive MS? • What causes degeneration of nerve fibers—thought to be the cause of long-term disability—and how can that be stopped or reversed? A common question is, “Why aren’t there more treatments for progressive MS?”  Virtually every therapy approved for relapsing MS has been tested, or is now in testing, in people with progressive forms of the disease. Clinical trials involving people with relapsing MS often rely on counting relapses or doing MRI scans to detect immune activity. Progression is less easily measured, and usually happens over long periods of time. This important difference makes it hard to quickly detect whether a therapy is impacting progression, and thus has made therapy development for progressive MS a challenge.   But the landscape is changing, thanks in part to National MS Society investments and collaborations: The FDA approved Ocrevus™ (ocrelizumab - Genentech, a member of the Roche Group) for the treatment of primary progressive MS or relapsing MS, based on clinical trials showing significant benefits against MS relapses and progression. The Society funded early research that laid the groundwork for this first therapy specifically approved for primary progressive MS. The FDA approved oral siponimod (brand named Mayzent, Novartis International AG) for the treatment of adults with  (an initial neurological episode) and relapsing forms of MS, including those with active secondary progressive MS. This means people who have had progression of disability but still experience acute relapses or new MRI activity. The Society has provided funding to several clinical trials of nervous system-protecting approaches: The ChariotMS trial in the United Kingdom, which will test whether cladribine tablets (Mavenclad®) can slow the progression of upper limb disability in people with advanced MS, who are rarely included in clinical trials of a phase 2 trial of oral ibudilast (MN-166, MediciNova, Inc.), in people with progressive forms of MS suggested it significantly slowed the rate of brain atrophy (shrinkage), which has been linked to cognitive and physical disability in MS. Ibudilast has been designated by the FDA as a “Fast Track Product” in terms of its development as a possible treatment of progressive MS.  A multicenter trial in the UK is testing whether a repurposed cholesterol-lowering therapy can slow the course of secondary progressive MS, with funding from the Society, the National Institutes for Health Research (UK) and the UK MS Society.   Large clinical trials are ongoing in progressive MS, including tests of oral ""BTK inhibitors,"" which affect activation of immune cells. The Progressive MS Alliance is bringing together the world’s leading experts in multiple sclerosis to change the world for people with progressive MS. recent breakthroughs in understanding and treating progressive MS. More than 30 studies investigating benefits of exercise, rehabilitation and other non-pharmaceutical strategies to enhance wellness, and address other symptoms that can interfere with quality of life. The Society launched a wellness initiative to develop strategies for increasing high-quality research and programming so people with MS can make informed lifestyle and wellness choices that help them live their best lives.  The Society-supported MS Outcome Assessments Consortium is a new measure of MS disability to improve the chances of successful clinical trials in MS, including progressive MS. Understanding what drives progression and how to stop it Researchers are exploring mechanisms that drive injury to the brain and spinal cord to expose new potential therapeutic targets along the injury pathways that may stop the damage. These include: Large-scale studies tracking people with MS to identify factors that contribute to progression risk. Advanced imaging and laboratory studies seeking to define and track the full measure of MS disease activity, MS lesions, and atrophy (shrinkage) in the brain and spinal cord. Exploring the potential of different types of stem cells in models of the disease, and ways to enhance the survival of repair cells in inflamed and scarred nerve tissue. An international research team supported by the Alliance and the Society found no difference in the behavior of OPCs derived from MS skin cells and those from healthy individuals, implying that MS does not change the inherent capacity of oligodendrocytes to repair myelin, and that the fault is more likely the brain environment.  Researchers at Johns Hopkins University studied small molecules involved in the metabolism (chemical processes that maintain cell life) of people with MS and people without MS, and found that molecules called bile acids were reduced in people with MS, particularly those with progressive disease. Bile acids have anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective properties. This team is  of bile acid supplementation in 60 people with progressive MS, with funding from the National MS Society. Collaborating researchers from the U.S. and Germany funded in part by the Society through Fast Forward reported promising early lab results from a new class of compounds that have potential for both protecting the nervous system and turning off immune attacks, possibly slowing MS progression. The tested three therapies that may have nerve-protecting properties in secondary-progressive MS (with the MS Society of the U.K.) Although none of the therapies slowed brain atrophy, the results confirm the feasibility of this innovative multi-arm trial design, enabling much quicker assessments of potential therapies for progressive MS in the future.

Relapsing forms of MS  includes people with  (an initial episode of neurological symptoms), , and active . People with active secondary progressive MS have had progression of disability but still experience acute relapses or new MRI activity. Vumerity is similar to dimethyl fumarate (Tecfidera, Biogen) but has a distinct chemical structure that has been shown to have fewer reported gastrointestinal side effects than Tecfidera. This approval provides another treatment option for people living with relapsing forms of MS and specifically includes people with secondary progressive MS who are continuing to experience active disease.   “We are pleased that there is a new oral treatment option for people with relapsing MS,” said Kathy Costello, MS, ANP-BC, MSCN, Associate Vice President of Healthcare Access at the National MS Society.    (.pdf)  (.pdf) DETAILS The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved Vumerity™ (diroximel fumarate, Biogen and Alkermes plc) as a disease-modifying therapy for people with relapsing forms of MS, including  (an initial neurological episode), , and active . People with active secondary progressive MS have had progression of disability but still experience acute relapses or new MRI activity.   Multiple sclerosis involves immune system attacks that cause inflammation and damage in the brain and spinal cord tissues. Vumerity is similar to Tecfidera but has a distinct chemical structure that has been shown to be better tolerated, with fewer reported gastrointestinal side effects than Tecfidera. Once in the body, Vumerity rapidly converts to the same active ingredient as Tecfidera. Because of the bio-equivalence to Tecfidera, it was not necessary for Vumerity to undergo extensive clinical trials to demonstrate benefits for relapsing MS. Although their exact mechanisms of action are not known, Vumerity and Tecfidera are thought to modulate the immune response to be less inflammatory and may have antioxidant properties that could be protective against damage to the brain and spinal cord.   Biogen Inc. and Alkermes plc announced top-line results of a five-week, Phase III study that compared gastrointestinal side effects and tolerability of Vumerity and Tecfidera. According to a press release, diroximel fumarate was better tolerated and had significantly fewer reported gastrointestinal symptoms compared to Tecfidera. The most common adverse events for both treatment groups were flushing, diarrhea and nausea. Rates of these events were significantly lower for the diroximel fumarate group, and fewer people on diroximel fumarate dropped out of the study due to side effects.   The approval of Vumerity is based largely on the FDA’s findings of safety and efficacy for Tecfidera. Twice-daily Tecfidera was shown in clinical trials to significantly reduce relapses and disease activity on MRIs, and in one trial it reduced progression of disability. The Tecfidera approval was based on results of two large-scale phase III studies, called DEFINE and CONFIRM, which were conducted in people with relapsing-remitting MS. The results were published in 2012.   Like Tecfidera, Vumerity may cause serious side effects including: allergic reaction (such as welts, hives, or difficulty breathing); PML (progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy - a rare brain infection that can lead to death or severe disability over a period of weeks or months); decreases in white blood cell count, and liver problems.   The most common side effects of Vumerity include: flushing, redness, itching, or rash; nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, stomach pain, or indigestion. Flushing and stomach problems are the most common reactions, especially at the start of therapy, and may decrease over time. Taking Vumerity with food (avoid high-fat, high-calorie meal or snack) may help reduce flushing. The (.pdf)provides full information on potential side effects.   Before starting treatment, the FDA recommends that a person’s health care provider assess a recent (within 6 months) blood cell count, and repeat the blood cell count every 6 to 12 months thereafter. Providers should test liver function before starting treatment, and during treatment if clinically indicated. Vumerity is not recommended for people with moderate to severe impairment of kidney function. Before treatment with Vumerity, women should talk to their health care providers if they are pregnant or planning to become pregnant. There are no adequate data on the developmental risk associated with the use of Vumerity in pregnant women.   Taking a disease-modifying therapy is currently the best way to reduce MS disease activity and future deterioration. Selecting an MS therapy should be done by people with MS in collaboration with their MS healthcare provider, taking into account a variety of factors, including the effectiveness of any therapy they are currently using, and weighing potential risks and benefits, costs and lifestyle factors.   For more information about support services provided by Biogen, people can contact the company’s Above MS program at www.AboveMS.com.     (.pdf)  (.pdf) Read more about disease-modifying therapies and other treatments for MS and MS symptoms.   Tecfidera is a registered trademark of Biogen.

What types of MS is Vumerity approved to treat? A. The FDA has approved Vumerity for the treatment of relapsing forms of MS, including  (an initial neurological episode), , and active . People with active secondary progressive MS have had progression of disability but still experience acute relapses or new MRI activity.  A. The capsules are taken orally twice per day. When Vumerity is begun, individuals will be provided with a one-week starter dose, and thereafter a maintenance dose, both taken twice daily.  Q. What are the potential side effects of Vumerity? A. Vumerity may cause serious side effects including: allergic reaction (such as welts, hives, or difficulty breathing); PML (progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy -- a rare brain infection that usually leads to death or severe disability over a period of weeks or months); decreases in white blood cell count, and liver problems. The most common side effects of Vumerity include flushing, redness, itching, or rash; nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, stomach pain, or indigestion.

Taking Vumerity with food (avoid high-fat, high-calorie meal or snack) may help reduce flushing. The (.pdf) provides full information on potential side effects.  Q. Why should a person with MS consider taking a disease-modifying therapy? A. Taking a disease-modifying therapy is currently the best way to reduce MS disease activity and future deterioration. Studies comparing people in clinical trials who started therapy earlier than those on inactive placebo suggest that early treatment offered important benefits against the accumulation of disability, which were generally not experienced to the same degree by those who started treatment later.  Selecting an MS therapy should be done by people with MS in collaboration with their MS healthcare provider, taking into account a variety of factors, including the effectiveness of any therapy they are currently using, and weighing potential risks and benefits, costs and lifestyle factors.  Q. Should I switch from my current therapy to Vumerity? A. The decision about whether to take Vumerity should be made in collaboration with your MS doctor, taking into account a variety of factors including the effectiveness of any therapy you are currently using, the potential risks and benefits, as well as costs and lifestyle factors. Important questions to be considered and discussed with your doctor in terms of Vumerity include: What is my tolerance for the risk of known side effects? What is my tolerance for the risk of adverse consequences that might emerge with longer-term use? How will my medication choice affect my ability or plans to become pregnant? What are the comparative costs of my current therapy versus Vumerity?  A. There is no specified time limit for taking Vumerity. Q. Are there any risk factors or medical conditions that would make it inappropriate for an individual to take Vumerity? A. Vumerity is not recommended for people with moderate to severe impairment of kidney function. Before treatment with Vumerity, women should talk to their health care providers if they are pregnant or planning to become pregnant. There are no adequate data on the developmental risk associated with the use of Vumerity in pregnant women. Q. Will a person taking Vumerity have to get any special medical tests or monitoring? A. Before starting treatment, the FDA recommends that a person’s health care provider assess a recent (within 6 months) blood cell count, and repeat the blood cell count every 6 to 12 months thereafter. Providers should test liver function before starting treatment and during treatment if needed.  A.The yearly cost of Vumerity was announced to be $88,000wholesale acquisition cost (WAC). The actual cost to an individual who has MS will depend on the provisions of his or her insurance coverage and the degree to which that individual will be eligible for programs designed to assist with out-of-pocket costs. Q. What is the Society's view of the cost of Vumerity? A. “Vumerity is an efficacious and tolerable treatment option for people with relapsing MS, but being priced only $500 lower than the least expensive oral disease modifying treatment, does not show the commitment to affordable access that we had hoped,” said Bari Talente, Executive Vice President, Advocacy, National MS Society.  “We know that high wholesale acquisition cost (WAC) prices for MS disease modifying treatments put a heavy burden on people with MS. Too many are forced to take on high out-of-pocket costs, navigate through complex systems, and face varied and unpredictable decisions by public and private payers and pharmacy benefit managers.   A.Coverage will depend on individual insurance plans.   A. No.  Q. Where can I get information about the patient support that Biogen plans to provide? A. For more information about support services provided by Biogen, people can contact the company’s Above MS program at www.AboveMS.com.  Q. Is Vumerity being tested in primary progressive MS or non-active secondary-progressive MS? A. Not at this time.   Multiple sclerosis is an unpredictable, often disabling . range from numbness and tingling to blindness and paralysis, and there is currently no cure for MS.

Interpretation: Rates of worsening and evolution to SPMS were substantially lower when compared to earlier natural history studies. Notably, the NEDA 2-year endpoint was not a predictor of long-term stability. Finally, the data call into question the utility of annual MRI assessments as a treat-to-target approach for MS care.

604e8e00-9f74-4b51-9ecb-3c342510f9ca,"Primary-Progressive MS (PPMS): Symptoms and Diagnosis Medically reviewed by — — (MS) is the most common disease of the . It’s caused by an immune response that destroys the myelin sheath, or coating on nerves. Primary progressive multiple sclerosis (PPMS) is one of the four types of MS. The three other types of MS are: PPMS is one of the least common types, affecting about of all people diagnosed with MS. Most people affected by MS have acute attacks with symptoms, called relapses, and periods of months or years with little to no symptoms, called remissions. PPMS is different. The disease progresses once symptoms start to appear, hence the name primary progressive. There may be periods of active progression and then periods of inactive progression of symptoms and disability. One difference between PPMS and the relapsing forms is that while active progression may stop temporarily, the symptoms don’t resolve. In relapsing forms, the symptoms may actually improve or return near where they were before the most recent relapse. Another difference is that there isn’t as much inflammation in PPMS compared to relapsing forms. Because of this, many of the drugs that work for relapsing forms don’t work for PPMS or SPMS. The progression of symptoms can worsen over a few months or several years. PPMS is often diagnosed in people in their . RRMS, on the other hand, usually presents in people in their 20s and 30s. PPMS also affects both sexes equally, while RRMS affects two to three times as many women as men. PPMS is caused by slow nerve damage that stops nerves from sending signals to each other. All four types of MS involve damage to the protective coating (myelin) of the central nervous system, called demyelination, as well as damage to the nerve. PPMS symptoms are similar to SPMS symptoms. Of course, what one person experiences will be different from another. A continuous contraction of certain muscles may cause stiffness and tightness, which may affect movement. This can make it more difficult to walk, use the stairs, and influence your overall activity level. About of those with PPMS experience . This can significantly affect daily life and make it difficult to work and complete regular activities. Those diagnosed with PPMS may find themselves very tired from simple activities. For example, the task of cooking dinner could wear them out and require them to take a nap. Another early symptom of PPMS is or tingling in various body parts, such as your face, hands, and feet. This can be confined to one area of your body, or travel to other parts. This can include , , inability to identify colors and contrasts, and pain when moving your eyes. While PPMS typically affects mobility, some individuals may experience a cognitive decline. This can significantly impair remembering and processing information, solving problems, focusing, and learning anything new. Those with PPMS may have episodes of and lightheadedness. Others may experience vertigo, a sensation that they’re spinning and losing their balance. Bladder and bowel problems can range from , to the constant need to go, to . This can lead to sexual problems, such as , , and less sensation in the genitals. About will face at least one depressive episode. Although it’s common to be upset or angry about the increasing disability, these mood changes typically go away with time. , on the other hand, doesn’t subside and requires treatment. PPMS has similar symptoms to other types of MS, as well as other nervous system disorders. As a result, it may take up to longer to get a confirmed PPMS diagnosis than a RRMS diagnosis. have a year of progressively worsening neurologic function meet two of the following criteria: Your doctor will likely conduct a medical history exam and ask you about any previous neurologic events. They may ask for family members to be present, as they can contribute their experiences with past symptoms. Your doctor will then likely do a thorough physical exam, specifically checking your nerves and muscles. Your doctor will order an MRI scan to check for lesions in the brain and spinal cord. They may also order an to check for electrical activity in the brain. Finally, your doctor will perform a to look for signs of MS in the spinal fluid. There’s no cure for PPMS. One medication, ocrelizumab (Ocrevus), is approved for PPMS as well as relapsing forms of MS. are commonly used in relapsing forms, however, because they decrease inflammation. PPMS doesn’t have a lot of inflammation, so immunosuppressants may not be recommended as useful. Research on effective treatments is ongoing. While there’s no cure for PPMS, those diagnosed with PPMS shouldn’t give up hope. With the help of doctors, physical therapy professionals, speech pathologists, and specialists in mental health, there are ways to manage the disease. These can include medications that help relieve symptoms, such as for muscle spasms, as well as a healthy diet, exercise, and a proper sleep routine.

1c2d0640-4b50-4c58-b72e-fccedbe71d22,"FDA Approves 2 New Multiple Sclerosis Drugs: What You Need to Know There are two pieces of encouraging news for people with progressive and relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis. The news comes in the form of two new drugs recently approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). On March 26, FDA officials the Novartis drug, Mayzent (siponimod), for various forms of multiple sclerosis, including clinically isolated syndrome, relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS), and active secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (SPMS). Novartis officials said the pill will be available sometime in early April. They noted that Mayzent, a tablet taken once a day, is the first treatment specifically for people with active SPMS in more than 15 years. The annual price tag is expected to be for the treatment. On March 29, the FDA also EMD Serono’s (cladribrine), also for RRMS and active SPMS but not for clinically isolated syndrome. Company officials told Healthline the annual price tag is expected to be $99,500 for the two-year treatment. There are nearly living with multiple sclerosis (MS) in the United States and about worldwide. The National Multiple Sclerosis Society states that people with RRMS have a 50 percent chance of progressing to SPMS within the first 10 years. Another 90 percent have a chance of transitioning after 25 years. People with relapsing remitting forms of MS currently have 15 FDA-approved disease modifying treatments (DMTs). People living with SPMS now have three choices. The last MS treatment by the FDA was ocrelizumab in 2017. It entered the market with a $65,000 annual . Here’s a look at the two drugs approved by the FDA last week. In 2010, the FDA Gilenya, the company’s widely used drug for MS treatment. Novartis last year, seeking to block the sales of generic versions of Gilenya after the drug’s main patent expires in August. “Mayzent works to sequester certain white blood cells in lymph nodes. These are considered important in inflammatory response in MS. If they can’t get out into system then they can’t cause over inflammation in MS.” , a nurse practitioner at the Johns Hopkins Multiple Sclerosis Center in Maryland and the associate vice president of healthcare access for National Multiple Sclerosis Society. In the phase III trial of Mayzent with 1,651 patients, the fraction of patients with confirmed progression of disability was statistically significantly lower in the Mayzent group than in the placebo group. Patients treated with Mayzent had a 55 percent relative reduction in annualized relapse rate. “This drug crosses the blood brain barrier,” explained , a neurologist at the University of California San Francisco. “We’re not exactly sure what it does, but the results show it slows progression in those with later stage of disease.” “The immune system is activated in the periphery and dives into brain and causes havoc,” he added. “We believe that in progressive MS cells get into the brain and destroy from the inside out. This medication works in the brain. Others work in the periphery.” Side effects common during the trials included headaches, elevations in blood pressures, increase in liver enzyme, and a reduction in white blood cell counts that might cause infection. Novartis shared with Healthline that it has developed a comprehensive patient support program for Mayzent, to help patients navigate insurance coverage and identify resources for those who are uninsured or underinsured. “Mayzent has been demonstrated to have a modest but statistically significant effect on slowing progression in persons with SPMS who are still ambulatory with or without a device,” , professor of clinical neurology at the David Geffen School of Medicine at the University of California Los Angeles and clinical director of the UCLA MS program, told Healthline. Officials at Merck KGaA, the parent company of EMD Serono, said in a that Mavenclad is the “the first ever oral treatment to provide two years of proven efficacy with a maximum of 20 days of treatment.” Mavenclad is taken for 8 to 10 days in each of the two years of treatment. There are no other treatments needed. In the phase III study of Mavenclad with 1,976 participants, patients experienced a in annual relapse rate and a 33 percent reduction in rate of disability progression measured by the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS). They also experienced a lower number of lesions compared to the placebo group. Mavenclad works by targeting certain white blood cells (lymphocytes) that lead the immune attack in MS. The drug temporarily reduces the number of certain lymphocytes without continuous suppression of the immune system. Risks include upper respiratory tract infection, headache, herpes, alopecia, and lymphopenia. Serious adverse reactions reported in the clinical program included malignancies. The company states that due to its safety profile this drug is generally recommended for patients who have had an inadequate response to, or are unable to tolerate, an alternate drug indicated for the treatment of multiple sclerosis. “Price to an individual who has MS will depend on the provisions of his/her insurance coverage and the degree to which that individual will be eligible for programs designed to assist with out of pocket cost,” EMD Serono officials told Healthline. “Coverage will depend on individual insurance plans.” “We are committed to helping support patients who are prescribed Mavenclad. offers personalized patient support, including assistance with navigating insurance coverage questions and additional resources that may be able to help eligible patients who are uninsured or underinsured,” company officials added. The availability of the new drugs is being tempered by their high costs. “While we are grateful to have another treatment available for people with MS, one with a more convenient delivery option, this benefit is overshadowed by the high list price,” said , executive vice president of advocacy for the National MS Society. “To have a new MS treatment priced just shy of six figures a year is disheartening,” Talente told Healthline. “This also illustrates the distorting effect of drug prices in the United States.” Talente said price and a company’s commitment to its patients go hand in hand. Choosing which medication is right is a basic risk benefit equation,” added West. “It is a different equation for everybody. More options mean a better chance to find a great solution for each patient. It’s about matching the right medicine to the right patient at the right time.” West was a paid consultant for Mavenclad and has been compensated by Novartis on other projects in an advisory manner.

0b67a1c5-7dd6-41c5-a9c6-3fcfa0b9932c,"Primary progressive multiple sclerosis (PPMS) is an uncommon form of MS that affects approximately 10-15% of MS patients. In PPMS, symptoms steadily get worse over time without frequent relapses or remission. Unlike relapse-remitting MS (RRMS), which affects women more than men, PPMS affects an equal number of both genders. PPMS is usually diagnosed in older individuals between the ages of 40 to 60, yet it is sometimes diagnosed beyond this range. Early symptoms in PPMS develop slowly over a period of time and usually involve issues with walking and general mobility. The pace and progress of PPMS can vary from patient to patient. In some people with PPMS, relapses can occur along with steady disease progression. This is referred to as progressive-relapsing MS (PRMS). The diagnosis of PPMS is particularly difficult as it is diagnosed in the 40s and 50s when other health issues related to mobility tend to develop. Since PPMS is characterized by a gradual and steady accumulation of disability over time, the criteria for diagnosis of PPMS are different from that of other forms of MS. Worsening of neurological function for one year without remission Indications of immune activity in the CNS (such as elevated IgG index) These criteria often take a long time to develop, hence PPMS diagnosis usually taking two to three years more than diagnosis of RRMS. Treatment for PPMS mainly aims at managing neurological symptoms. Ongoing drug trials focus on reducing relapses and slowing down the disease progression rate as well as the build-up of disability. Currently, no FDA-approved medications are available for the treatment of PPMS. This is mainly because most approved therapies work towards reducing inflammation, which is not a characteristic of PPMS. Many clinical trials are underway to find an effective drug for this disease. Drug prices beat inflation all the way even with discounts Integrin b3 and ACE2 linked by short linear motifs enabling endocytosis and autophagy of SARS-CoV-2 Study sheds light on myelin's role in 'chemobrain' and multiple sclerosis Wellbeing and rehabilitation of people affected with PPMS is important and can be achieved by following a healthy diet and exercise regimen. Unsteadiness in walking and muscle weakness can be tackled with the help of an occupational therapist and a physiotherapist, while a dietician can help develop an appropriate meal plan based on the patient’s individual mobility levels. Neurologic examination and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) must be performed at least once a year to evaluate disease progression and activity. Characterizing the disease course at regular intervals is important as it helps in updating treatment methods. If PPMS is active with relapses or fresh MRI activity, a disease-modifying therapy (DMT) should be started so as to mitigate the risk of an attack. If PPMS is stable with no progression or activity, treatment should focus on rehabilitation so as to maintain function and symptom management. If PPMS is inactive with no relapses or activity, but with disease progression and build-up of disability, treatment should aim at maintaining function and promoting independence of the patient. PPMS does not involve relapses due to inflammation; hence, patients with this type of MS have fewer lesions or plaques in the brain with fewer inflammatory cells. Relapsing forms such as RRMS and secondary progressive MS (SPMS) are characterized by frequent inflammatory attacks. The age of onset for relapsing forms of MS is about 10 years earlier than that for PPMS. PPMS tends to affect walking and mobility more than other functions, while relapsing MS types cause numbness, spasticity, vision problems, and cognitive decline. http://www.nationalmssociety.org/What-is-MS/Types-of-MS/Primary-progressive-MS/Treating-Primary-Progressive-MS http://www.nationalmssociety.org/What-is-MS/Types-of-MS/Primary-progressive-MS https://www.mssociety.org.uk/what-is-ms/types-of-ms/primary-progressive-ppms Last Updated: Feb 27, 2019 Susha has a Bachelor of Science (B.Sc.) degree in Chemistry and Master of Science (M.Sc) degree in Biochemistry from the University of Calicut, India.

d24c087c-f024-44a4-b764-bf33f717ff14,"Yuck! New MS Drug Candidate Contains Bacteria from Teen Acne — The bacterial archnemesis of teenagers may play a heroic role in treating progressive forms of multiple sclerosis. Researchers in Australia are exploring a new method of drug delivery that harnesses the power of teenage acne. The same bacteria that can fill an adolescent with anxiety over a face full of blemishes may become a tool for treating secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (SPMS). “The study is taking place at four sites around Australia,” Bob Soh, Ph.D., from the Nucleus Network in Melbourne, told Healthline. He is lead investigator for the Melbourne study site and oversees recruitment, enrollment, and execution of the trial. Researchers want to know how effective the new drug, called MIS416, is for treating SPMS. Although there are currently 12 FDA-approved drugs for relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS), there are no treatments for progressive forms of the disease. Soh, along with the other investigators, hopes the experimental drug, which contains a refined version of acne-causing bacteria, will trip a switch and turn on the signaling pathways of the innate immune system to combat disease activity in MS. The bacteria that cause pimples, , have cell walls that are rich in muramyl dipeptide, a protein that triggers the NOD2 pathway in the body’s innate immune system, explained Soh. “We are trying to target two innate immunity pathways with both [] and MIS416,” said Soh. “The benefit of using this approach is that the immune system will take up this bacteria, ensuring direct uptake of both MIS416 and directly into the immune system where it is designed to target.” So, by turning on these pathways with , the door is flung wide for the experimental MIS416 to do its job. The study’s sponsor, Innate Immunotherapeutics, has developed a special manufacturing process to treat the acne-causing bacteria that removes all but the active microparticle necessary to trigger the immune response. Early-stage clinical trials typically use a small sample of volunteers in order to determine the safety and effectiveness of a treatment. In this phase of the study, 90 participants with SPMS will receive a weekly infusion of either MIS416 or a placebo for 52 weeks. After that time, the volunteers who had been on placebo will be given the opportunity to switch to MIS416. In an earlier study of 10 patients, or greater improvement in at least one measure of their neuromuscular function. These earlier, positive results prompted the researchers to forge ahead with the larger study. Volunteers undergo a battery of tests to measure the state of their disease, including the MS Functional Composite that consists of a timed 25-foot walk, a 9-hole peg test, and the Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test, where patients add a series of numbers as they hear them to test their cognitive ability. Grip strength and vision are also tested. Read More: Discover the Benefits of Participating in a Clinical Trial » According to the , most people who are diagnosed with RRMS will eventually transition to SPMS. So researchers like Soh and others realize how critical it is to find treatments for those who are no longer relapsing. “Preventing relapses is a goal in [RRMS] whereas in [SPMS] ongoing accumulation of disabilities is no longer associated with relapsing pathology,” said Soh. MIS416 is in development for SPMS and, as Soh explains, the goal of the study is “to slow or stop progression and perhaps, based on patient reporting to date, also to reverse some of the disabilities and other symptoms associated with MS.” Soh is hopeful this larger study will benefit those with primary progressive MS (PPMS) too. “The sponsor has some anecdotal data from patients with primary progressive MS that MIS416 may have some positive effect in that form of MS as well, although the patients with PPMS have not reported the degree of improvements that many patients with SPMS have reported,” said Soh. “Given the unmet need in both SPMS and PPMS, the sponsor is currently very focused on establishing to what extent MIS416 can impact progressive MS disease.” To learn more about this study or find out if you’re a likely candidate, . — Promising Treatments and Clinical Trials for Relapsing-Remitting MS Could an Undiagnosed Sleep Disorder be Causing Your MS Fatigue?

As of June 1, 2020, Zeposia is now available for prescription. Relapsing forms of MS includes  (an initial episode of neurological symptoms), , and active . People with active secondary progressive MS have had progression of disability but still experience acute relapses and/or new MRI activity. Zeposia is similar to Gilenya (fingolimod, Novartis International AG) and Mayzent (siponimod, Novartis International AG). Zeposia is thought to act by retaining certain white blood cells in the body’s lymph nodes, keeping them out of circulation and from entering the central nervous system. In two phase 3 clinical trials, Zeposia significantly reduced annual relapse rates compared with Avonex (interferon beta-1a, Biogen), and also reduced new MRI-detected disease activity. There was no significant difference in the proportion of people who experienced disease progression between those taking Zeposia or Avonex.  The most common adverse reactions reported from clinical trials were upper respiratory infection, increases in liver function tests, low blood pressure after standing up (orthostatic hypotension), urinary tract infection, back pain, and high blood pressure. Zeposia may cause infections, including serious infections. Starting Zeposia may result in temporary reductions in heart rate. To help reduce this potential side effect, Zeposia is taken in gradually larger doses over 7 days before the standard maintenance dose is achieved. There is no requirement for in-office observation when an individual receives the first dose. When this therapy is launched, it will provide another treatment option for people living with relapsing forms of MS. “MS affects each person in a unique way, and response to disease-modifying therapies may vary,” said Kathy Costello, MS, ANP-BC, MSCN, Associate Vice President of Healthcare Access at the National MS Society. Having access to multiple treatment options is important, so the approval of oral Zeposia is a welcome addition for people with relapsing forms of MS.   (.pdf) (.pdf)   ADDITIONAL DETAILS Zeposia (zeh-poe’-see-ah) is a selective sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor modulator. It is thought to act by promoting the retention of certain white blood cells in the body’s lymph nodes, keeping them out of circulation and from entering the brain and spinal cord. Similar therapies are approved by the FDA to treat MS: Gilenya (fingolimod, Novartis International AG) and Mayzent (siponimod, Novartis International AG). Results from two phase 3 clinical trials were published in Lancet Neurology 2019 ( and ).   Two phase 3 clinical trials, involving more than 2,600 people with relapsing MS, compared two different doses of daily oral Zeposia to Avonex (injected into the muscle once weekly). Zeposia was found to significantly reduce annual relapse rates, and reduced new MRI-detected signs of disease activity. Zeposia was not shown to slow disability progression significantly more than Avonex.   The most common adverse reactions reported from clinical trials were upper respiratory infection, increases in liver function tests, low blood pressure after standing up (orthostatic hypotension), urinary tract infection, back pain, and high blood pressure. The serious adverse events reported to be more likely for those taking Zeposia included infections. History of current or prior immune-suppressing medications may cause Zeposia to further reduce the ability to fight infections. Zeposia is not recommended for people with certain types of heart conditions.   Prescribing information includes several warnings and precautions, including the following. Zeposia: reduces white blood counts, and so may increase the risk of infections, including serious infections may cause macular edema (swelling in the back of the eye) may cause harm to a fetus, so women of childbearing potential should use contraception during and for 3 months after stopping Zeposia. may cause severe disability after stopping Zeposia The Zeposia provides advice about symptoms to be alert to and about which individuals taking Zeposia should inform their healthcare providers.   The prescribing information contains advice to health care providers about tests people should undergo before beginning to take Zeposia. These include: Eye examination in those with a history of certain eye disorders (uveitis or macular edema) or diabetes mellitus Blood test for antibodies to varicella zoster virus (Shingles virus). In those who are negative, VZV vaccination is recommended. If live attenuated vaccine immunizations are required, they should be administered at least 1 month prior to initiation of Zeposia. The company has established a where additional information about Zeposia and its Zeposia 360 Support™ program is available. Individuals with MS and healthcare providers may also call for more information at 1-833-ZEPOSIA (1-833-937-6742).   Taking a disease-modifying therapy is currently the best way to reduce MS disease activity and future deterioration. Selecting an MS therapy should be done by people with MS in collaboration with their MS healthcare provider, taking into account a variety of factors, including the effectiveness of any therapy they are currently taking, and weighing potential risks and benefits, costs and lifestyle factors.     Avonex is a registered trademark of Biogen Gilenya is a registered trademark of Novartis Mayzent is a registered trademark of Novartis Zeposia is a registered trademark of Celgene Corporation Zeposia 360 Support is a trademark of Bristol Myers Squibb   FAQ About the FDA Approval and Launch of Oral Ozanimod – Brand Name Zeposia – for Relapsing MS The FDA has approved Zeposia for the treatment of relapsing forms of MS including  (an initial episode of neurological symptoms), , and active . People with active secondary progressive MS have had progression of disability but still experience acute relapses or new MRI activity.   Zeposia is a capsule taken by mouth once daily. Starting Zeposia may result in temporary reductions in heart rate. To help reduce this potential side effect, Zeposia is taken in gradually larger doses over 7 days before the standard maintenance dose is achieved. There is no requirement for in-office observation when an individual receives the first dose.   Q. What are the potential side effects of Zeposia? The most common adverse reactions reported from clinical trials were upper respiratory infection, increases in liver function tests, low blood pressure after standing up (orthostatic hypotension), urinary tract infection, back pain, and high blood pressure. The serious adverse events reported to be more likely for those taking Zeposia included infections. History of current or prior immune-suppressing medications may cause Zeposia to further reduce the ability to fight infections. Zeposia is not recommended for people with certain types of heart conditions.   Prescribing information includes several warnings and precautions, including the following. Zeposia: reduces white blood counts, and so may increase the risk of infections, including serious infections may cause macular edema (swelling in the back of the eye) may cause harm to a fetus, so women of childbearing potential should use contraception during and for 3 months after stopping Zeposia. may cause severe disability after stopping Zeposia The Zeposia provides advice about symptoms to be alert to and about which individuals taking Zeposia should inform their healthcare providers.   Q. Why should a person with MS consider taking a disease-modifying therapy? Taking a disease-modifying therapy is currently the best way to reduce MS disease activity and future deterioration. Studies comparing people in clinical trials who started therapy earlier than those on inactive placebo suggest that early treatment offered important benefits against the accumulation of disability, which were generally not experienced to the same degree by those who started treatment later. Selecting an MS therapy should be done by people with MS in collaboration with their MS healthcare provider, taking into account a variety of factors, including the effectiveness of any therapy they are currently using, and weighing potential risks and benefits, costs and lifestyle factors.   As of June 1, 2020, Bristol Myers Squibb has announced that Zeposia is ready to be prescribed.   Should I switch from my current therapy to Zeposia? The decision about whether to take Zeposia should be made in collaboration with your MS provider taking into account a variety of factors including the effectiveness of any therapy you are currently using, the potential risks and benefits, as well as costs and lifestyle factors. Important questions to be considered and discussed with your provider in terms of Zeposia include: What is my tolerance for the risk of known side effects? What is my tolerance for the risk of adverse consequences that might emerge with longer-term use? How will my medication choice affect my ability or plans to become pregnant? What are the comparative costs of my current therapy versus Zeposia?   There is no specified time limit for taking Zeposia.   Q. Are there any risk factors or medical conditions that would make it inappropriate for an individual to take Zeposia? Zeposia should not be prescribed for people with certain types of heart conditions, for people with severe untreated sleep apnea, or for people who take a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (which is an early form of antidepressant, such as selegiline, phenelzine, and linezolid).   In addition, it is not recommended that a person take certain other medications along with Zeposia, since this may cause high blood pressure. These include opioid pain killers, medicines to treat depression, certain medicines to treat MS-related pain, medicines to treat Parkinson’s disease, and certain over-the-counter decongestants (pseudoephedrine). Blood pressure should be monitored for individuals taking these types of medications along with Zeposia.   Q. Will a person taking Zeposia have to get any special medical tests or monitoring? The prescribing information contains advice to health care providers about tests people should undergo before beginning to take Zeposia. These include: Eye examination in those with a history of certain eye disorders (uveitis or macular edema) or diabetes mellitus Blood test for antibodies to varicella zoster virus (Shingles virus). In those who are negative, VZV vaccination is recommended. If live attenuated vaccine immunizations are required, they should be administered at least 1 month prior to initiation of Zeposia. There is no recommendation for any ongoing lab testing after a person begins taking Zeposia.   The list price of Zeposia has been announced as $86,000 per year. The actual cost to an individual who has MS will depend on the provisions of his or her insurance coverage and the degree to which that individual will be eligible for programs designed to assist with out-of-pocket costs.   Coverage will depend on individual insurance plans.   No.   Q. Where can I get information about the patient support that Bristol Myers Squibb plans to provide? Individuals with MS and health care providers may call for information at 1-833-ZEPOSIA (1-833-937-6742). In addition, the company has launched a for information.   Q. Is Zeposia being tested in primary progressive MS or non-active secondary-progressive MS? Not at this time.   Q. Is it safe to start on Zeposia during the COVID-19 pandemic? Many experts believe it is safe to start a disease-modifying therapy (DMT), including Zeposia, during the COVID-19 pandemic. Zeposia may increase your risk of infections, including COVID-19. This must be weighed against other factors including your MS activity, your age, other medical conditions and other potential factors that could impact your DMT. This is a difficult decision and needs a thorough discussion with your MS provider. The company is making it possible for many individuals to get at-home medical testing required before an individual begins taking Zeposia.

e699239e-0a22-42a0-920e-bec285febe98,"Mavenclad (Cladribine) Tablets Approved by the FDA for Adults with Relapsing Forms of MS, Including Active SPMS Mavenclad (Cladribine) Tablets Approved by the FDA for Adults with Relapsing Forms of MS, Including Active SPMS In a dated March 29, 2019, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced the approval of Mavenclad (cladribine) oral tablets to treat adults with relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (MS). The approval is for individuals with relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) and for individuals with active secondary-progressive MS (SPMS). Mavenclad is not recommended for individuals with clinically isolated syndrome (CIS). According to the FDA, Mavenclad is generally recommended for patients who have had an inadequate response to, or are unable to tolerate, an alternate drug indicated for the treatment of MS. Because of its safety profile, it is not considered to be a first-line of treatment for MS. Following the approval of Mayzent (siponimod) oral tablets three days earlier, Mavenclad has become the second disease-modifying therapy (DMT) to be approved in recent years for active secondary-progressive MS. According to EMD Serono, the makers of Mavenclad, this medication “is the first and only FDA-approved treatment for RRMS and active SPMS that provides two years of proven efficacy with a maximum of 20 days of oral treatment, during a two-year period.” This medication will be available to patients within approximately two weeks of the approval date. According to MSAA’s Chief Medical Consultant Dr. Jack Burks, “To have two treatments approved by the FDA within three days of one another is truly exciting. Additionally, both of these medications are not only indicated for people with relapsing-remitting MS, but also for individuals with active secondary-progressive MS, a patient population that previously had no realistic FDA-approved treatment options. What makes Mavenclad so unique is that it is an oral medication that is given in only two annual courses for a maximum of 20 days over a period of two years. No additional treatments are needed for the next two years, while treatments beyond the four-year time period have not yet been studied. We are greatly encouraged to see a second approved treatment for these two types of MS, giving individuals with MS more treatment options and more potential to receive the best possible medication for their specific disease course and situation.” In clinical trials, cladribine has been shown to reduce disease activity in patients with relapsing MS, including disability progression, annualized relapse rate, and MRI activity. Potential adverse events include lymphopenia, a condition that causes abnormally low counts of white blood cells that play a role in fighting infection, and herpes zoster infection. The FDA’s press release explains that most people with MS start with a relapsing-remitting course of symptom flare-ups and remissions, possibly with some degree of residual disability. Over time, some patients experience an increase in disability that is independent of relapses, and this is referred to as “secondary-progressive MS.” Initially, people with this form of MS may still experience relapses, which is referred to as “active” secondary-progressive MS – the form that Mavenclad is approved to treat. Without treatment, many of those with this form of MS eventually experience continued progression of disability without relapses, and this is referred to as “non-active” secondary-progressive MS. Mavenclad is not approved for this latter form of the disease. This approval comes eight months after the announcement that the FDA had accepted a New Drug Application (NDA) for Mavenclad, previously referred to as “Cladribine Tablets.” At that time, this investigational treatment for relapsing forms of MS had already been accepted by the European Commission in August 2017 and by Canada in December 2017. It had also been approved for the treatment of relapsing MS in 38 countries under the trade name Mavenclad. Please see MSAA’s news item, “,” for more information. According to MSAA’s , “Cladribine selectively targets the immune system’s B cells and T cells, leading to depletion of those cells. This is followed by a distinct pattern of ‘reconstitution,’ as new B cells and T cells are produced. The medication has an interesting dosing regimen, with two annual courses given for a maximum of 20 days over two years. Its developers note that this approach avoids continuous suppression of the immune system.” Following these first two years, no treatment is needed for Years 3 and 4. The FDA’s approval of Mavenclad was based on the 96-week, Phase III CLARITY trial, where 1,326 patients with RRMS were randomized in a roughly 1:1:1 ratio to receive 3.5 mg of cladribine per kilogram (kg) of body weight, 5.25 mg/kg cladribine, or placebo. Either of the two doses, or the placebo, was given in two or four short courses for the first 48 weeks. This was followed by two short courses starting at Week 48 and Week 52, for a total of 8 to 20 days of treatment per year. According to MSAA’s , “Patients receiving cladribine at either dose had annualized relapse rates that were less than half the rate of individuals receiving placebo. Roughly 79 percent of the cladribine-treated patients did not have a relapse over the 96-week study period, as compared to 61 percent of people in the placebo group. Individuals receiving cladribine, at either dose, also had a lower risk of sustained progression of disability and a greater reduction in the number of brain lesions identified on MRI relative to the placebo group.” The FDA explains that Mavenclad must be dispensed with a patient Medication Guide, describing important information about the drug’s uses and risks. Mavenclad has a Boxed Warning for an increased risk of malignancy (cancer) and fetal harm. Mavenclad is not to be used in patients who currently have or previously had a malignancy, nor should it be given to patients who have an increased risk of malignancy. Mavenclad should not be used in pregnant women, nor in women and men of reproductive potential who do not plan to use effective contraception during treatment and for six months after the course of therapy because of the potential for fetal harm. Mavenclad should be stopped if the patient becomes pregnant. Other warnings include the risk of decreased lymphocyte (white blood cell) counts, and these should be monitored before, during, and after treatment. Mavenclad may increase the risk of infections, liver injury, and other health risks. Physicians need to screen for these conditions and stop treatment if necessary. The most common adverse reactions reported by patients receiving Mavenclad in the clinical trials include upper respiratory tract infections, headache, and decreased lymphocyte counts.   EMD Serono’s patient assistance program, MS LifeLines, will offer personalized patient support for individuals who want to learn more about Mavenclad.

There are currently no licensed treatments that target disability progression in people with SPMS.   The research will be led by Dr. Jeremy Chataway, University College London Institute of Neurology, who led the phase 2 trial of simvastatin involving 140 people with SPMS that was published in in 2014. The research found those taking high doses of the drug had a significant reduction in the rate of brain atrophy (brain shrinkage) over two years, and also had better disability and quality of life scores at the end of the study.   “This drug holds incredible promise for the thousands of people living with secondary progressive MS in the U.K., and around the world, who currently have few options for treatments that have an effect on disability,” said Chataway. “This study will establish definitively whether simvastatin is able to slow the rate of disability progression over a three year period, and we are very hopeful it will.”   Bruce Bebo, Executive Vice President, Research for the National MS Society said, “We are very pleased to be a partner in the public-private funding syndicate that was forged to support a phase 3 clinical trial of a repurposed, generic therapy for people with SPMS, for whom there are few treatment choices.”   The simvastatin trial begins in Spring 2017, and will involve 1180 people with SPMS across the U.K. The trial will take six years to complete.   The trial will cost a total of nearly $7 million, with research costs of: •        $1.8M        National Institute for Health Research (U.K.) •        $1.4M        MS Society (U.K.) •        $1.4M        National MS Society (U.S.) Multiple sclerosis is an unpredictable, often disabling . range from numbness and tingling to blindness and paralysis, and there is currently no cure for MS.

437a7a03-863e-448d-afbd-0fd1c5f0ba41,"How Close Are We to a Cure for Multiple Sclerosis? — — There’s currently no cure for multiple sclerosis (MS) yet. However, in recent years, new medications have become available to help slow the progression of the disease and manage its symptoms. Researchers continue to develop new treatments and learn more about the causes and risk factors of this disease. Read on to learn about some of the latest treatment breakthroughs and promising avenues of research. Disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) are the main group of medications used to treat MS. To date, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved DMTs for different types of MS. It treats relapsing forms of MS and primary progressive MS (PPMS). This is the to be approved to treat PPMS and the only one approved for all four types of MS. This drug treats pediatric MS. It was already approved for adults. In 2018, it became the first DMT to be approved . It’s to treat relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) as well as active secondary progressive MS (SPMS). It’s to treat RRMS, Active SPMS, and clinically isolated syndrome (CIS). In , it effectively reduced the rate of relapse in people with Active SPMS. Compared to a placebo, it cut the relapse rate in half. This drug is to treat RRMS, Active SPMS, and CIS. It’s similar to dimethyl fumarate (Tecfidera), an older DMT. However, it causes fewer gastrointestinal side effects. . This drug is approved to treat CIS, RRMS, and active SPMS. It’s the newest DMT to be added to the market and was FDA approved in March 2020. While new treatments have been approved, another medication has been removed from pharmacy shelves. In March 2018, daclizumab (Zinbryta) was around the world. This drug is no longer available to treat MS. Several other medications are working their way through the research pipeline. In recent studies, some of these medications have shown promise for treating MS. The results of a new suggest that ibudilast might help reduce the progression of disability in people with MS. To learn more about this medication, the manufacturer a phase III clinical trial. The findings of a suggest that clemastine fumarate might help restore the protective coating around nerves in people with relapsing forms of MS. This oral antihistamine is currently available over the counter but not in the dose used in the clinical trial. More research is needed to study its potential benefits and risks for treating MS. These are only a few of the treatments currently being studied. To learn about current and future clinical trials for MS, visit . Thanks to the development of new medications for MS, people have a growing number of treatment options to choose from. To help guide their decisions, scientists are using large databases and statistical analyses to try to pinpoint the best treatment options for different types of patients, reports the . Eventually, this research might help patients and doctors learn which treatments are most likely to work for them. To understand the causes and risk factors of MS, geneticists and other scientists are combing the human genome for clues. Members of the International MS Genetics Consortium have identified associated with MS. For example, identified four new genes linked to the condition. Eventually, findings like this might help scientists develop new strategies and tools to predict, prevent, and treat MS. In recent years, scientists have also the role that bacteria and other microbes in our guts might play in the development and progression of MS. This community of bacteria is known as our gut microbiome. Not all bacteria are harmful. In fact, many “friendly” bacteria live in our bodies and help regulate our immune systems. When the balance of bacteria in our bodies is off, it can lead to inflammation. This might contribute to the development of autoimmune diseases, including MS. Research into the gut microbiome might help scientists understand why and how people develop MS. It could also pave the way for new treatment approaches, including dietary interventions and other therapies. Scientists continue to gain new insight into the risk factors and causes of MS as well as potential treatment strategies. New medications have been approved in recent years. Others have shown promise in clinical trials. These advancements are helping improve the health and well-being of the many people who live with this condition while bolstering hopes for a potential cure. — — Six Talking Points to Bring Up at Your Next Appointment for MS Oral vs. Injectable MS Treatments: What’s the Difference?

For some, these treatments reduce the number and severity of attacks and slow disease activity.   We are making significant progress in stopping MS: The Society joined with NIH to launch a therapy trial of the re-purposed therapy ibudilast in primary-progressive and secondary-progressive MS. suggest that ibudilast significantly slowed the rate of brain atrophy (shrinkage), which has been linked to cognitive and physical disability in MS.This therapy has been designated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration as a “Fast Track Product” in terms of its development as a possible treatment of progressive MS. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved the expansion of the use of the oral MS therapy Gilenya® (fingolimod, Novartis AG) and adolescents 10 years of age or older with relapsing MS. This is the first therapy specifically approved to treat pediatric MS. The Alliance is an unprecedented global collaboration of MS organisations, researchers, health professionals, the pharmaceutical industry, companies, trusts, foundations, donors and people affected by progressive MS, working together to address the unmet needs of people with progressive MS ─ rallying the global community to find solutions. The mission is to accelerate the development of effective treatments for people with progressive forms of multiple sclerosis to improve quality of life worldwide. There is increasing understanding that malfunctioning mitochondria, the tiny energy producers of cells (like battery packs), may contribute to nervous system damage in MS, opening up possibilities for preventing that damage.  An international team has reported the feasibility and safety of using a patient’s own altered blood cells to reduce immune responses against specific components of myelin. The National MS Society-launched MS Outcome Assessments Consortium and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration continue to clear a pathway for a new tool for improving and speeding clinical trials in MS. This team already has generated a new database containing nearly 2500 patient records from the placebo arms of nine MS clinical trials is now available for research by qualified investigators.  Identifying the causes of MS, and the underlying mechanisms and biological pathways involved in MS injury to the brain and spinal cord, will expose new targets for the development of treatments to stop the damage that causes disability. Diagnosing progressive disease based on biomarkers, in addition to clinical presentation would enable the testing of therapies earlier, promising better ways of protecting the nervous system from MS injury. High impact research areas include: Clarifying the destructive and protective roles of the adaptive and innate immune system, including both infiltrating and compartmentalized cells Determining the causes of tissue injury at different stages of disease, and whether neurodegeneration and demyelination can be independent events in MS Determining how evolving MRI sequences relate to pathological changes in the central nervous system Leveraging big data and transformative technologies to identify and interrogate relevant biological pathways and clinical/demographic features that influence disability progression Ensuring access to human central nervous system tissues/cells from MS patients and healthy controls for the purpose of gaining a thorough understanding of the neuropathology of MS Determining the specific pathologic underpinnings of MS progression Identifying objective indicators of disease activity that mark the transition to progression, measure treatment impact, and predict an individual’s course and response to therapy Determining mechanisms underlying the causes of progression in the absence of acute inflammation or relapses, the transition from relapsing to secondary progressive MS, and whether primary progressive and secondary progressive MS have similar biological underpinnings Developing better animal models that recapitulate human pathology to inform the study of the mechanisms underlying MS and progression Developing tools that allow better treatment decision making and personalized medicine, including therapy risks/benefits Testing approaches for the prevention and treatment of MS progression including repurposed/repositioned FDA-approved therapies, impact of early aggressive treatment vs. step therapy, and cell-based therapy  Read more about our successes and goals for stopping MS. Understanding and stopping MS in its tracks requires a better understanding of the role that the immune system plays in the inflammatory attacks on myelin and, very possibly, in the injury to axons (the wire-like nerve fibers) that contributes to longer-term disability. We Support academic and commercial research leading toward clinical trials of new therapies to stop damage and progression of disability; we are feeding the pipeline in several ways and pursuing therapies for EVERYONE with MS.

MS Symptoms, Causes, Diagnosis Reviewed By: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disease in which the body's immune system attacks its own central nervous system (the brain and spinal cord). In MS, the immune system attacks and damages or destroys myelin, a substance that surrounds and insulates the nerves. The myelin destruction causes a distortion or interruption in nerve impulses traveling to and from the brain. This can result in a wide variety of symptoms. Multiple sclerosis is estimated to affect 2.8 million people worldwide. Most people are diagnosed between the ages of 20 and 50, though it can also occur in young children and the elderly. Multiple sclerosis is three times more common in women than in men. In addition, nearly all women afflicted with MS get the condition before menopause. This could mean that hormones play an important role in the disease’s development. Usually, MS in men is more severe than it is in women. They typically get MS in their 30s and 40s, just as their testosterone levels begin to decline. Although MS is more common in women than men overall, one form of the disease contradicts this pattern. People with primary progressive (PP) MS are about as likely to be male as female. (The four main types of MS are described later). People who smoke are more likely to develop MS, and to develop it more severely and with a faster progression. MS is more prevalent among Caucasians than other ethnicities. MS is believed to have a genetic component as people with a first-degree relative with the disease have a higher incidence than the general population. We don't know exactly what causes multiple sclerosis, but it is believed to be some combination of immunologic, environmental, infectious, and/or genetic factors. Some theories have been proposed, though there is not enough evidence to establish any one cause. Theories as to what causes MS include: Exposure to chemical solvents such as amines, esters, ethers, and ketones Viruses such as Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and human herpes virus 6 (HHV-6) Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disorder in which the immune system mistakenly perceives its own myelin (the protective sheath around the nerves) as an intruder and attacks it, as it would a virus or other foreign infectious agent. To understand how this harms the body, it helps to understand how nerves work. A nerve can be seen by the naked eye, but it is made up of hundreds or even thousands of microscopic nerve fibers wrapped by connective tissue. Nerves conduct messages to and from the brain by way of electrical impulses. Often the nerve fibers that make up a nerve are all individually wrapped in myelin, a protective sheath that causes electric impulses to conduct down the nerve much faster than fibers that lack myelin. (The same principle is used to improve electric wires by covering them with a plastic outer layer.) In multiple sclerosis, the immune system's T cells attack the myelin sheath. By attacking myelin, the immune system in a person with MS causes inflammation and degeneration of the myelin that can lead to demyelination, or stripping of the myelin covering of the nerves. It can also cause scarring (the ""sclerosis"" in the name “multiple sclerosis”). This causes electrical impulses to travel more slowly along the nerves resulting in deterioration of function in body processes such as vision, speech, walking, writing, and memory. While multiple sclerosis is not hereditary, genetics are believed to play a role. In the U.S., the chances of developing MS are one in 750. Having a first-degree relative (parent, sibling) increases the risk to up to 5%. An identical twin of someone with MS has a 25% chance of being diagnosed with the disorder. It is thought there is an outside trigger, as genetics only makes certain people susceptible to getting MS, which is why the disease is not considered hereditary. Genes may make a person more likely to develop the disease, but it is believed that there still is an additional outside trigger that makes it happen. There are four different types of multiple sclerosis that have been identified and each type can have symptoms ranging from mild to severe. The different types of MS can help predict the course of the disease and a patient's response to treatment. The four types of MS are discussed on the next four slides. Relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RR-MS, RRMS or RMS) is the most common type of MS, affecting about 85% of MS sufferers. RR-MS is defined by inflammatory attacks on the myelin and nerve fibers causing a worsening of neurologic function. Symptoms vary from patient to patient, and symptoms can flare up (called relapses or exacerbations) unexpectedly, and then disappear (remission). Primary-progressive multiple sclerosis (PP-MS, PPMS) is characterized by steady worsening of neurologic functioning, without any relapses or remissions. There may be occasional plateaus, but overall, the progression of the disability is continuous. This form of MS occurs equally in men and women, and the age of onset is about 10 years later than in relapsing-remitting MS. Secondary-progressive multiple sclerosis (SP-MS, SPMS) is a form of MS that follows relapsing-remitting MS. Most people diagnosed with RR-MS will eventually transition to having SP-MS. After a period of relapses (also called attacks, or exacerbations) and remissions the disease will start to progress steadily. People with SP-MS may or may not experience remissions. Progressive-relapsing multiple sclerosis (PR-MS, PRMS) is the least common form of MS, occurring in about 5% of MS patients. People with PR-MS experience steady disease progression and worsening neurological function as seen in primary-progressive multiple sclerosis (PP-MS), along with occasional relapses like people with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RR-MS). Symptoms of multiple sclerosis may be single or multiple. They may range from mild to severe in intensity. They may also be long-term or short-term in duration. Multiple sclerosis is often difficult to diagnose as symptoms are so varied and can resemble other diseases. It is often diagnosed by a process of exclusion – that is, by ruling out other neurological diseases – so the diagnosis of MS may take months to years. A physician will do a complete history and neurological exam, along with tests to evaluate mental, emotional and language functions, strength, coordination, balance, reflexes, gait, and vision. Tests to Help Confirm a Multiple Sclerosis Diagnosis Cerebrospinal fluid exam (spinal tap, lumbar puncture) One of the main ways to diagnose multiple sclerosis is an MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) scan. Characteristic areas of demyelination will show up as lesions on an MRI scan. On the left is a brain MRI scan of a 35-year-old man with relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis that reveals multiple lesions with high T2 signal intensity and one large white matter lesion. The right image shows the cervical spinal cord of a 27-year-old woman representing a multiple sclerosis demyelination and plaque (see arrow). There are several aspects to treating multiple sclerosis. Modifying the disease – there are several drugs that can reduce the severity and frequency of relapses Treating exacerbations (or attacks) with high dose corticosteroids Rehabilitation both for fitness and to manage energy levels Treatment for multiple sclerosis may include drugs to manage attacks, symptoms, or both. Many medications carry the risk of some side effects, so patients need to manage their treatment with their doctors. Corticosteroids are drugs that reduce inflammation in the body and affect the function of the immune system. They are often used to manage MS attacks, but can have numerous side effects. There are several medications approved for disease modification, including the following: Many medications are used to treat and manage symptoms associated with multiple sclerosis. Here are some common multiple sclerosis symptoms, followed by the medical treatments often used to treat them. Methylprednisolone (Solu-Medrol): Solu-Medrol is given intravenously during the acute attack, sometimes followed up with an oral corticosteroid. Continued from the last slide, here are some common multiple sclerosis symptoms, followed by the medical treatments often used to treat them. : Anti-convulsants like carbamazepine (Tegretol) or gabapentin (Neurontin) are used for face or limb pain. : Anti-depressants or electrical stimulation are used for pricking pain, intense tingling, and burning. : Antibiotics are used to manage infections : Vitamin C and cranberry juice are used to prevent infections : Used for bladder dysfunction This is usually treated by increasing fluids and fiber to the diet. Often resistant to treatment. Sometimes drugs or surgery are used if tremors are severe. There has been a lot of progress over the years in managing multiple sclerosis, and research is ongoing into new therapies. There are several new avenues of current research. Scientists hope to find further associations between lifestyle and illness progression. They want to learn ways to repair and reverse the damage MS causes. And they hope to learn the ultimate cause of this disease. Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disease that progressively damages the nerves of the brain and spinal cord. Any sensory or motor (muscular) function in the body may be affected by the nerves damaged from MS. The cause of multiple sclerosis is unknown, but it is believed to be a combination of genetic, immunological, infectious, and/or environmental factors. There are four different types of multiple sclerosis and symptoms range from mild to severe. The different types of MS can help predict the course of the disease and, to some degree, the patient's response to treatment. What Is Multiple Sclerosis?

b3669cc3-1cd3-4c89-acd4-b019b4150ef7,"— — Multiple sclerosis (MS) is often diagnosed when people are in their 20s and 30s. The disease typically follows a pattern, moving through different variations or types over the years. This is because as you get older, your MS symptoms are likely to change. MS damages myelin, the protective coating around nerves. This damage interrupts the flow of nerve impulses from the brain to the body. The greater the damage that’s done to the myelin, the more severe your symptoms will become. Everyone with MS is different. How quickly your disease progresses and the symptoms you experience won’t necessarily be the same as someone else’s with the condition. Your doctor can’t predict exactly how your disease will change over time. But advances in MS research are offering better treatments to slow the disease’s progression and improve the outlook for people living with MS. MS often starts with a single attack. Suddenly your vision becomes blurry, or your legs feel numb or weak. When these symptoms last for at least 24 hours and this is the first attack, they’re called clinically isolated syndrome (CIS). CIS typically starts between ages 20 and 40. It’s caused by inflammation or damage to myelin in your central nervous system. CIS can be a warning of MS to come, but that isn’t always the case. Between of people with CNS will develop MS. If an MRI shows signs of brain lesions, MS is much more likely to develop. Up to of people with MS are first diagnosed with RRMS. It typically starts when people are in their 20s or 30s, although it can begin earlier or later in life. In RRMS, attacks on myelin produce periods of symptom flare-ups called relapses. During a relapse, symptoms may include: Each relapse can last from a few days to a few months. The exact symptoms and their severity can be different for each person. After a relapse, you’ll enter a symptom-free period called remission. Each remission lasts for several months or years. The disease doesn’t progress during remission. Some people stay in RRMS for many decades. Others progress to the secondary-progressive form within a few years. It’s impossible to predict how each person’s disease will act, but new treatments are helping to slow the progression of MS overall. About of people with MS are diagnosed with the primary progressive form. PPMS usually appears during the mid to late 30s. In PPMS, nervous system damage and symptoms steadily get worse over time. There are no real remission periods. The disease continues to progress, and it can eventually lead to problems walking and performing other daily activities. SPMS is the stage that follows RRMS. In this type of MS, myelin damage gets worse over time. You won’t have the long remissions that you had with RRMS. Increasing nervous system damage will lead to more severe symptoms. In the past, about with RRMS moved into the SPMS stage within 10 years, and transitioned to SPMS within 25 years. With new MS drugs, fewer people are progressing to SPMS, and the transition is happening much more slowly. Experts don’t yet know how long these treatments can delay the progression to SPMS. MS is a disease that starts early in life but progresses over time. Most people start with the relapsing-remitting form, alternating periods of symptoms called relapses with symptom-free periods called remissions. Without treatment, the disease continues to the secondary-progressive form. Yet new and more effective treatments are slowing MS progression, sometimes for decades. — — Advancing MS: Coping with Depression, Stress, and Anger Understanding Secondary-Progressive Multiple Sclerosis Depression and MS: Ways to Care for Your Mental Health If you have MS, you're at an increased risk of developing depression.

fb5523c0-8cb7-4c61-9324-80e2a2da154f,"On March 26, 2020, Bristol Myers Squibb announced that the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Zeposia® (ozanimod) for the treatment of adults with relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (RMS), including clinically isolated syndrome (CIS), relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS), and active secondary-progressive MS (SPMS). Zeposia is an oral medication given once daily as a 0.92 mg pill. Patients taking Zeposia for the first time start with a titration, which means that it is begun at a lower dose and gradually increased until the full dose is reached. With this newly approved medication, starting at a lower dose reduces the risk of a transient decrease in heart rate and atrioventricular conduction delays, which may occur if a larger dose is introduced too quickly. Zeposia is a sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) receptor modulator that binds with high affinity to S1P receptors 1 and 5. It joins two other previously approved S1P receptor modulators: Gilenya® (fingolimod) and Mayzent® (siponimod); additional S1P receptor modulators are also under investigation. Ponesimod is among those still under investigation and it was recently submitted to the FDA for approval. Zeposia is the only approved S1P receptor modulator that offers RMS patients an initiation that does not require a genetic test or label-based first-dose observation. S1P receptor modulators are thought to work by blocking potentially damaging immune-system cells (lymphocytes) from leaving lymph nodes, lowering their number in the blood and tissues. These treatments may reduce damage to the central nervous system (CNS). In clinical trials of more than 2,600 adults with relapsing forms of MS, Zeposia was shown to have a significant effect on reducing the annual relapse rate (ARR) as well as the number of brain lesions, when compared to Avonex® (interferon beta-1a). The most common adverse reactions occurring in 4% or more of the study participants include: upper respiratory infection; elevated liver enzymes, which could indicate inflammation; orthostatic hypotension, which is a sudden drop in blood pressure when changing position, such as when standing up from a sitting position; urinary tract infection; back pain; and high blood pressure. Warnings and precautions include an increased risk of infections, heart-rhythm issues, liver injury, fetal risk if pregnant while taking Zeposia, a decline in pulmonary (respiratory) function, and macular edema (swelling behind the eye). Additional warnings and limitations are specified in the prescribing information. In light of the current COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on the country’s healthcare system, Bristol Myers Squibb is delaying the launch of Zeposia. For more information, please see . Individuals with questions may reach the BMS (Bristol Myers Squibb) Contact Center at . On October 30, 2019, Biogen Inc. and Alkermes plc announced the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of Vumerity™ (diroximel fumarate) oral capsules to treat adults with relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (MS). This approval includes the treatment of clinically isolated syndrome (CIS), relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS), and active secondary-progressive MS (SPMS). This medication is taken by mouth twice daily. Vumerity is in the same class of MS therapy as Biogen’s Tecfidera® (dimethyl fumarate), but is believed to cause fewer gastrointestinal (GI) side effects. The exact mechanism of action by which Vumerity exerts therapeutic effect in MS is not completely understood. However, upon entering the body, the medication is rapidly converted into the molecule monomethyl fumarate, which is the same active component found in Tecfidera. The monomethyl fumarate molecule is thought to activate an antioxidant protein that reduces oxidative stress, which in turn slows damage to protective nerve fibers in the brain. When submitting Vumerity to the FDA for approval, study results comparing Vumerity to Tecfidera were included to establish bioequivalence, which refers to having the same active ingredients and resulting in similar effectiveness, safety, and side effects. The Phase III, open-label, two-year EVOLVE-MS-1 safety study in RRMS, along with pharmacokinetic bridging studies comparing Vumerity and Tecfidera, were used to demonstrate bioequivalence. EVOLVE-MS-2 (an elective Phase III, five-week, double-blind study) evaluated the gastrointestinal (GI) tolerability of Vumerity and Tecfidera. In terms of effectiveness and safety, Tecfidera has been shown to reduce the rate of MS relapses, slow the progression of disability, and impact the number of MS brain lesions in people with relapsing forms of MS, while demonstrating a well-characterized safety profile. In terms of side effects, abdominal pain, diarrhea, and nausea were among the most common adverse events associated with Tecfidera in clinical trials. However, the “distinct chemical structure” of Vumerity that converts to the same active molecule as Tecfidera, reduces the incidence of gastrointestinal side effects. Common side effects include flushing, redness, itching, or rash; nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, stomach pain, or indigestion. Warnings, side effects, and adverse events are similar to those listed for Tecfidera. Individuals with liver problems, kidney problems, low white blood cell counts or infection, as well as those who are pregnant, breastfeeding, or plan to become pregnant or breastfeed, should speak with their healthcare provider before taking Vumerity. Allergic reactions, PML (progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy), decreases in white blood cell counts, and liver problems are among the potential serious adverse events that could occur.

On December 5, 2019, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced that they had approved the applications from three separate pharmaceutical companies for the first generic versions of Gilenya® (fingolimod) capsules for the treatment of relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (MS) in adult patients. Approved in September 2010, Gilenya was the first oral drug available for the long-term treatment of relapsing-remitting MS. In May 2018, Gilenya became the first DMT also approved for the treatment of children and adolescents, ages 10 through 17, with relapsing forms of MS. At this time, Gilenya is the only DMT approved for this patient population, referred to as “pediatric MS.” However, the FDA states that this approval of the three generic applications is for relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (MS) in adult patients, and does not specify if pediatric MS will be included within these medicines’ indications at this time. The three pharmaceutical companies who received this approval of their generic Gilenya are HEC Pharm Co. Limited, Biocon Limited, and Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Limited. Further details on how soon these companies may market their generic versions of Gilenya and when these will be available to the MS community have not yet been announced. For more information, please see . FDA Accepts Filing of Ofatumumab in the Treatment of RMS On February 24, 2020, Novartis announced that the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) accepted the filing of ofatumumab, a novel B-cell therapy for adults with relapsing forms of MS. Ofatumumab is an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody that has the potential advantage of being a human monoclonal antibody, versus using antibodies from non-human species that have been modified. Ofatumumab has a unique target on the CD20 molecule and is approved for certain forms of leukemia. Two simultaneous Phase III clinical trials – ASCLEPIOS I and ASCLEPIOS II – compared the efficacy and safety of monthly subcutaneous ofatumumab (20mg) versus once-daily 14mg doses of oral Aubagio® (teriflunomide) in adults with RMS. In both the ASCLEPIOS I and ASCLEPIOS II studies, ofatumumab reduced the annual relapse rate by 50.5% and 58.5% respectively, significantly suppressed both gadolinium-enhancing T1 lesions and new or enlarging T2 lesions, and showed a relative risk reduction in three-month and six-month confirmed disability progression (CDP) in pre-specified pooled analyses. Novartis anticipates regulatory approval in June 2020. For general information or to speak with a trained Client Services Specialist, please call MSAA’s Helpline at .

SPMS with active disease refers to those patients who are in a progressive phase of the disease and continue to have clinical relapses. In the clinical trials, siponimod appeared to have the most benefit for patients who were younger, had gadolinium-enhancing lesions, lower disability, and shorter disease duration. The benefit of siponimod in patients with SPMS without relapses is less clear. Siponimod is a sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor (S1P) modulator that selectively binds the S1P subtypes 1 and 5. It acts as a functional antagonist, as binding to S1P1 induces receptor internalization and degradation in T and B cells. The ultimate result is prevention of lymphocyte egress from the lymphoid tissue into the central nervous system (CNS). Additionally, preclinical studies have shown that siponimod inhibits demyelination, and attenuates the production of TNFα, IL-6, and IL-17 by astrocytes and microglia. This suggests that siponimod may act directly on the CNS in addition to its role in decreasing circulating lymphocytes. Siponimod has a rapid onset of action, and reduces circulating T and B cells within 4-6 hours. Its half-life is approximately 30 hours. Circulating lymphocytes counts recover within a week after treatment discontinuation. Complete elimination of siponimod from the body takes approximately 10 days. Siponimod is metabolized in the liver through the Cytochrome P450 system (primarily through CYP2C9, subsequently by CYP3A4). Genetic variants to the CYP2C9 enzyme can slow siponimod metabolism. This is important in determining the correct dose and titration schedule for a given patient, as patients with the *3 variant of CYP2C9 demonstrated slower rates of drug metabolism. Specifically, heterozygotes with CYP2C9 *3 have moderately slowed metabolism, and homozygotes with CYP2C9 *3/*3 have severely impaired metabolism. As a result, CYP2C9 *3 heterozygotes should follow a lower dose titration and lower final dose; CYP2C9 *3/*3 genotype is a contraindication to siponimod. Does siponimod have any significant drug interactions? While siponimod does not induce nor inhibit the CYP450 system, its metabolism can be affected by medications that are CYP2C9 inhibitors or inducers. For example, a patient who takes warfarin, a CYP2C9 inhibitor, may have increased levels of siponimod. We recommend a careful review of a patient’s medication list, and would use siponimod cautiously in patients who take CYP450 modulators. What did the clinical trials of siponimod for MS show? Siponimod was approved for treatment of MS based on the results of two clinical trials. The first was , which was a phase II randomized, double-blind, dose-finding, placebo comparison trial for patients with RRMS. This showed that siponimod at a dose of 2mg approached peak efficacy as measured by a reduction in the number of new or enlarging T2 lesions or new enhancing lesions. It also showed that the medication had favorable tolerability and safety. While there were two significant cardiovascular adverse events, both of these patients had preexisting cardiac risk factors, and both of these events occurred after drug discontinuation and washout. The safety 24-month extension study did not identify any new serious safety signals compared to the original study. The second study was EXPAND, which was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase III trial of patients with SPMS. EXPAND demonstrated that siponimod reduced the risk of confirmed disability worsening in patients with SPMS by 21%, reduced the risk of relapses compared to placebo by 55%, and slowed the rate of radiographic disease activity and brain atrophy. The side effects of siponimod that occurred in greater than 10% of patients in clinical trials are as follows: Siponimod, similar to other S1P modulators, can lead to temporarily bradycardia immediately following the first dose, although a five-day titration appears to mitigate first-dose bradycardia. There were no symptomatic bradycardic events or adverse reactions, nor clinically significant changes in baseline blood pressure observed in the trials. Siponimod also induced cardiac conduction abnormalities in 3% of patients in clinical trials, including first- and second-degree AV block. Approximately 1% of patients in clinical trials experienced increases in alanine aminotransferase (ALT). 2% of siponimod patients developed macular edema, compared to less than 1% of placebo patients. In the clinical trial EXPAND, macular edema was seen in 2% of siponimod patients compared to <1% of placebo patients. Patients with a prior history of uveitis and patients with diabetes mellitus are at increased risk of macular edema when taking siponimod. While this is not an absolute contraindication, we recommend obtaining a baseline ophthalmologic evaluation. We typically complete this using optical coherence tomography (OCT). OCT monitoring for macular edema is only done if symptoms suggestive possible macular edema. OCT monitoring for macular edema is only done if symptoms suggestive possible macular edema. Is siponimod associated with progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML)? There have been no cases of PML reported in patients treated with siponimod, although PML has been associated with another S1P modulator fingolimod. Infingolimod the rate of PML is very low. . Accordingly, a risk of PML during siponimod treatment cannot be excluded. We believe that if PML is to develop in patients taking siponimod, it will occur at the same low rate as was seen in fingolimod. Currently, we do not feel that positive JC virus serology should preclude treatment with siponimod. Clinical trials showed that the overall rate of infections was comparable between siponimod and placebo group (49.0% vs 49.1%, respectively), and the rate of serious infection was slightly increased for the siponimod group compared to placebo (2.9% vs 2.5%). The siponimod group had a higher rate of herpetic infections (including VZV), , upper respiratory infection, and fungal skin infection. While not reported for siponimod, rare cases of cryptococcal meningitis have been reported in patients taking fingolimod, another S1P modulator. Siponimod reduces the circulating absolute lymphocyte count (ALC), which is its intended pharmacodynamics effect. The magnitude of reduction is dose-dependent, and is approximately 20-30%. Lymphopenia (defined as ALC < 200/µL) occurred in 1% of patients, however there is no correlation between lymphopenia and an increased risk of infections, including PML. Contraindications to siponimod include patients homozygous for the CYP2C9*3/*3 genotype; significant heart rhythm or conduction abnormalities (unless the patient has a functioning pacemaker); or in the past six months has had myocardial infarction, unstable angina, stroke, TIA, decompensated heart failure, or Class III or IV heart failure.   Siponimod is a once-daily oral medication that follows an initial titration. Prior to starting the medication, CYP2C9 genotype must be tested in order to determine how the drug will be metabolized for a specific patient. This determines the titration strategy and target dosage. If a titration dose is missed for more than 24 hours, treatment should be restarted with Day 1 of the titration schedule. If treatment is interrupted for more than 4 days, patients should repeat the titration. For patients with CYP2C9 Genotypes *1/*1, *1/*2, or *2/*2: initiate siponimod therapy with the standard 5-day titration, followed by the maintenance dose of 2 mg taken once daily beginning on day 6. This standard titration should be prescribed using the starter pack (which includes 12 pills of 0.25mg), followed by a separate prescription for the 2mg maintenance pills. Titration for wild-type CYP2C9 Genotypes (*1/*1, *1/*2, or *2/*2) For patients with CYP2C9 Genotypes *1/*3, or *2/*3: initiate siponimod therapy with an altered 4-day titration, followed by the maintenance dose of 1 mg taken once daily beginning on day 5. The titration should be given as a prescription for siponimod 0.25 mg x 7 pills, followed by a separate prescription for the 1mg maintenance dose. Titration for heterozygote CYP2C9 Genotypes (*1/*3, or *2/*3) Siponimod is contraindicated for patients with the *3/*3 CYP2C9 genotype due to dangerously prolonged siponimod metabolism. Prior to starting treatment with siponimod, we recommend the following tests: this can be done in a patient’s home at no cost to the patient through the pharmaceutical company Virus IgG antibodies (VZV), and we recommend vaccinating VZV antibody-negative patients prior to starting treatment OCT to screen for macular edema, can also consider ophthalmologic examination to screen for asymptomatic uveitis It is also recommended that patients not have active infections when starting siponimod Is monitoring required during the first dose like with fingolimod? For the majority of patients, first dose observation is not necessary. First-dose 6 hour monitoring is recommended for patients who have a history of myocardial infarction, heart failure, sinus bradycardia (HR < 55 bpm), or first- or second-degree AV block as detected on baseline EKG. This monitoring should include hourly measurements of pulse and blood pressure, as well as an EKG at the end of the observation period. What monitoring is done during siponimod treatment? Although routine monitoring is not stipulated in the prescribing information, we at the Mellen Center recommend measuring blood pressure during office visits, and checking CBC with differential and LFTs 3-6 months after starting treatment, then every 6-12 months while on the medication. On these labs, we expect to see a 20-30% reduction in ALC, but we monitor for lymphopenia (ALC < 200/µL) and elevated ALT. For any significant abnormalities, more frequent monitoring is reasonable. Currently, there are no data to suggest that the lymphopenia produced by siponimod leads to a higher risk of infection. We recommend routine clinical monitoring for infections for all siponimod patients, especially for those who develop ALC < 200/µL with concomitant leukopenia, or for patients with a history of frequent infections. For other S1P modulators such as fingolimod, rebound disease activity may occur after drug discontinuation. While this phenomenon was not seen in the siponimod clinical trials, we consider it a potential risk, and therefore patients should be monitored closely for relapses, MRI lesion activity, or disability worsening after stopping the drug. Additionally, rare cases of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) have occurred in patients receiving other S1P modulators, though this has not yet been reported in siponimod patients. It is therefore considered a potential risk, and should be considered in the differential diagnosis for any patient who develops a new neurologic symptom or deficit. Although there are no data on the safety of siponimod in pregnant woman, siponimod has been shown to cause teratogenicity in various animal models. Therefore, female patients of childbearing potential should use effective contraceptive methods while on siponimod, and wait at least 2 months (based on the half-life of the drug) after the last siponimod dose before attempting to conceive. There are currently no data on the safety of siponimod on the breastfed infant, however animal studies have shown that the medication is secreted into breast milk. A discussion of the risks and benefits of breastfeeding while on siponimod should occur with each patient individually. Which vaccines should a patient receive while on siponimod? Prior to starting siponimod therapy, VZV antibodies should be checked, and patients who are antibody-negative should receive VZV vaccination. After starting siponimod, patients should receive all age-appropriate vaccines, including the annual flu vaccine, though we recommend avoiding any live vaccines. Killed or inactivated vaccines are considered to be relatively safe.

Mavenclad is not recommended for use in people with (CIS) because of its safety profile.  Mavenclad is not recommended for people who: are pregnant, plan to become pregnant, or are a woman of childbearing age or a man able to father a child and not using birth control have active infections, including tuberculosis and hepatitis. Mavenclad is approved for the treatment of adults with relapsing forms of MS including and active . Relapsing-remitting MS – the most common disease course – is characterized by clearly defined attacks of new or increasing neurologic symptoms. These attacks – also called relapses or exacerbations – are followed by periods of partial or complete recovery (remissions). follows an initial relapsing-remitting course.   Many people who are initially diagnosed with relapsing-remitting MS eventually transition to a secondary progressive course in which there is a progressive worsening of neurologic function over time. Some people with secondary progressive MS can be characterized as either active or not active, as well as with progression or without progression. Those with active secondary progressive MS have had progression of disability but still experience acute relapses or new MRI activity.   Mavenclad is a compound that targets certain types of white blood cells that drive the immune attack in MS. It temporarily reduces the number of both T and B cells without continuous suppression of the immune system. Mavenclad is a tablet, taken by mouth in two treatment courses, twelve months apart.   A phase III clinical trial (CLARITY) tested the safety and effectiveness of oral Mavenclad in 1,326 people with relapsing-remitting MS. Investigators compared the effects of two doses of Mavenclad (3.5 mg/kg, and 5.25 mg/kg) against an inactive placebo and followed participants for up to 2 years. Those taking the lower dose of Mavenclad had a 58% reduction in annual relapse rate compared to people in the placebo group, and those taking the higher dose had a 55% reduction compared to placebo. People taking Mavenclad also had a lower risk of sustained disability progression at 3 months as measured by the EDSS scale and had less disease activity on MRI scans.   Prescribing information for includes several warnings and precautions, including or increased risk of cancers and birth defects/fetal harm. Women and men should use birth control before and at least 6 months after the last dose of Mavenclad. The most common adverse reactions reported during clinical trials included upper respiratory tract infections, headache, and low white blood counts.   Please see the prescribing information for the full list of warnings and precautions. Other potential risks include: Graft-Versus-Host Disease with blood transfusion (serious condition where cells in the transfused blood react to the body) The prescribing information contains advice to health care providers about tests people should undergo before beginning to take Mavenclad. These include: Blood tests including a complete blood count, liver function tests and screening for acute or latent infections including HIV, Tuberculosis, hepatitis. Blood counts (lymphocytes) should be monitored before, during and after treatment with Mavenclad. Lymphocytes must be within normal range before initiating the first treatment course, and at least 800 cells per microliter before initiating the second treatment. Blood test for antibodies to varicella zoster virus (Shingles virus). In those who are negative, Shingles vaccination is recommended. Administer other immunizations according to standard guidelines prior to starting Mavenclad. Live vaccines or live-attenuated vaccines should be administered at least 4-6 weeks prior to dosing. For women with reproductive potential, administer pregnancy test. Screen for cancer following standard screening guidelines. Baseline (within 3 months of treatment start) MRI imaging prior to the first treatment course because of the risk of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML).

What types of MS is Mavenclad approved to treat? A. The FDA has approved oral Mavenclad for the treatment of adults with relapsing forms of MS, including  and active secondary MS.  Because of its safety profile, Mavenclad is generally recommended in adults with MS who have had an inadequate response to, or are unable to tolerate, another MS therapy.   A. Mavenclad is a pill, taken by mouth. The dose is determined by body weight and is given in two treatment courses spread over 2 years. Each yearly treatment consists of 2 treatment weeks (4 or 5 days) that will occur about one month apart.   Q. Why should a person with MS consider taking a disease-modifying therapy? A. Taking a disease-modifying therapy is currently the best way to reduce MS disease activity and future deterioration. Studies comparing people in clinical trials who started therapy earlier than those on inactive placebo suggest that early treatment offered important benefits against the accumulation of disability, which were generally not experienced to the same degree by those who started treatment later.   Selecting an MS therapy should be determined by people with MS in collaboration with the healthcare provider who treats their MS, taking into account a variety of factors, including the effectiveness of any therapy they are currently using, and weighing potential risks and benefits, costs and lifestyle factors.   Q. Should I switch from my current therapy to Mavenclad? A. The decision about whether to take Mavenclad should be made in collaboration with the healthcare provider who treats your MS, taking into account a variety of factors including the effectiveness of any therapy you are currently using, the potential risks and benefits, as well as costs and lifestyle factors. Important questions to be considered and discussed with your provider in terms of Mavenclad include: What is my tolerance for the risk of known side effects? How will my medication choice affect my ability or plans to become pregnant or to father a child? What are the comparative costs of my current therapy versus Mavenclad? Q. How does the effectiveness of Mavenclad compare to other available therapies? A. We don’t have sufficient information to answer this question, based on the clinical trial conducted for the approval of Mavenclad. In that trial, Mavenclad was not compared to other MS therapies. Q. If I have been taking another disease-modifying therapy for MS, how long will I have to wait before starting Mavenclad? A. If you have taken one or more therapies that suppresses the immune system, (such as methotrexate, cyclosporin, cyclophosphamide and azathioprine), Mavenclad could further reduce your immune system’s ability to fight infection. Before taking Mavenclad, your blood cell counts will guide your healthcare provider’s decision on when or whether to start Mavenclad.   Q. What are the potential side effects of Mavenclad? A. Please see the prescribing information for the full list of warnings and precautions. Prescribing information for includes several warnings and precautions, including or increased risk of cancers and birth defects/fetal harm. Women and men should use birth control before and at least 6 months after the last dose of Mavenclad. The most common adverse reactions reported during clinical trials included upper respiratory tract infections, headache, and low white blood counts. In addition, other potential risks include: A. The total dose of Mavenclad is based on body weight, and this is reached after 2 years of treatment. After the second dose in year two of treatment, individuals are observed for an additional two years. People who took part in the clinical trials did not need further treatment with Mavenclad in years three and four. The safety and efficacy of taking Mavenclad more than 2 years after completing 2 treatment courses has not been studied.   Q. Are there any risk factors or medical conditions that would make it inappropriate for an individual to take Mavenclad? A. Mavenclad may not be appropriate if you have existing medical conditions including liver problems, active cancer, serious infections such as HIV or tuberculosis. Mavenclad should not be taken if you are pregnant or breastfeeding. Mavenclad can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Women of childbearing potential, as well as men, should use effective contraception during therapy and for 6 months after the last dose. A barrier contraceptive method should be used with hormone contraceptives until 4 weeks after the last dose of Mavenclad. Mavenclad may interact with some medications and you should tell your healthcare provider about all of the medications you are taking.   Q. Will people taking have to get any special medical tests or monitoring? A. Yes. Tests and evaluations include: Blood tests including a complete blood count, liver function tests and screening for acute or latent infections including HIV, TB, hepatitis. Blood counts (lymphocytes) should be monitored before, during and after treatment with Mavenclad. Lymphocytes must be within normal range before initiating the first treatment course, and at least 800 cells per microliter before initiating the second treatment. Blood test for antibodies to varicella zoster virus (Shingles virus). In those who are negative, VZV vaccination is recommended. Administer other immunizations according to standard guidelines prior to starting Mavenclad. Live vaccines or live-attenuated vaccines should be administered at least 4-6 weeks prior to dosing. For women with reproductive potential, administer pregnancy test. Screen for cancer following standard screening guidelines. Baseline (within 3 months) MRI imaging prior to the first treatment course because of the risk of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML). A. The wholesale acquisition cost (WAC) of Mavenclad is $99,500 annually. The price to an individual who has MS will depend on the provisions of his or her insurance coverage and the degree to which that individual will be eligible for programs designed to assist with out-of-pocket costs. EMD Serono is offering patient support through MS LifeLines, including assistance with navigating insurance questions and additional resources that may assist those who are uninsured or underinsured. or call Q. Where can I get information about the support that EMD Serono will provide to help people gain access to Mavenclad? A. EMD Serono plans to offer support to healthcare providers and people with MS through MS LifeLines, including assistance with navigating insurance questions and additional resources that may assist those who are uninsured or underinsured. or call .   Q. What other disease-modifying therapies are available for MS? A. Other are available for people living with relapsing forms of MS, , and (an initial neurological episode). These include therapies that are taken by mouth, injection, and infusion.   A. Not at this time.   Q. Are there other therapies in development for progressive MS? A. Yes. The National MS Society is closely watching experimental treatments in development for people with progressive forms of MS. In addition, other studies include: Investigators at Oregon Health & Science University are conducting a Phase 2 clinical trial to determine if the oral supplement, lipoic acid, is an effective treatment for progressive forms of MS. The trial is co-funded by the Veteran’s Administration and the National MS Society. The SPRINT-MS trial of Ibudilast, an oral anti-inflammatory agent, demonstrated that it was well tolerated and significantly slowed the rate of brain atrophy compared to placebo in people with secondary progressive and primary progressive MS. This trial was a unique collaboration between NIH's NeuroNEXT Network, MediciNova, and the National MS Society. The MS-STAT2 study is underway at University College London, a multicenter trial testing whether a repurposed cholesterol-lowering therapy can slow the course of secondary progressive MS; the Society is providing funding. The Society is also very interested in wellness research to identify exercise, dietary and other approaches that will help people who have MS live their best lives. The Society supports several clinical trials that are investigating dietary interventions for symptom management and for their potential to modify the disease process.    Based on these trial results, is there still a need to invest in additional research on progressive MS? Yes. We need to continue our investment in research to find solutions for progressive MS. We welcome recent developments, but we must remain focused on finding more and better solutions for treating progressive MS. We will do this by our continued leadership in the International  and by funding research on progressive MS through our own research programs, and by encouraging other companies to commit to developing treatments for progressive forms of MS.     Multiple sclerosis is an unpredictable, often disabling . range from numbness and tingling to blindness and paralysis, and there is currently no cure for MS. The progress, severity and specific symptoms of MS in any one person cannot yet be predicted, but advances in and are leading to better understanding and moving us closer to .

It is made up of exactly the same amino acids (major components of proteins) as the interferon beta found in the human body. In controlled clinical trials in relapsing MS, those taking the medication had a reduced risk of disability progression, experienced fewer exacerbations, and showed a reduction in number and size of active lesions in the brain (as shown on MRI) when compared with the group taking a placebo. In a subsequent study of patients who had experienced a single demyelinating event in the optic nerve, spinal cord, or brainstem, and had lesions typical of MS on brain MRI, Avonex significantly delayed the time to a second exacerbation, and thus to a clinically definite diagnosis of MS. Avonex is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis, which include clinically isolated syndrome, relapsing-remitting disease (RRMS) and active secondary progressive disease (SPMS with relapses).

There are several different types of MS, including relapsing-remitting, progressive and fulminant. The severity of your condition depends on the type of MS you have. Symptoms of MS can include numbness, difficulty walking, fatigue and weakness in one or more body part. Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a central nervous system disorder — that is, it affects the brain and spinal cord and spares the nerves and muscles that leave the spinal cord. MS is an inflammatory disorder in which infection-fighting white blood cells enter the nervous system and cause injury. It is a demyelinating disorder because the myelin sheath that protects nerves is stripped off during inflammation. When this happens, the nerves cannot conduct electricity as well as they should, causing various symptoms. Symptoms may be the type that come and go over time (relapsing-remitting MS) or progress over time (progressive MS). MS can happen to just about anyone and is long-term. Are there different types of multiple sclerosis (MS)? MS varies from patient to patient so that each individual has their own set of symptoms, problems, and their own course. There are people who have MS so mildly that they never even know that they have it. Of course, there are also others that have it severely. It is really a spectrum that ranges from mild to severe. An international panel of experts developed a classification of MS in 1999 that most neurologists use today: : Patients have attacks of symptoms/signs, with or without recovery, but between attacks have no interval worsening. : This is often after a few years of relapsing-remitting MS. The pattern changes from a relapsing pattern to progressive in between attacks, usually with fewer attacks. : This involves a gradual onset from the beginning and no attacks. : This is a rare form, and begins with a progressive course, while later developing attacks. : This is a rare form, and is very severe, rapidly progressive MS. Is there such a thing as benign multiple sclerosis (MS)? The term, ""benign MS,"" is not part of the international classification. It is used when people have had MS for many years without developing significant measurable disability. Recent studies have shown that it cannot be predicted early in the disease and so the term can only really be used retrospectively, after people have done very well with MS for many years. What are the risk factors of multiple sclerosis (MS)? There has been extensive research about MS over the past 50 years. While we still do not know the cause of MS, we know that it is an inflammatory disorder of the central nervous system that occurs in people with a tendency to such a problem. We know that about 350,000 people in the United States have MS, about one in a 1,000 people. We know that it is more common further north and south of the equator, though we are still unsure why this is. Females tend to get MS about three times as often as males, a rate which is similar to other immune diseases. It is more common in Caucasians, but can occur in other populations. It is not contagious nor is it infectious. There may be a link with reduced vitamin D levels and perhaps with decreased sun exposure. We know that there is a genetic component to MS. Having a mother or father with MS increases the risk of having MS to about 3 to 5% lifetime, and having an identical twin with MS increases the risk to about 30%. However, many people with MS have no close family members with the disease. There is nothing that an individual with MS either did to cause the disease to happen, or can avoid to stop the disease from following its natural course. We know that emotional stress may increase the symptoms of MS. We also know that attacks of MS are more likely after infections. There does not seem to be any association with physical trauma or surgical procedures and MS, nor do these seem to make MS worse. There has been widespread research about MS over the past 50 years. We do not know the cause of MS, but do know that it is an inflammatory disorder of the central nervous system that occurs in people with a tendency to such a problem. We know that about 350,000 people in the United States have MS, about 1 in 1,000 people. We know that it is more common further north and south of the equator. Although we are still unsure exactly why this is. Females tend to get MS about three times as often as males, a rate similar to other immune diseases. MS is more common in Caucasians, but can occur in other populations. It is not contagious, nor is it infectious. Did I do anything to bring on the multiple sclerosis (MS) or make it worse? As far as we know there are no activities that specifically cause MS or make it worse. People with MS may not tolerate heat as well as they used to and may need to avoid particularly hot or humid situations. There is evidence that having infections makes having an exacerbation of MS more likely. There does not appear to be a link to trauma. However, emotional stress has been linked to a worsening of MS symptoms. Having MS is not the fault of people who have it; it can happen to anyone. Is there anything new that we know about multiple sclerosis (MS)? Multiple sclerosis is being studied actively in many research institutions around the world, and new knowledge is being added constantly. For example, we now know that even with early MS, the nerve fibers themselves (the axons) are affected more than we knew before. We know from MRI studies that new lesions (abnormal areas in the brain or spinal cord) occur about 5 to10 times as often as people with MS have new symptoms; that is, much of the disease occurs 'under the radar scope'. We know that myelin repair occurs in the central nervous system all the time. Some groups feel there are different types of immune or pathological processes going on that we call MS, and perhaps MS may be many different disorders that we have lumped together. Do any other diseases look like multiple sclerosis (MS)? When neurologists evaluate MS they are also considering other diagnoses. While MS is the most likely cause of typical white matter changes and symptoms in an otherwise healthy young person, there are some other diseases that we consider and occasionally diagnose. These include a vitamin B12 deficiency that can cause an MS-like illness, and rarely, , which may have symptoms that suggest MS. The MRI is very useful in ruling out many other disorders that could be confused with MS, and the blood tests and spinal fluid may also be helpful in diagnosing other diseases. What are some early symptoms of multiple sclerosis (MS)? MS varies from person to person so there is no 'standard' set of symptoms for MS. However, we know that common symptoms of MS include: Numbness or tingling in various parts of the body. Lhermitte's phenomenon, a symptom in which people feel electrical tingling or shocks down their back, arms or legs when they bend their neck forwards. Urinary symptoms, such as hesitancy when trying to urinate, or a feeling of urgency (when you have to go, you have to go). There is no way to predict which symptoms one person might develop. MS varies from person to person so there is no ‘standard’ set of symptoms for MS. However we know that common symptoms of MS include numbness or tingling in various parts of the body, weakness of one or more parts of the body, walking difficulties, dizziness, fatigue, visual blurring and occasionally double vision. Patients may also have a symptom called Lhermitte’s phenomenon, in which they feel electrical tingling or shocks down their back, arms or legs when they bend their neck forwards. Sometimes people notice hesitancy when they try to urinate or may find that 'when they have to go, they have to go’. There is no way to predict which symptoms one person might develop. The usual course of MS is to have periods of time where things are relatively stable, followed by times when, over a few days or weeks, new symptoms occur or old symptoms worsen. This relatively rapid worsening is known as an exacerbation (also known as an attack, or a relapse). In others with MS, there may be a tendency to progress in that symptoms gradually worsen over time (months to years). MS varies from patient to patient so that each individual has their own set of symptoms, problems, and their own course. There are people who have MS so mildly that they never even know that they have it. Of course, there are also others that have it severely. It is really a spectrum that ranges from mild to severe. An international panel of experts developed a classification of MS in 1999 that most neurologists use today. : Patients have attacks of symptoms/signs, with or without recovery, but between attacks have no interval worsening. : This is often after a few years of relapsing-remitting MS. The pattern changes from a relapsing pattern to progressive in between attacks, usually with fewer attacks. : Gradual onset from the beginning, no attacks. : This is a rare form, and begins with a progressive course, while later developing attacks. : Very severe, rapidly progressive MS. This is a rare form of MS. Why do I have symptoms with multiple sclerosis (MS)? MS damages the myelin sheath surrounding the nerve cells of the brain and spinal cord. Scarring from this damage can block or slow nerve impulses in areas of the brain (neurological damage). As a direct result of MS, you may lack coordination and feel tired, and have weakness, involuntary movements, muscle stiffness (spasticity), or pain. Symptoms such as these are called ""primary symptoms."" Primary symptoms of MS can make you move less. As a result, you may feel tightness, pain and weakness, especially in the muscles and joints. These symptoms, which are not a direct result of MS, are called ""secondary symptoms."" Why do people with multiple sclerosis (MS) have depression? is very common in people with multiple sclerosis (MS). In fact, symptoms of depression severe enough to require medical intervention affect up to half of all people with MS at some point during their illness. Depression may be the result of a difficult situation or stress. It is easy to understand how having MS, with its potential for progressing to permanent disability, can bring on depression. Depression might be actually caused by MS. MS may affect the insulating myelin that surrounds nerves which transmit signals affecting mood. Depression is also a side effect of some drugs used to treat MS, such as steroids or interferon. How does heat or humidity impact people with multiple sclerosis (MS)? Heat or high humidity can cause many people with to experience a temporary worsening of their symptoms. Doctors believe that this occurs because heat causes nerves (whose myelin covering has been removed by MS) to conduct electrical signals even less efficiently. For reasons that are not well understood, extremely cold temperatures and changes in temperature can also cause MS symptoms, usually , to flare. Reviewed by a Cleveland Clinic medical professional.

Patients may also have a symptom called Lhermitte’s phenomenon, in which they feel electrical tingling or shocks down their back, arms or legs when they bend their neck forwards. Sometimes people notice hesitancy when they try to urinate or may find that 'when they have to go, they have to go’. There is no way to predict which symptoms one person might develop. The usual course of MS is to have periods of time where things are relatively stable, followed by times when, over a few days or weeks, new symptoms occur or old symptoms worsen. This relatively rapid worsening is known as an exacerbation (also known as an attack, or a relapse). In others with MS, there may be a tendency to progress in that symptoms gradually worsen over time (months to years). MS varies from patient to patient so that each individual has their own set of symptoms, problems, and their own course. There are people who have MS so mildly that they never even know that they have it. Of course, there are also others that have it severely. It is really a spectrum that ranges from mild to severe. An international panel of experts developed a classification of MS in 1999 that most neurologists use today. : Patients have attacks of symptoms/signs, with or without recovery, but between attacks have no interval worsening. : This is often after a few years of relapsing-remitting MS. The pattern changes from a relapsing pattern to progressive in between attacks, usually with fewer attacks. : Gradual onset from the beginning, no attacks. : This is a rare form, and begins with a progressive course, while later developing attacks. : Very severe, rapidly progressive MS. This is a rare form of MS. Why do I have symptoms with multiple sclerosis (MS)? MS damages the myelin sheath surrounding the nerve cells of the brain and spinal cord. Scarring from this damage can block or slow nerve impulses in areas of the brain (neurological damage). As a direct result of MS, you may lack coordination and feel tired, and have weakness, involuntary movements, muscle stiffness (spasticity), or pain. Symptoms such as these are called ""primary symptoms."" Primary symptoms of MS can make you move less. As a result, you may feel tightness, pain and weakness, especially in the muscles and joints. These symptoms, which are not a direct result of MS, are called ""secondary symptoms."" Why do people with multiple sclerosis (MS) have depression? is very common in people with multiple sclerosis (MS). In fact, symptoms of depression severe enough to require medical intervention affect up to half of all people with MS at some point during their illness. Depression may be the result of a difficult situation or stress. It is easy to understand how having MS, with its potential for progressing to permanent disability, can bring on depression. Depression might be actually caused by MS. MS may affect the insulating myelin that surrounds nerves which transmit signals affecting mood. Depression is also a side effect of some drugs used to treat MS, such as steroids or interferon. How does heat or humidity impact people with multiple sclerosis (MS)? Heat or high humidity can cause many people with to experience a temporary worsening of their symptoms. Doctors believe that this occurs because heat causes nerves (whose myelin covering has been removed by MS) to conduct electrical signals even less efficiently. For reasons that are not well understood, extremely cold temperatures and changes in temperature can also cause MS symptoms, usually , to flare. Reviewed by a Cleveland Clinic medical professional.

There are several different types of MS, including relapsing-remitting, progressive and fulminant. The severity of your condition depends on the type of MS you have. Symptoms of MS can include numbness, difficulty walking, fatigue and weakness in one or more body part. Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a central nervous system disorder — that is, it affects the brain and spinal cord and spares the nerves and muscles that leave the spinal cord. MS is an inflammatory disorder in which infection-fighting white blood cells enter the nervous system and cause injury. It is a demyelinating disorder because the myelin sheath that protects nerves is stripped off during inflammation. When this happens, the nerves cannot conduct electricity as well as they should, causing various symptoms. Symptoms may be the type that come and go over time (relapsing-remitting MS) or progress over time (progressive MS). MS can happen to just about anyone and is long-term. Are there different types of multiple sclerosis (MS)? MS varies from patient to patient so that each individual has their own set of symptoms, problems, and their own course. There are people who have MS so mildly that they never even know that they have it. Of course, there are also others that have it severely. It is really a spectrum that ranges from mild to severe. An international panel of experts developed a classification of MS in 1999 that most neurologists use today: : Patients have attacks of symptoms/signs, with or without recovery, but between attacks have no interval worsening. : This is often after a few years of relapsing-remitting MS. The pattern changes from a relapsing pattern to progressive in between attacks, usually with fewer attacks. : This involves a gradual onset from the beginning and no attacks. : This is a rare form, and begins with a progressive course, while later developing attacks. : This is a rare form, and is very severe, rapidly progressive MS. Is there such a thing as benign multiple sclerosis (MS)? The term, ""benign MS,"" is not part of the international classification. It is used when people have had MS for many years without developing significant measurable disability. Recent studies have shown that it cannot be predicted early in the disease and so the term can only really be used retrospectively, after people have done very well with MS for many years. What are the risk factors of multiple sclerosis (MS)? There has been extensive research about MS over the past 50 years. While we still do not know the cause of MS, we know that it is an inflammatory disorder of the central nervous system that occurs in people with a tendency to such a problem. We know that about 350,000 people in the United States have MS, about one in a 1,000 people. We know that it is more common further north and south of the equator, though we are still unsure why this is. Females tend to get MS about three times as often as males, a rate which is similar to other immune diseases. It is more common in Caucasians, but can occur in other populations. It is not contagious nor is it infectious. There may be a link with reduced vitamin D levels and perhaps with decreased sun exposure. We know that there is a genetic component to MS. Having a mother or father with MS increases the risk of having MS to about 3 to 5% lifetime, and having an identical twin with MS increases the risk to about 30%. However, many people with MS have no close family members with the disease. There is nothing that an individual with MS either did to cause the disease to happen, or can avoid to stop the disease from following its natural course. We know that emotional stress may increase the symptoms of MS. We also know that attacks of MS are more likely after infections. There does not seem to be any association with physical trauma or surgical procedures and MS, nor do these seem to make MS worse. There has been widespread research about MS over the past 50 years. We do not know the cause of MS, but do know that it is an inflammatory disorder of the central nervous system that occurs in people with a tendency to such a problem. We know that about 350,000 people in the United States have MS, about 1 in 1,000 people. We know that it is more common further north and south of the equator. Although we are still unsure exactly why this is. Females tend to get MS about three times as often as males, a rate similar to other immune diseases. MS is more common in Caucasians, but can occur in other populations. It is not contagious, nor is it infectious. Did I do anything to bring on the multiple sclerosis (MS) or make it worse? As far as we know there are no activities that specifically cause MS or make it worse. People with MS may not tolerate heat as well as they used to and may need to avoid particularly hot or humid situations. There is evidence that having infections makes having an exacerbation of MS more likely. There does not appear to be a link to trauma. However, emotional stress has been linked to a worsening of MS symptoms. Having MS is not the fault of people who have it; it can happen to anyone. Is there anything new that we know about multiple sclerosis (MS)? Multiple sclerosis is being studied actively in many research institutions around the world, and new knowledge is being added constantly. For example, we now know that even with early MS, the nerve fibers themselves (the axons) are affected more than we knew before. We know from MRI studies that new lesions (abnormal areas in the brain or spinal cord) occur about 5 to10 times as often as people with MS have new symptoms; that is, much of the disease occurs 'under the radar scope'. We know that myelin repair occurs in the central nervous system all the time. Some groups feel there are different types of immune or pathological processes going on that we call MS, and perhaps MS may be many different disorders that we have lumped together. Do any other diseases look like multiple sclerosis (MS)? When neurologists evaluate MS they are also considering other diagnoses. While MS is the most likely cause of typical white matter changes and symptoms in an otherwise healthy young person, there are some other diseases that we consider and occasionally diagnose. These include a vitamin B12 deficiency that can cause an MS-like illness, and rarely, , which may have symptoms that suggest MS. The MRI is very useful in ruling out many other disorders that could be confused with MS, and the blood tests and spinal fluid may also be helpful in diagnosing other diseases. What are some early symptoms of multiple sclerosis (MS)? MS varies from person to person so there is no 'standard' set of symptoms for MS. However, we know that common symptoms of MS include: Numbness or tingling in various parts of the body. Lhermitte's phenomenon, a symptom in which people feel electrical tingling or shocks down their back, arms or legs when they bend their neck forwards. Urinary symptoms, such as hesitancy when trying to urinate, or a feeling of urgency (when you have to go, you have to go). There is no way to predict which symptoms one person might develop.

UPDATE: Pr Ocrelizumab Granted “Breakthrough Therapy Designation” for Primary-Progressive MS by FDA. UPDATE: Priority Review Granted by Dec. 28, 2016 UPDATE: FDA has granted Priority Review Designation, with a decision target of December 28, 2016.  Originally released February 17, 2016 Genentech, a member of the Roche Group, has announced that the experimental therapy ocrelizumab has been granted “Breakthrough Therapy designation” by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of people with primary-progressive MS. This designation means that once Genentech files for approval of ocrelizumab to treat primary-progressive MS, the review process can be expedited. According to a February 16 press release, Genentech plans to pursue marketing approval for both primary-progressive MS and relapsing multiple sclerosis.   “We are encouraged by this news and look forward to following the FDA’s actions regarding ocrelizumab,” says Timothy Coetzee, PhD, Chief Advocacy, Services and Research Officer at the National MS Society. “People with progressive MS need solutions and we are hopeful that this is the first of many treatments that will be developed for this form of MS.”   Breakthrough Therapy designation can expedite the development and review of therapies intended to treat a serious condition when clinical evidence indicates that the treatment may demonstrate substantial improvement over available therapy. The designation was granted to ocrelizumab based on phase III trial results presented at the European Committee for Treatment and Research in MS in 2015. Compared to placebo, ocrelizumab significantly reduced the risk of progression of clinical disability by 24% in 732 people with primary-progressive MS. about these results.   Ocrelizumab is a monoclonal antibody that binds to a molecule (CD20) on the surface of immune cells called B cells, and depletes them from circulation. B cells have several functions including making antibodies, and they may play a role in immune-system mediated damage to brain and spinal cord tissues in MS. Ocrelizumab is administered by intravenous infusion every 6 months. There currently are no FDA-approved disease-modifying therapies to treat , which is characterized by steady worsening of neurologic functioning, without any distinct relapses or attacks, or periods of remission.   Frequently Asked Questions Related to “Breakthrough Therapy” Designation of Ocrelizumab to Treat Primary-Progressive MS   The Food and Drug Administration has developed four approaches to making treatments available as rapidly as possible when treatments are the first available treatment or if the therapy has advantages over existing treatments. about these on the FDA website. designation can expedite the development and review of therapies intended to treat a serious condition when clinical evidence indicates that the treatment may demonstrate substantial improvement over available therapy. This designation makes the treatment eligible for all designations, intensive guidance on an efficient drug development program, and organizational commitment involving senior managers. It does make the treatment automatically eligible for priority review, which means FDA’s goal is to take action on an application within 6 months (compared to 10 months under standard review).   Q: Does this mean that ocrelizumab is approved to treat primary-progressive MS? No, this means that once Genentech files with the FDA for approval of ocrelizumab to treat primary-progressive MS, the review process can be expedited. According to a February 16 press release, Genentech plans to pursue marketing approval for both primary-progressive MS and relapsing multiple sclerosis, and will submit data from three phase III studies to the FDA in the first half of 2016.   Q: Will ocrelizumab be approved to treat secondary-progressive MS? At this point, Genentech plans to pursue marketing approval for both primary-progressive MS and relapsing multiple sclerosis. Relapsing MS includes people with secondary-progressive MS who are experiencing relapses. Ocrelizumab reduced relapse rates by 46% to 47% after two years compared to the established MS treatment, Rebif (interferon beta-1a, EMD Serono) in two phase III studies in people with relapsing MS. about these results. Ocrelizumab has not been studied so far in people with secondary-progressive MS who are not experiencing relapses. Breakthrough designation only applies to primary-progressive MS.   It is not possible to say if or when ocrelizumab may become available.  The company has stated plans for applying for regulatory approval of ocrelizumab in the first half of 2016.  Even with an expedited review, the timeline for successful marketing approval depends on many variables, such as whether the application is accepted by the FDA or whether the agency requests additional information before the application is deemed complete.  Then the FDA needs time to evaluate the results and make a decision about whether the therapy can be marketed.   Q: What role, if any, did the National MS Society play in the development of ocrelizumab? The Society did not play a specific role in the development of ocrelizumab. However, the Society has funded early studies that increased understanding of the role of B cells in the immune attack of MS, as well as an early clinical trial of rituximab, a therapy similar to ocrelizumab. The Society continues to fund researchers exploring the importance of B cells, in relapsing and progressive MS.

Multiple sclerosis, often called MS, is a disease that affects the —the brain and spinal cord. It can cause problems with muscle control and strength, vision, balance, feeling, and thinking. Your nerve cells have a protective covering called myelin. Without myelin, the brain and spinal cord can't communicate with the nerves in the rest of the body. MS gradually destroys myelin in patches throughout the brain and spinal cord, causing muscle weakness and other symptoms. These patches of damage are called lesions. MS is different for each person. You may go through life with only minor problems. Or you may become seriously disabled. Most people are somewhere in between. Generally, MS follows one of four courses: , where symptoms fade and then return off and on for many years. , which at first follows a relapsing-remitting course and then becomes progressive. ""Progressive"" means it steadily gets worse. , where the disease is progressive from the start. , where the symptoms are progressive at first and are relapsing later. The exact cause is unknown, but most experts believe that MS is an autoimmune disease. In this kind of disease, the body's defenses, called the , mistakenly attack normal tissues. In MS, the immune system attacks the central nervous system—the . Experts don't know why MS happens to some people but not others. There may be a link, because the disease seems to run in families. Where you grew up may also play a role. MS is more common in those who grew up in colder regions that are farther away from the equator. Symptoms depend on which parts of the brain and spinal cord are damaged and how bad the damage is. Early symptoms may include: You may feel weak and stiff, and your limbs may feel heavy. You may drag your leg when you walk. Your vision may be blurred or hazy. You may have eyeball pain (especially when you move your eyes), blindness, or double vision. You may feel tingling, a pins-and-needles sensation, or numbness. You may feel a band of tightness around your trunk or limbs. You may feel lightheaded or dizzy or feel like you're spinning. Diagnosing MS isn't always easy. The first symptoms may be vague. And many of the symptoms can be caused by problems other than MS. MS is not diagnosed unless a doctor can be sure that you have had at least two attacks affecting at least two different areas of your central nervous system. The doctor will examine you, ask you questions about your symptoms, and do some tests. An is often used to confirm the diagnosis, because the patches of damage (lesions) caused by MS attacks can be seen with this test. During a relapse, to make the attack shorter and less severe. Over a long period of time, to keep down the number of attacks and how severe they are and to slow the progression of the disease. (This is called disease-modifying therapy.) You may find it hard to decide when to start taking the drugs that slow the progression of MS. The drugs may not work for everyone, and they often have side effects. You and your doctor will decide together when you should start any of these drugs. There is no cure for MS. Treatment and self-care can help you maintain your quality of life. Physical therapy, occupational therapy, and speech therapy can help you manage some physical problems caused by MS. You can also help yourself at home by eating balanced meals, getting regular exercise and rest, and learning to use your energy wisely. Dealing with the physical and emotional demands of MS isn't easy. If you feel overwhelmed, talk to your doctor. You may be depressed, which can be treated. And finding a support group where you can talk to other people who have MS can be very helpful. Health Tools help you make wise health decisions or take action to improve your health. Decision Points focus on key medical care decisions that are important to many health problems. Multiple Sclerosis: Should I Start Taking Medicines for MS? The cause of multiple sclerosis (MS) is unknown. Because a person's risk of MS is slightly higher in some families when a relative has MS, there may be a . For more information, see . Some research suggests that where you lived as a child and you have had could be triggers for MS later in life. But these links have not been proved. The symptoms of multiple sclerosis (MS) vary from person to person depending on which parts of the brain or spinal cord (central nervous system) are damaged. The and scarring caused by MS can affect any part of the central nervous system. Myelin is the insulating coating around a nerve. Symptoms may come and go or become more or less severe from day to day or, in rare cases, from hour to hour. Symptoms may become worse with increased body temperature or after a viral infection. , such as weakness, leg dragging, stiffness, a tendency to drop things, a feeling of heaviness, clumsiness, or a lack of coordination (). , such as blurred, foggy, or hazy vision, eyeball pain (especially when you move your eyes), blindness, or double vision. Optic neuritis—sudden loss of vision that is often painful—is a fairly common first symptom. It occurs in up to 25 out of 100 people who have MS. , such as tingling, a pins-and-needles sensation, numbness, a band of tightness around the trunk or legs, or electrical sensations moving down the back and legs. As MS progresses, symptoms may become more severe and may include: Worse muscle problems, and stiff, mechanical movements () or uncontrollable shaking (). These problems may make walking difficult. A wheelchair may be needed some or all of the time. Bladder symptoms, such as an inability to hold urine () or to completely empty the bladder, or a loss of bladder sensation. (impotence) and . . These are common in people who have had MS for some time. Feeling very tired (fatigue). This can be worse if symptoms such as pain, spasticity, bladder problems, anxiety, or depression make it hard to sleep. In general, multiple sclerosis follows one of four courses: , where symptoms may fade and then recur at random for many years. The disease doesn't advance during the remissions. Most people who develop MS have a relapsing-remitting course. In 8 to 9 out of 10 people with this course of MS, the relapsing-remitting phase lasts about 20 years. , which at first follows a relapsing-remitting course. Later on, it becomes steadily progressive. , where the disease is progressive from the start. , where steady deterioration of nerve function begins when symptoms first appear. Symptoms appear and disappear, but nerve damage continues. Few people have this course of MS. MS is different for every person. You may go through life with only minor problems. Or you may become seriously disabled. Most people are somewhere in between. The duration of the disease varies. Most people who get MS live with it for decades. MS usually progresses with a series of that occur over many years (relapsing-remitting MS). In many people the first MS attack involves just a single symptom. It may be weeks, months, or years before you have a relapse. As time goes by, symptoms may linger after each relapse so you lose the ability to fully recover from the relapse. New symptoms often develop as the disease damages other areas of the . Events that can mean you may have a more severe type of MS include: Frequent relapses during the first few years of the disease. Early, lasting motor problems that affect movement. Many lesions that show up on an early in the disease. Some people have a few mild attacks from which they recover entirely. This is called benign MS. Although rare, a small number of people die within several years of the onset of MS. This is called malignant or fulminant MS. Because MS may affect your ability to move and walk, it can place limits on your daily living, particularly as you age. If you or someone in your family has MS, talk to your doctor about . Knowing what to expect will help you plan for the future. Reduced ability to move and walk. This makes it necessary to use a wheelchair some or all of the time. Your risk for multiple sclerosis (MS) increases with: Geographic location, or where you lived during childhood (up to age 15). People who spend the first 15 years of their lives in colder climates that are farther away from the equator tend to be more likely to get MS than people who lived closer to the equator during those years. Family history of MS. About 15 out of 100 people who have MS have a relative with MS, most often a brother or sister. Certain genetic characteristics associated with the . These appear more frequently in people who have MS. This may mean that there are one or more that may increase the chance of getting MS. Race. People of Western European ancestry are more likely to get MS. Being female. MS is about 3 times as common in women as in men. Some of the symptoms of multiple sclerosis (MS) are similar to those of many other illnesses. See your doctor if over a period of time you have more than one symptom, such as: Blurry, foggy, or hazy vision, eyeball pain, loss of vision, or double vision. A feeling of heaviness or weakness, involuntary leg dragging, stiffness, walking problems, and clumsiness. Tingling or a pins-and-needles sensation; numbness; tightness in a band around the trunk, arms, or legs; or electric shock sensations moving down the back, arms, or legs. Inability to hold urine or to completely empty the bladder. Problems with memory, attention span, finding the right words for what you mean, and daily problem-solving. If you have been diagnosed with MS, see your doctor if: You begin having a symptom that you have not had before or you notice a significant change in symptoms that are already present. Milder MS-type symptoms can be caused by many other conditions or may occur now and then in healthy people. For example, lots of people have minor numbness in their fingers or a mild dizzy spell once in a while. Stiffness and muscle weakness can result from being more active than usual. A wait-and-see approach () is appropriate for these types of everyday aches and pains, so long as they do not continue. If your symptoms occur more often or don't go away, talk to your doctor. Talk to your doctor about what to expect from the disease and from treatment. MS is an unpredictable disease, but you probably can get some idea of what is ""normal"" and what symptoms or problems are reasons for concern. Some people who have MS want active, regular support from their doctors. Others want to manage their condition on their own as much as possible. Wherever you are in this range, find out which signs or symptoms mean that you need to see your doctor. And seek help when you need it. Health professionals who may be involved in evaluating symptoms of MS and treating the condition include: or . Consult your doctor when symptoms first start. He or she will refer you to a neurologist if needed. If you have MS, your family doctor or internist can treat your general health problems even if you see a neurologist for MS treatment. . A neurologist can decide whether your symptoms are caused by MS. He or she can also help you decide what may be the best treatment for your condition. Many university medical centers and large hospitals have MS clinics or centers staffed by neurologists and other health professionals who specialize in diagnosing and treating MS. They may be able to provide the most thorough evaluation. If you have been diagnosed with MS, at some point you may need to seek the help of: A , to assist with exercise to maintain body strength and flexibility and deal with movement problems. An , to identify ways of accomplishing daily activities if MS has caused any physical limitations. A , to improve speech, chewing, and breathing if MS has affected the muscles of the face and throat. A , to help with managing pain, maintaining strength, and adapting to physical disability. A or , to evaluate and treat , or other mood disorders, and problems with memory and concentration if these develop. A , to help with any significant chronic pain that MS may cause. A pain specialist, often as part of a pain clinic, can help find ways of reducing pain when possible and dealing with pain that doesn't go away. A , to do surgery for severe or . Diagnosing multiple sclerosis (MS) isn't always easy and in some cases may take time. Your medical history and can identify possible nervous system problems and are often enough to strongly suggest a diagnosis of MS. Tests may help confirm or rule out the diagnosis when your history and exam do not provide clear evidence of the disease. MRI and neurological exam may help doctors predict which people will develop MS after a first attack of symptoms. of the brain and spinal cord. This test is done to . (sometimes called a spinal tap). This test may be done to evaluate . Most people with MS have abnormal results on this test. . This test can often reveal abnormalities in the and in the that other tests may not detect. MS is diagnosed when it is clear from neurological tests and a neurological exam that lesions (damaged areas) are present in more than one area of the (usually the brain, spinal cord, or the nerves to the eyes). Tests will also clearly show that damage has occurred at more than one point in time. Some people have had only one episode of a neurological symptom such as optic neuritis, but MRI tests suggest they may have MS. This is known as a clinically isolated syndrome. Many of these people go on to develop MS over time. Urinary tract tests may be needed to help diagnose a problem with bladder control in a person who has MS. may be needed to identify thinking or emotional problems, which may be present without the person being aware of them. Typically, these tests are in a question-and-answer format. A blood test for JC virus antibodies may be done. This test can help you and your doctor understand your risk for getting a rare but serious brain infection called PML (progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy). Treatment can make living with multiple sclerosis (MS) easier. Your type of treatment will depend on how severe your symptoms are and whether your disease is active or in remission. You may get medicines, physical therapy, and other treatment at home. Medicines are used to treat relapses, control the course of the disease (disease-modifying drugs or DMDs), or treat symptoms. The National Multiple Sclerosis Society recommends that people with a definite diagnosis of MS and who have active, relapsing disease start treatment with medicines. This group also recommends treatment with medicine after the first attack in some people who are at a high risk for MS. If you decide not to try medicines at this time, meet with your doctor regularly to check whether the disease is progressing. Multiple Sclerosis: Should I Start Taking Medicines for MS? You and your doctor will set up a schedule of periodic appointments to monitor and treat your symptoms and follow the progress of your MS. Monitoring your condition helps your doctor find out if you may need to try a different treatment. , occupational therapy, and nonmedical treatment done at home may also help you manage symptoms and adjust to living and working situations. To learn more, see . In rare cases, MS is life-threatening. If your condition gets considerably worse, you may want to make a living will, which allows your wishes to be carried out if you are not able to make decisions for yourself. For more information, see the topic . In general, there is no way to prevent multiple sclerosis (MS) or its attacks. For people with , , and , treatment with medicine may reduce the frequency of relapses and delay disability. If you have multiple sclerosis (MS), it is important to find ways of coping with the practical and emotional demands of the disease. These are different for everyone, so home treatment varies from person to person. Home treatment may involve making it easier to get around your home, dealing with , handling specific symptoms, and getting support from your family and friends. to keep it safe and easy to get around. For example, to help prevent falls, install grab bars in the bathroom and don't use throw rugs.

At some time, most people with MS have bladder problems. Your doctor may prescribe a medicine to help you. Avoid getting overheated. Increased body temperature can temporarily make your symptoms worse. Use an air conditioner, keep your home somewhat cool, and avoid hot swimming pools and hot tubs. During warm or hot weather, exercise in an air-conditioned area rather than outdoors. Eat plenty of fruits, vegetables, grains, cereals, legumes, poultry, fish, lean meats, and low-fat dairy products. A balanced diet for a person who has MS is the same as that recommended for most healthy adults. Change how and what you eat if you are having problems swallowing. Thicker drinks make swallowing easier. Try milk shakes or juices in gelatin form. Avoid foods such as crackers or cakes that crumble easily. These can cause choking. Soft foods need less chewing. Use a blender to prepare food for easiest chewing. Eat frequent, small meals to avoid fatigue from eating heavy meals. Ask your doctor about and occupational therapy to help you manage at work and home. Make all efforts to preserve your health. Proper diet, rest, wise use of energy, and practical and emotional support from your family, friends, and doctor can all be very helpful.

Medicines for multiple sclerosis (MS) may be used: During a , to make the attack shorter and less severe. Over a long period of time, to alter the natural course of the disease (disease-modifying drugs or DMDs). These medicines can shorten a sudden relapse and help you feel better sooner. They have been shown to affect the long-term course of the disease or to prevent disability. Strong evidence suggests that MS is caused by the causing and attacking nerve cells and myelin, which is the protective coating surrounding the nerve fibers. Medicines that change the way the immune system works can reduce the number and severity of attacks that damage the nerves and myelin. For people who have , disease-modifying therapy can reduce the number and severity of relapses. It may also delay disability in some people. Some of these medicines may also delay disease progression and reduce relapses in some people who have or . The most commonly used disease-modifying therapies are: Interferon beta (such as Betaseron), for clinically isolated syndrome (first MS attack), relapsing-remitting MS, and secondary progressive MS. Glatiramer (Copaxone), for clinically isolated syndrome and relapsing-remitting MS. Other disease-modifying medicines may also be used for MS. Your doctor will prescribe a medicine depending on the type of MS you have, your symptoms, and how your body responds. They include: Some people have only one episode of a neurological symptom such as . Yet or other tests suggest that these people have MS. This is known as a clinically isolated syndrome. Many of these people go on to develop MS over time. In most cases, doctors will prescribe medicine for people who have had a clinically isolated syndrome. These medicines, when taken early or even before you have been diagnosed with MS, may keep the disease from getting worse or extend your time without disease. Treating specific symptoms can be effective, even if it doesn't stop the progression of the disease. Symptoms that can often be controlled or relieved with medicine include: Medicines can also help with sexual problems, emotional problems, and walking problems. Sildenafil (Viagra) can help with sexual problems in both men and women. Clomipramine may also be given to improve . Dextromethorphan and quinidine (Nuedexta) is a medicine that can be used for uncontrollable outbursts of crying or laughing at strange or inappropriate times. Dalfampridine (Ampyra) is a medicine that can be used to help with walking problems. Medicine may be used only some of the time or regularly, depending on how severe or constant a certain symptom is. Changes in diet, schedule, exercise, and other habits can also help manage some of these symptoms. See . Cannabinoids are substances found in marijuana. Similar drugs can be created in a lab. Some forms of natural and man-made cannabinoids may help with symptoms such as pain and spasticity. They are not available in all areas. Talk to your doctor if you are considering cannabinoids. A variety of other medicines and biological chemicals have been tried or are being studied as therapy for MS. None of them have been clearly proved as beneficial, and none have been approved for treatment of MS. Several medicines are being tested in clinical trials. People with MS who have not responded to standard therapy sometimes choose to take part in these trials. To learn more about clinical trials, talk to your doctor or contact the National Multiple Sclerosis Society at www.nationalmssociety.org. The National Multiple Sclerosis Society recommends that people with a definite diagnosis of MS and active, relapsing disease start treatment with interferon beta or glatiramer. Most neurologists support this recommendation and now agree that permanent damage to the nervous system may occur early on, even while symptoms are still quite mild. Early treatment may help prevent or delay some of this damage. In general, treatment is recommended until it no longer provides a clear benefit. The National MS Society also says that treatment with medicine may be considered after the first attack in some people who are at a high risk for MS (before MS is definitely diagnosed). Despite the recommendation, some people find it hard to decide whether to begin disease-modifying therapy, especially when their symptoms have been fairly mild. Some may not want to bear the risks and side effects of medicine when they are not sure they need it. Some may want to see whether their disease gets worse before they start therapy. A small percentage of people diagnosed with MS may never have more than a few mild episodes and may never develop any disability, but the disease is unpredictable. Multiple Sclerosis: Should I Start Taking Medicines for MS? The need and desire for medicine vary. If your symptoms are mild, you may choose to manage them without any medicine. If you have specific symptoms that are causing problems, certain medicines may help you keep them under control. Or you may want to use medicine only during a relapse. The possible side effects of using steroids or other medicines to treat symptoms or control a relapse. Some people have only minor side effects. But others may have side effects that concern them more than their MS symptoms. The costs of treating symptoms and controlling relapses. In some cases, using medicine to control symptoms and relapses may reduce the need for hospital stays. Other personal issues that you face at work or at home. Also keep in mind that it can be hard to tell if medicine is helping. Multiple sclerosis is a disease with spontaneous remissions. This means that your condition can improve on its own, without any treatment. Just because your symptoms improve after treatment doesn't mean that a treatment is working. People with multiple sclerosis (MS) who have severe (shakiness) affecting movement may be helped by surgery. People with severe (muscle stiffness) may be helped by insertion of a spinal pump to deliver medicines when oral medicines fail. for tremor. This treatment is only considered after other options have failed. Severe and disabling tremor that occurs with the slightest movement of the limbs may be helped by an implanted device that stimulates an area of the brain. A does the surgery to implant the device. Implantation of a drug catheter or pump, for spasticity. This treatment is only considered after other options have failed. People who have severe pain or spasticity may benefit from having a catheter or pump placed in the lower spinal area to deliver a constant flow of medicine, such as baclofen. The unpredictability and variety of symptoms caused by multiple sclerosis (MS) make it a disease that people have tried to treat in many different ways. Many have been proposed as treatments for MS. None of these treatments have been shown to modify the course of the disease. Some of those most commonly used are: Diets and vitamin, mineral, herbal, or dietary supplements. (often used by ). Although clinical research has not shown all of these complementary therapies to be effective, a person with MS may benefit from safe nontraditional therapies along with conventional medical treatment. Some complementary therapies may help relieve stress, depression, fatigue, and muscle tension. And some may improve your overall well-being and quality of life. Talk to your doctor if you are interested in trying any of these complementary therapies or to MS treatment. Clinical research also has been unable to show that treatments such as ""liberation"" angioplasty for chronic cerebrospinal venous insufficiency (CCSVI), bee venom therapy, Prokarin (a caffeine and histamine combination), removal of mercury fillings (dental amalgams), and have any benefits for people who have MS. Some of these therapies may be harmful as well as expensive and are not recommended by most experts. Experimental treatments for MS involve reducing the activity of the . This may be done with medicines and biological chemicals or through methods such as total lymphoid irradiation, in which the entire lymph node system is exposed to radiation. While these methods have been used with success in the treatment of certain other medical conditions, they have failed to produce significant benefits when tested in controlled clinical trials. They remain experimental treatments for MS. , which uses immature cells from the bone marrow, has been studied. Early results suggest that stem cell transplant may delay disability, especially in people with relapsing-remitting MS. Stem cell transplant may be an option for people who have very aggressive or malignant forms of MS. It remains unproved and isn't recommended for treating relapsing-remitting MS. There is no cure for MS. So far, the only treatments proved to affect the course of the disease are approved disease-modifying therapies. Other types of treatment should replace these medicines if you are a candidate for treatment with them. Some people who have MS report that complementary therapies have worked for them. This may be in part because of the . Some complementary therapies don't treat the disease itself, but they may affect a person's sense of well-being and help the person feel better and healthier. If you are thinking about trying a complementary treatment, get the facts first. Discuss these questions with your doctor: Talk with your doctor about the safety and potential side effects of the treatment. This is especially important if you are on drug therapy for MS. Some complementary treatments in combination with drug therapy can be quite dangerous. A treatment that could be harmful to you and may or may not improve your symptoms isn't worth the risk. Because MS symptoms can come and go, you may find it hard to judge whether a particular treatment is really working. Keep in mind that if you get better after using a certain treatment, the treatment isn't always the reason for the improvement. MS may often improve on its own (spontaneous remission). An expensive, unproven treatment that may or may not help you may not be worth its cost. Beware of therapy providers or products that require a large financial investment at the beginning of a series of treatments. Even if they aren't effective in treating MS, some complementary practices (such as acupuncture, massage, or yoga) may be safe. And they may lead to healthy habits that improve your overall well-being. These might be worth trying. With a hard-to-treat disease like MS, it can be tempting to jump at the promise of an effective treatment. Be cautious about trying unproven treatments.

5eb2be07-cabc-407c-a9de-6ab7f7488611,"Medically reviewed by — — Understanding the typical progression of multiple sclerosis (MS) and learning what to expect can help you gain a sense of control and make better decisions. MS occurs when the body’s immune system abnormally targets the central nervous system (CNS), though it’s not considered to be an autoimmune disorder. The attack on the CNS damages the myelin and the nerve fibers that the myelin protects. The damage disrupts or distorts the nerve impulses being sent down the spinal cord. People with MS generally follow one of four disease courses that vary in severity. The first stage to consider occurs before your doctor has made a diagnosis of MS. In this initial stage, you may have symptoms that you’re concerned about. Genetic and environmental factors are thought to play a role in who gets MS. Perhaps MS runs in your family, and you’re worried about your likelihood of developing the disease. Maybe you’ve previously experienced symptoms that your doctor has told you might be indicative of MS. At this stage, your doctor can determine whether you’re at high risk for developing the condition based on your medical history and a physical exam. However, there is no definitive test to confirm the presence of MS and many of the symptoms also occur with other conditions, so the disease can be tough to diagnose. The next step on the continuum is receiving a diagnosis of MS. Your doctor will diagnose you with MS if there is clear evidence that, at two different points in time, you have had separate episodes of disease activity in your CNS. Often it can take time to make this diagnosis because other conditions must first be ruled out. These include CNS infections, CNS inflammatory disorders, and genetic disorders. In the new diagnosis stage, you will likely discuss treatment options with your doctor and learn new ways to manage everyday activities with your condition. There are different types and stages of MS. Learn more below about the different types. This is the first episode of symptoms caused by inflammation and damage to the myelin covering on nerves in the brain or spinal cord. Technically, CIS doesn’t meet the criteria for a diagnosis of MS as it’s an isolated incident with only one area of demyelination responsible for symptoms. If an MRI shows another episode in the past, a diagnosis of MS can be made. The type of MS generally follows a predictable pattern with periods in which symptoms worsen and then improve. Eventually it may progress to . According to the , around 85 percent of people with MS are initially diagnosed with relapsing-remitting MS. People with RRMS have flare-ups (relapses) of MS. Between the relapses, they have periods of remission. Over a few decades, the course of the disease is likely to change and become more complex. Relapsing-remitting MS can progress into a more aggressive form of the disease. The reports that, if left untreated, half of those with the relapsing-remitting form of the condition develop secondary-progressive MS within a decade of the first diagnosis. In secondary-progressive MS, you may still experience relapses. These are then followed by partial recoveries or periods of remission, but the disease doesn’t disappear between cycles. Instead, it steadily worsens. Approximately 15 percent of people are diagnosed with a relatively uncommon form of the disease, called primary-progressive MS. This form is characterized by slow and steady disease progression with no remission periods. Some people with primary-progressive MS experience occasional plateaus in their symptoms as well as minor improvements in function that tend to be temporary. There are variations in the progression rate over time. In addition to adults, children and adolescents can be diagnosed with MS. The reports that between 2 and 5 percent of all MS patients noticed symptoms that started before they were 18 years old. Pediatric MS follows a similar course of progression as the adult form of the disease with similar symptoms as well. However, some children experience additional symptoms, such as and . Also, the disease course may progress more slowly for younger people than it does for adults. There are a variety of treatment options available to a person diagnosed with MS. Your doctor and medical team can help you find the best combination of treatments to manage your symptoms and improve your quality of life. Prescription treatments and medical interventions include: Any time you’re making a change to your treatment plan, consult your doctor first. Even natural remedies can interfere with medications or treatments you’re currently taking. When you’re aware of what to look for in each stage of MS, you can take better control of your life and seek appropriate treatments. Researchers continue to make strides in their understanding of the disease. Improved therapeutic advances, new technologies, and FDA-approved medications are having an impact on the underlying course of MS. Using your knowledge and working closely with your doctor can make MS easier to manage throughout the course of the disease. Are there any ways to slow the progression of MS? If so, what are they? Besides a healthy diet and exercise with stretching, make sure you are taking in enough Vitamin D since MS patients have been found to be deficient. And as always, taking MS medications regularly has been shown to slow the disease progress and prevent relapse. Answers represent the opinions of our medical experts.

7a97fac5-5052-4c50-87d8-a9d1aa7689ab,"Is there any proof that vitamin D supplements can prevent MS or keep symptoms of MS from worsening? Answer From Iris Marin Collazo, M.D. Research over the years has shown that maintaining adequate levels of vitamin D may have a protective effect and lower the risk of developing multiple sclerosis (MS). A number of studies have shown that people who get more sun exposure and vitamin D in their diet have a lower risk of MS. Therefore, vitamin D supplementation is considered an important modifiable environmental risk factor for development of multiple sclerosis. Some studies suggest that for people who already have MS, vitamin D may offer some benefits. These benefits include lessening the frequency and severity of their symptoms, improving quality of life, and lengthening the time it takes to progress from relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis to the secondary-progressive phase. But the evidence isn't conclusive. Vitamin D supplementation in people with MS appears to be safe but at high doses can lead to changes in calcium levels. More research is needed to determine whether it's truly beneficial. Experts also need to better understand how vitamin D might affect MS. When a person has MS, his or her immune system attacks the coating that protects the nerve cells (myelin). Research suggests that a connection between vitamin D and MS could be tied to the positive effects vitamin D has on the immune system. The connection between vitamin D and MS is strengthened by the association between sunlight and the risk of MS. The farther away from the equator a person lives, the higher the risk of MS. Sunlight is the body's most efficient source for vitamin D — suggesting that exposure to sunlight may offer protection from MS. The Institute of Medicine recommends 600 international units (IUs) of vitamin D a day for adults up to age 70. The recommendation increases to 800 IUs a day for adults age 71 and older. The recommendation for women who are pregnant or breast-feeding is 600 IUs per day. However, the Institute of Medicine recommends avoiding taking more than 4,000 IUs a day. Research studies have indicated that taking 400 IUs or more of vitamin D per day significantly decreases the risk of MS in women. If you are diagnosed with vitamin D deficiency, it may be appropriate to use up to 50,000 IUs weekly for up to three months until your vitamin D levels become normal, and then switch to a maintenance dose. The maintenance dose varies, but is usually between 2,000 and 5,000 IU daily. Very large doses of vitamin D over an extended period can result in toxicity. Signs and symptoms include nausea, vomiting, constipation, poor appetite, weakness and weight loss. In addition, vitamin D toxicity can lead to elevated levels of calcium in your blood, which can result in kidney stones. If you're considering vitamin D to reduce your risk of or help manage multiple sclerosis, talk with your doctor about what's both safe and helpful for you. Raghuwanshi A, et al.

5d869bae-4313-4640-8ccd-20edb1945575,"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a neurodegenerative disorder that damages the nerves in the brain and spinal cord, leading to problems with muscle movement, balance and vision. Myelin is a substance composed mainly of lipids that forms a protective coating around the long axonal fibres of the nerves. The axon conducts neural messages in the form of electrical impulses that travel from one end of the nerve cell to the other. The myelin sheath is formed from the oligodendrocyte. Oligodendrocytes are the most abundant cell in the central nervous system and the processes of just one oligodendrocyte can insulate up to 50 axons. The myelin sheaths along an axon are interspersed by gaps called the nodes of Ranvier. As the electrical impulse travels along an excited axon fibre, the electric impulse cannot flow through the resistant myelin sheath and travels straight along the axon to reach the next node of Ranvier. This ensures a linear flow of the impulse along the nerve. MS is an autoimmune disease. The body’s immune system mistakes the myelin sheath for a foreign body and mounts an immune response against it, stripping it away from the nerve fibres. This leads to disruption of the nerve signal along the nerve fibre, which may be slowed or not transmitted at all, and causes the symptoms associated with demyelination. Eventually, the nerves themselves become damaged, leading to progressive worsening of neurological symptoms. Study sheds light on myelin's role in 'chemobrain' and multiple sclerosis Vision problems such as blurred vision, double vision or paralysis of eye muscles Muscle stiffness and lack of balance and co-ordination. There is loss of dexterity and fine movement. Around 80% of all individuals with MS have the relapsing remitting form of the disease. These individuals have periods where their symptoms are mild or absent (remission), followed by periods of symptom relapse. The relapsing and remitting form of MS (RRMS) eventually progresses to secondary progressive MS, where there is a worsening of symptoms and fewer or no periods of remission. About half of individuals with RRMS go on to develop this secondary progressive MS. The least common form of MS is primary progressive MS which occurs in about 10% to 15% of all MS cases. In this form of the condition, symptoms get worse over time rather than occurring in bouts or as sudden attacks. At present there are no cures for this condition and treatment is aimed at delaying disease progression and relieving symptoms. MS can be treated with several disease-modifying drugs that can slow disease progression and also reduce the length and severity of relapses. Some examples of medications include beta interferon, copolymer 1, and immunosuppressants such as mitoxantrone and natalizumab. www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Multiple-Sclerosis/Pages/Introduction.aspx www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/tutorials/multiplesclerosis/nr229105.pdf http://www.nice.org.uk/nicemedia/live/10930/46699/46699.pdf http://www.who.int/mental_health/neurology/Atlas_MS_WEB.pdf Last Updated: Feb 27, 2019 Dr. Ananya Mandal is a doctor by profession, lecturer by vocation and a medical writer by passion.

You can develop MS at any age, but most people receive diagnoses between the . There are relapsing, remitting, and progressive types of MS, but the course is rarely predictable. Researchers still don’t fully understand the cause of MS or why the rate of progression is so difficult to determine. The good news is that many people living with MS don’t develop severe disabilities. Most have a normal or near-normal lifespan. There’s no national or global registry for new MS cases. Known figures are only estimates. Recent findings from a National MS Society study estimate nearly in the United States are living with MS. This is more than double the last reported number, and the first national research on MS prevalence since 1975. The society also estimates that 2.3 million people live with MS globally. About are diagnosed each week in the United States, says the MS Discovery Forum. Rates of MS are higher . It’s estimated that in (below the 37th parallel), the rate of MS is between 57 and 78 cases per 100,000 people. The rate is twice as high in northern states (above the 37th parallel), at about 110 to 140 cases per 100,000. The incidence of MS is also higher in colder climates. People of Northern European descent have the highest risk of developing MS, no matter where they live. Meanwhile, the lowest risk appears to be among Native Americans, Africans, and Asians. A 2013 study found only of all diagnosed MS cases are in children. Far more women have MS. In fact, the National MS Society estimates MS is more common in women than men. MS is , but researchers believe there may be a genetic predisposition to developing the disease. About of people with MS have one or more family members or relatives who also have MS, notes the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke. In the case of identical twins, there’s a 1 in 3 chance for each sibling to have the disease. Researchers and neurologists still can’t say with certainty what causes MS. The ultimate cause of MS is damage to myelin, nerve fibers, and neurons in the brain and spinal cord. Together these make up the central nervous system. Researchers speculate that a combination of genetic and environmental factors is at play, but it’s not fully understood how. The relationship of the immune system and the brain, however, could be considered a culprit. Researchers suggest the immune system could mistake normal brain cells for foreign ones. One thing the MS community knows for certain is that the disease is . CISis considered to be of MS, but it may or may not progress to MS.To get a diagnosis of MS: A person has to experience a neurologic episode (typically lasting 24 hours or more) that resulted in damage to the central nervous system. People who are at high risk of developing MS are found to have MRI-detected brain lesions. There’s a chance of receiving an MS diagnosis within a few years, estimates the National MS Society. Meanwhile, people at low riskdon’t have MRI-detected brain lesions. They have a 20 percent chance of receiving an MS diagnosis in the same amount of time. RRMS is characterized by clearly defined relapses of increased disease activity and worsening symptoms. These are followed by remissions when the disease doesn’t progress. Symptoms may improve or disappear during remission. Approximately of people receive a diagnosis of RRMS at first, says the National MS Society. SPMS follows an initial RRMS diagnosis. It sees disability gradually increase as the disease progresses, with or without evidence of relapse or changes in an MRI scan. Occasional relapses may occur, as will periods of stability. Untreated, about of people with RRMS transition to SPMS within a decade of the initial diagnosis, estimates a 2017 study. About 90 percent of people transition within 25 years. PPMS is diagnosed in about of people with MS, estimates the National MS Society. People with PPMS experience a steady progression of the disease with no clear relapses or remissions. The rate of PPMS is equally divided between men and women. Symptoms usually begin between the ages of 35 and 39. A high percentage of MS cases don’t progress. These may fit into a subgroup with a “very stable benign” form of the disease, per a presented in 2017. Researchers say it’s possible for people to remain in the RRMS phase for 30 years. At the other end of the spectrum, a 2015 study found about of people with MS develop a more aggressive course of the disease. It’s known as highly active relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (HARRMS). Symptoms vary a great deal from one person to another. No two people have the same combination of symptoms. This, of course, complicates identification and diagnosis. In a , one-fifth of European women surveyed received misdiagnoses before eventually receiving an MS diagnosis. The average woman was found to go through about five visits with a healthcare provider over the course of six months before reaching a diagnosis. According to the , symptoms can impact the mind, body, and senses in a number of ways. These include: There’s no single “MS test.” To receive a diagnosis, your doctor needs to collect your medical history and perform a neurological examination and a series of other tests. Tests may include: Since the exact cause of MS is still unknown, there’s no known prevention. There’s also no cure for MS yet, but treatments can manage symptoms. MS medications are designed to lessen the frequency of relapses and slow the progression of the disease. There several approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to treat MS. They include: These medications aren’t approved for use during pregnancy. It’s also unclear if MS medications are excreted through breast milk. Talk to your doctor about your MS medications if you’re considering becoming pregnant. People with MS can safely carry a baby to term. Pregnancy doesn’t generally affect MS in the long term. MS has been found to affect decisions about pregnancy, though. In a , 36 percent of women participants decided not to have children at all or postponed the timing of getting pregnant due to their MS. While people with MS often experience during pregnancy, about have a relapse within six months of giving birth. MS is an expensive disease to treat. A found the total lifetime costs per person with MS to be $4.1 million. The average yearly healthcare costs range from $30,000 to $100,000 based on the mildness or severity of the disease.

The following are some of the key differences between RRMS and PPMS: RRMS is diagnosed earlier. Most people are diagnosed with RRMS in their 20s and 30s.PPMS is diagnosed later. Most people are diagnosed with PPMS in their 40s and 50s. People with RRMS tend to have more brain lesions with more inflammatory cells.Those with PPMS tend to have more spinal cord lesions and fewer inflammatory cells. RRMS affects women two to three times more often than men. People with RRMS will likely have mobility issues, but these issues are more gradual.People with PPMS often experience more mobility issues and have more trouble walking. In general, PPMS tends to affect the body’s ability to function more than RRMS does. For example, those with PPMS may also find it more difficult to continue working because of their mobility issues and declining neurologic function. As far as symptoms go, RRMS and PPMS are oftentimes very different from each other. People with RRMS enter periods of flare-ups and remission, while those with PPMS are in a continual phase of deterioration.

3a72eb78-7495-48bc-83dd-863fb337f8f8,"Complementary & Alternative Medicines Find Programs & Services in Your Area COVID-19 Vaccine Guidance for People Living with MS     PPMS is characterized by worsening neurologic function (accumulation of disability) from the onset of symptoms, without early relapses or remissions. PPMS can be further characterized as either (with an occasional relapse and/or evidence of new MRI activity over a specified period of time) or , as well as  (evidence of disability accrual over time, with or without relapse or new MRI activity) or . This graphic shows the kinds of disease activity that can occur in PPMS; however each person's experience with PPMS will be unique. PPMS can have brief periods when the disease is stable, with or without a relapse or new MRI activity, as well as periods when increasing disability occurs with or without new relapses or lesions on MRI. Disease activity and progression can be evaluated by neurologic examination and MRI. Monitoring your disease course at different points in time helps you and your MS care provider have important conversations about your treatment options and prognosis. For example: If you have PPMS that is active, with new MRI activity or relapses, your conversation with your MS care provider could be about starting treatment with a disease-modifying therapy to reduce the risk of a relapse, as well as rehabilitation to help improve function and mobility. If you have PPMS that is stable without activity (no new MRI activity or relapses) or progression, the conversation with your MS care provider could include the role of rehabilitation to help you maintain function, as well as other symptom management strategies that you may need. If you have PPMS that is not active (no new MRI activity or relapses) but is progressing with increasing accumulation of disability, the conversation with your MS provider could focus on the rehabilitation strategies that can help you maintain function and keep you safe and independently mobile. How does PPMS differ from the other disease courses? Although there is a lot of variability among people with PPMS, we know that as a group, they differ in several ways from people with relapsing forms of MS: Relapsing forms of MS (including relapsing-remitting MS, and secondary progressive in those individuals who continue to experience relapses) are defined by inflammatory attacks on myelin. PPMS involves much less inflammation of the type seen in relapsing MS. As a result, people with PPMS tend to have fewer brain lesions (also called plaques) than people with relapsing MS and the lesions tend to contain fewer inflammatory cells. People with PPMS also tend to have more lesions in the spinal cord than in the brain. Together, these differences make PPMS more difficult to diagnose and treat than relapsing forms of MS. In the relapsing forms, women are affected two to three times as often as men; in PPMS, the numbers of women and men are approximately equal. The average age of onset is approximately 10 years later in PPMS than in relapsing MS. People with PPMS tend to experience more problems with walking and more difficulty . In general, people with PPMS may also require more assistance with their everyday activities. The National MS Society is pursuing all promising research paths and collaborating worldwide to drive progress in research in progressive MS, for which few therapies exist.

This is the first therapy specifically approved to treat primary progressive MS. Potential safety issues identified by the FDA include infusion reactions and infections. There may be an increased risk of malignancy in people taking Ocrevus. More information about Ocrevus is available from Genentech:  1-844-OCREVUS (9am-8pm Eastern) Additional details and Frequently Asked Questions below DETAILS The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved Ocrevus™ (ocrelizumab - Genentech, a member of the Roche Group) for use in the treatment of and , making it the first therapy for the treatment of primary progressive multiple sclerosis. Ocrevus will be available as a first-line treatment, which means that there are no recommendations in the approved labeling for people to try other MS therapies before taking it. Ocrevus has not been tested in children.    “As the first therapy specifically approved to treat primary progressive MS, this represents a significant milestone,” said Kathy Costello, MS, ANP-BC, MSCN, Associate Vice President of Healthcare Access at the National MS Society.   “We are grateful that there is finally a disease-modifying treatment for people with primary progressive MS, and also an important new option for people with relapsing MS,” said Bruce Bebo, PhD, Executive Vice President, Research, at the National MS Society. “We hope this is just the first of many new treatments approved for people with progressive MS.”   Ocrevus is a monoclonal antibody that binds to a molecule (CD20) on the surface of immune cells called B cells, and reduces the numbers of certain B cells that are circulating in the blood. B cells have several functions including making antibodies, and they are believed to play a role in immune-system-mediated damage to brain and spinal cord tissues in MS. Ocrelizumab is administered by intravenous infusion every 6 months. The first dose is given in two infusions, two weeks apart. Subsequent doses are given as a single infusion.   The ORATORIO study involving people with primary progressive MS, which compared Ocrevus to inactive placebo, met its primary endpoint, showing treatment with Ocrevus significantly reduced the risk of progression of clinical disability by 24% compared with placebo in 732 people. Compared to placebo, Ocrevus also reduced the time required to walk 25 feet by 29%, and decreased the volume of brain lesions.   In the OPERA I and OPERA II studies involving people with relapsing MS, which compared ocrelizumab to interferon beta-1a (Rebif,® EMD Serono and Pfizer), Ocrevus significantly reduced the annualized relapse rate by up to 47% compared with Rebif over two years in a total of 1,656 people with relapsing MS. In addition, Ocrevus significantly delayed confirmed progression of disability on the EDSS scale by 40% compared with Rebif. Ocrevus also significantly reduced active inflammation observed on MRI scans by up to 95%, and total damage on MRI scans by up to 83% compared with Rebif.  (.pdf) for Ocrevus includes several warnings and precautions. Ocrevus can cause a wide variety of infusion-related reactions, the most frequent being itchy skin, rash, irritation in the throat, flushed face or fever, headache or other symptoms. In rare cases, these can be life-threatening. Infusion reactions occur most frequently with the first infusion, and they can occur up to 24 hours after the infusion. As a precaution, people are administered a steroid and antihistamine before their infusion and monitored at least one hour after infusion. Ocrevus increases the risk of infection, including respiratory tract infections and herpes infections. Ocrevus administration should be delayed in people with an active infection, and vaccination with live or live-attenuated vaccines is not recommended during treatment and not until B cells have been repopulated following treatment. There may be an increased risk of malignancy (cancers), including breast cancer, in people taking Ocrevus. Individuals using Ocrevus should follow standard breast cancer screening guidelines.The clinical trial results and ongoing monitoring of trial participants indicate an imbalance in the number of cancers that occurred in individuals treated with Ocrevus compared to those who were on interferon in the relapsing remitting trial and those on placebo in the primary progressive trial.The numbers are too small to know for sure if this is related directly to Ocrevus. This imbalance will require continued careful observation, evaluation, and data in larger numbers of individuals. PML: Although no cases of PML (progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy), a serious brain infection, occurred in clinical trials, PML has been observed in people taking related medications for other conditions. Typical symptoms are diverse, progress over days to weeks and include progressive weakness on one side of the body or clumsiness, vision disturbances, and changes in thinking, memory, orientation and personality. Hepatitis B Virus Reactivation: Although no cases of hepatitis B virus reactivation have been reported in people taking Ocrevus, they have occurred in people taking similar medications. Before initiating treatment with Ocrevus, individuals should have a blood test to detect hepatitis B virus.  For more information, people with MS can contact Genentech at: 1-844-OCREVUS (9am-8pm Eastern)   For people who qualify, Genentech plans to offer patient assistance programs through Genentech Access Solutions: (866) 4ACCESS/(866) 422-2377 or http://www.Genentech-Access.com.   The approval of Ocrevus is an exciting milestone for people with primary progressive MS and an encouraging new option for people with relapsing forms of the disease. The National MS Society applauds Genentech for their leadership in setting the wholesale acquisition cost (or list price) of Ocrevus at $65,000 per year -- nearly 20 percent below the current market average for an MS treatment. The continually escalating prices of MS disease-modifying therapies are creating barriers to people with MS getting these life-changing medications. Through its action on Ocrevus, Genentech is changing industry dynamics so that more people can access the life-changing treatments they need to live their best lives. We encourage other companies to follow suit, creating a drug pricing trend that keeps patients first.    - - -Read the FDA ""Snapshot"" describing the clinical trials of Ocrevus -Read details of the clinical trials of Ocrevus in two papers published in the December 21, 2016 issue of the New England Journal of Medicine: “Ocrelizumab versus Placebo in Primary Progressive Multiple Sclerosis” (Dr. Xavier Montalban and others) “Ocrelizumab versus Interferon Beta-1a in Relapsing Multiple Sclerosis” (Dr. Stephen Hauser and others)   Ocrevus is a trademark of Genentech, a member of the Roche Group. Rebif is a registered trademark of Merck KGaA and EMD Serono, Inc. FAQ About FDA Approval of Ocrelizumab – brand name Ocrevus™ – for Primary Progressive and Relapsing Forms of MS A. Ocrevus™ (ocrelizumab - Genentech, a member of the Roche Group) is a monoclonal antibody that binds to a molecule (CD20) on the surface of immune cells called B cells, and reduces the numbers of certain B cells that are circulating in the blood. B cells have several functions including making antibodies, and they are believed to play a role in immune-system-mediated damage to brain and spinal cord tissues in MS.   A. The FDA has approved ocrelizumab for the treatment of adults with  and with .   Q. Will everyone who has primary progressive MS benefit from Ocrevus? A. We don’t know, since like all clinical trials, the Ocrevus trial in primary progressive MS limited the characteristics of people who could participate. The trial only included people who were aged 18 to 55, who had an EDSS (Expanded Disability Status Scale – a scale to assess neurological functioning used in clinical trials) score of up to 6.5 (meaning they were able to walk with the help of a walker or bilateral crutches or other devices on both sides), and who had evidence of immune proteins in a test of their spinal fluid (“oligoclonal bands”). It is not possible to predict how a specific individual will respond to treatment. The use of Ocrevus in clinical practice will help determine who is likely to benefit.   Q. Will Ocrevus help people with secondary progressive MS who are no longer experiencing relapses? A. We don’t know. So far, the clinical trials of Ocrevus have involved people with relapsing forms of MS and primary progressive MS. Results were announced as positive for the trials in these populations. There is no data yet on whether Ocrevus may be effective in those people with secondary progressive MS who are no longer experiencing relapses.   A. Ocrevus is administered by intravenous (into a vein) infusion every 6 months. At the beginning of treatment there are two doses separated by 14 days. After that, there is a single infusion every 6 months.   Q. When will ocrelizumab be available by prescription? A. According to Genentech, people may talk to their MS doctors now about taking Ocrevus. The company expects supplies of the therapy to be available in about two weeks (around the week of April 4, 2017). Accessing the medication also depends on issues related to an individual’s health insurance.   Q. How effective is Ocrevus in primary progressive MS? A. The ORATORIO study involving people with primary progressive MS, which compared Ocrevus to inactive placebo, met its primary endpoint, showing treatment with Ocrevus significantly reduced the risk of progression of clinical disability by 24% compared with placebo in 732 people. Compared to placebo, Ocrevus also reduced the time required to walk 25 feet by 29%, and decreased the volume of brain lesions.   A. In the OPERA I and OPERA II studies involving people with relapsing MS, which compared ocrelizumab to interferon beta-1a (Rebif,® EMD Serono and Pfizer), Ocrevus significantly reduced the relapse rate by up to 47% compared with Rebif over two years in a total of 1,656 people with relapsing MS. In addition, Ocrevus significantly delayed confirmed progression of disability on the EDSS scale by 40% compared with Rebif. Ocrevus also significantly reduced active inflammation observed on MRI scans by up to 95%, and total damage on MRI scans by up to 83% compared with Rebif. Q. Should individuals who have relapsing MS switch from their current therapy to Ocrevus? A. The decision about whether to take Ocrevus should be made in collaboration with your MS doctor, taking into account a variety of factors including the effectiveness of any therapy you are currently using, the potential risks and benefits, as well as costs and lifestyle factors. Important questions to be considered and discussed with your doctor in terms of Ocrevus include: What is my tolerance for the risk of known side effects? What is my tolerance for the risk of adverse consequences that might emerge with longer-term use? How will my medication choice affect my ability or plans to become pregnant?  Q. If I have been taking another disease-modifying therapy for MS, how long will I have to wait before starting the Ocrevus? A.  There is no wash-out or waiting time currently established or recommended for switching from another therapy to Ocrevus. Therefore a decision to wait or proceed needs to be made in collaboration with your MS doctor.   Q. What are the potential side effects of Ocrevus? A.  (.pdf) for Ocrevus includes several warnings and precautions. Ocrevus can cause a wide variety of infusion-related reactions, the most frequent being itchy skin, rash, irritation in the throat, flushed face or fever, headache or other symptoms. In rare cases, these can be life-threatening. Infusion reactions occur most frequently with the first infusion, and they can occur up to 24 hours after the infusion. As a precaution, people are administered a steroid and antihistamine before their infusion and monitored at least one hour after infusion. Ocrevus increases the risk of infection, including respiratory tract infections and herpes infections. Ocrevus administration should be delayed in people with an active infection. Vaccinations need to be administered at least 6 week prior to starting Ocrevus and vaccination with live or live-attenuated vaccines is not recommended during treatment and not until B cells have been repopulated following treatment. PML: Although no cases of PML (progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy), a serious brain infection, occurred in clinical trials, PML has been observed in people taking related medications. Typical symptoms are diverse, progress over days to weeks and include progressive weakness on one side of the body or clumsiness, vision disturbances, and changes in thinking, memory, orientation and personality. Hepatitis B Virus Reactivation: Although no cases of hepatitis B virus reactivation have been reported in people taking Ocrevus, they have occurred in people taking similar medications. Before initiating treatment with Ocrevus, individuals should be given a blood test to detect hepatitis B virus.  Although there is long-term safety data available on other medications that work in a similar fashion (those medications that deplete B cells), the long-term safety of Ocrevus is unknown at this time.   A. There may be an increased risk of malignancy (cancers), including breast cancer, in people taking Ocrevus. Individuals using Ocrevus should follow standard breast cancer screening guidelines. The clinical trial results and ongoing monitoring of trial participants indicate an imbalance in the number of cancers that occurred in individuals treated with Ocrevus compared to those who were on interferon in the relapsing remitting trial and those on placebo in the primary progressive trial. The numbers are too small to know for sure if this is related directly to Ocrevus. This imbalance will require continued careful observation, evaluation, and data in larger numbers of individuals.   Q. Has Ocrevus been proven to be more effective than other disease-modifying therapies? A. Ocrevus has only been compared to Rebif® (interferon beta-1a, EMD Serono and Pfizer). In two phase III studies in a total of 1,656 people with relapsing MS (people with relapsing-remitting MS and those with secondary-progressive MS who were experiencing relapses), Ocrevus significantly reduced relapse rates after two years compared to Rebif. Ocrevus has not been compared in clinical trials to other disease-modifying therapies.   A. There is no specified time limit for taking Ocrevus. Like with other disease modifying medications, Ocrevus would likely be continued if the person’s MS is stable, and is experiencing no adverse events or new safety issues that could be ascribed to the medication.   Q. Will people taking Ocrevus have to get any special medical tests or monitoring? A. Your doctor will need to run a blood test prior to starting this medication to test for hepatitis B infection. For individuals with relapsing MS, some MS doctors might like to have a new “baseline” MRI prior to starting a new medication. This will be at the discretion of your doctor. Individuals using Ocrevus should follow standard breast cancer screening guidelines.   Q. Will Ocrevus help my mobility, prevent me from getting worse or reverse my progressive disability? A. Based on results from the clinical trials, Ocrevus is not likely to significantly reverse an individual’s disability, but may help stabilize it. In the ORATORIO trial for primary progressive MS, treatment with Ocrevus significantly reduced the risk of progression of clinical disability. This reduced risk of progression means that people taking Ocrevus in the trial were 24% less likely to demonstrate worsening of disability than people taking placebo. Ocrevus also reduced the time required to walk 25 feet, and decreased the volume of brain lesions. This means that as a group, people taking Ocrevus in the trial had a lower risk of progression, improved in their 25-ft walk speed and had reduced volume of brain lesions. However, it is not possible to predict how any one individual will respond to this or any other therapy.   Q. Will Ocrevus reduce disease activity in relapsing MS? A. As a group, people taking ocrelizumab in the trial had fewer relapses, fewer new or enlarging lesions on MRI and less risk of disability worsening than people who were taking Rebif (interferon beta-1a). However, it is not possible to predict how any one individual will respond to this or any other therapy.   Q. Can I continue to take supplements while on Ocrevus, such as Biotin, vitamin D, vitamin B12, etc.? A. Yes. However, it is essential that your MS doctor knows all of the prescription and over-the-counter medications, supplements and vitamins you are taking. Q. What about vaccinations and Ocrevus? Can I have a flu shot, the pneumonia shot, and the vaccine for shingles? A. Individuals should wait 6 weeks after being vaccinated before beginning therapy with Ocrevus. Any vaccination with live or live-attenuated viruses is not recommended during treatment with Ocrevus, and not until B cells have been repopulated following treatment. Individuals should speak to their doctors about whether the shot they are considering is available in an inactivated form.   Q. How often should I have an MRI while on Ocrevus? A. Your MS doctor will guide you on how often an MRI is needed. The 2015 Revised Recommendations of the Consortium of MS Centers’ Task Force for a Standardized MRI Protocol and Clinical Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Follow-Up of Multiple Sclerosis suggest a brain MRI approximately 6 months after switching to a new treatment and then routine brain MRI every 6 months to 2 years for all of those with relapsing MS. Currently there are no recommendations regarding the frequency of MRI in primary progressive MS.   Q. Will my immune system be suppressed or compromised if I take Ocrevus? Will I be more likely to “catch” ordinary infections if I take this medication? A. Ocrevus increases the risk of infection, including respiratory tract infections and herpes infections.   Q. Can I continue my other medications while I am on Ocrevus, such as Ampyra,® baclofen, and bladder medications? A. You can continue to take all of your MS symptom management medications. However, it is essential that your MS doctor knows all of the prescription and over-the-counter medications, supplements and vitamins you are taking.   Q. Will I need to have a spinal tap before starting Ocrevus? A. No.   Q. What if I no longer live in my own home. Can I still get Ocrevus if I live at an assisted living facility or a nursing home? A. Whether you live at home or in a facility should not affect your ability to be on Ocrevus. However, insurance coverage may impact access to the medication.   Q. What are the differences between relapsing-remitting MS, secondary progressive MS and primary progressive MS? A. Relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) is characterized by clearly defined attacks of new or increasing neurologic symptoms. These attacks – also called relapses or exacerbations – are followed by periods of partial or complete recovery (remissions). Secondary progressive MS (SPMS) follows an initial relapsing-remitting course. Many people who are diagnosed with RRMS will eventually transition to an SPMS course in which there is progressive worsening of neurologic function (accumulation of disability) over time. Primary progressive MS (PPMS) is characterized by worsening neurologic function (accumulation of disability) from the onset of symptoms, without early relapses or remissions. “Relapsing forms” of MS is a phrase that includes RRMS as well as progressive MS in those individuals who continue to experience relapses.   Q. Is Ocrevus more likely to help me if my disability from primary progressive MS is mild versus severe? A. It is not known who will benefit most from the use of Ocrevus. The study involving people with primary progressive MS only included individuals between the ages of 18 and 55, who had scores on the EDSS disability scale between 2.0 (minimal disability) to 6.5 (able to walk with the help of a walker or bilateral crutches or other devices on both sides). It is not possible to predict how a specific individual will respond to treatment.   Q. Is it better to take it earlier than later for treating progressive MS? A. In the ORATORIO trial for primary progressive MS, the average time from diagnosis in participants was 3.3 years. It is not known how the medication will work in people who have had primary progressive MS for longer periods of time.   Q. Is it better to take Ocrevus earlier than later for treating relapsing MS? A. In general, early and consistent treatment with a disease-modifying therapy is recommended. () However, it is not yet specifically known whether it is better to use Ocrevus earlier or later, and it is not known whether it is better to use Ocrevus before or after other disease-modifying therapies.   Q. Is there a point at which Ocrevus does not work? A. There is no known point in time when this or any MS therapy may stop working effectively. Each individual will respond differently to any given therapy, and response to treatment must be assessed regularly by your MS doctor.   A. The list price has been announced as $65,000 per year. However, the price of Ocrevus to an individual who has MS will depend on the provisions of his or her insurance coverage and the degree to which that individual will be eligible for programs designed to assist with out-of-pocket costs.   Q. What is the National MS Society’s response to the posted price of Ocrevus? A. The approval of Ocrevus is an exciting milestone for people with primary progressive MS and an encouraging new option for people with relapsing forms of the disease. The National MS Society applauds Genentech for their leadership in setting the wholesale acquisition cost (or list price) of Ocrevus at $65,000 per year — nearly 20 percent below the current market average for an MS treatment. The continually escalating prices of MS disease-modifying therapies are creating barriers to people with MS getting these life-changing medications. Through its action on Ocrevus, Genentech is changing industry dynamics so that more people can access the life-changing treatments they need to live their best lives. We encourage other companies to follow suit, creating a drug pricing trend that keeps patients first.    A. Coverage will depend on individual insurance plans. For people who qualify, Genentech plans to offer patient assistance programs through Genentech Access Solutions: (866) 4ACCESS/(866) 422-2377 or http://www.Genentech-Access.com.   Q. Where can I get information about the support that Genentech will provide to help people gain access to Ocrevus? A. Physicians and people with MS can contact Genentech for information about access at Genentech Access Solutions: (866) 4ACCESS/(866) 422-2377 or http://www.Genentech-Access.com.   Q. Is Ocrevus the same as rituximab, which is a therapy used to treat some cancers? A. No, and Ocrevus is not a derivative of rituximab. Both rituximab and Ocrevus work by depleting B cells. However, the two medications are not the same. Based on published reports, Ocrevus is manufactured differently than rituximab. Ocrevus is mostly human, and rituximab is equal parts mouse and human. These monoclonal antibodies bind to specific, but overlapping, areas of a molecule on immune B cells (called CD20 cells). There are also differences in the ways that rituximab and Ocrevus induce the death of CD20 B cells. Whether these differences are meaningful in terms of potential effectiveness in MS, or in terms of safety, is difficult to say at this time.    Q. Are there other therapies in development for progressive MS? A. Yes. The Society is closely watching clinical trials that could lead to treatments for people with progressive forms of MS. For example, positive results were recently announced from a trial of BAF-312 (Siponimod) in secondary progressive MS.  In addition, other studies include: The MS-SMART trial is testing three therapies that may have nerve-protecting properties in secondary progressive MS (with the MS Society of the U.K.). The SPRINT-MS trial of Ibudilast, an oral anti-inflammatory agent, is ongoing in people with secondary progressive and primary progressive MS thanks to a unique collaboration between NIH's NeuroNEXT Network, MediciNova, and the National MS Society. The MS-STAT2 study getting underway at University College London is a multicenter trial testing whether a repurposed cholesterol-lowering therapy can slow the course of secondary progressive MS; the Society is providing funding.The Society is also very interested in wellness research to identify exercise, dietary and other approaches that will help people who have MS live their best lives. The Society supports several clinical trials that are investigating dietary interventions for symptom management and for their potential to modify the disease process.  Q: Based on these trial results, is there still a need to invest in additional research on progressive MS? A:  Yes. We need to continue our investment in research to find solutions for progressive MS.  This trial is the first success after many disappointments. We welcome this development, but we must remain focused on finding more and better solutions for treating all forms of progressive MS. We will do this by our continued leadership in the International  and by funding research on progressive MS through our own research programs, and by encouraging other companies to commit to developing treatments for progressive forms of MS.   Multiple sclerosis is an unpredictable, often disabling . range from numbness and tingling to blindness and paralysis, and there is currently no cure for MS. The progress, severity and specific symptoms of MS in any one person cannot yet be predicted, but advances in and are leading to better understanding and moving us closer to .

Multiple sclerosis (MS) literally means “many scars,” which refers to the lesions that accumulate in the brain and spinal cord throughout the course of the disease. These scars, or lesions, consist mostly of dead nerve cells, whose axons have been denuded of the myelin sheaths that normally protect them and permit the conduction of nerve impulses. MS is a chronic, degenerative disease that usually begins in young adulthood and most visibly destroys muscular control, although many other brain functions are affected. Most people will live with MS for decades after their diagnosis. MS reduces life expectancy after onset (as measured by current diagnostic criteria) by only about 10-15 years, and about half of the patients survive 30 years or more from onset. THE CLINICAL PICTURE: SYMPTOMS, DISEASE COURSE, VARIATION, AND DIAGNOSIS MS, as defined by ongoing central nervous system (CNS) lesion formation and increasing cumulative damage, is now recognized as a disease that is active in most patients most of the time. Disease activity has reversible and irreversible sequelae; irreversible sequelae ultimately lead to progressive impairment and disability in most patients. MS takes a variety of forms, distinguished by the clinical pattern of disease activity (, ). Accumulated deficit can produce sustained worsening in both relapsing and progressive MS.

Varieties of MS Autopsy studies indicate there are individuals without any known clinical history who have neuropathologic changes typical of MS. It is difficult to get an accurate estimate of subclinical disease, but one recent review suggested asymptomatic MS might account for up to 25% of all cases. This is the major MS subtype. Approximately 85% of patients with a diagnosis of MS start out with relapsing MS. Overall, this subtype accounts for 55% of MS. Relapsing MS patients show a high rate of inflammatory lesion activity (gadolinium-enhancing lesions). This category represents a subset of relapsing patients who have few attacks and make an excellent recovery. They show minimal impairment and disability, even after 20-30 years. The proportion of MS patients with benign disease is controversial. Reasonable studies suggest 10-20% of people with MS fit into this category. This subtype accounts for 10% of MS. Patients show gradual worsening from onset, without disease attacks. These patients tend to be older and often present with a spinal cord dysfunction without obvious brain involvement. This subtype is the least likely to show inflammatory lesion activity on MRI (gadolinium-enhancing). Unlike the other subtypes of MS, men are as likely as women to develop primary progressive MS. This subtype accounts for 5% of MS. Patients show slow worsening from onset, with superimposed attacks. Recent studies suggest these patients are similar to primary progressive patients. This is the major progressive subtype and accounts for approximately 30% of MS. Relapsing MS patients usually transition to secondary progressive disease. They show gradual worsening, with or without superimposed relapses. Natural history studies of untreated relapsing MS indicate 50% of patients will be secondary progressive at 10 years and almost 90% by 25 years. This form of MS shows a lower rate of inflammatory lesion activity than relapsing MS, yet the total burden of disease continues to increase. This most likely reflects ongoing axonal loss. Also referred to as Marburg variant MS, this is the most severe form of MS. Significant disability develops much more rapidly than usual, over weeks to months. Pathologic changes are widespread and destructive. These cases are rare and generally occur in young people. This refers to patients who present with an isolated CNS syndrome (optic neuritis, incomplete transverse myelitis, brainstem or cerebellar lesion), which is often the first MS attack. Clinical, MRI, and CSF studies indicate that such patients with normal brain MRI and CSF have a low risk of developing MS. In contrast, those with abnormal MRI have a high risk of developing MS. NOTE: CSF = cerebrosinal fluid; MRI = magnetic resonance imaging ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001. Multiple Sclerosis: Current Status and Strategies for the Future.

SOURCE: Adapted from Lublin and Reingold, 1996. lapsing MS, worsening occurs in most patients during acute attacks with incomplete recovery. In progressive MS, the dominant pattern is a gradual accumulation of neurologic deficits, with slow clinical worsening. Disease activity and progression have both clinical and subclinical components. Clinical disease activity and progression are judged by observation and neurologic examination. Subclinical components refer to pathological changes that are not observable in a clinical examination but are observed using a variety of laboratory tests, predominantly neuroimaging parameters. Relapses are variously referred to as acute attacks, exacerbations, or disease flare-ups. They involve the acute, or sudden onset, of focal neurologi- ""2 Clinical and Biological Features.""

Examples of typical MS relapses include blurring of vision in one eye (optic neuritis), persistent numbness or tingling of a body part (sensory system relapse), weakness of a body part (motor system relapse), or loss of coordination (cerebellar system relapse). Early in the MS disease process, relapses are likely to involve sensory, motor, cerebellar, or visual system abnormalities ( , ). Later in the disease process, relapses are likely to involve bladder, bowel, cognitive, and sexual function abnormalities. Acute disease attacks are a characteristic feature of the relapsing-remitting MS subtype. Relapses also occur in patients with progressive relapsing disease and in a number of patients with secondary progressive disease. The only clinical disease subtype in which relapses never occur is primary progressive MS. Areas of the CNS often affected by MS. Reprinted with permission from University of Delaware. Sensory problems (numbness or tingling of a body part) ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001. Multiple Sclerosis: Current Status and Strategies for the Future. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. Relapses generally consist of three phases. There is a period of worsening, with onset of new deficits or increasing severity of old deficits. This is followed by a period of stability, with no change in deficits. The final phase is the period of recovery, with variable degrees of improvement in deficits. Most patients recover within six weeks, although for some, improvements can continue over months. Recovery can be complete return to baseline status, partial return, or no improvement. However, some degree of improvement is typical, particularly early in the disease. Relapsing patients then remain clinically stable until the next disease attack. To be considered a relapse, deficits must persist for a minimum of 24 hours. This avoids confusion with deficits lasting only minutes to hours, which are believed to be a consequence of impaired nerve conduction through old lesion areas rather than the formation of a new lesion. Alternatively, new abnormalities that last seconds to minutes, such as Lhermitte's sign (a tingling sensation radiating down the arms, neck, or back on neck flexion), or paroxysmal attacks (stereotypic neurologic deficits occurring multiple times a day that last less than a minute) are also considered relapses if they occur repeatedly over several weeks. Sequential relapses are considered distinct only when they occur at least 30 days apart with a month of clinical stability in between. Although clinical relapses always produce changes in a patient's condition, they are not always associated with changes on neurologic examination. Maximal deficit in an MS relapse typically develops over several days but in some cases can develop much faster, over hours or even minutes, or much more slowly, over a period as long as several weeks. Physiologic factors such as temperature, pH, or electrolyte balance can temporarily disrupt nerve conduction and produce neurologic abnormality. A relapse must be distinguished from a which is a neurologic deterioration associated with a physiologic change such as infection or fever. This condition can last for days, mimicking a true relapse. Pseudoexacerbation deficits disappear once the precipitating factor has been corrected. They reflect a temporary disruption in nerve conduction, rather than the formation of a new lesion. Approximately 85 percent of MS patients begin with relapsing-remitting disease. MS relapses can involve a single neural system, as in optic neuritis, or several anatomically distinct systems at the same time, for example, combined motor and sensory problems. Attacks involving single neural systems are somewhat more common in the first MS relapse. Most patients experience their second attack within two to three years of the first, but 5 percent of patients remain free of relapses for 15 years or more. In most cases, there is substantial recovery from the first relapse; only 4 percent of patients show no improvement. The average relapse rate is one to two attacks a year, but this rate normally declines over time. The longer a person has MS, the less likely it is that relapses will be followed by complete recovery and the more likely it is that relapses will be associated with residual deficits and increasing disability. ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001. Multiple Sclerosis: Current Status and Strategies for the Future. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. Relapse features have prognostic significance (). In the first few years after disease onset, the number and type of relapses, as well as the degree of recovery, help predict future disease course. Relapses that involve visual, sensory, or brainstem systems have a better prognosis than those that involve cerebellar, motor, or sphincter systems. In the first two years of disease, a low relapse rate with excellent recovery indicates a better prognosis than a high relapse rate with poor recovery. Relapses restricted to single neural systems are prognostically better than those involving multiple systems. The relapse rate also has prognostic significance in the later stages of MS. With a disease duration of five or more years, an increasing relapse rate, polyregional relapses that involved multiple systems, and incomplete recovery from relapses indicate a worse prognosis. The relapsing form of MS is characterized by acute disease exacerbations. In contrast, progressive MS is characterized by slow deterioration and increasing neurological deficits. There are three forms of progressive MS. Approximately 15 percent of MS patients show slow deterioration from onset. In the second form, 10 percent have either primary progressive MS and never experience acute disease attacks or progressive relapsing MS (5 percent), and have occasional subsequent attacks. The third form, secondary progressive MS, is the major progressive subtype. These are relapsing patients who begin to slowly worsen 5 to 15 years after the first relapse. Once relapsing patients enter a progressive phase, they either stop having relapses or continue to experience exacerbations superimposed on slow worsening. Documentation of a progressive course requires at least six months of observation. Observation over a year or two is often necessary to be confident of progression, since deficits can accumulate at a very gradual rate. The major defining feature of progressive MS is slow deterioration that occurs independently of acute disease relapses and does not reflect residual deficits from acute disease attacks. An analysis of the disease course among 1,844 patients indicated that the presence or absence of relapses during the progressive phase does not significantly affect the progression of irreversible disability (4 percent of ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001. Multiple Sclerosis: Current Status and Strategies for the Future. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. patients in this study had been treated for up to one year with beta-interferon, but this did not affect the study results). Progressive MS patients can be clinically stable for up to several years at a time and can even show slight improvement for a period of time. Ultimately, however, all progressive MS patients develop disability with limited ability to walk. Progressive MS is a more severe form than benign or relapsing-remitting MS and has a worse prognosis. Clinical parameters such as relapses and progression underestimate the actual damage to tissue that occurs in MS. When macroscopically normal-appearing brain tissue is looked at under the microscope, one can detect inflammation, gliosis (scarring), and myelin damage. Chemical studies of normal-appearing brain tissue often reveal changes in organelles such as lysosomes, in enzymes, and in myelin constituents. In addition, a number of the new research neuro-imaging techniques can detect changes in brain and spinal cord areas that appear free of lesions on conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Some of these abnormalities are detectable several months to years before they can be seen with conventional MRI. Changes in normal-appearing brain tissue are generally pronounced in MS patients with severe impairment. As a group, secondary progressive MS patients show more abnormalities in normal white matter and brain tissue than relapsing patients. (White matter corresponds to brain regions where axons are ensheathed in myelin; gray matter corresponds to brain regions that are rich in cell bodies.) Primary progressive patients often show subtle but diffuse changes in normal-appearing brain areas. Even conventional MRI indicates that most new lesion formation is clinically silent, meaning that clinical exam does not reveal any corresponding symptoms. Approximately 80 to 90 percent of new brain lesions do not produce identifiable relapses. They might, however, be associated with subtle cognitive changes or other neuropsychological changes that are not detected in clinical examination. The total lesion burden increases in MS patients, on average, 5 to 10 percent per year, reflecting in large part the development of clinically silent lesions. (This does not apply to patients on the disease-modifying therapies discussed later in this section.) Atrophy of both brain and spinal cord can be detected even in patients with minimal symptoms. Atrophy can progress without obvious lesion formation, most likely reflecting loss of axons. MS patients show an accelerated rate of age-related brain and spinal cord atrophy that is three- to tenfold higher than the rate in control populations. Spinal cord lesions are generally similar to those in the brain except for the absence of “black holes” (see discussion in of T1-weighted lesions). Spinal MS lesions rarely cover more than half of the cross-sectional area of the cord or exceed two vertebral segments in length. They are found more often in the cervical spinal cord (neck region) than thoracic region (midback) and are most ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001.

MRI involves application of a magnetic field to the body that causes nuclei with odd numbers of protons, such as hydrogen nuclei, to behave like tiny magnets. These protons align themselves either parallel or antiparallel to the applied external magnetic field. The net magnetization induces an electric current that forms the basic MR signal. An MR image is formed by determining the spatial distribution of the signal and reconstructing the data into detailed images. The signals are picked up by a very sensitive antenna and forwarded to a computer for processing. Two time constants, T1 and T2 relaxation times, are important in determining the appearance of MR images. T1, or the longitudinal relaxation time, is the time constant when 63 percent of the original longitudinal magnetization is regained as the nuclei return to alignment with the external magnetic field. T2 or the transverse relaxation time, is the time constant when the transverse magnetization decreases to 37 percent of its original value as the nuclei lose alignment with each other following the initial application of an external magnetic field (a radio-frequency pulse). By altering the imaging parameters and pulse sequences used, differences between tissues with intrinsically different proton densities and T1 and T2 relaxation times can be highlighted or obscured. Image contrast can be either T1 weighted or T2 weighted in order to emphasize the differences between normal and pathological tissues. For example, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is dark on T1-weighted images and bright on T2-weighted images. White matter is bright on T1-weighted images, whereas a matter is dark but not as dark as CSF. common in the midcervical region. Disease activity is much less frequent in the spine than in the brain. In summary, the clinical manifestations of MS possibly represent only the “tip of the iceberg,” with most of the CNS damage occurring much earlier and being detectable only when the accumulated damage overwhelms the ability of the CNS to compensate. The mechanisms through which CNS tissue is damaged or destroyed are discussed in greater detail later in the chapter. At the present time, neuroimaging provides the best assessment of disease activity in MS (, ). A number of neuroimaging techniques can measure distinct pathologic changes and thereby provide markers for different aspects of the MS disease ""2 Clinical and Biological Features.""

Magnetic resonance imaging is a technique that creates cross-sectional images of the brain using a magnetic field and radio waves (). It is a versatile, powerful, and sensitive tool for measuring abnormalities in the brain. This is especially valuable with MS, because so much of the pathological activity of the disease is neurologically asymptomatic. Indeed, until neuroimaging results proved otherwise, the disease appeared to be quiescent during remissions. Neuroimaging has revealed a previously unsuspected level of activity and pathology throughout the course of disease. Contrast agents are used in MRI in cases where contrast between two tissues is poor. The contrasting agent, gadolinium, is normally excluded from the brain by the blood-brain barrier.

Gadolinium-enhancing activity on MRI correlates with clinical relapses and predicts increased risk or further disease activity. However, since most new brain MRI lesions are clinically silent, gadolinium-enhanced lesions are seen more often than clinical relapses. In T2-weighted images, MS lesions appear as very bright white areas against a gray or more neutral background and are the most readily visualized MS lesions by MRI. They reflect lesions with different pathology and of various ages, and reversible as well as irreversible abnormalities. T2-weighted hyperintense lesions can be used to measure the total lesion volume (burden-of-disease). The variable pathology, which is not distinguished in T2 burden-of-disease measures, is probably a determinant of associated disability. Only a modest relationship has been observed between T2 burden of disease and clinical disability in relapsing and secondary progressive MS. However, in patients with clinically isolated syndromes who are in the early stages of MS, T2 burden-of-disease has been correlated with the development of MS, as well as the clinical subtype of MS and disability 10 years later. The magnitude of T2 burden-of-disease changes very early in the disease process and may be valuable for predicting subsequent course. Atrophy of both brain and spinal cord can be detected in MS patients, including relapsing patients with minimal neurologic deficits. Both axon and myelin loss contribute to tissue atrophy. Recent studies suggest that CNS atrophy may be the best neuroimaging correlate for clinical disability (reviewed in 1999 by Trapp et al.). A number of different methodologies are used to measure atrophy. Current advances involve measurement of the whole brain and improved automation, but the optimal technique has not been decided. Axonal injury can be measured on proton MR spectroscopy by estimating -acetyl aspartate (NAA) levels in brain tissue. NAA is a molecule that is virtually confined to axons and neurons. Levels of NAA can fluctuate, suggesting that they can be used to measure reversible as well as irreversible damage. Persistent reduction of NAA on MR Spectroscopy correlates with axon loss, damage, or dysfunction. Reduced NAA is found not only within MS lesions but also in the normal-appearing white matter of relapsing-remitting, secondary progressive, and primary progressive MS patients. The reduction in NAA is more severe in secondary progressive MS than in relapsing MS. In addition, NAA decrease in cerebellar white matter has been correlated with clinical ataxia. NAA can be measured in a discrete region of interest within the brain. Recently, whole-brain NAA has been measured in MS. This appears to be a more meaningful neuroimaging marker to evaluate axon damage. MR spectroscopy can also be used to measure lipid changes within both lesions and normal- ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001. Multiple Sclerosis: Current Status and Strategies for the Future. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. appearing brain tissue, but these studies are very preliminary and NAA measurements are the major focus of current MR spectroscopy studies in MS. Also referred to as black holes, T1-weighted hypointense lesions have lower signal intensity than the surrounding white matter. T1 hypointense lesions are most common in the supratentorial region (cerebral hemispheres). They are much less common in the infratentorial (brainstem and cerebellum) region and are not reported in the spinal cord. Compared to T2-weighted lesions, they represent more severe tissue pathology, with axon loss, demyelination, and extracellular edema. In postmortem studies of progressive MS, T1-weighted hypointense lesions correlate strongly with axon density measurements. T1-weighted hypointense lesions show a stronger correlation with disability than T2-weighted hyperintense lesions. Magnetization transfer imaging (MTI) can be used to study global brain function or to measure changes within a local region of interest. Populations of bound and soluble protons produce different signals in response to the external magnetic field. The magnetization transfer ratio (MTR) is the ratio of the different signals produced by these two populations. It is reduced in MS and is believed to reflect both demyelination and axon loss, thereby producing an index of tissue destruction. MTR measurements are correlated with MS disability, as measured by the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS; see ), as well as cognitive measures. MTI shows great promise as a disease marker. Lower MTR values occur with disease worsening in relapsing, secondary progressive, and primary progressive MS patients and even in patients with clinically isolated MS syndromes. In primary progressive patients who have a relatively small T2 burden of disease, MTR is significantly reduced, suggesting that axon damage is significantly greater in this clinical subtype. Differences in MTRs are associated with different lesion pathology. Lesions that are more destructive (as indicated by T1 hypointensity) have reduced MTR values. Lesions that remain hypointense show a persistent reduction in MTR, whereas lesions that become isointense recover in MTR. New lesions in secondary progressive patients have a lower MTR than those in relapsing patients. The decline in MTR over three years is significantly greater in secondary progressive MS than in relapsing MS, supporting a relationship between MTR changes and disease progression. MTR measures allow more significant lesions to be detected and may provide a better potential correlate with clinical disability. Reduction in MTR can precede the development of new lesions on conventional MRI. Diffusion-weighted MRI is sensitive to the diffusion, or random motion, of water molecules in tissue. It can detect subtle pathological changes that are not seen on conventional MRI. This technique ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001. Multiple Sclerosis: Current Status and Strategies for the Future. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. might allow detection of pathological change in white matter tracts, including demyelination and loss of axons, by quantifying anisotropy through a measure of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). DTI can identify significantly altered diffusion properties in normal-appearing white matter. Lesions with the highest diffusion are the more destructive black holes, while the greatest change in anisotropy is seen in acute inflammatory lesions. Coincident with new lesion formation, diffusion-weighted imaging has shown changes in contralateral normal-appearing white matter. High-field-strength magnets, which are 4 tesla (T) or higher, increase the signal-to-noise ratio (conventional imaging machines are 1.5 T). They allow enhanced detection of small (less than 5 mm) MS lesions, particularly those aligned along blood vessels. Both MR spectroscopy and MTI can be conducted on high-field machines with enhanced sensitivity. Functional magnetic resonance imaging, or fMRI, is a technique for determining which parts of the brain are activated by different types of sensation such as sight or sound, by different types of tasks such as moving one's fingers or legs, or by different mental tasks such as adding sums, reading, or memorizing. This “brain mapping” is achieved by using an MRI scanner to measure changes in blood flow to different areas of the brain. When a particular brain region is activated, blood flow into the region increases. The incoming arterial blood is rich in oxygenated hemoglobin, and there is a corresponding decrease in local deoxygenated hemoglobin. Changes in the MRI signal are derived from regional changes in the concentration of deoxygenated hemoglobin, which is a paramagnetic molecule (reviewed in Hirsch et al.). The fMRI signal is, thus, determined by the balance between oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin. FMRI can provide second-by-second images of changes in response to different stimuli and during performance of mental tasks. It provides a unique tool for assessment of neural circuits involved in loss and recovery of function, as well as for measuring the circuits underlying symptoms that are as difficult to study as cognitive changes, fatigue, pain, and sensory disturbances. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is the fluid that circulates around and within the brain and spinal cord. CSF provides a vehicle for removing waste products of cellular metabolism from the nervous system and is believed to be nutritive for both neurons and glial cells and to function as a transport system for biologically active substances such as releasing factors, hormones, neurotransmitters, and metabolites. Sampling this fluid thus provides an index to substances active in the CNS and possibly those involved in MS pathology. ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001. Multiple Sclerosis: Current Status and Strategies for the Future. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. A number of potential CSF disease markers have been reported in MS, including markers that are proposed as distinguishing between different types of MS (). For the most part, these are markers of tissue damage or immune disturbance. None are currently used in routine clinical practice, since they have not proved useful enough to justify serial lumbar punctures. There has been particular interest in the specificity of oligoclonal bands in MS. Oligoclonal bands are produced by the overrepresentation of particular anti-bodies that can be visualized when CSF proteins are separated by gel electrophoresis where they appear as separate bands of protein on a gel matrix. Each of the bands contains a single type of antibody produced by a single clone of B cells. Oligoclonal bands are for the CSF of MS patients, but they are not to MS patients. For example, they are also found in the CSF of patients with other inflammatory status, such as viral brain infections. In MS, however, the particular antigens that elicit each antibody band are unknown. Investigators have recently used molecular approaches such as phage display libraries to probe MS oligoclonal immunoglobulin G (IgG) bands for sequence information related to their antigenic target. These are powerful methods that should allow for the identification of antigenic targets for the oligoclonal IgG. A main question, however, is whether the oligoclonal IgG bands represent an immune response directed against the etiologic agent of MS or merely constitute a by-product of immune system activity. In other words, upregulation of the antibody response and the heterogeneous distribution of antibodies into oligoclonal IgG bands could be a result of B-cell hyperactivity rather than an immune response to a specific etiologic pathogen. A variety of blood, urine, and mucosal fluid disease markers have been studied in MS, but none of them have provided a reliable disease marker. Again they are either markers of tissue damage (such as S-100) or immune activation (such as neopterin). Blood markers have included matrix metalloproteinases and their tissue inhibitors, circulating adhesion molecules, levels of various cytokines and their receptors, different subpopulations of cells, a variety of antibodies including antiviral and autoreactive antibodies, S-100 levels, and neopterin levels. Urine disease markers have included myelin basic protein-like material, free light chains, neopterin, gliotoxin, and neuron-specific enolase. Mucosal fluid cells and immunoglobulins have also been studied. The diagnosis of MS is based on both clinical parameters, such as medical history and neurological examination, and paraclinical parameters such as MRI, CSF oligoclonal banding, and evoked potentials. There is no MS-specific diag- ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001. Multiple Sclerosis: Current Status and Strategies for the Future. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. nostic test, and the intermittent nature of the disease and high variability in presenting symptoms make diagnosis difficult (listed in ). The presentation of MS can be monosymptomatic or have multifocal signs and symptoms, and many neurodegenerative disorders are similar to MS in their presentation. The general diagnostic criteria, established in 1965 by a committee sponsored by the National MS Society (the MS Society), state that a diagnosis of “clinically definite” MS (CDMS) requires clinical evidence of two or more white matter lesions on at least two occasions. In 1983, these criteria were expanded by Poser et al. to include the use of paraclinical parameters, and they have since become the standard MS diagnostic criteria (). In July 2000, an international committee met to further revise these criteria, in particular to make MRI information a more integral component and to incorporate diagnostic criteria for primary progressive MS. The results of that meeting, however, were not available at the time of this writing. The failure of the Poser criteria to incorporate primary progressive MS has recently been addressed by revised criteria that define definite, probable, and possible levels of diagnostic certainty. These criteria are based on clinical findings, CSF abnormalities, brain and spinal cord MRI abnormalities, and evoked potentials. Using these criteria, at least one year of clinical progression must be documented before a diagnosis of primary progressive MS can be made. MRI reveals neuropathological damage in 70 to 95 percent of people with MS and, because of its sensitivity, is the most helpful paraclinical diagnostic test. However, the use of MRI in MS diagnosis has led to concern that its high sensitivity combined with limited MS specificity leads to misdiagnosis, since other conditions including myelopathy and disseminated encephalomyelitis can cause MRI lesions similar to MS lesions. Thus, it is important that imaging be used in combination with clinical data for the diagnosis of MS. Recently, several sets of criteria for the definition of “MRI-definite” MS have been suggested (). Patients with clinically isolated syndromes are particularly difficult to diagnose, and Barkhof et al. and Fazekas have identified criteria that are relevant to such cases. Although assessment of spinal cord damage using MRI remains behind the development of brain methodology, it can be useful in diagnosing patients suspected of MS, particularly in cases with equivocal or negative brain MRI results. Spinal cord imaging increases the diagnostic sensitivity of MRI and might also enable earlier diagnosis. When demyelination or sclerosis (scarring) occurs, the conduction of nerve impulses along axons is slowed or interrupted. Impaired conductance is reflected in an increased latency of evoked potentials or an increase in the amount of time that elapses between the presentation of a sensory stimulus and the resulting ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001. Multiple Sclerosis: Current Status and Strategies for the Future. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. change in the brain's electrical field. Evoked potentials are measured by placing small electrodes on the head in the region corresponding to the stimuli presented ( ). Abnormal evoked responses to different types of stimuli provide clues to the location of plaques or lesions and are useful in detecting “clinically silent” lesions that do not produce easily observable symptoms. However, abnormal evoked responses are not unique to MS. For example, although abnormal visual IgG antibodies are composed of light and heavy polypeptide chains. Free light chains are found in patients with chronic infections or inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, but also in healthy individuals particularly following strenuous exercise. Cytokines are intercellular signaling proteins produced by cells of the immune system and CNS. They are involved in various aspects of disease processes, particularly inflammatory responses. Oligoclonal bands are produced by the overrepresentation of particular antibodies. They are of the CSF of MS patients, but not to it. Antiviral antibodies are produced by B cells in direct response to an antigen's presence, and certain antiviral antibodies are increased in the CSF of some patients with MS. Immunoglobulins are produced by plasma cells and are integral in adaptive immune responses. Polyclonal increases of IgG occur in chronic infection and inflammation. White blood cells responsible for cell-mediated immune responses to antigens, including viral infections. Adhesion, costimulatory, and other surface of MS. molecules Upregulated adhesion molecules in blood and CSF indicate sustained potential for inflammation in the CNS throughout the clinical spectrum A major component of myelin, MBP is increased in the CSF of some, but not all, MS patients following a demyelinating episode.

Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. evoked potentials are common in MS, they also occur in compressive lesions of the visual pathway and spinocerebellar degeneration. Evoked potentials can aid in the localization of lesions, confirm clinically ambiguous lesions, and confirm the organic basis of symptoms. In addition, changes in evoked potentials can be used to measure disease progression and the effectiveness of therapeutic treatment, including treatments designed to improve conduction. Continued S-100 protein is an astroglial-specific protein that binds calcium. When a brain lesion occurs, S-100 is released into both the CSF and the blood. As a marker of brain damage, NSE reflects the severity of disease in patients with intracerebral hematoma, subarachnoid hemorrhage, head injury, and certain tumors. A major constituent of glial filaments in differentiated CNS astrocytes, GFAP has been used for the diagnosis of astrocytic tumors, the study of astrocytic gliosis, and CNS regeneration and transplantation. Neurofilaments are important for axonal structure, transport, and regeneration. Accumulation of neurofilaments in motor neurons can trigger a neurodegenerative process and may be a key intermediate in the pathway of pathogenesis leading to neuronal loss. A modulator of axon outgrowth and cell adhesion that adapts its structure to requirements during development by alternative splicing and posttranslational modification. CNTF appears to promote remyelination, as well as formation of oligodendroctyes. Highly cytotoxic for astrocytes and oligodendrocytes, gliotoxin may represent an initial pathogenic factor leading to the neuropathological features of MS, such as blood-brain barrier involvement and demyelination. A marker of immune activation, neopterin is increased in CSF of relapsing-remitting patients and correlates with a decrease of -tryptophan, reflecting interferon-gamma-mediated activation of macrophages. Matrix metalloproteinases are enzymes that can dissolve the extracellular matrix of the blood-brain barrier. ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001. Multiple Sclerosis: Current Status and Strategies for the Future. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. Combinations of various types of evidence are used to diagnose MS under the Poser criteria. More than one combination of clinical and paraclinical evidence can support a diagnosis within a single category. Laboratory-supported diagnosis requires one of two possible immune disturbances in CSF: IgG oligoclonal bands or intrathecal IgG production. NOTES: CSF, Cerebrospinal fluid. OB, Oligoclonal bands.

Evoked Potentials as a Diagnostic Tool in MS Strobe light flash or reversible checkerboard pattern flash on a computer screen Series of clicking noises or tone bursts played into earphone On the scalp along the vertex and on each earlobe Evaluation of sensory nerve tracts in spinal cord, thalamus, and sensory cortex Mild electrical stimulus via electrodes on wrists or knees On the scalp, each wrist (medial nerve), and the knees (peroneal nerve) The use of evoked potentials as a diagnostic tool has greatly declined since the advent of the MRI, which provides a more comprehensive picture of disease activity. In at least some cases of progressive MS, visual evoked potentials show changes over time where none are detected in MRI scans. In May 2000, the Quality Standards Subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology concluded that although visual evoked potentials are useful to identify patients at increased risk of developing clinically definite MS, somatosensory evoked responses are only useful for that purpose, and there is insufficient evidence to recommend brainstem auditory evoked potentials as a diagnostic tool. Although MS is postulated to have an underlying immune-mediated pathogenesis, there is as yet no biologic marker that is disease specific and can be used for diagnostic purposes. Similarly, there is insufficient evidence to allow detection of any putative disease-related infectious agent as a basis for defining the disease. Thus, MS continues to be defined by sets of criteria that have been ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001. Multiple Sclerosis: Current Status and Strategies for the Future. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. developed based on clinical and pathologic observations. MS may well be heterogeneous when viewed from the perspective of genetics, pathogenic mechanisms, clinical phenotypes, and immunopathology. To be considered a truly distinctive variant of MS, any putative distinct disease subtypes defined in one of these categories would have to be correlated with the distinctive features identified in each of the other categories. Cases classified as MS are recognized where disease distribution is mainly in the spinal cord, hind brain (cerebellum or brainstem), or cerebrum. Different animal models have distinct topographic distributions, some of which seem to have distinct immunopathologies. For example, Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus, the demyelinating disease that afflicts mice, is mainly a spinal cord disease. There is an apparent overrepresentation of specific phenotypes in certain geographic regions. For example, MS that is relatively restricted to the optic nerve and spinal cord is more common in Japan than in other countries. The Devic's pattern of MS features a predominance of spinal cord and optic nerve involvement. The pathology is considered more destructive than classical MS, and the prognosis is worse. At issue is whether these differences reflect different immunopathogenic mechanisms in a given individual, even when the disease trigger, or initiating event, is not distinct among such individuals. Even in identical twins with MS, the disease course can be markedly different. A number of immunomodulatory agents have been shown in double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter Phase III trials to benefit patients with relapsing MS ( ; see also 1999 review by Rudick ). These agents help clinical disease features (they decrease the number of attacks, the severity of attacks, and sustained worsening on neurologic examination) as well as MRI disease features (they decrease the formation of new lesions, the number of contrast-enhancing lesions, the total burden of disease, and brain atrophy). Although all of these drugs have side effects, they are manageable in most patients. The benefit of treatment is sustained for at least several years. It is not yet known whether these agents prevent, reduce, or delay transition from relapsing to progressive MS, but preliminary data suggest that this may be the case. Throughout this report, the term “disease-modifying therapy” is used to distinguish these agents from other medications used to relieve the symptoms of MS that do not alter either the frequency of relapses or the rate of progression. Beta-interferon (IFN-Î²) is an anti-inflammatory regulatory cytokine with antiviral, antineoplastic, and immunomodulatory activity. It has a number of effects on the immune system that would be beneficial in MS. For example, it decreases cell migration into the CNS, inhibits T-cell proliferation and expression of cell activation markers, inhibits inducible nitric oxide synthase (the enzyme that produces nitric oxide, a potentially damaging substance), and enhances ""2 Clinical and Biological Features.""

There are two types of recombinant (artificially made) beta-interferon. Beta-interferon-1a (Avonex, Rebif) is a duplicate of human beta-interferon. Beta-interferon-1b (Betaseron) has three molecular differences from human beta-interferon: it is not glycosylated, there is an amino acid substitution at position 17, and there is no “N-terminal” methionine. The three available beta-interferon therapies are given in different amounts and dosing schedules (). There are well-recognized side effects (most commonly flu-like reactions), which occur maximally during the first weeks or months of therapy. Flu-like reactions can be minimized by initiating therapy with a dose escalation schedule and consistent use of anti-inflammatory premedication during the first few weeks of therapy. *Rebif has been approved for the treatment of relapsing-remitting MS by the European Commission but has not been approved by the Food and Drug Administration in the United States because of the Orphan Drug Act. If tentative approval is received, Rebif could enter the U.S. market in 2003, when the exclusivity periods for Avonex and Betaseron end. ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001. Multiple Sclerosis: Current Status and Strategies for the Future. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. Glatiramer acetate (Copaxone) consists of random polymers of four amino acids, designed to mimic myelin basic protein, an important component of CNS myelin. Glatiramer acetate is believed to work by activating antiinflammatory regulatory T cells, which then migrate into the CNS to inhibit local immune reactions. Glatiramer acetate has an excellent side effect profile. Patients may experience injection site reactions, but they tend to be quite minor. Some 10 to 15 percent of patients experience at least one immediate postinjection reaction characterized by chest tightness, palpitations, flushing, and anxiety within a few minutes of injection. The reaction lasts only minutes and is not dangerous. Mitoxantrone (Novantrone) is a cytotoxic agent that interferes with DNA synthesis and repair, and suppresses a variety of immune system cells. It also enhances suppressor cell activity. It is given as an intravenous infusion over 5 to 15 minutes, every three months. Mitoxantrone is fairly well tolerated at low doses. In the recent Phase III trial, both the low (5 mg/m) and high (12 mg/m) doses showed efficacy, but the high dose gave the best overall results. Mitoxantrone should not be given at a cumulative dose of 140 mg/m or higher because of concerns about cardiotoxicity, which also means that this drug can be used for only a few years. Currently available treatments are highly effective in preventing the type of MS damage that can be visualized using MRI. They are moderately effective in preventing and reducing the severity of relapses, but they are generally disappointing in preventing long-term disability—the most important goal of treatment. This might reflect the timing of treatment, and there has been a recent emphasis on starting therapy at the time MS is first diagnosed. This type of early therapy is likely most effective in delaying or preventing long-term disability, although this effect has not yet been clearly demonstrated through empirical research studies (Richard Rudick, personal communication). Clearly, much remains to be done in the development of therapies for people who suffer from MS. Two recent studies, the interferon beta-1a (Avonex) prevention study (CHAMPS, Controlled High Risk Subjects Avonex Multiple Sclerosis Prevention) and the interferon beta-1a (Rebif) early treatment (ETOMS, Early Treatment of Multiple Sclerosis) trial, have compared the use of disease-modifying therapy with placebo in patients after their first attack who also have an abnormal brain MRI. These are patients at high risk for MS, but who do not meet current criteria for a definite diagnosis. In both studies, early treatment with a disease-modifying agent significantly delayed onset of a second clinical attack over the two-year study period. Patients who received treatment also showed significantly less MRI disease activity over the next two years. These two trials have led to a reassessment of when disease-modifying therapy should be started. The National MS Society consensus statement endorsed treatment of patients as soon as a definite diagnosis of relapsing MS is made. If new diagnostic criteria are formulated for an MRI-based diagnosis at the time of a first attack, it is likely that the use of disease-modifying therapy will expand to include these early patients.

Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. Beta-interferon and glatiramer acetate have been tested mainly in relapsing MS. It is more controversial whether they benefit progressive MS. Several Phase III trials have examined beta-interferon therapy in patients with secondary progressive MS, with conflicting results. The European Secondary Progressive Study on beta-interferon-1b (Betaseron) showed a significant effect on slowing progression. In contrast, the North American Secondary Progressive beta-interferon-1b study and the European SPECTRIMS beta-interferon-1a (Rebif) study showed no significant effect on progression. These trials did, however, show positive results on secondary outcomes such as relapse rate and MRI disease parameters. The European study, which showed a treatment effect on progression in contrast to the two negative studies, included secondary progressive patients who had a shorter disease duration, were still experiencing relapses, and had contrast-enhancing brain MRI lesions. Considered as a whole, these studies suggest that in the earlier stages of MS, when there is still a significant inflammatory component (reflected in clinical relapses and gadolinium-enhancing lesion activity), beta-interferon may have a positive effect on clinical progression. In the later, nonrelapsing, progressive stages of MS, where there appears to be ongoing atrophy relatively independent of contrast-enhancing lesion activity, beta-interferon does not seem to slow progression. The European Phase III trial of Mitoxantrone enrolled both relapsing and secondary progressive MS patients. The drug had a positive effect on progression as indicated by a decrease in the EDSS impairment scale at the end of the study (change of -0.13 compared to +0.23 in the placebo group, p = .038) (for EDSS scale, see ). An ongoing trial (IMPACT Study) in secondary progressive MS is testing double-dose interferon beta-1a (Avonex) once a week. There have been no major treatment trials in primary progressive and progressive relapsing MS. There currently is an ongoing three-year Phase III trial of glatiramer acetate in primary progressive MS (the Promise trial). Each of the currently available disease-modifying treatments has shortcomings, including partial efficacy for patients as a group and potential adverse effects. There are four reasons why treatments fail—nonadherence on the patient's part, adverse side effects, production of neutralizing antibodies, and nonresponsive disease (reviewed by Cohen at al., 1999). Patient adherence is a factor in the efficacy of any medication, but particularly so when a patient's hopes exceed the outcome—which is particularly salient for therapies that are preventive, but not restorative. The primary principles to increase adherence are appropriate selection of patients for treatment, availability of adequate medical support throughout treatment, and perhaps most importantly, patient education before and during treatment. MS patients need to be fully informed that the therapy can prevent relapses and the accumulation of disability, ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001. Multiple Sclerosis: Current Status and Strategies for the Future. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. but that it will not improve preexisting manifestations. In addition, some patients are averse to self-injection and will not be persuaded to inject themselves with any medication (unless, perhaps, they are convinced of a substantial and certain benefit, which many MS patients are not). Health care financing policies vary widely among different countries and even within countries such as the United States and Canada. This will also influence patient adherence. In countries such as France where the costs of MS therapies are fully covered by the state, cost is unlikely to influence adherence, but in countries where patients must assume the full costs of MS disease-modifying therapies themselves, many of them will decide that they cannot afford to pay more than $10,000 (U.S.) annual expense for the modest health benefit they might gain. Adverse effects are a common reason for discontinuing treatment, but they are generally not serious health threats. The most common side effect of glatiramer acetate is irritation at the injection site, although it is typically mild. The most common side effects of beta-interferon are flu-like symptoms, and these usually resolve after three to six months. (Depression is also a possible side effect and is discussed in greater detail in .) Although only 4 percent of actively treated patients withdrew from beta-interferon clinical trials because of side effects, in clinical practice, 11 percent discontinue within four months of initiating treatment (reviewed in 1999 by Mohr et al.). (The percentage of patients who discontinue treatment because of side effects might, however, decline as physicians become more experienced in managing these side effects.) Defining nonresponsive disease in individual patients is difficult, because unfortunately patients can continue to experience relapses after initiation of disease-modifying therapy with beta-interferon or glatiramer acetate. Comparison of pre- and post-treatment relapse rates is fraught with problems, and it is often difficult to identify whether an individual patient is responsive to therapy. At a minimum, a patient's level of neurological impairment and disability should remain stable on therapy. Persistent gadolinium-enhancing or T2 lesion accrual should be considered a worrisome feature, even in the absence of clinical evidence of activity or worsening. Finally, neutralizing antibodies, which can interfere with the effects of interferons, appear in up to 20 percent of patients after two years of beta-interferon treatment. They do not appear to be an issue with glatiramer acetate. Increased neutralizing antibodies appear to be associated with reduced clinical benefit, although there is still some controversy about this point. For example, it is still not known what levels of neutralizing antibodies are clinically significant, how often they persist, and what is the most reliable method of measuring them. More research is needed on testing for neutralizing antibodies in MS patients treated with beta-interferons and how to best use the results to properly manage patient treatment.

Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. Disease-modifying therapies are expensive, costing roughly $8,000 to $10,000 (U.S.) per year. Several studies have indicated that their costs outweigh their benefits, but these analyses have been heavily criticized. Forbes and colleagues argued that it is not cost-effective to treat progressive MS patients with interferon beta-1b in Britain and that the money spent on interferon beta-1b would be better spent on other services, such as supportive care and simple interventions to reduce the burden of patients' symptoms. Analyses of cost-effectiveness of medical treatment often use quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) to measure health benefits (see ). The estimated costs of beta-interferon treatment per gain in QALY for relapsing-remitting MS range from 809,000 British pounds ($1,140,000 U.S.) to 2,038,400 British pounds ($2,870,000 U.S.). The estimates are considerably lower in Canada (406,000 to 490,000 Canadian dollars, or $270,000-$330,000 U.S.). For secondary progressive MS, the estimated costs of beta-interferon treatment per gain in QALY range from 874,600 British pounds ($1,230,000 U.S.) to 1,024,000 British pounds ($1,440,000 U.S.). While disease-related expenditures are relatively easy to calculate, the benefits of these expenditures are not so easy to calculate, particu- Quality-adjusted life-years are a health status measure that includes both quantity and quality of life in a single outcome measure. Multiplying life expectancy by a quality-of-life adjustment fraction, or utility, results in a QALY value. Utilities represent the level of quality or value associated with a particular health state, and range in value from 0, representing death, to 1, representing optimal health. Utilities are determined in two ways: by researchers through literature searches for previously conducted utility studies or by direct measurement of utility values based on the assessment of people's values for different levels of health. The use of QALYs for resource allocation has been widely criticized as discriminatory against the elderly and the disabled by placing less value on extending their lives due to the lower potential for health status improvement. The determination of utility values that accurately reflect the many ways quality of life can be affected is difficult in part because one of the underlying assumptions of QALYs— that the severity of a disease state or disability and the corresponding value represent a fixed quantity—is unlikely to be true. The effect of health status on quality of life depends in large part on an individual's unique perspective. Although the use of QALYs is one of the current standards for such evaluations, it is a crude attempt to express a qualitative, subjective reality in quantitative terms and has been criticized as being of limited value in this respect. ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001. Multiple Sclerosis: Current Status and Strategies for the Future. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. larly in long-term diseases where treatments might slow the progress of disease, but neither cure it nor restore impaired functions. In addition to the limitations inherent in the use of QALYs, there are other problems with the conclusion that disease-modifying therapies are not cost-effective. The studies done to date have been criticized for using poor economic methodology in interpreting the data. In a year 2000 review of immunomodulatory drugs used to treat MS, the British National Health Service committee on health technology assessment concluded that the cost-effectiveness of these drugs is simply not known. The committee cited a lack of quality clinical trials for each drug, including methodological limitations, poor reporting of data, small sample sizes, short duration, inconsistent treatment regimes and outcome measures, and uncertainty about the clinical significance of reported benefits. The latter criticism might, however, change. New data about these drugs are emerging at such a rapid pace that conclusions about their benefits should be reconsidered as new data from clinical trials become available. In general, cost-effectiveness analysis should be considered skeptically. Cost-effectiveness is a highly politicized issue in which economic principles are often misapplied. Indeed, the United States health care system often favors economically inefficient delivery of some products—for example, liver transplants—in that health care providers are willing to underwrite additional costs to gain market share. Further, cross-national comparisons have little merit because of differences in national health care systems, as well as other economic and social factors. Finally, although economic analysis reveals important financial trade-offs, all societies hold certain social values that outweigh economic considerations. For many people, the health and well-being of their loved ones and themselves is among the deepest of these values. Ultimately, the pathogenic mechanisms underlying MS will have to be better understood to design rational therapies. Physiology of Myelin and Axons: Normal Function, Demyelination, and Repair The integrative activity of the nervous system, which underlies motor, sensory, cognitive, and psychological behavior, depends on electrical signaling between neurons. Each neuron encodes its message in the form of action potentials (small all-or-none electrical impulses) that are carried to other neurons via axons, the cable-like fibers that extend from neuron cell bodies. Many axons within the brain and spinal cord are myelinated. ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001. Multiple Sclerosis: Current Status and Strategies for the Future. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. The myelin sheath provides a high-resistance, low-capacitance insulator that increases the reliability and speed of action potentials conducted along axon fibers. Myelin is what makes the white matter of brain white. It is a multilayered sheath formed by the oligodendroglial cells, or oligodendrocytes, that insulate axons ( ). Each segment of the myelin sheath surrounds the axon in a segmented fashion, with segments (called internodes) periodically interrupted at nodes of Ranvier. The internodal axon is normally surrounded by myelin sheaths whose thicknesses are related to the caliber of the ensheathed axon. In normal Oligodendrocyte making myelin. The processes of a given oligodendrocyte wrap themselves around portions of the surrounding axons. As each process wraps itself around, it forms layers of myelin. Each process thus becomes a segment of the axon's myelin sheath. SOURCE: National Institutes of Health Office of Science Education. ""2 Clinical and Biological Features.""

Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. myelinated fibers, the action potential does not travel in a continuous manner. On the contrary, it jumps from one node of Ranvier to the next, in a manner known as “saltatory” (derived from the Latin word for “jumping”). Saltatory conduction is a rapid process, with the impulse taking only 20 one-thousandths of a second to jump from one node of Ranvier to the next; as a result, myelinated fibers conduct impulses with a high velocity. Significantly, voltage-dependent sodium channels are clustered at the nodes of Ranvier but are relatively more scarce in the internodal axonal membrane. In contrast, potassium channels, which exist in low density at nodes, are more abundant in the internodal and paranodal axonal membrane, under the myelin sheath. Therefore, loss of the myelin sheath exposes relatively inexcitable axonal membranes; the consequence is that nerve impulses are conducted more slowly or not at all. Axonal Conduction Is Impaired in Demyelinated Axons Following damage to the myelin, conduction velocity is reduced, and conduction slows along the demyelinated axon ( ). Studies using evoked potentials to examine human subjects with MS have demonstrated that this slowing of conduction does not, in itself, necessarily produce clinical deficits. In addition, however, conduction failure can occur in demyelinated axons. When conduction failure occurs, the axon potential is not propagated from one end of the fiber to the other, and information is lost. This produces a clinical deficit. Conduction failure in demyelinated axons is now known to result not only from loss of the insulating myelin, but also from the molecular organization of the axon membrane. Following damage to the myelin, internodal parts of the axon membrane (which had previously been covered by myelin) are uncovered. Myelinated Axons Exhibit Complex Molecular Architecture Prior to the last decade, axonal dysfunction in demyelinating diseases was considered to be due entirely to the loss of the myelin insulation. According to this schema, after the myelin is damaged, there is a “short circuit,” and impulse conduction is slowed or fails. It is now known that although the schema described above is partially correct, it is not the whole story. The axon itself exhibits an elegant molecular architecture, and following damage to the myelin, this architecture is disrupted. The molecular architecture of the axon is manifest by the placement of specialized protein molecules, called ion channels, within the membrane of the axon. Sodium channels act as tiny molecular batteries, which produce the depolarization that is necessary for the generation of action potentials. In contrast, potassium channels act as molecular brakes, damping electrical activity. Within myelinated axons, these two types of ion channels have a complementary structure. Sodium channels are clustered in high density in the axon membrane at small gaps in the myelin called nodes of Ranvier, where they support the produc- ""2 Clinical and Biological Features.""

Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. tion of action potentials; they are sparse, however, in the “internodal” parts of the axon membrane beneath the myelin. Their numbers there are too low to support secure conduction, which contributes to conduction failure. Potassium channels, on the other hand, tend to be located in the internodal parts of the axon membrane, beneath the myelin sheath; as a result of this, they are masked by the Pathogenesis. Current concept of pathogenesis of neurological dysfunction associated with acute multiple sclerosis lesion in relapsing-remitting MS patient. Normal myelinated fibers (A) are demyelinated by inflammatory process (B), which causes conduction block.

Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. overlying myelin in normal myelinated fibers. The unmasking of potassium channels by demyelination thus introduces another factor that tends to interfere with the conduction of action potentials. Molecular Plasticity in Demyelinated Axons Underlies Restoration of Impulse Conduction Given that impulse conduction fails in demyelinated axons and that this contributes to clinical deficits, how do remissions occur? It is now clear that demyelinated axons possess a remarkable capability to rebuild themselves at the molecular level. In the weeks following demyelination, demyelinated axons acquire, within regions where myelin has been lost, a density of sodium channels that is high enough to support action potential conduction even in the absence of insulating myelin. The demyelinated nerve fibers insert additional amplifiers (sodium channels) in their membranes so that they are able to conduct action potentials reliably even though there is a short circuit. This is a striking example of neuronal plasticity, in this case at the molecular level. Although this molecular plasticity has been clearly demonstrated in laboratory experiments, a number of important questions remain: How do neurons “know” that their axons have been demyelinated and that there is a need to activate the machinery for synthesis of sodium channels? How do neurons control the synthesis and deployment of sodium channels? What turns on the genes for sodium channels and ensures that the correct types of sodium channels (there are nearly a dozen different types, which are like different types of batteries) are produced following demyelination? Also, how are sodium channels transported and inserted into the correct parts of the axon membrane so that they can function normally? These questions have important therapeutic implications and are currently under study. The presence of axonal degeneration in MS was recognized even in the early descriptions of this disease, but its presence has recently been reemphasized (). Axonal transection might be the structural basis for acquisition of permanent (nonremitting) neurological deficits, making it an especially important part of the pathology of MS. A corollary of this proposition would be that neuroprotective interventions that limit axonal injury should prevent, or at least lessen, the acquisition of new, permanent signs and symptoms in MS. As a step toward the development of neuroprotective strategies in MS, it will be important to delineate the mechanisms that underlie axonal injury in this disorder. Is it a consequence of demyelination? Alternatively, is the axonal damage a by-product of the inflammatory or immune processes involved in triggering demyelination? What is the nature of the “injury cascade” that leads from the ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001. Multiple Sclerosis: Current Status and Strategies for the Future. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. initial insult to ultimate degeneration of axons in MS? Understanding the pathogenesis of the process might lead to the development of new therapeutic targets for MS. These questions are being approached in models of other neurological diseases such as trauma and cerebrovascular disease, including stroke, and should be actively pursued in MS research as well. Axonal transection during inflammatory demyelination. According to this schema, axonal transection during (A) is a consistent feature of inflammatory demyelinating lesions. This results in degeneration of the distal axonal segment (B) and irreversible loss of neuronal function. During the relapsing-remitting course of multiple sclerosis (RR-MS), the CNS compensates for axonal destruction. Axonal degeneration as a result of chronic demyelination. This model posits that axonal viability depends upon oligodendrocyte-derived trophic effect. Chronically demyelinated axons (A) may undergo nerve transection (B) or wallerian degeneration (C), which are caused by lack of myelin trophic support. Axonal transection and degeneration.

MS is defined as a demyelinating disease because the myelin sheaths and their parent cells, the oligodendroglia, are major targets of immune-mediated damage (). The classical lesions are discrete plaques of demyelination, which, depending on disease stage, are associated with varying evidence of inflammation. The clinical signs, which are episodic and are not clinically predictable, are presumably related to the location of the lesions, although clinically “silent” demyelinating lesions also occur. These predominantly white matter lesions occur in multiple brain regions and appear at different times throughout the disease. Common syndromes correlated with lesions in specific areas include visual deficits, weakness and spasticity, eye movement abnormalities, and ataxia (). Lesions are often described as active or chronic, depending on whether there are signs of active inflammation, usually associated with ongoing demyelination, or whether the lesion is stable and does not show signs of inflammatory activity. Disruption of the blood-brain barrier that normally insulates the brain from pathogenic blood-borne substances is an early event in the development of MS lesions (). Antigen-specific T cells enter the nervous system, and when they encounter and recognize their specific antigen, a cascade of cytokine expression begins that contributes to the damage of the blood-brain barrier. This can be detected on contrast-enhanced MRI. Examination of active demyelinating lesions in autopsy cases of MS reveals structural and immunopathological abnormalities related to demyelination and abnormalities of oligodendrocytes. The inflammatory response is dominated by lymphocytes and macrophages, but the data on the relative numbers of CD4+ and CD8+ cells are still not settled. A plaque is characterized by loss of myelin sheath and infiltration by macrophages (which show myelin basic protein and myelin-associated glycoprotein immunoreactivities).

Clinical Pathological Correlations in Common Syndromes of MS Often related to the involvement of the optic nerve as occurs in optic neuritis Frequently associated with plaques involving connections between the brainstem nuclei subserving eye movements One of the consequences of lesions involving the spinal cord or descending motor tracts in the white matter of internal capsule or brainstem Usually the result of lesions in cerebellum or its input-output pathways inflammatory responses amplify, macrophages are filled with lipids, myelin damage occurs, and there is apparently some collateral damage to axons. Scattered B cells and plasma cells are also sometimes associated with these lesions. Immunocytochemical analysis has suggested that there may be leakage of immunoglobulins and complement from vessels at the margins of active plaques. There is evidence for upregulation of a variety of cytokines within MS plaques including various interleukins (IL-1, 2, 4, 6, 10, and 12); beta-interferon; tumor necrosis factor (TNF); and transforming growth factor (TGF). Cytokines are intercellular signaling proteins produced by cells of the immune system and CNS. Their involvement in any disease is complex. They can initiate, sustain, or terminate various aspects of disease processes and are particularly involved in inflammatory responses. Specific chemokine receptors are expressed by infiltrating cells in demyelinating MS brain lesions and in CSF. These results imply pathogenic roles for specific chemokine-chemokine receptor interactions in MS and suggest new molecular targets for therapeutic intervention. Some investigators have emphasized that the pattern of pathology suggests a dying-back oligodendrogliopathy (those parts of the cell, such as the most distal process, farthest from the cell body are the most vulnerable). During the active stages of disease, the number of oligodendrocytes can be reduced near the demyelinating foci. Subsequently, there might be partial recruitment of oligodendrocyte precursors that may, in part, repopulate the margins of the plaque and contribute to remyelination. Trapp and colleagues have emphasized that the relapsing-remitting course is intimately related to the inflammatory demyelination and classical plaques, while more chronic progressive forms of the disease are linked to transection, or severing, of axons at sites of inflammation and demyelination. They have shown that severed axons were a consistent component in the lesions of individuals with MS and suggest that the number of these injured axons is correlated to the magnitude of the inflammation within the lesion. Axonal damage might be a pathological correlate of irreversible neurological deficits that occur in patients with progressive MS. In individuals with chronic MS, plaques are often sharply demarcated with scattered lipid-containing macrophages and little evidence of ongoing myelin destruction. Demyelination can be incomplete. The density of axons may be significantly reduced. There is usually astrogliosis within these lesions. It is not clear exactly how the axonal damage that occurs at later stages plays into this complex evolving pathology, but the extent of axonal damage appears to be a critical determinant of whether a person recovers from an attack or not. Lack of recovery from attacks and disease progression are more likely when axons are more severely damaged and repair mechanisms fail. ""2 Clinical and Biological Features.""

The tight seal of the cells lining the blood vessels forms a blood-brain barrier that keeps many substances out of the brain. Leaky blood vessels in the body allow many molecules to cross through to other tissues, but the tight construction of the vessels in the head guards against entry of most molecules into the brain. Normally, only certain molecules, for example, blood gases such as oxygen and small nutritional molecules, can cross the blood-brain barrier, but this barrier breaks down when the brain is injured or in certain diseases, such as MS.

A correlation between demyelination and axonal degeneration observed at autopsy is supported by imaging studies, including those that compare the concentrations of -acetyl aspartate. For example, one study measured the levels of NAA, an amino acid found only in neurons that serves as a biological marker for integrity of the axon and neuronal cell body. The brains of MS patients showed significantly greater side-to-side differences in levels of NAA, indicating decreased neuronal integrity on the side of the brain with lower NAA levels. There was a correlation between this asymmetry in motor function and the asymmetry of NAA concentrations in the internal capsule. Insights into processes that lead to demyelination and axon damage can be obtained by analyzing T1-weighted image hypointensities, proton spectroscopy, MTI, and DTI and by correlating these measures with clinical and pathological findings. Gliosis is a prominent feature of the MS lesion, but it is best regarded as a secondary phenomenon. Whenever the CNS is damaged, it undergoes an injury response, usually called reactive gliosis or glial scarring. The response is broadly the same whatever the source of injury, although the details vary somewhat with different types of pathology. The glial reaction to injury includes recruitment of oligodendrocyte precursor cells, stem cells, microglia, and astrocytes. Formation of the glial scar after CNS injury generally occurs over a period of weeks. Microglia are typically the first cell types to enter the lesion. In the normal brain, they are quiescent with short, branched processes. Following injury, they exhibit various changes, including activation, cell division, and migration to the injury site. During activation, microglia display conspicuous functional plasticity, which involves changes in cell morphology, cell surface receptor expression, and production of growth factors and cytokines, and they become, in general, more macrophage like. Microglia can be either neurotoxic or neurotrophic. The final glial scar is made up mainly of a meshwork of tightly interwoven astrocyte processes, attached to one another by tight junctions and gap junctions and surrounded by extracellular matrix (reviewed in 1999 by Fawcett and Asher). (Astrocytes are irregularly star-shaped, background structural cells of the nervous system.) Gliosis is usually restricted to the area of demyelination, but it sometimes extends beyond that area. There is no specific way to identify the presence and extent of gliosis in MS lesions through MRI, although the T1 signal might be more sensitive to gliosis than the T2 signal. The role of astrocytes in gliosis is not completely known. Since there is evidence that glial scars can inhibit both axon growth and myelination, it is clearly important to know what causes them to form, what cells are involved, why they are inhibitory, and how to manipulate them. Finally, although gliosis is generally considered harmful, there is also evidence that the gliotic ensheathment of demyelinated axons might favor the restoration of nerve conduction.

Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. The relapsing-remitting form of MS appears to be related to the demyelination of axons during relapses, followed by the remodeling and remyelination with consequent restoration of conduction that underlies remission. Remyelination is carried out by surviving oligodendrocytes or by the proliferation of progenitor cells that are then stimulated to become oligodendrocytes. Molecular remodeling of demyelinated axons, in terms of their redistributing their sodium channels along the axon, might act as a form of adaptive plasticity; this process may represent a target for future therapies. In contrast, the progressive form of the disease, which appears clinically as an unremitting accumulation of deficits, might reflect the superimposition of axonal injury or degeneration on multiple chronic foci of demyelinated axons. The finding that axonal damage can occur frequently in MS and the suggestion that these lesions contribute to persistent neurological deficits are important issues in MS research. Thus, it will be important to understand the mechanisms whereby axons are damaged and to define ways of protecting axons, which may be vulnerable to degeneration, in part due to their proximity to inflammatory and demyelinating foci. It will also be important to search for molecules that promote the regrowth of injured axons to their appropriate targets. Some of the lessons from studies of the repair of spinal cord injury are likely to be relevant here. Moreover, because abnormal patterns of ion channels have been found within neurons whose axons are undergoing demyelination, it will be important to understand the factors that influence the regulation of these channels. These lines of research, involving strategies can restore conduction in demyelinated axons represent opportunities to restore that protect axons from degeneration or promote repair, and those agents that functions and could have significant implications for therapy. Similarly, future therapeutic approaches might involve replacement of oligodendroglia with pluripotent stem cells (discussed further in ). Progenitor cells, those either already present in an individual or provided from another source by injection, can produce myelin in demyelinated foci in experimental animals. Future experimental therapeutics will involve approaches directed at restoring oligodendrocytes to ensheath axonal processes and to induce physiological modeling of axons to restore conduction. The most striking pathology in MS is the immune system's attack and destruction of the body's own myelin sheath, which is why it is believed to be an autoimmune disease, although this has not yet been definitively proven (). The pathogenic trigger that first causes the immune system to attack myelin is unknown, but the immunopathology, or pathological activity of the immune system, that ensues after that initial attack is becoming clearer. ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001. Multiple Sclerosis: Current Status and Strategies for the Future. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. The immune system defends the body against foreign invaders such as bacteria and viruses. It does so by recognizing that foreign invaders have special markers distinguishing them as “non-self,” compared to the body's own tissue (or “self”) (). Normally, the immune system reacts only to non-self invaders, not to its own tissues. Unfortunately, this process is not foolproof. Autoimmunity is an immune response mounted against antigens that are naturally produced within the body, or self-antigens, to cause lasting tissue damage. In the strictest sense, an autoimmune disease must meet several criteria. First, the disease must be reproduced by transfer of autoantibodies or autoreactive T lymphocytes (T cells) from affected to unaffected individuals. Second, the self-antigen that elicits the immune attack must be identified. Third, this antigen (or a closely related one) should cause a similar disease in an animal model. (Scientifically, it would be best to show that the antigen caused the disease in humans, but it would be unethical to intentionally infect humans, hence, the compromise for evidence in animals). It is now feasible to transfer human genes into animals in an attempt to satisfy these criteria. One of the first so-called transgenic studies that introduced certain human genes into an animal without MS led to the development of a disease resembling MS. Among the newly added genes were those for a specific type of histocompatibility antigen and for a particular type of T-cell receptor that binds to a fragment of a myelin protein (myelin basic protein). This type of study begins to confirm the autoimmune nature of MS. Human autoimmune diseases, however, are generally classified as such without meeting these three stringent criteria. Circumstantial evidence often is marshaled for classification. For example, patients are classified as having autoimmune disease if they have high levels of autoantibody or autoreactive T cells, or because there is a correlation between the level of immune activity and disease severity. Some examples of autoimmune diseases are listed in . Why does the immune system have autoreactive lymphocytes? During development, the immune system randomly builds a vast repertoire of cells that respond to a multitude of foreign antigens. At the same time, the immune system must weed out those cells that react to self-antigens. Most self-reactive B cells and T cells are removed early during development. Other regulatory mechanisms exist to keep self-reactive lymphocytes unresponsive later on. These are among the normal regulatory mechanisms resulting in immunological tolerance to most self-antigens. Even though there are usually small numbers of autoreactive lymphocytes in a normal adult, most do not cause disease, and some might even serve a (currently unknown) beneficial purpose. With autoimmune disease, however, there are large numbers of autoreactive immune cells. Autoimmune disease thus can be thought of as a failure of normal regulatory mechanisms that guard against autoimmunity. ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001. Multiple Sclerosis: Current Status and Strategies for the Future. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. The causes of autoimmune response in MS and most other autoimmune diseases are unknown but likely include a combination of genetic susceptibility and exposure to environmental agents. For most autoimmune diseases, the actual genes and environmental agents are unknown. Gender also plays a role because women are disproportionately affected by autoimmune disease. The reasons for the gender difference are also unknown but appear to relate to distinct immune environments in women and How can genes and environment trigger autoimmune pathology? Genes control many properties of the immune system. Theoretically, autoimmune disease can occur if any of the genes controlling the immune system's ability to distinguish self from non-self are defective. The genes often suspected of predisposing to autoimmune disease encode proteins, such as histocompatibility antigens, that participate in this complex process of self versus non-self recognition. Environmental or infectious agents can stimulate pathological autoimmune reactions through at least two possible mechanisms: molecular mimicry, superantigens, and bystander damage (). Molecular mimicry occurs when a bacterial or viral epitope—the fragment of an antigen that elicits an immune response—is very similar to a self-epitope. This can occur following an infection where an immune cell targeting an epitope on a bacterium subsequently cross-reacts with a self-antigen. Superantigens are proteins from bacteria or retroviruses that lead to widespread activation of T cells. Unlike most antigens, which activate only a specific T cell, superantigens activate approximately one out of every ten T cells. Because of their generic ability to activate so many types of T cells, superantigens may inadvertently activate autoreactive T cells, which then attack self-tissues. In bystander damage, a virus upregulates a nonspecific immune response that then leads to pathology; for example, proinflammatory cytokines might activate Th1 cells or macrophages that contribute to the immunopathology. Once damage occurs, new cellular epitopes become exposed and trigger an immune response in a process called epitope spreading, which can also lead to autoimmune pathology. During an immune response against a particular epitope, the number of lymphocytes that recognize the epitope normally multiplies. Yet, in epitope spreading, the immune response escalates to target other epitopes on the same antigen or on related antigens. In this way, an initially nonpathological autoimmune response expands to produce a pathological response. The underlying basis for epitope spreading in autoimmune diseases is poorly understood. Another way to produce a pathological autoimmune response is for autoreactive lymphocytes to gain access to a target antigen from which they are ordinarily separated. The brain is one example of an anatomical sanctuary site, because it is protected by the blood-brain barrier of the central nervous system. Normally, T cells that might react against myelin do not pass across this barrier into the central nervous system. In MS, however, T cells become activated, which enables them to penetrate the blood-brain barrier and reach their targets—myelin antigens—thereby generating an autoimmune response. ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001. Multiple Sclerosis: Current Status and Strategies for the Future. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. One of the first pathological processes leading up to MS attacks is thought to be activation of autoreactive T lymphocytes, or T cells, and their migration into the central nervous system. However, T cells and the inflammatory molecules they secrete are not the only players. Many cells and molecules of the immune system—likely unleashed by T-cell activation—participate in demyeli- Interactions between major cell components of the immune system. This simplified outline shows interactions that occur in response to a foreign antigen. The antigen could be an epitope from a virus particle, bacterium, or other foreign agent. The antigen-presenting cell (APC) ingests the antigen (or in the case of an infecting virus, it may already be within the cell) and processes it into peptide fragments. The major histocompatibility complex (MHC, the cell surface structure characteristic of each individual) presents this target to a resting T cell. Binding of the peptide-MHC complex by the T-cell receptor activates the T cell. In the case of a CD8+ cell, it becomes a cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL), which will destroy any cells that have the same peptide-MHC complex on their surfaces. In the case of a CD4+ cell, the activated cell produces and secretes various cytokines that recruit and activate nonspecific effector cells (such as macrophages) or stimulate antigen-bound B cells to produce antibodies. When T and B lymphocytes are activated by a specific antigen, they undergo proliferation, producing more cells with their same antigen specificity. This serves to amplify the immune response against the foreign antigen. ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001.

Although no virus has yet been shown to contribute to the etiology of MS, there are several ways in which this could occur, and one of these is shown in this figure. Activated T cells cross the blood-brain barrier following activation by a microbe with a structural similarity to a component of the myelin sheath. Once inside the brain, these cells attack self-antigens, such as the various myelin proteins that are attacked in MS. NOTE: MBP = myelin basic protein. SOURCE: Steinman and Oldstone, 1997.

The key features of this cascade are not fully understood, including the precise ordering of events, the antigens targeted by T cells, and the contributions of B lymphocytes, or B cells, and other cells of the immune system. Yet, as this section explains, much insight has been gained into the immunopathology of MS. This knowledge has been—and continues to be—fundamental for devising therapies targeted to the immunopathology of MS (). ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001. Multiple Sclerosis: Current Status and Strategies for the Future. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. As much as a century ago, researchers observed that T cells were particularly abundant in MS lesions. Over time, using modern immunologic techniques, they managed to isolate and characterize a particular type of T cell, the autoreactive T cell, from the blood and CSF of MS patients. These and related findings gave credence to the hypothesis that autoreactive T cells played a dominant role in MS. After all, immunologists have long known that T cells are capable of orchestrating a multifaceted autoimmune attack. However, this was not enough to explain MS pathology. First, elevations in certain types of autoreactive T cells were not unique to MS patients. Second, and more critically, T cells were necessary but not sufficient to cause demyelinating disease in animal models. The transfer of myelin-specific T cells into normal animals initiated only inflammation, not demyelination. This suggested that other immune cells, particularly antibody-producing B cells () and macrophages, might also play key roles, even if autoreactive T cells launched the process.

Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. The prime autoantigen that elicits the autoimmune response in MS is not known. While there are many candidate autoantigens, as yet none is preeminent. Much MS research focused on myelin basic protein (MBP), located at the inner surface of the myelin membrane. Clinical studies were shaped by research on experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE), the classic animal model of demyelinating disease. In many species, MBP acts as a classical encephalitogenic autoantigen (an antigen capable of serving as the focus of an inflammatory attack in the brain). EAE research further established that in some strains of mice and rats, the autoimmune response to MBP displays two unique features. First, in the initial stages of the immune response in EAE, T cells react only to very small regions of the MBP molecule (“epitope dominance”), even though they later react to many more regions of the molecule (“epitope spreading”) (see ). Second, the encephalitogenic T cells in EAE use an unusually narrow repertoire of genes for their antigen receptors. (T cells recognize their target antigen by its capacity to bind to specific receptors on their surface membrane, called T-cell receptors [TCRs]). These two features raised hopes for developing immune-based therapies because a more limited range of therapies might succeed in combating MS in early stages. Unfortunately, these features turned out to be much less prominent in humans with MS. First, human T cells respond to a broader set of MBP epitopes. While there might be a relatively dominant epitope in the central portion of the MBP molecule, there are clearly many other target epitopes along the full sequence of this large polypeptide. Second, MBP-specific T cells use multiple genes for their TCRs, which allows for large variability among individuals. Generally, it appears that the T-cell response against myelin proteins differs greatly between individual patients, a property that suggests the potential need for individually designed immune therapies. Several research teams have attempted to identify MBP-specific T cells in MS patients. Unfortunately, these attempts did not show significant increases in MBP-specific T-cell counts in MS patients compared to healthy blood donors. However, when more definitive assay systems were used, increased frequencies of activated MBP-specific T cells were found in MS patients. These studies relied on complex methods and were influenced by numerous factors that complicate the interpretation of results. More direct assays, such as those that use binding of oligomeric class II-peptide complexes to specific T cells, might resolve the problem. To add a further degree of complexity, MBP does not appear to be the only autoantigen in MS: there are a number of additional myelin and nonmyelin proteins that are potential autoantigens in MS. Earlier hypotheses had implicated MBP on the basis of two lines of research. First, studies of EAE had suggested that MBP was indeed the most important, if not the only, encephalitogenic myelin autoantigen. Second, due to its particularly convenient molecular properties, MBP was the only myelin protein available both at high purity and in large ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001. Multiple Sclerosis: Current Status and Strategies for the Future. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. quantities. However, thanks to modern biotechnology, even minor myelin proteins are now available in large quantities and can be studied for their encephalitogenic capacity. Later studies established that many, if not all, myelin proteins are potentially encephalitogenic. Especially interesting among these newly recognized autoantigens is myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG). In contrast to MBP, which lies on the inside of the myelin sheath, MOG lies on the surface. As one of the few myelin proteins accessible to humoral autoantibodies, MOG is a target for demyelinating immunoglobulins (see next section). In addition, MOG is a very effective autoantigen in rodents and in primates for encephalitogenic T cells. Some studies even demonstrated increased frequencies of MOG-reactive T cells in MS patients. These findings clearly warrant general confirmation. It is also important to investigate whether different subtypes of MS, which are distinguished by divergent clinical, genetic, and morphological features, are associated with enhanced T-cell responses against different target autoantigens. Thus far, research has spotlighted one class of T cells—those with a TCR termed Î±Î². Î±Î² T cells are the major class of immune cells centrally involved in adaptive immune responses against infections and tumors. Much less attention has been given to other T-cell classes (Î³Î´ T cells and NK1 T cells), which may function both as effector cells in autoimmune attacks and as suppressor cells that dampen autoimmune responses. There are reports linking the presence of Î³Î´ T cells in the brain (presumably) with the induction of heat shock proteins in MS lesions. Certain members of this broad class of proteins are a normal component of the myelin sheath, yet they are also found outside the CNS as well as in pathogens. The role of heat shock proteins in the development of the MS lesion is unknown, but there are various possibilities. Some of these proteins might act as a target autoantigen, as has been shown in autoimmune diabetes. They might also reflect inflammatory stress inflicted on local CNS cells, or they might be determinants of beneficial anti-inflammatory control mechanisms. Even though the precise pathological roles of T cells and their autoantigens are unresolved, this line of research has generated many approved or emerging therapies. These include vaccination strategies, which use either attenuated myelinspecific T cells or peptides representing myelin-specific T-cell receptors as vaccines to strengthen the body's own regulatory responses against pathogenic T cells (reviewed in Zhang et. al., 1998). Also under development are “altered peptide” therapies that use peptide analogues of myelin protein segments to induce autoreactive T cells to produce protective, rather than pathogenic, cytokine mediators. Cytokines, as discussed later, are a functionally diverse set of signaling molecules produced by T cells. *Each (Î± and Î²) refers to a polypeptide chain that forms the T-cell receptor. ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001. Multiple Sclerosis: Current Status and Strategies for the Future. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. B cells (also known as B lymphocytes) have been detected in MS lesions for many years, although less consistently than T cells. While most MS research naturally focused on T cells, evidence also has accumulated for participation by autoreactive B cells. It now appears that both types of lymphocytes actively contribute to MS immunopathology. Autoreactive T cells are thought to launch inflammation and, through their release of cytokines, to stimulate B cells to secrete antibodies that cause demyelination. This is consistent with animal studies finding that EAE can be produced only by injecting myelin-specific T cells in combination with myelin-specific antibodies. Without injecting the antibodies, demyelination does not occur. In MS patients, levels in cerebrospinal fluid of the type of protein known to consist of antibodies (immunoglobulin) are often higher than in healthy people. The increased immunoglobulin is due to production by only a few different clones of B cells that have been induced to proliferate. B cells from the CSF of MS patients have been reported to contain mutations in the DNA sequences that encode antibodies, which is consistent with the notion of an antigen-driven selection of antibodies with high-affinity antigen-binding sites. Such events are commonly observed in immune responses against foreign antigens such as bacterial infections, as well as in humoral autoimmune responses. However, no foreign antigen or autoantigen responsible for the generation of oligoclonal bands in MS has yet been identified. One recent study using sophisticated immunocytochemistry furnished direct evidence of a pathologic role for autoantibodies. For the first time, MOG-specific antibodies were demonstrated to be bound to myelin debris in active MS lesions. If confirmed and extended to a larger group of patients, this finding would suggest that B-cell-derived autoantibodies might induce myelin destruction. On the other hand, although anti-MOG antibodies are found in the CSF of MS patients, they are also found in CSF of patients with other neurological diseases that are not demyelinating. Thus, despite tantalizing leads, the role of anti-MOG antibodies in MS patients is still unclear. Cytokines are soluble proteins produced and released by T cells, macrophages, and certain other cell types. Interferons (IFN- Î±, Î², and Î³), interleukins (including IL- 1, 4, 6, 10, 12, and 13), TGF-b, and the neuropoietic cytokines (such as ciliary neurotrophic factor and leukemia inhibitory factor) are all different types of cytokines. They generally act as intercellular signaling molecules that regulate *Neuropoietic cytokines are the family of neural growth factors that act on both the nervous and the hematopoietic or immune systems.

Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. and carry out immune functions, but their repertoire is complex. Some function as pro-inflammatory, others as anti-inflammatory agents. Some even have divergent functions during different phases of disease. Cytokines, including the subset known as chemokines (for ), also alter the permeability of the blood-brain barrier or act on neural cells. Thus, particular cytokines can initiate, sustain, or terminate inflammatory disease processes. Proinflammatory cytokines and other secretory products of immune cells are proposed in several neurological diseases—including MS—to be toxic to neurons and oligodendrocytes if they are secreted in sufficiently high concentrations over a sustained period of time. In MS, the initial entry of autoreactive T cells into the CNS is thought to trigger the local production of cytokines and chemokines, which in turn begins the inflammatory process and enhances the permeability of the blood-brain barrier. A more permeable blood-brain barrier allows infiltration into the CNS of more immune cells which in turn contribute to the ongoing inflammation. Thus, understanding the roles of cytokines and their temporal sequence of activation is crucial to modifying the course of MS. Much of our present understanding of cytokine action in demyelinating disease comes from studies of animal models, including EAE. A large body of research is being compiled on the expression and possible function of cytokines as pro- and anti-inflammatory mediators in MS. Some studies have used in situ immunocytochemistry and in situ hybridization to visualize gene expression in lesions, whereas others have relied on the activation of inflammatory cells (T cells, B cells, macrophages) in vitro. Much of the research is comparing material from MS patients with or without treatment with immunomodulatory agents, especially glatiramer acetate and beta-interferon. Pro-inflammatory cytokines within active MS lesions have been localized to both infiltrating immune cells and glia. Longitudinal studies have linked clinical exacerbation and remission to high and low expression, respectively, of proinflammatory cytokines, especially TNF-Î³. For example, secretion of TNF-Î³ and cell adhesion molecules by inflammatory cells is upregulated immediately prior to relapse. Yet, not all findings could be verified in all patient groups studied. Understanding of cytokines and their diverse roles throughout the course of disease, although still incomplete, has nevertheless spawned new treatments. One explanation for the success of glatiramer acetate and beta-interferon relates to their control over cytokine expression: they can induce T cells to switch from a pro-inflammatory phenotype (Th1) to an anti-inflammatory phenotype (Th2). T cells that are switched to an anti-inflammatory phenotype release a variety of cytokines, such as IL-10, that reduce inflammation. CNS. CNS tissues were traditionally thought to be exempt from active immune reactivity, but it is now known ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001. Multiple Sclerosis: Current Status and Strategies for the Future. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. that the brain is subject to immune surveillance and can be the site of immune responses. Only activated and not resting T cells can cross the blood-brain barrier and interact with local CNS cells. Local glial cells can be stimulated by proinflammatory cytokines to express immunologically active molecules, such as the major histocompatability complex (MHC) products, cytokines, and chemokines required for local immune responses. Neurons are capable of suppressing immune responses within the CNS. Thus, immune responses are more likely to occur in areas of neuronal degeneration than in intact CNS tissues. Immune reactivity within the CNS must hence be viewed as the balance between the proinflammatory signals contributed by activated T cells and other inflammatory cells entering the brain and the anti-inflammatory signals from functional neurons. Epidemiologists define what causes a disease and what puts an individual at risk of getting this disease. They look for correlations such as whether Caucasians are more likely to have MS than Asians or whether residents of one county are more likely to get MS than residents of another. These correlations lead to hypotheses or working models as to which factors actually cause MS and which are only associated with it. These hypotheses or models can then be tested experimentally. Epidemiological studies have limitations, but for a complex disease like MS, they can rule out some factors and highlight others. They are the first step toward finding a biological mechanism for MS, or possibly a cure. Most epidemiological studies of MS have been observational and retrospective; researchers collected the information (for example, ethnicity, age of onset) from an individual (or from records) that had been diagnosed with MS. Such studies rely on an individual's ability to accurately recall information from years ago, for example, the infections that she or he had before the age of five. Other sources of data, such as death certificates, can contain incorrect information. Despite these shortcomings, a few factors consistently correlate with MS prevalence. Determining how these factors lead to an increased risk of MS has proven more difficult. The risk of MS increases with increasing distance from the equator. In the United States, this is seen as a gradient of risk, with higher risk in northern regions and a lower risk in the south. In Australia, the prevalence of MS increases similarly from lower, subequatorial latitudes to the more southerly latitudes. Studies on migrating populations, although inconclusive, offer tentative support for the hypothesis that environment influences MS risk. Individuals who have moved from a region with one risk level to a region with a higher or lower risk, in general, adopt the risk level of their new home. This is especially true for individuals moving from a low-risk to a high-risk area. Studies carried out in the 1960s and 1970s suggested that this geographical effect had a defined susceptibility period before age 15. Although these data still ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001. Multiple Sclerosis: Current Status and Strategies for the Future. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. appear in the MS literature and have led to several hypotheses about the effects of puberty or early dietary effects on MS risk, the sample numbers are too small to support such a tight cutoff. A later and larger study assayed the effects of migration by comparing location at birth with location at approximately 24 years of age. Although individuals did adopt the risk of their new home, the age values in that study are not precise enough to add to the argument for or against a cutoff. Most recently, a study comparing the prevalence of MS among native-born Australians and Australian immigrants from the United Kingdom (thereby providing a rough control for genetic background) suggests that rather than being established around age 15, environmental risk factors operate over many years and into early adulthood. Although the migrational studies suggest an environmental correlation with MS, the root cause of this latitude effect is unknown. Differences in diet or sunlight have been proposed, but neither has been supported by rigorous studies. Alternatively, the geographical distribution of MS could result from the migration either of a viral agent or of individuals (perhaps originally Scandinavians) who carried a pool of susceptible genes. Ethnicity is another definite risk factor. MS is more prevalent among Caucasians than other groups. In a study of 5,305 U.S. veterans with MS, Caucasian males had twice the risk of MS as African-American males. Other factors can modulate the effect of ethnicity on risk of MS. MS is almost absent among black Africans. African Americans, however, show a low risk of MS; this might be due to genetic mixing with Caucasian Americans or to an environmental effect. MS occurrence among Asians is also quite low. Again, Asian Americans show an intermediate risk for MS between Asians and Caucasian Americans. A discussion of the role of genetics in MS can be found in the next section. When applied to a complex disorder such as MS, conclusions derived from epidemiologic data of this type must be interpreted cautiously because inapparent explanations may be present. For example, a higher-than-expected incidence of MS observed in South Vietnamese immigrants (a low-risk group) residing in France (a moderate-risk area) superficially suggest a modifying role of the environment on MS. However, this immigrant population was in fact racially mixed and contained substantial numbers of individuals with mixed French and Asian ancestry. Thus, the higher-than-expected MS incidence in these immigrants could have been due to either genetic or environmental factors. Neither factor can be ruled out. A similar argument could explain the incidence of MS in West Indian immigrants residing in Great Britain. On the other hand, the increased incidence of MS observed in Japanese-Americans compared to individuals residing in Japan is not easily explained by racial admixture and does support a role of the environment on MS risk. As in other autoimmune diseases, women are much more likely to get MS than men, suggesting that hormonal or genetic factors are involved. The ratio of women to men with MS is about 2:1. Among both sexes, the age of onset for ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001. Multiple Sclerosis: Current Status and Strategies for the Future. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. MS ranges between 10 and 59 years, with the highest incidence occurring among individuals in their mid-20s to early 30s, depending on the population examined. Males tend to have a slightly later mean age of onset than females. This results, at least in part, from an increase in the percentage of males with the primary progressive variant. This form of MS has a later onset than other types and affects approximately 15 percent of patients. The ratio of males to females with primary progressive MS is approximately 1:1. Epidemiological studies have provided conflicting data as to whether an infectious agent (viral or bacterial) either causes or triggers MS. The occurrence of MS epidemics has suggested that an infectious agent might be at work. The two MS epidemics cited most often, one in the Faroe Islands and one in Iceland, were directly preceded by the influx of foreign troops during World War II. Both, however, are open to multiple interpretations. Coincident with the stationing of foreign soldiers, the population of the Faroe Islands received increased medical services and changed its diet. The Icelandic epidemic, on the other hand, began shortly after the arrival of that island's first neurologist. In both cases, the increased prevalence of MS might have resulted from an increased level of detection or a combination of other factors, such as nonspecific immune stimulation resulting from the introduction of a variety of infectious agents into previously unexposed populations. No infectious agent has been associated with either of these MS clusters. Another area of investigation has explored whether environmental factors contribute to the onset of MS or the probability of MS attacks. Some studies suggest that MS attacks are more likely to occur in the spring and fall than in the winter or summer. Such a finding, if true, suggests that a relationship exists between some viral infections and the risk of exacerbations. Many patients with MS are also at heightened risk for urinary tract, pulmonary, or skin infections, yet the relationship between these potentially preventable infections and the course of MS has never been adequately studied. Additional research in this area is needed. Perhaps the most clear-cut epidemiologic link to MS attacks is the effect of pregnancy and the postpartum period. Pregnancy is associated with a decrease in the risk for MS attacks, particularly during the third trimester. The postpartum period is, conversely, associated with a significant increase in risk. An immunosuppressive state in the pregnant mother is created by increased numbers of regulatory T cells (Th2 cells) which, presumably, dampen the autoimmune reaction that produces attacks of MS. The explanation for the increase in attack risk during the postpartum period is less clear but might involve immunostimulation by prolactin, the hormone responsible for milk production. The absence of supporting evidence does not prove that a virus is connected with the disease. Unrelated individuals (in the case of the adoptee and conjugal studies) may differ in their susceptibilities to infectious agents. Researchers have isolated a variety of viruses from individual MS patients, but to ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001. Multiple Sclerosis: Current Status and Strategies for the Future. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. date, no one virus has been isolated from all MS patients examined. It might, however, be the case either that MS is not one single disease or that there are multiple ways to trigger it. Researchers continue to look for causative infectious agents. (See section below on infectious causes of MS for further discussion.) The aggregation of MS in some geographic areas, ethnic populations, or families could be explained by a common environmental exposure, a shared genetic background, or a combination of both environmental and genetic susceptibility. It is likely that in MS, as in other complex disorders, both factors contribute. It is also possible that the relative contributions of environment versus genetics might vary in different situations, depending on the degree to which an individual is genetically susceptible and the specific environmental context. The role of genetic factors in MS is discussed in the next section. MS is not considered a genetic disease in the classic sense because it usually occurs sporadically. However, population and family studies are consistent with a principal pathogenic role for genetic risk factors in MS etiology. This genetic component is indicated primarily by the increased relative risk to siblings of affected individuals compared with the general population. Familial aggregation (Î»s) is measured by estimating the ratio of the prevalence (frequency) in siblings versus the population prevalence of the disease. A Î»s of 1 represents no familial clustering of the trait. For MS, the Î»s is estimated to be between 20 (0.02/0.001) and 40 (0.04/0.001). Half-sibling1 and adoption studies confirm that genetic, and not environmental, factors are responsible for familial aggregation. In addition, twin studies from different populations consistently indicate that a monozygotic twin of an MS patient is at higher risk (25 to 30 percent concordance) for MS than a dizygotic twin (2 to 5 percent), providing additional evidence for a significant but complex genetic etiology. Finally, the frequent occurrence of MS in some ethnic populations (particularly those of northern European origin) compared to others (African and Asian groups), irrespective of geographic location, also provides evidence for a complex genetic etiology. Overall, adoption and family studies suggest that being related to a person with MS is a greater risk factor than living with someone with MS. A simple genetic model for the inheritance of MS is unlikely to be valid. Such a single-gene hypothesis is at odds with concordance data in twin and family studies and with the observed nonlinear decrease in disease risk as the genetic distance from the relative with MS is increased. It is likely that susceptibility is determined by multiple independent genetic loci (polygenic inheritance), each with a relatively modest contribution to overall risk. It is also possible that there are different genetic causes of susceptibility to MS (genetic heterogeneity). Finally, the genes that contribute to MS susceptibility are likely to be normal, common variants (or alleles) of genes rather than obviously defective mutations. ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001. Multiple Sclerosis: Current Status and Strategies for the Future. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. Most individuals who carry such susceptibility genes would have no obvious deleterious consequences. For example, the DR2 gene (described below) is the most important genetic contributor to MS susceptibility identified to date. Approximately half of patients with MS have this gene, but so do 15 to 20 percent of healthy Caucasians. Thus, only approximately 1 in 250 people who have DR2 develop MS. The cumulative action of several susceptibility genes, each with weak effects and limited penetrance, is thought to underlie genetic susceptibility to MS. (Penetrance refers to the likelihood that a person carrying an allele will develop specific manifestations caused by that gene.) The effects of individual susceptibility genes may also be influenced by interactions with other genes and by specific environmental exposures. Locus heterogeneity is also likely, meaning that there are different susceptibility genes in different MS patients. The possibility that MS is a heterogeneous disease with different causes or pathological processes adds an additional level of complexity to the analysis. In addition to MS, similar issues are present in other autoimmune diseases such as diabetes mellitus that are genetically complex, and common research tools will be needed to decipher specific disease genes in these different conditions. The genetic region most clearly associated with MS susceptibility is the major histocompatibility complex (MHC, or HLA [human leukocyte antigen] in humans) locus on the short arm of chromosome 6 (6p21) (). This association has been seen in different population studies that have relied primarily on sporadic patients. Formal genetic linkage to 6p has also been found in several recent whole-genome scans of multiple affected MS families. Many of the MHC genes are extraordinarily variable or polymorphic, reflecting the importance of genetic variation of these critical antigen-presenting molecules in the maintenance of a heterozygous advantage and the need to effectively present a diverse array of antigens if immune homeostasis is to be maintained. Immune homeostasis refers to the capacity of the immune system to respond appropriately to a diverse number of infectious pathogens and tumors without initiating unhealthy responses against self-constituents (auto- The major histocompatibility complex is a chromosomal region that contains more than 100 genes, many of which make proteins involved in the immune system. It is named for the role it plays in rejecting tissue transplants ( means tissue). In humans, this region resides on chromosome 6 and is called the human leukocyte antigen gene complex. The terminology is slightly confusing because ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001. Multiple Sclerosis: Current Status and Strategies for the Future. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. MHC and HLA also refer to the proteins that some of these genes make. In this report, the term “MHC molecules” is used to indicate the proteins. The role of the immune system is to differentiate between self and non-self. This allows it to tell the difference between, for example, muscle tissue (self) and an invading virus (non-self) and to respond appropriately. To do this, the immune system relies on several different proteins that specifically bind antigens. This process is analogous to a lock and key. The “lock” is an antibody, a T-cell receptor, or an MHC molecule. The “key” is an antigen, which can be a carbohydrate, lipid, nucleic acid, or protein—anything that binds specifically to a component of the immune system. This discussion focuses on T-cell receptors and MHC molecules. T-cell receptors sit on the surface of T cells and bind to antigens outside the cell. (In the case of T-cell receptors and MHC molecules, antigens are small protein fragments.) Binding to an antigen signals the T cell either to die, to do nothing, or to become active. The signal context, such as whether the antigen is self or non-self, determines which of these signals is relayed. However the T cell cannot bind the antigen alone. It needs the help of an MHC molecule. MHC molecules sit on the surface of other cells. The MHC molecule, like two outstretched arms, holds onto an antigen and presents it to a T-cell receptor. There are two major classes of MHC molecules. MHC I molecules, which are expressed on most cell types, present antigens to CD8+ T cells. MHC II molecules, which are expressed on special antigen presenting cells (APCs), present antigens to CD4+ T cells. In humans, there are three main class I molecules, HLA-A, HLA-B, and HLA-C, and three main class II molecules, HLA-DP, HLA-DQ, HLA-DR. Each arm of the MHC molecule is made up of a separate protein. In the case of MHC I molecules, there is an Î±-chain (A, B, or C) that pairs with the protein b2microglobulin. An MHC II molecule is made up of an Î±-chain and a Î²-chain (for example, DP-Î± and DP-Î²), but the story becomes more complex. Each MHC molecule can bind many but not all of the thousands of antigens that confront the immune system. The immune system relies on diversity among the MHC proteins to help stack the odds in its favor. The gene for each MHC protein chain comes in different varieties, or alleles. One of the MHC Î²-chains has more than 150 alleles. Each of these alleles produces a slightly different protein. The proteins vary just enough that although they all function as MHC proteins, they can bind different antigens. Any one person will have two alleles, at most, for a particular MHC protein (there are two copies of each gene in human cells), but across a population of individuals, this variety becomes more important. For example, in Gambia, West Africa, 25 percent of HLA-B genes are the HLA-B53 allele, compared to less than 1 percent in Europe. HLA-B53 is very effective at presenting an antigen from the parasite that causes malaria to CD8+ T cells. Researchers hypothesize that because HLA-B53 can protect people from the most severe forms of malaria, it is more prevalent in Gambia. Having a particular MHC allele can also be a disadvantage, as researchers have shown in the case of HLA-DR2 and MS. (HLA-DR2 actually designates both a specific DR-a chain allele and a DR-b chain allele.) Scientists still do not understand how HLA-DR2 predisposes individuals to MS, but this might have to do with the MHC molecule's ability to present specific antigens (for example, a fragment of myelin basic protein) to T cells.

Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. immune responses). In Caucasian MS populations of northern European descent, the critical MS-associated genetic region is thought to reside near the class II locus and is comprised of a group of genes with specific polymorphisms (alleles) that tend to occur in certain fixed combinations, termed haplotypes. In molecular terms, the “DR2” haplotype is designated as HLA-DRB1*1501, DQA1*0102, DQB1*0602. DR molecules are comprised of alpha and beta chains (encoded by A and B genes, respectively), and the polymorphisms are predominantly present in the beta chain. Of the more than 100 beta-chain sequence variations identified in humans, only one (1501, also designated as DR2) is associated with MS. How can the DR2 association with MS be explained? The DR2 molecule itself may have a propensity to bind peptide antigens of myelin and stimulate disease-inducing T cells. DR2 is known to bind with high affinity to a region of MBP (spanning amino acids 89-98) thought to be “immunodominant” in humans. X-ray crystallography of the DR2-MBP peptide complex revealed that the DR2 molecule contains a distinctive hydrophobic pocket in its antigen-binding region, created by a unique alanine residue at the B71 position into which glutamic acid at position 93 of MBP is tightly bound, anchoring the MBP-DR2 complex. In a larger sense, the structure of the antigen-binding domain of DR2 molecules likely facilitates binding of many peptides containing certain amino acid residues, specifically aromatic amino acids. Glatiramer acetate (copolymer 1), a currently available disease-modifying therapy for MS, is a random synthetic protein composed of four amino acids, including tyrosine. The tyrosine residues of processed copolymer peptides likely also bind to the hydrophobic pocket of DR2, perhaps interfering with presentation of this key MBP peptide to encephalitogenic T cells. It is surprising that no data exist on the interaction of DR2 and the response to glatiramer acetate in MS. Another possibility is that the DR2 molecule does not itself predispose to MS but that another nearby gene (perhaps another HLA gene such as DQ) is responsible. DR2 is also linked to other diseases. Besides MS, narcolepsy is the disease most strongly linked to DR2. In various studies, the HLA region has been estimated to confer somewhere between 10 percent and half of the inheritability of MS. To date, no other genes of major effect have been identified in genomic screens. Several studies appear to demonstrate that a deletion mutation in the CCR5 chemokine receptor gene (a coreceptor for HIV) on chromosome 3 confers a later age of onset or a more benign course of MS; this mutation is also associated with protection against HIV. This is particularly important because the expression of CCR5, which is increased in MS brain lesions, is thought to attract inflammatory cells into tissue. Another locus on chromosome 19q22 near apolipoprotein C1 has been linked to MS in several genomic screens, but the estimated Î»s is only 1.4. A polymorphism near the gene for myelin basic protein on chromosome 21 was reported to be linked to MS in a family from Finland, but not in other populations. Some studies have suggested linkages or ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001. Multiple Sclerosis: Current Status and Strategies for the Future. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. associations with the TCR beta-chain locus on chromosome 7, the immunoglobulin heavy-chain locus on chromosome 14, and a region on chromosome 5, but others have not found similar linkages. The inability to confirm some genetic regions as containing MS susceptibility genes might reflect the small genetic contribution of these putative genes or genetic heterogeneity; alternatively, the original claim might have been spurious. As noted above, it is likely that an additive model consisting of multiple independent genes, each with small effects, explains the non-MHC genetic contributions to MS. It should be emphasized, however, that the identification of specific genes that have even very minor genetic effects on MS can have an enormous payoff, both in terms of helping to decipher the underlying biology of MS and in pointing to new potential treatments. For example, the genetic studies discussed earlier that identified a role for the CCR5 chemokine receptor suggest that therapies aimed at this receptor could be investigated in people with MS. Perhaps the strongest indication that MS is a heterogeneous disorder comes from HLA studies showing an absence of DR2 association in particular ethnic groups or perhaps in some clinical variants. In Japanese patients, one form of MS (“Western type”) is characterized by disseminated CNS involvement and is associated with the DR2 haplotype. In contrast, a more restricted form of MS in which optic nerve and/or spinal cord involvement predominate (“Asian MS”) is not associated with DR2. Lesions in the non-DR2-associated condition are frequently more severe and necrotizing than in the disseminated form. In one report, the Asian MS form was genetically associated with an HLA gene named DP (the DPB1*0501 allele). Another area of uncertainty is the strength of the association between primary progressive MS (PPMS) and DR2. A number of (relatively) small studies failed to show any association between PPMS and DR2, although a recent larger study from northern Ireland appeared to show an association; it is possible that PPMS represents more than one underlying disorder. Evidence for genetic heterogeneity is not limited to case-control HLA association studies but is also derived from formal linkage studies. Analysis of the MHC locus in an American multiple affected member MS data set confirmed the significant genetic linkage to this region (lod score of 4.60), and the specific association with the DR2 allele; however 25 percent of the families that were DR2 negative showed no linkage to the HLA region on 6p21. This indicated most likely the presence of locus heterogeneity in familial MS in Caucasians. A related *Lod scores are based on the ogarithm of the ds of linkage between two genes. A score of 3 or more is considered evidence of a genetic linkage between a known gene (or gene marker) and another unknown gene that underlies a trait (such as MS). That information thus indicates that the trait has a genetic basis and localizes the gene to a specific chromosomal region. ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001. Multiple Sclerosis: Current Status and Strategies for the Future. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. observation in MS-prone Caucasian families is that the phenotypic expression of MS aggregates within families in some cases, suggesting that some clinical manifestations of MS are influenced by an individual's genetic background. The extent to which distinct clinical forms of MS are associated with different susceptibility genes, as may be the case in EAE (see discussion of animal models), is not known. Also unknown is whether specific genes interact with certain causative agents or triggers. Genetic studies have the potential to answer these questions, particularly when the information is analyzed in combination with epidemiologic, clinical, and neuroimaging data. There are several human and animal diseases of known etiology or pathogenesis that resemble either the clinical or the pathological features of MS (). Animal diseases that resemble MS are discussed under animal models. CNS demyelinating diseases include those mediated by immune responses, infection, and toxins, as well as inherited disorders. Infectious agents can induce direct injury of oligodendrocytes and their myelin membranes, as well as indirect injury via the immune system. A variety of toxins, such as diphtheria, lysolecithin, cuprizone, and ethidium bromide, have been associated with demyelinating lesions. Many of these toxins induce lysis of the oligodendrocyte, with demyelination as a secondary effect. In addition, nutritional deprivation can be associated with demyelination in the central and peripheral nervous system. Immune-Mediated and Virus-Induced CNS Demyelinating Diseases Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM), also known as post vaccination encephalomyelitis, occurs as a consequence of vaccination with neural antigens. EAE, the most widely used animal model of MS, is the animal counterpart of this human disease. ADEM is characterized pathologically by widespread perivenular inflammation and demyelination. The uniformity of lesions differs from the multi-age lesions found in even the most acute case of MS. Post vaccination immune-mediated damage can also affect the peripheral nervous system. Since there is no standard laboratory-based test to diagnose the human disorder, the most reliable descriptions of the clinical spectrum of the disease are derived from collections of cases in which epidemiologic and statistical studies support the association of a triggering stimulus and disease. Such criteria are best met by cases associated with immunization with CNS tissue containing vaccines, for example, original Pasteur rabies vaccine. This vaccine complication can occur at all ages. A clinical hallmark of the rabies vaccine-associated form of ADEM is its uniphasic course evolving over days to several weeks. ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001. Multiple Sclerosis: Current Status and Strategies for the Future. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. CNS Demyelinating Diseases That Resemble MS ADEM is characterized pathologically by widespread perivenular inflammation and demyelination. Multifocal CNS lesions can occur as a component of an array of systemic collagen vascular disorders including systemic lupus eryhemtosus and polyarteritis nodosa. The CNS manifestations may be the presenting feature. The peripheral nervous system is also frequently involved. PML is caused by the JC virus, which infects and destroys oligodendrocytes with minimal associated immune response. It typically occurs in immunosuppressed or immunocompromised individuals and is common in AIDS. The disease can feature a subacute progressive or relapsing clinical course. The imaging and pathologic features can be distinguished from classical MS. HTLV-1 (human T-cell lymphotropic virus type I) infection is sometimes associated with a neurological syndrome called HTLV-1-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP). Patients with HAM/TSP have a progressive myelopathy, usually with spastic paraparesis, sensory disturbance, bladder dysfunction, and occasionally, optic neuritis. These inherited disorders are characterized by specific gene defects that result in either inadequate formation or excess breakdown of myelin. There may be a prominent inflammatory response in the region of myelin breakdown, but this is considered to be secondary to tissue breakdown. To date, therapeutic attempts with immunomodulatory agents in the leukodystrophies, specifically, adrenoleukodystrophy, have been ineffective. Toxic optic neuropathy, subacute myelo-optic neuropathy (SMON) Outbreaks of toxic optic neuropathy and SMON have been described in Cuba and in Japan.11,12,99 Sporadic cases of toxic optic neuropathy likely account for the disorder tobacco-alcohol amblyopia. Conversely, one need consider whether deficiency syndromes could underlie development of demyelinating syndromes; deficiency of vitamin B12, a cofactor in myelin formation, has also been implicated. ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001. Multiple Sclerosis: Current Status and Strategies for the Future. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. ADEM, or postinfectious encephalomyelitis, has been implicated as a consequence of a wide array of viral infections, although for many, the epidemiologic data are not strong enough to support a causal link. Measles virus epidemics have, however, been convincingly linked to ADEM. Postinfectious encephalomyelitis (PIE) is thought to be autoimmune in nature rather than secondary to a direct virus injury for the following reasons: (1) encephalitis appears after the rash clears; (2) there is generally little or no evidence of infectious virus or viral genome in the CNS at the time of the demyelinating disease; and (3) there is evidence of increased reactivity against myelin antigens during the demyelinating disease. Postinfectious encephalomyelitis is generally uniphasic. Immune system disturbances, which are known to occur following measles virus infection, might underlie the immunopathological response of post-infectious encephalomyelitis. A new direction for studies of PIE involves the possibility of establishing a model for this disease in transgenic mice that express the CD46 measles virus receptor. Molecular cross-reactivity, or molecular mimicry, has been demonstrated between myelin antigens and an array of viruses. Homologous sequences from viruses have been used to induce EAE (for example, hepatitis virus antigens). The extent of T-cell receptor degeneracy (meaning that the same receptor can respond to a wide sequence of peptides) and T-cell receptor heterogeneity in humans suggests that a wide array of exogenous agents could induce such a disease mechanism. As in MS, the putative infectious trigger could be different in individual MS patients depending on their immunogenetic makeup and the status of their immune system at the time of infection. A remaining challenge in MS is to determine whether any infectious agents detected in the CNS of such cases also persist in the CNS without causing harm or whether they are responsible for generating a pathogenic immune response. ADEM cases are usually sporadic, and it is sometimes difficult to identify the initiating factor. Relapsing cases of ADEM have been described, especially in younger-age patients. For some cases, characteristic pathologic material has been available. Similarly, the EAE model can be manipulated to produce a relapsing chronic disorder by selecting animals with specific immunogenetic backgrounds and timing their immunizations so that the underlying systemic immune response is amplified or the blood-brain barrier is altered. Such variables could also determine the nature of the response of humans when they are exposed to potential disease-inducing antigens. JC virus, a member of the papovavirus family, is a common pathogen in humans, although the *JC refers to the initials of the individual from whom the virus was isolated in 1970. ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001. Multiple Sclerosis: Current Status and Strategies for the Future. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. primary disease caused by this virus is not characterized. Common symptoms include hemiparesis, aphasia, focal seizures, and visual disturbances. JC virus is thought to reactivate in immunosuppressed hosts, especially individuals with AIDS, producing the opportunistic infection PML. The disease involves a progressive CNS syndrome with symptoms and signs that suggest white matter involvement. Demyelination is usually most prominent in the occipital lobes of the cerebral hemispheres. The histopathology is characterized by the presence of oligodendrocytes with intranuclear inclusion bodies filled with papovavirus infectious particles, indicating that this disease involves a direct, lytic infection of the oligodendrocyte; that is, the oligodendrocyte is broken apart after being infected with the virus. Enlarged astrocytes are also seen, suggesting that the JC virus can transform these cells. Demyelination is a result of the direct oligodendrocyte infection by JC virus. Thus, in PML the immune response is considered to be protective rather than pathogenic. This retrovirus is common in the tropics as well as Japan, and is usually associated with asymptomatic disease. HTLV-1 infection is infrequently associated with a T-cell leukemia or lymphoma or a neurological syndrome called HTLV-1-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP). Patients with HAM/TSP have a progressive myelopathy usually with spastic paraparesis, sensory disturbance, bladder dysfunction, and occasionally, optic neuritis. The CSF generally shows a lymphocytic pleocytosis with elevated IgG and oligoclonal IgG bands directed against HTLV-1. Necrotizing lesions with inflammation in the white matter are present in the spinal cord. HAM/TSP can resemble MS clinically. In fact, a case of HAM/TSP might be diagnosed as MS if it were not for the presence of HTLV-1 antibody and the observation that the HTLV-1 genome can be detected in the CNS. The pathogenesis of HAM/TSP remains unclear. There are numerous CD8+ T cells that recognize the virus, suggesting that this immune response might foster white matter disease. Infected glial cells are a possible source of inflammatory pathogenic cytokines and might also be the target for these cytolytic T cells. In addition, there is some evidence that molecular mimicry plays a role in disease pathogenesis. Host genetic factors, for example, HLA type, might also be important in determining susceptibility to HAM/TSP after infection. It has not been proven that MS is caused by an infectious agent, but various data, including the inflammatory nature of the disease, epidemiological studies, and a heightened immune response against several pathogens, suggest an infectious etiology (reviewed in 1998 by Kastrukoff et al.). Demyelinating diseases that clinically and pathologically resemble MS can be caused by viral agents or ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001. Multiple Sclerosis: Current Status and Strategies for the Future. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. Koch’s Postulate on Causation of Disease by a Pathogen The pathogen is always present in pathologically affected tissue. It would be rare to consistently isolate a pathogen from all cases of the disease that it causes because of shortcomings in isolation procedures. The pathogen is not present in tissues from controls. Pathogens can have a variety of clinical manifestations, from asymptomatic disease to varied diseases. Host restriction may prevent experimental transmission. immunopathological responses (). Infectious agents might be able to cause demyelination either directly, as a result of oligodendrocyte lysis, or indirectly, by means of an immunopathological response. Demyelination mediated by an immunopathological response can occur by a number of mechanisms. For example, the infectious agent can induce a pathogenic cross-reactive immune response (molecular mimicry), or the release of myelin antigens can stimulate an immune response that is directed against white matter antigens and becomes more broad over time (epitope spreading). (See for a summary of autoimmunity and disease.) There are clear limitations to using classical criteria to implicate a pathogen isolated in MS as a causal agent for the disease, as shown in . These issues make it especially difficult to establish the significance of a positive isolation from tissues of a patient with MS. However, all cases in which an infectious agent causes a disease will clearly not fit standard criteria, and individualization of the requirements is sometimes necessary. Because of these limitations, it is prudent to consider criteria that may be more appropriate and realistic. One could consider the following additional guidelines in analyzing disease causation by a pathogen: consistent transmission or isolation of the pathogen; cure or effective treatment of the disease following elimination of the pathogen; absence of the disease in geographic regions where the pathogen is not present. It may also be appropriate to consider particular molecular signatures related either to the genes of the pathogen or to the transcription expression profile associated with a particular pathogen. Many pathogens have been implicated over the years as etiological agents in MS (). ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001. Multiple Sclerosis: Current Status and Strategies for the Future. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. Agents Isolated or Implicated in the Etiology of MS Some of these claims have been doubted for the following reasons: contamination (for example, spirochete), artifacts of isolation methods (for example, simian cytomegalovirus), and normal flora (for example, herpes simplex-1 [HSV-1]). Although some of these agents are clearly capable of inducing a CNS demyelinating syndrome that resembles MS, it remains uncertain whether particular cases in which a pathogen is isolated represent a rare MS-like case or whether the pathogen may actually be a common cause of MS. There are various possible explanations of why so many pathogens have been isolated in MS but no single pathogen has been consistently observed. First, there might be a variety of pathogens that can independently cause MS (i.e., the disease is multifactorial), perhaps inducing heterogeneous forms of the disease. Second, MS might not be an infectious disease. The isolations of different pathogens might all be artifactual or related to rare events associated with a particular pathogen. Third, the relationship of the pathogen to MS might be a relatively minor one, possibly through interactions with genetic factors. Finally, the true pathogen might not yet have been identified. Thus far, there is inadequate evidence to either accept or reject suggestions that any particular pathogen is causally related to MS. A variety of members of the herpes group of viruses (for example, simian cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, HSV-1, and human herpesvirus-6 [HHV-6]) have been implicated in the etiology of MS. Members of this group of viruses remain attractive candidates as etiologic agents in MS since they are common pathogens that are known to persist and reactivate from a latent stage (and therefore could trigger the attacks and remissions seen in MS) and in some cases can induce focal demyelination in animals (see discussion of animal models of virus-induced demyelination). The most recent herpesvirus candidate to generate attention is HHV-6. HHV-6, a common pathogen, is the cause of the childhood disease, roseola (exanthem subitem). This virus is associated with febrile seizures in children, can invade the CNS, and can persist in peripheral blood mononuclear cells and the spinal fluid. In some cases, HHV-6 induces an MS-like disease, which raises the issue ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001. Multiple Sclerosis: Current Status and Strategies for the Future. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. of its broader involvement in MS. Some recent studies of HHV-6 have found no or rare evidence of HHV-6 genome in MS CSF (as well as little, if any, evidence of genome from several other members of the herpesvirus group). One recent study reported that there was an increased incidence of HHV-6 (as well as HSV and varicella-zoster virus) genome in CNS tissue from MS cases compared to tissues from controls; however, the differences were not statistically significant (see Sanders). Some investigators have argued that the cell type that is infected by HHV-6 differs in MS CNS compared to controls and, therefore, that the virus plays a role in the pathogenesis of MS. The interpretation of HHV-6 studies may be complicated because HHV-6 infection and the localization of the virus may be altered secondary to inflammation associated with MS or to immunosuppressive treatment of MS patients; therefore, a change in localization of HHV-6 in MS CNS compared to control CNS may be unrelated to any pathogenic role of HHV-6 in MS. Although HHV-6 may not induce the white matter lesions of MS, it remains a possibility that HHV-6 contributes to the demyelination seen in some cases of MS. The recent identification of CD46 as a cellular receptor for HHV-6 and the availability of transgenic mice that carry CD46 provide an opportunity to develop an experimental model of HHV-6-induced CNS disease pathogenesis. A recent study found that CSF from MS patients was culture-positive for and PCR (polymerase chain reaction)-positive for this agent more commonly than CSF from patients with other neurological disease. In addition, there was evidence of increased antibody against chlamydia in MS CSF, as well as evidence that MS CSF oligoclonal IgG bands were absorbed by chlamydia antigens. This work clearly needs confirmation. Members of the public awaiting cures for specific diseases often express impatience with the fact that most research on the biological basis of disease is based on animal studies, complaining that the time and money spent on animal studies would be better invested in clinical trials. However, animal studies are not simply interchangeable with clinical studies. Ultimately, every biologically active substance exerts its effects at the cellular and molecular levels, and the evidence has shown that this is remarkably consistent among mammals, even those as different in body and mind as rats and humans. Thus, animals can serve as models for basic biological processes in humans and can provide information about how drugs work that would not be obtainable in clinical studies. Animal models in which both spontaneous and induced disease occur have contributed greatly to our knowledge of the pathogenesis of diseases, and in the future, they will be increasingly used to aid in the assessment of various treatment modalities. A variety of animal models have been used to study the pathogenesis and experimental treatment of diseases that share features with MS (). ""2 Clinical and Biological Features.""

Immunization of mice, rats, or primates with myelin proteins (MBP, MOG, PLP) or other autoantigens (PLP). CREAE is a chronic, relapsing type of EAE In contrast to T cells, there is no technology available to routinely clone autoantigen specific B cells. As an alternative approach, B-cell “monoclonal” mice have recently been generated by gene replacement transgenesis Genetic engineering is used to produce animals that express particular human genes hypothesized to be involved in MS A variety of viruses can induce CNS demyelination, including Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus, mouse hepatitis virus, and herpes simplex virus Most of our present knowledge of myelin-specific autoimmunity and, more generally, of immune reactivity within the CNS emanates from experimental animal models. It should, however, be noted that there is a diversity of distinct models, defined by the animal species, the target autoantigen, and the mode of induction. Three basic types of animal models have been developed to understand the disease mechanisms underlying MS: EAE, virus-induced demyelination, and genetically modified animals. EAE models have served, in many respects, as the prototype for current thinking on the pathogenesis of MS. This paralytic disease is characterized by the presence of inflammation and demyelination in the CNS. It is an autoimmune syndrome induced in different susceptible strains and species, generally by intradermal immunization with myelin antigens (natural or synthetic) or by adoptive transfer of T lymphocytes reactive against myelin proteins. The antigens capable of inducing EAE vary depending upon the strain and species of animal, the adjuvants employed, and perhaps also the history of environmental exposures experienced by the animal. EAE should be considered not as a single model but rather as a heterogeneous family of related disorders. Each of the EAE variants reflects different aspects of human MS, and conversely, there is no one EAE model that represents the entire complexity of MS (). As is the case in MS, susceptibilities to EAE are determined as complex genetic traits. In both disorders, the most evident susceptibility locus resides within the HLA locus. Also in both disorders, locus heterogeneity is extensive (i.e., different loci and genes). Different genes can act at specific stages of the ""2 Clinical and Biological Features.""

Comparison Between Multiple Sclerosis and EAE SOURCE: Larry Steinman, presentation to the committee, November 17, 1999. EAE or Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV) disease process, influencing severity, recovery, susceptibility to relapse, remyelination, and other elements of the phenotype. Knowledge of the extensive heterogeneity in disease susceptibility and modifier genes in these MS models should provide targets for study in human MS. Even within genetically identical littermates, the immune response following immunization with whole myelin is heterogeneous, with different antigenic targets dominating in different individuals. When groups of genetically identical animals are housed in different facilities, the resulting clinical syndromes can be markedly different, presumably reflecting the effects of different individual microenvironments. Studies of EAE established that the pathogenic agents of the disease are CD4+ T cells, which produce cytokines of the proinflammatory Th1 pattern (IFN-Î³ and TNF-Î±, but no IL-4) upon stimulation. The precursors of these T cells are contained within the normal immune repertoire, but they unfold their pathogenic potential only on activation, by either specific antigens, microbial superantigens, or mitogens. In EAE induced in the Lewis rat strain (and H-2 mice) by immunization ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001. Multiple Sclerosis: Current Status and Strategies for the Future. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. with MBP, the encephalitogenic T cells recognize almost exclusively single, circumscript epitope segments of the MBP in the molecular context of MHC class II (clonal dominance). This dominance can be gradually lost over time, a phenomenon referred to as determinant spreading. Furthermore, in these models, the T-cell receptor for most autoreactive T cells is based on a highly simplified repertoire of structural genes, such as the VÎ²8.2 gene for the TCR Î²-chain. These unusual features of antigen recognition have raised hopes with regard to immunospecific therapies. Unfortunately, however, they seem to be limited to only a few experimental models. Most EAE models, as well as the human myelin-specific T cells, do not show either striking epitope dominance or T-cell receptor biases. To date, attempts to identify possible functions of CNS-specific T-cell classes distinct from CD4+ T cells have not led to consistent pictures. Evidence from T-cell transfer models and TCR transgenic mice suggests that CD8+ T cells might help control and limit an ongoing CD4+ dependent EAE process. Most acute EAE models show profuse inflammatory CNS reactions with a conspicuous absence of large-scale demyelination, implying that MS-like demyelination is not caused directly by myelin-specific T cells but must be brought about by other mechanisms. B cells are the best-characterized effectors of this function. Large, confluent inflammatory demyelinated lesions can be produced in rats by transferring encephalitogenic T cells along with a monoclonal antibody against myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein. The T cells cause inflammation, thereby opening the blood-brain barrier to the autoantibodies, which enter the CNS where they bind to myelin and destroy it via complement- or phagocyte-dependent mechanisms. “Simple” immunization of rodents with MOG can also produce the same result. In addition to producing humoral autoantibodies, brain-specific B cells target and present myelin antigens to specific T cells. During this presentation process, the B cells may stimulate the activation of specific T cells, with a possible tendency to shift them from Th1 (pro-inflammatory) to Th2 cytokine (anti-inflammatory) profiles. The roles of autoreactive B cells in the pathogenesis of EAE are incompletely understood, mostly because of technical shortcomings. In contrast to T cells, there is no technology available to routinely clone autoantigen-specific B cells. As an alternative approach, B-cell “monoclonal” mice have recently been generated by gene replacement transgenesis. The germline repertoire of immunoglobulin genes in these mice has been replaced by the mature, rearranged gene encoding a MOG-specific autoantibody. Most, if not all, of the B cells in these mice express immunoglobulin receptors that are autoreactive to MOG. The mice spontaneously produce high titers of anti-MOG autoantibodies in their blood. There is no natural, spontaneous animal model resembling MS. The immunological conditions leading to relapses ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001. Multiple Sclerosis: Current Status and Strategies for the Future. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. and remissions of inflammatory demyelinating disease over time are most commonly examined in chronic relapsing versions of EAE. These episodic courses depend on the modes of immunization as well as on genetic factors innate to the host animals. Although the conditions that trigger relapses in CREAE models are not yet well understood, models are expected to provide clues to these essential aspects of MS, especially when refined by the use of suitable transgenic animals. It has recently been shown that a chronic relapsing EAE in a primate, the common marmoset, is more like MS than other EAE models. This form of EAE, induced in marmosets by immunization with MOG, produces lesions that are almost indistinguishable from fresh, acute human MS plaques. In both the human disease and this animal model, a zone of myelin destruction is seen at the margins of lesions; within the lesions, myelin sheaths are replaced by vesiculated membranous elements. MOG-specific antibodies, thought to be related to the deposition of antigen-specific antibody, are present over the vesiculated myelin. In both settings, oligodendrocytes were spared, and there was some evidence of myelin repair. Axonal pathology, however, was more conspicuous in MS cases than in this animal model. It has been suggested that processes mediated by T-cells initiate the demyelinating lesions and that other effector mechanisms are the principal offenders in damaging the myelin sheath. Mechanisms that initiate the lesion might be immunologically distinct from those that propagate disease. Antibodies might play an important role in these processes. The marmoset EAE model has also confirmed the encephalitogenic potential of autoreactive T-cell clones, whose precursors are preformed in the healthy immune repertoire. At the same time, however, these experiments also show that all T-cell clones are not equally autoaggressive. Experimental animal models of MS are based almost exclusively on the use of rodents, mostly rats and mice. Unfortunately, rodent and human immune systems differ to such a large degree that not all observations made in rodent EAE can be directly translated to human MS. An important disadvantage of animal models is that they do not necessarily mirror the cellular or molecular pathology of MS. Some types of EAE, for example, produce brisk demyelination, whereas others produce little demyelination. Which is the best model? Since these features of MS are not yet fully understood, it is dificult to know how faithfully any given animal model of MS illustrates the human disease. In addition, these models are not very tractable for studies on the electrophysiology and biophysics of neuronal function, a serious limitation in a disease such as MS in which symptoms and signs arise from impaired nerve function. Powerful research methods are now available for studying the physiology and ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001. Multiple Sclerosis: Current Status and Strategies for the Future. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. biophysics of normal or injured nerve cells. These methods permit neuroscientists to study electrical signaling in both normal and injured neurons, but they require that these nerve cells, with reproducible abnormalities, be reproducibly located, within fractions of a millimeter, in specific parts of the nervous system so that they can be studied. In MS and in most currently available animal models, the pathology is patchy, and the location of demyelinated and injured neurons varies from case to case. For the electrophysiologist who studies neuronal signaling by precisely placing tiny microelectrodes within neurons, studying the physiology of demyelinated or otherwise injured neurons when their location varies from animal to animal is, indeed, a challenge. A model in which focal demyelination, or axonal injury, can be produced at specific locations that are consistent from animal to animal would be a great improvement. Viruses can cause demyelination in several ways, the most straightforward of which is for viruses to lyse, or break open, oligodendrocytes, the myelinproducing cells. In some cases, however, the immune system is also involved. The mechanism by which virus-induced immune-mediated demyelination is carried out is not clear, but roles for molecular mimicry, bystander damage, and superantigen activation of T cells have all been proposed (see ). The best developed models of virus-induced demyelination are those caused by certain strains of TMEV and the mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) (reviewed in Kastrukoff et al.). Probably the most fruitful of the remaining models are those of semliki forest virus (SFV) and herpes simplex virus (HSV) (). The advantages of SFV are its small, simple genome and ease of mutagenesis. Although the HSV genome is large and complex, the wealth of molecular information related to this virus and the ability to manipulate the viral genome make it an attractive model system, as well. The DA strain of TMEV produces an inflammatory demyelinating disease of the spinal cord with lesions that resemble MS. A variety of experimental studies of TMEV-induced demyelination suggest that as in MS, the immune system fosters demyelination. The inflammatory, demyelinating, and multifocal lesions of TMEV infection are mediated at least in part by T cells directed against viral antigens. The inflammatory response directly contributes to tissue damage in this MS-like model, since susceptibility is determined in part by immune response genes and immunosuppression abrogates demyelination. One to two weeks after inoculation with the DA virus, there is a brisk inflammatory response in the brain with high levels of virus. This is generally a subclinical process since the mouse usually appears normal. After three weeks, the brain pathology virtually disappears, but mice develop a progressive spastic para- ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001. Multiple Sclerosis: Current Status and Strategies for the Future. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. Animal Viruses That Induce Demyelination The TO subgroup strains of TMEV produces an inflammatory demyelinating disease of the spinal cord with lesions that resemble MS. A variety of experimental studies of TMEV-induced demyelination suggest that the immune system fosters the white matter disease. The many different strains of MHV lead to a plethora of different diseases, including hepatitis, as well respiratory CNS disorders. The presence and extent of demyelination depend on the viral genotype, dosage, and route of inoculation, as well as the strain, age, and immune status of the infected mouse. Virus persists in glial cells of demyelinated mice. Experimental infection of mice and rats with specific strains of SFV leads to demyelination; other strains induce an encephalomyelitis. Demyelination depends on the specific strain of virus, the mouse strain, and the immune status of the host. Virus persists in the central nervous system. The role of the immune system in the demyelinating disease remains unclear. Many strains of HSV produce a diffuse encephalitis in mice, but certain virus strains induce an inflammatory demyelinating disease in particular strains. Other strains of mice have multifocal demyelination that can relapse or persist in varied areas of the brain. The role of the immune system in this model is unclear but appears to contribute to the destruction of CNS tissue. Maedi visna is found only in sheep. There is no experimental rodent model of maedi visna infection, and therefore one needs to investigate sheep. The absence of markers for the sheep's immune system and of genetically modified sheep with knockouts of different arms of the immune system are clear limitations of the maedi visna model. The pathology of disease varies from an encephalomyelitis to a pure inflammatory demyelination that resembles MS.37 Virus persists during the disease with a restricted expression in microglial cells. It remains unclear whether demyelination is a result of direct viral lysis or is mediated by the immune response. CDV produces a variety of CNS diseases in dogs, including acute and chronic encephalitis and demyelinating disease. Virus persists in the chronic disease and appears to be present in oligodendrocytes in some cases. Work with this model has been limited since dogs are required as the host. The pathogenesis of the demyelinating disease remains unclear. paresis associated with an inflammatory demyelinating disease of the spinal cord. Although the titers of DA virus decrease over the first few weeks, virus persists in the central nervous system for the life of the mouse. The persistent virus is said to have a restricted, or incomplete, expression. In other words, viral genome is present, but the levels of infectious virus are low, with relatively little viral capsid ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001. Multiple Sclerosis: Current Status and Strategies for the Future. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. protein produced. (The capsid is the protein shell surrounding the viral DNA or RNA and is generally required for viral infectivity.) Advantages of the TMEV model include the simplicity of its genome, the detailed structural information about the virus, the ease with which it can be genetically manipulated, and finally, the extensive knowledge about the genes and immune system of mice, the natural host of TMEV (see .). Despite all that is known about TMEV and despite the ease in manipulating this simple virus, the pathogenesis of the demyelinating disease is not yet fully understood. It is clear that viral persistence in the oligodendrocytes and microglia is critical to the development of TMEV-induced demyelination; that is, an ongoing virus infection is always associated with the white matter disease. It is also clear that the immune system contributes to the late demyelinating disease, but exactly how remains poorly understood. Part of the difficulty in dissecting the role of the immune system in the pathogenesis of TMEV (as well as some of the other animal models of virus-induced demyelination) is that it changes over time. Early after infection, the immune system controls the virus infection, but later in Advantages of the TMEV Model of Virus-Induced Demyelination The following features of TMEV make it an attractive model for studies of virus-induced immune-mediated demyelination: with only four structural proteins in the infectious particle. The genome is only approximately 8,100 nucleotides in length. Three strains are completely sequenced. The crystallographic structure of three strains of the virus has been solved, so that the location of every amino acid in the infectious particle is known. The B-cell epitopes that are the targets for neutralizing antibody have been identified and located on the infectious particle. Some of the epitopes on the virus that trigger proliferation of immune CD4+ T cells and some that act as targets for an antivirus cytolytic T-cell response are also known. Some components of the receptor for the virus have been identified. Infectious clones of the virus are available so mutations can be quickly engineered into any region of the genome. There is extensive knowledge about mouse genetics and immunology. The mouse, which is the natural and experimental host of TMEV, provides a special benefit in studies of the pathogenesis of TMEV-induced demyelinating disease because so much is known about mouse genetics and the immune system. In addition, many genetically engineered mice are available, including those in which specific genes for different components of the immune system have been “knocked out.” ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001. Multiple Sclerosis: Current Status and Strategies for the Future. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. the disease, it contributes to the demyelination. In addition, during the disease there appears to be a critical “balance” of the immune response that is necessary for the induction of demyelination: an inadequate immune response early in the disease can lead to the death of the mouse within the first couple of weeks and before the appearance of demyelination, while a very forceful immune response early can lead to clearance of the virus so that no virus persists and white matter disease fails to develop. In other words, viral persistence and demyelination occur only in association with a certain level of the antiviral immune response. CD4+, as well as CD8+, T cells might be mediators of the late demyelinating disease. DA virus infection induces demyelination in both CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell knockout mice, suggesting that both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells mediate the late demyelinating disease. The targets for these immunopathogenic CD4+ and the CD8+ T cells are unknown. There is some evidence for epitope spreading, in which an increasing number of myelin antigenic epitopes become the target for a CD4+ T-cell response. However, epitope spreading appears to begin after demyelination has become established, so it is unclear how important this mechanism of immunopathology is to DA-induced demyelination, especially early in the white matter disease. Mouse strains that are resistant to DA-induced demyelinating disease mount an antivirus cytolytic T-cell response and clear the virus. Mouse strains that are susceptible to the late disease do not mount this response, presumably allowing for virus persistence. L*, a small protein synthesized by demyelinating strains of TMEV via alternative translation, is critical for TMEV persistence and demyelination. L* inhibits the antivirus cytolytic T-cell response in susceptible mouse strains through an, as yet, unknown mechanism. Certain cells, for example, oligodendrocytes, may have cell-specific RNA-binding proteins that bind to the viral genome (as well as some nonviral messenger RNAs) and regulate whether L* or the viral capsid proteins are synthesized. The more L* that is synthesized, the more the expression of the virus is restricted. TMEV induces apoptosis in certain cells, including neurons and macrophages. The relationship between apoptosis and DA-induced demyelination remains an open question. There are many different strains of mouse hepatitis virus that lead to a plethora of different diseases, including hepatitis as well as respiratory and CNS disorders. JHM, S, and A59 strains of MHV induce demyelination. The extent of demyelination depends on the virus, including its geno-type, dosage, and route of inoculation, as well as on the condition of the infected mouse, including its strain, age, and immune status. Intracerebral inoculation of the JHM strain into weanling mice leads to demyelination in the mice that survive encephalitis. Virus persists in glial cells of demyelinated mice. At present, there are some notable limitations to MHV pathogenesis studies. MHV has a remarkably large viral genome (32 kb), making this a complex ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001. Multiple Sclerosis: Current Status and Strategies for the Future. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. pathogen. A system for efficient and rapid mutagenesis has not yet been perfected, and therefore manipulation of the viral genome is not straightforward. Investigators initially thought that demyelination occurred as a result of viral lysis of oligodendrocytes independently of the immune system. More recent studies, however, suggested that it does contribute to the demyelination (reviewed in 1996 by Houtman et al.). For example, investigators found that C57BL/6 mice that are immunosuppressed by gamma irradiation before being exposed to the JHM virus develop less severe demyelination. Adoptive transfer of JHM virus-infected splenic T cells to the infected irradiated mice leads to the development of significant demyelination. Other studies in rats showed that transfer of T cells from rats that have JHM virus-induced demyelinating encephalomyelitis leads to the development of experimental allergic encephalomyelitis-like lesions. Studies in CD4+ and CD8+ knockout mice demonstrated that both T-cell types are needed for clearance of the virus; however, CD4+ T cells contribute to central nervous system inflammation and demyelination. A suggestion of the latter study was that the CD4+ T cells influenced the expression of cytokines, specifically the RANTES cytokine, and led to macrophage entry into the CNS; treatment of the infected mice with anti-RANTES antibody resulted in a decrease in macrophage infiltration and demyelination. These studies and conclusions require confirmation. The committee notes that the following animal models of virus-induced demyelinating disease are particularly likely to yield clues to the pathogenesis of MS: The HAM/TSP syndrome resembles MS. Because the principles relevant to this human disease might be similar to those in MS, investigating the pathogenesis of this disease could reveal insights into MS pathogenesis. The development of a widely available animal model for HAM/TSP is a high priority. PIE is of special interest since recurrences following this acute inflammatory white matter disease are so similar to MS attacks that the two diseases are indistinguishable, indicating a close relationship between PIE and MS. The availability of transgenic mice that carry a receptor for measles virus might provide an experimental model for the study of PIE. The pathological lesions of TMEV are similar to MS plaques; therefore, continuing delineation of the mechanism by which the immune system contributes to the virus-induced demyelination might lead to a better understanding of the pathogenesis of demyelinating disease. ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001. Multiple Sclerosis: Current Status and Strategies for the Future. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. Research on the MHV-induced demyelination model is presently limited by difficulties with site-directed mutagenesis methods. A high priority for research with this virus should be the generation of an infectious MHV cDNA clone and a refinement of mutagenesis techniques. Molecular genetic manipulation has become one of the most important tools for evaluating gene function in living organisms. These tools of molecular biology have extended the reach of researchers to a new level of understanding of neurodegeneration mechanisms. The development of animal models for neurodegenerative disorders by means of genetic engineering has revolutionized experimental neurology. The identification and cloning of genes involved in diseases such as Alzheimer's, Huntington's, and amyotropic lateral sclerosis provided the keys to develop mice that overexpress the human genes involved in these diseases (reviewed in 1999 by Brusa). The nonobese diabetic (NOD) mouse is genetically susceptible to diabetes, and transgenic NOD mice have been developed to allow examination of the role of possible autoantigens in the development of diabetes, which like MS involves an inflammatory autoimmune pathology. The NOD mouse has also identified candidate molecules and processes that have influenced research in EAE and MS. Mutant mice have provided insights into all aspects of biology for generations, but only in the last two decades has it been possible to modify the expression of selected genes, an essential breakthrough for analyzing the role of specific genes in complex processes and diseases such as MS. In addition, identification of the genes that are activated or inactivated in both pathological and repair processes in the CNS will likely reveal new and unexpected targets for uniquely selective disease-modifying therapies in MS. “Reverse genetics” and “forward genetics” offer contrasting approaches to the analysis of gene function. Forward genetics is an approach to identify genes that are not already implicated in a particular disease or process. Reverse genetics is an approach to identify the role of genes whose involvement in the disease or process being studied is already implicated. In forward genetics, large numbers of mice are mutagenized (using techniques that mutagenize genes at random); their resulting phenotypes are analyzed to select mutants that exhibit spontaneous MS. The mutated genes in the selected mutants are then positionally cloned and identified. The homologous human clones can also be identified, a task that is becoming vastly simpler as the human genome project nears completion. The advantage of this approach is that the screen is not biased in any way and can reveal genes beyond those already known to be involved in MS. Another advantage of forward genetics is that once a gene is identified in a disease process, one can quickly do a screen for suppressors and ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001. Multiple Sclerosis: Current Status and Strategies for the Future. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. enhancers of the phenotype. This will yield the entire biochemical pathway (as opposed to just one step) involved in disease pathogenesis. One limitation to the forward genetics approach is that only a small percentage of the mutated genes will result in a phenotype relevant to MS. Consequently, large numbers of mutants have to be screened, which is generally expensive, time-consuming, and labor intensive. Yet the rewards—especially for complex diseases and processes that have resisted traditional approaches—are unparalleled. In reverse genetics, mutant strains of mice that either overexpress or lack specific genes are generated through a variety of techniques. The classic approach to creating transgenic mice is to inject a foreign gene (“transgene”) into a fertilized egg, thereby inducing overexpression of the transgene. The egg bearing the transgene is implanted into a host mother. Progeny bearing DNA encoding the transgene are screened, as are the corresponding levels of RNA and protein. This transgene is randomly incorporated into a mouse chromosome and ultimately leads to production of the protein of interest. This approach has been used to transfer human genes (such as those for T-cell receptor, HLA DR2, and CD4) into mice to see if they develop spontaneous MS. One limitation of “knockin” mice is that genes can be inserted in uneven copy numbers in “replicate” animals or might be integrated into disparate sites in the genome. Gene expression can also be altered through knockout experiments. Knockout mice, or null mutants, are created using embryonic stem cells and homologous recombination to produce a cell line in which a certain gene has been removed, or ablated. When transferred into an early mouse embryo, these cells can participate in the generation of all cell lineages including germ cells, thereby transmitting their genotype to the next generation. Alternatively, embryonic stem cells can be used to create so-called knock-in mice by inserting a gene into a particular locus. The transgenic gene-targeting approaches described above all rely on irreversible changes to the genome that are present from the onset of development throughout an animal's life. The function of the gene must be deduced from the phenotype of animals that have been deficient for the product of the disrupted gene throughout development. Yet, many genes play different roles at different stages of development and in different tissues. This presents serious drawbacks (reviewed in 1998 by Gingrich and Roder and in 1999 by Muller). First, an animal with a gene alteration that lethally disrupts development obviously cannot be studied as an adult—even though the gene might play another critical role, for example, in neural repair. This is particularly relevant to MS because many of the genes that regulate embryonic neural development also regulate neural repair in adults. Another limitation of transgenic models is that changes in the regulation of other genes could yield misleading phenotypes, in part because of differences between effects of the gene at different developmental stages, gene redundancy (other genes might also play the role of the missing gene), or adaptive mecha- ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001. Multiple Sclerosis: Current Status and Strategies for the Future. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. nisms that compensate for the missing gene. Even apparently unaltered phenotypes would thus not prove that the gene was not involved in the disease or process being studied. Another limitation of this approach is that in physiological responses, gene products tend to be produced in waves, whereas in transgenics, expression is usually “on” from the time of development. Alternative approaches in which one gene, or parts of it, can be inactivated or activated in specific tissues or at specific times (“conditional” and “inducible” mutants) have recently been developed in this rapidly expanding array of genealtering techniques (reviewed in Brusa, 1999; Gingrich and Roder, 1998; and van der Neut, 1997). This second generation of transgenic technology derives from the possibility of modulating the suppression of a transgene with external stimuli, by using a “biological switch” that can turn the foreign gene on and off. Gene expression patterns in the nervous system are highly regionalized. For example, the enzymes involved in producing neurotransmitters and their receptors differ from one subpopulation of neurons to another. Other proteins are more widespread, such as the intermediate filament proteins NF (neurofilament) or GFAP (glial fibrillary acidic protein), or are ubiquitous, such as N-CAMs (neural cell adhesion molecules) and integrins. Thus, it would be particularly advantageous to develop tissue-specific mutants for MS research. The development of inducible systems will become an important tool in the many diverse aspects of research on the disease mechanisms and possibilities for repair in MS, including the potential administration of gene therapy. Transgenic overexpression of cytokines or gene targets of cytokines in the CNS offers a relatively non-intrusive mechanism to assess the role of individual cytokines in CNS development, function, and response to insult. A common technique for assessing the effects of a particular cytokine in EAE is to induce its expression directly in the CNS. This allows researchers to ask whether expression of the cytokine induces CNS pathology similar to that seen in MS. Directed expression of transgenes in the CNS relies on promoters that normally control the expression of CNS-specific genes. This includes the GFAP gene promoter, which drives expression in astrocytes, as well as the neurofilament promoter (neurons), and the myelin basic protein promoter (oligodendrocytes). To date, no one has isolated a microglial-specific promoter. Only MBP promoters have been used to overexpress gamma-interferon in the CNS. Phenotypes of transgenic mice range from a lethal, “jimpy”-like hypomyelinating mouse, through progressive demyelinating disease, to mice with no outward phenotype that nevertheless showed progression from EAE to a *A point mutation in the gene coding for myelin proteolipid protein causes male offspring of jimpy mice to have little or no myelination. Affected mice develop severe tremors and die prematurely at approximately 30 days. ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001. Multiple Sclerosis: Current Status and Strategies for the Future. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. chronic demyelinating disease in contrast to control mice that recovered from EAE-induced demyelination. It is of interest that the same laboratory observed both extremes using the same constructs. This might be because the transgenes were unevenly integrated at different loci, since levels of expression did not obviously correlate with phenotype in one case. Asymptomatic transgenic mice did, however, show enhanced glial responses to CNS injury, and exacerbated ischemic infarction (Lambertsen et al., unpublished). These asymptomatic mice presumably reflect sub-threshold levels of cytokine. Nevertheless, crossing an asymptomatic MBP promoter-driven gamma-interferon transgenic mouse with MBP or MHC class I mice produced a more extreme jimpy phenotype. This might provide a clue to cytotoxic effects of beta-interferon-Î³ on oligodendrocytes, being perhaps dependent on local interferon-Î³ titers becoming sufficiently high to stimulate MHC I induction. It is not known whether similar mechanisms account for oligodendrocyte pathology in TNF-Î± and interferon-Î± transgenic mice. The IL-3 and IL-12 transgenic mice provide a useful counterpart, there being no obvious suggestion of a direct effect on oligodendrocytes., These mice illustrate the potential for direct macrophage and microglial attack on oligodendrocytes, which might occur in TNF-Î± transgenic mice. It is not clear from any of these experiments whether activation of immune cells took place within the CNS or following cytokine exit to the periphery. A systemic effect must account for the fact that overexpression of the antiinflammatory cytokine IL-10 protected animals from EAE in two separate preparations. The fact that IL-4 transgenic mice did not show similar resistance might reflect insufficient expression within the CNS or strain background differences, given that IL-4 knockout exacerbated disease in another study. Most recently, a transgenic mouse has been “constructed” that expresses T-cell receptor genes from a human MBP-specific T-cell clone, along with relevant human MHC class II determinants and MBP. Under certain conditions, this “humanized” mouse developed spontaneous EAE that indeed showed inflammation with some demyelination. In recent years, there have been many advances in the use of transgenes (including gene knockouts), as well as even more sophisticated models that make use of tissue-specific and time-dependent regulators. These models should facilitate the development of rational therapies and the transfer of knowledge from animal models to the prevention and treatment of human disease. However, although temporally regulated targeting controlled by the administration of an environmental inducer has become feasible with high efficiency for some organs, it remains to be further improved for other tissues, particularly the brain. New generations of inducible promoters will more faithfully mimic the in vivo kinetics and dynamics of cytokine production. Knock-in mice, in which ""2 Clinical and Biological Features.""

Multiple sclerosis is a chronic and often disabling disease of the nervous system, affecting about 1 million people worldwide. Even though it has been known for over a hundred years, no cause or cure has yet been discovered—but now there is hope. New therapies have been shown to slow the disease progress in some patients, and the pace of discoveries about the cellular machinery of the brain and spinal cord has accelerated. This book presents a comprehensive overview of multiple sclerosis today, as researchers seek to understand its processes, develop therapies that will slow or halt the disease and perhaps repair damage, offer relief for specific symptoms, and improve the abilities of MS patients to function in their daily lives. The panel reviews existing knowledge and identifies key research questions, focusing on: Research strategies that have the greatest potential to understand the biological mechanisms of recovery and to translate findings into specific strategies for therapy. How people adapt to MS and the research needed to improve the lives of people with MS. Management of disease symptoms (cognitive impairment, depression, spasticity, vision problems, and others). The committee also discusses ways to build and financially support the MS research enterprise, including a look at challenges inherent in designing clinical trials. This book will be important to MS researchers, research funders, health care advocates for MS research and treatment, and interested patients and their families. 3 Characteristics and Management of Major Symptoms 5 Strategies for Future Research on Disease Mechanisms 7 Building and Supporting the Research Enterprise Appendix D: Kurtze's Expanded Disability Status Scale Appendix F: U.S. Social Security Administration's Criteria for Qualifying as Disabled from MS Appendix G: Treatments That Have Been Claimed to Be of Benefit in MS You're looking at OpenBook, NAP.edu's online reading room since 1999.

d194e8df-120f-43fa-aaf0-589d65a9dcf9,"— — Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a condition that damages nerve cells in your central nervous system (CNS). Your CNS is composed of your brain, spinal cord, and optic nerves. causes symptoms that gradually get worse, as well as symptoms that come on suddenly after a period of being controlled. This sudden appearance of symptoms is called a . There’s for MS, and the damage it causes can’t be reversed. However, certain medications can help you manage the condition. Condition management focuses on medication that can treat relapses, as well as modify the disease to reduce damage and disability. It also involves other drugs that treat the symptoms or complications of MS. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved the following drugs for the treatment of multiple sclerosis (MS): cladribine (Mavenclad), dimethyl fumarate (Tecfidera), diroximel fumarate (Vumerity), fingolimod (Gilenya), monomethyl fumarate (Bafiertam), ozanimod (Zeposia), siponimod (Mayzent), teriflunomide (Aubagio) interferon beta-1a (Avonex, Rebif), interferon beta-1b (Betaseron, Extavia), glatiramer acetate (Copaxone, Glatopa), peginterferon beta-1a (Plegridy) alemtuzumab (Lemtrada), mitoxantrone hydrochloride, natalizumab (Tysabri), ocrelizumab (Ocrevus) There are several types of that work to help change the course of MS. The length of treatment with these medications can range from a few months to years, depending on how effective the medications are for you. Your may recommend switching between these drugs throughout the course of your treatment. This will depend on how effectively each drug manages your disease and how you tolerate the side effects. If you switch to a different DMT, your doctor will take note of whether you develop new . The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved 12 MS medications that are administered by injection or infusion. They help modify relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) and secondary progressive MS (SPMS) in cases of active disease — that is, a relapse has occurred or new lesions have appeared on an MRI scan. They also treat clinically isolated syndrome (CIS), a one-off episode of neurological symptoms. CIS can progress to MS and is sometimes categorized as a type of MS. These drugs are made up of proteins that keep certain from entering your brain and spinal cord. These WBCs are thought to that forms a protective coating over your nerve fibers. Therefore, preventing these WBCs from moving into your brain and spinal cord can help slow their damage and reduce the number of relapses you have. You inject these drugs yourself. Your healthcare provider will show you how to do this. The number of injections depends on the drug: Glatiramer acetate (Copaxone) is a manufactured substance that resembles a basic protein of natural myelin. It’s thought to work by prompting the WBCs to attack the substance instead of the myelin cells. It’s used to treat RRMS and SPMS in cases of active disease — that is, a relapse has occurred or new lesions have appeared on an MRI scan. It can also treat CIS. You inject this drug yourself once per day or three times per week, depending on your dosage. Your healthcare provider will show you how. People who receive injections three times per week should ensure that at least 48 hours elapses between their injections. The FDA has also approved Glatopa, a generic form of Copaxone. Natalizumab (Tysabri) is an antibody that may block damaged T lymphocytes from moving into your brain and spinal cord. It’s used to treat RRMS and SPMS in cases of active disease — that is, a relapse has occurred or new lesions have appeared on an MRI scan. It can also treat CIS. A healthcare provider gives you this drug as an intravenous (IV) infusion. The infusion takes about an hour, and you’ll get it every 4 weeks. Mitoxantrone hydrochloride was originally used to treat cancer. Now it’s also prescribed to treat people with MS. It suppresses the immune system cells that are thought to attack myelin cells. This medication is only available as a generic drug. It’s used to treat SPMS or worsening RRMS in instances where other drugs haven’t worked. It has a high risk of serious side effects, so it’s only appropriate for people with these more severe forms of MS. A healthcare provider gives you this drug as a short IV infusion once every 3 months. The infusion should only take 5 to 15 minutes. Alemtuzumab (Lemtrada) is approved for people with relapsing forms of MS, including RRMS and active SPMS. It’s intended for people who’ve tried at least two other MS medications but found that treatment was unsuccessful or caused intolerable side effects. It works by reducing the number of specific B and T lymphocytes in your body. This action may decrease the inflammation of and damage to nerve cells. Alemtuzumab is given as a 4-hour IV infusion. To start, you receive this drug once per day for 5 days. Then 12 months after your first treatment course, you receive it once per day for 3 more days. Ocrelizumab (Ocrevus) is the newest infusion treatment for MS. It was approved by the FDA in 2017. It’s the first drug used to treat primary progressive MS (PPMS). It’s also used to treat CIS and relapsing forms of MS. Ocrelizumab appears to work by targeting and ultimately reducing the number of B lymphocytes. B lymphocytes are responsible for damage and repair of the myelin sheath. Ocrelizumab is given as an IV infusion. To begin, you’ll receive it in two 300-milligram (mg) infusions, separated by 2 weeks. After that, you’ll receive it in 600-mg infusions every 6 months. You’ll also receive a corticosteroid and an on the day of each infusion to reduce the risk of reaction to the medication. Ofatumumab (Kesimpta) was approved by the FDA in August 2020 and is the newest treatment for MS. It’s used to treat RRMS and SPMS in cases of active disease — that is, a relapse has occurred or new lesions have appeared on an MRI scan. It can also treat CIS. Like ocrelizumab (Ocrevus), it also works by targeting harmful B lymphocytes and reducing their overall number. Ofatumumab is given as an injection once per week for the first 3 weeks. After a 1-week break, the drug is given as a monthly injection. The FDA has approved eight oral medications for the treatment of MS. Fingolimod (Gilenya) comes as an oral capsule that you take once per day. It was the first oral medication approved by the FDA to treat RRMS. It’s also used to treat CIS and active SPMS. Fingolimod causes the damaging WBCs to remain within your lymph nodes. This reduces the chance that they’ll enter your brain or spinal cord and cause damage. Teriflunomide (Aubagio) is an oral tablet that you take once per day. It’s used to treat RRMS and SPMS in cases of active disease — that is, a relapse has occurred or new lesions have appeared on an MRI scan. It can also treat CIS. Teriflunomide works by blocking an enzyme that’s needed by the damaging WBCs. As a result, teriflunomide helps decrease the number of these cells, which reduces the damage they can inflict. Dimethyl fumarate (Tecfidera) is an oral capsule that you take twice per day. It’s used to treat RRMS and SPMS in cases of active disease — that is, a relapse has occurred or new lesions have appeared on an MRI scan. It can also treat CIS. It appears to work by interfering with the activity of certain immune system cells and chemicals to reduce the risk of MS relapse. It may also have antioxidant properties that help protect against brain and spinal cord damage. Monomethyl fumarate (Bafiertam) is an oral capsule that you take twice per day. It’s the newest oral drug on the market, having been approved by the FDA in April 2020. It’s used to treat RRMS and SPMS in cases of active disease — that is, a relapse has occurred or new lesions have appeared on an MRI scan. It can also treat CIS. Monomethyl fumarate is a bioequivalent of dimethyl fumarate (Tecfidera). Like dimethyl fumarate, monomethyl fumarate may have antioxidant properties and appears to work by interfering with the activity of certain immune system cells and chemicals. Cladribine (Mavenclad) is a pill that you take for a total of 16 or 20 days over the course of 2 years. You’ll have treatment for 2 weeks per year, with each one lasting 4 or 5 days. There’s a 1-month break in between the 2 weeks of treatment. It’s approved for people with relapsing forms of MS, including RRMS and active SPMS. It’s intended for people who’ve tried at least one other MS medication but found that treatment was unsuccessful or caused intolerable side effects. It may work by reducing the number of harmful B and T lymphocytes that you have. Siponimod (Mayzent) is an oral tablet that you take once per day. It’s used to treat RRMS and SPMS in cases of active disease — that is, a relapse has occurred or new lesions have appeared on an MRI scan. It can also treat CIS. It’s believed to work by blocking certain inflammatory cells from leaving your lymph nodes. This action limits the amount of nerve damage that they can inflict. Diroximel fumarate (Vumerity) is an oral capsule that you take twice per day. It’s used to treat RRMS and SPMS in cases of active disease — that is, a relapse has occurred or new lesions have appeared on an MRI scan. It can also treat CIS. Diroximel fumarate has the same active ingredient as dimethyl fumarate (Tecfidera), and it works the same way. This means that it may also have antioxidant properties and interfere with the activity of certain immune system cells and chemicals. Ozanimod (Zeposia) is an oral capsule that you take once per day. It’s used to treat RRMS and SPMS in cases of active disease — that is, a relapse has occurred or new lesions have appeared on an MRI scan. It can also treat CIS. It’s believed to work by blocking immune cells from leaving your lymph nodes and entering your CNS. Fingolimod (Gilenya) is currently the only DMT that’s approved by the FDA for use in children. It’s safe for use in people ages 10 years old and up. However, doctors may prescribe other DMTs off label. Off-label drug is when a medication approved by the FDA for one purpose is used for a different purpose that hasn’t been approved. However, a doctor can still use the drug for that purpose. This is because the FDA regulates the testing and approval of drugs, but not how doctors use drugs to treat their patients. So, your doctor can prescribe a drug however they think is best for your care. While many relapses go away on their own, more severe relapses require treatment. Inflammation causes MS relapses, and it’s typically treated with . These drugs can reduce inflammation and help make MS attacks less severe. Corticosteroids used to treat MS include: If corticosteroids don’t work, your doctor may prescribe corticotropin (H.P. Acthar Gel). Corticotropin is an injection, and it’s also known as ACTH gel. It works by prompting the adrenal cortex to secrete the hormones cortisol, corticosterone, and aldosterone. The secretion of these hormones helps to reduce inflammation. Medications to treat MS symptoms and complications Other drugs can be used to treat specific or from MS-related damage. Dalfampridine (Ampyra) is an oral tablet taken twice per day to help improve walking. Dalfampridine works by blocking potassium channels, which form tiny pores in your nerve cells. This action may help damaged nerve cells to better send messages. Improved nerve impulse conduction aids in leg muscle control and strength. A doctor will often give to people with MS who have painful muscle stiffness or muscle spasms. Drugs commonly used to treat these symptoms include: is a common problem for people with MS. For this symptom, your doctor may prescribe a drug such as modafinil (Provigil). They may also prescribe an off-label drug, such as amantadine (Gocovri) and fluoxetine (Prozac). means “bad sensation.” It’s a type of pain that can feel like ongoing burning or itching. It may also feel like wetness, electric shock, or pins and needles. According to a published in Nature Reviews Neurology, some research has shown that people with MS are more likely to be clinically depressed than the general population. Drugs used to treat depression in people with MS include: Constipation is another common complication of MS. Your doctor may recommend with one of the following : Bladder dysfunction is also a common complication of MS. Symptoms may include frequent urination, , or hesitancy in starting urination. You may also experience frequent (nighttime urination). Both men and women with MS tend to have higher rates of sexual dysfunction than the general population, according to an from 2016. that may be prescribed to help treat include: Older drugs that must be injected directly into the penis are also available. These drugs aren’t used as much now that oral drugs are available. They include alprostadil (Caverject). A drug that may be used off label for this purpose is the blood pressure medication papaverine. People with a vagina or clitoris may experience problems such as reduced feeling or . There are no drugs currently available to treat these problems. However, for vaginal dryness, you can use water-soluble personal lubricants available over the counter. Many different types of drugs are available to help you manage MS. The type of drugs that may be best for you depend on the type of MS you have and the symptoms you experience. You may not be able to access all of these medications. Ask your doctor to confirm which drugs are currently on the market in your area and which ones might be most appropriate for you. Speaking with your doctor is especially important if you’re pregnant or planning to become pregnant. Work with your doctor to to manage your MS symptoms and help prevent further damage from the disease. Sticking to your treatment plan can help you feel better and slow the progression of your condition. — — MS Treatment Chart: Comparing Disease-Modifying Therapies Oral vs. Injectable MS Treatments: What’s the Difference?

The trial in primary progressive MS is the first large-scale clinical trial to show positive results in people with primary progressive MS. The studies were published in two papers in the December 21, 2016 issue of the New England Journal of Medicine: “Ocrelizumab versus Placebo in Primary Progressive Multiple Sclerosis” (Dr. Xavier Montalban and others); “Ocrelizumab versus Interferon Beta-1a in Relapsing Multiple Sclerosis” (Dr. Stephen Hauser and others).   Regulatory agencies are now evaluating these results. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration is expected to make an approval decision by March 28, 2017. DETAILS Results from three clinical trials of the experimental therapy ocrelizumab (proposed brand name, Ocrevus,™ Genentech, a member of the Roche Group) have been published, showing benefits in people with  and and providing additional details regarding effectiveness and safety, after preliminary findings were reported at medical conferences. The trial in primary progressive MS is the first large-scale clinical trial to show positive results.   “If the FDA approves this treatment, it will a breakthrough for people living with primary progressive MS, who have waited so long for an effective disease modifying therapy,” commented Dr. Bruce Bebo, Executive Vice President, Research at the National MS Society. “We hope that this success will encourage others to focus more resources into the research and development of treatments for progressive forms of MS.”   Dr. Bebo added, “The results from the trial of ocrelizumab in relapsing MS have revealed a new approach to suppressing disease activity. The possibility of another effective disease modifying treatment option for people living with relapsing MS is very encouraging.”   Ocrelizumab is a monoclonal antibody that binds to a molecule (CD20) on the surface of immune cells called B cells, and reduces the numbers of certain B cells that are circulating in the blood. B cells have several functions including making antibodies, and they are believed to play a role in immune-system-mediated damage to brain and spinal cord tissues in MS. Ocrelizumab is administered by intravenous infusion every 6 months.   The ORATORIO study compared ocrelizumab to inactive placebo in people with primary progressive MS for a minimum of 120 weeks. Of 732 participants, 488 were randomly assigned to receive ocrelizumab and 244 received inactive placebo. The trial was successful at meeting its primary endpoint, showing treatment with ocrelizumab significantly reduced the risk of progression of clinical disability by 24% compared with placebo. This reduced risk of progression means that people taking ocrelizumab in the trial were 24% less likely to demonstrate worsening of disability than those taking placebo. Other secondary benefits showed that compared to placebo, ocrelizumab reduced the time required to walk 25 feet, decreased the volume of brain lesions and reduced the rate of brain atrophy (shrinkage).   In the OPERA I and OPERA II studies involving people with relapsing MS, which compared ocrelizumab to interferon beta-1a (Rebif,® EMD Serono and Pfizer), ocrelizumab significantly reduced the annualized relapse rate by up to 47% compared with Rebif over two years in a total of 1,656 people with relapsing MS. Ocrelizumab also significantly delayed confirmed progression of disability, and reduced active inflammation and total damage on MRI scans compared with Rebif. The most common adverse events associated with ocrelizumab in all three trials were mild to moderate infusion-related reactions. Infusion reactions varied, the most frequent being itchy skin, rash, irritation in the throat, flushed face or fever, headache or other symptoms. These reactions decreased and tended to be less severe with subsequent doses. Serious infections occurred at similar rates in treatment and placebo groups. Other less severe infections included flu and oral herpes. A small percentage of participants who took ocrelizumab developed cancers during or after the trial more than those on placebo. This occurrence “warrants ongoing evaluation,” noted the authors of both papers. Extension studies now underway should help track safety and longer-term benefits.   There are extension studies involving participants of the clinical trials, plus additional clinical studies taking place which are currently recruiting individuals with MS who meet specific criteria. All participants receive the active therapy, and there is no placebo group.

Multiple Sclerosis Symptoms, Causes, Treatment, Diagnosis, and Life Expectancy Medical Author: Medical Editor: What Are the Signs and Symptoms of Multiple Sclerosis? 5 Early Warning Signs and Symptoms of Multiple Sclerosis What Are the Common Signs and Symptoms of Multiple Sclerosis? What Are the Signs and Symptoms of Multiple Sclerosis in Children and Teens (Pediatric MS)? At What Age Can Multiple Sclerosis Start? Who Has MS? What Medications Are Used for the Treatment of Multiple Sclerosis? What Drug Therapies Are Used for the Treatment and Symptoms of Multiple Sclerosis? What Is the Prognosis and Life Expectancy for MS in Adults, Teens, and Children? Is It Fatal? When Should You Seek Medical Care for Multiple Sclerosis? Multiple sclerosis is caused by damage to tissues surrounding nerve fibers. () is a condition that results from damage to myelin, the tissues surrounding nerves of the brain and . Damage to the myelin is a result of an autoimmune disease in which the body produces an immune response against its own tissues. is more common in women than in men. Symptoms and signs of are extremely variable and range from mild to severe, and may include: Some people with MS may have no symptoms to mild symptoms; about 30% of those affected will have significant disability after 20-25 years with the condition. The average age of onset for MS is about 34 years of age; but children and teens also get the condition. There is no cure for MS, but disease-modifying drugs can reduce the symptoms, delay disability, and reduce progression of the condition as seen on . The body's immune system attacks nerve sheaths, causing multiple sclerosis.. Multiple sclerosis (MS) can be thought of as an immune-mediated inflammatory process involving different areas of the () at various points in time. As the name suggests, the condition affects many areas of the central or CNS. Normal nerves are surrounded by a myelin sheath to insulate and protect them from damage. This sheath also allows effects how fast nerve signals get from the brain or spinal cord (CNS) to the affected body part. As this sheath is destroyed, the nerve conduction to that body area or part decreases or is interrupted completely. The destruction is caused by the body's immune system attacking the myelin sheath. The reason that the body's immune system attacks the sheath is not understood fully, but it is believed to be related to a combination of a genetic predisposition and acquired or environmental influences. What Are the Signs and Symptoms of Multiple Sclerosis? The signs and symptoms of MS in adults, children, and teens are similar; however, children and teens with the disease (pediatric MS) also may have and complete that adults with MS do not experience. Moreover, symptoms in people with multiple sclerosis differ from person to person. Visual, sensory, and motor signs and symptoms are all part of MS; however, there is a wide range of symptoms that can appear. Some people have mild cases of MS with little or no disability over the years. Others have more severe types of MS, requiring confinement to a wheelchair or bed. Over 30% of those affected with MS will have a significant disability after 20 to 25 years. Still, others may live their entire lives symptom-free (some individuals without multiple sclerosis symptoms are found incidentally to have multiple sclerosis lesions by MRI or individuals in whom an examination of their brain after death unexpectedly reveals that they were affected by the disease). This variability makes it difficult in some cases to diagnose multiple sclerosis. Often the signs and symptoms are mistaken as being psychiatric in origin. 5 Early Warning Signs and Symptoms of Multiple Sclerosis The of multiple sclerosis are often . Large number of people with multiple sclerosis develop optic neuritis (inflammation of the , which is an extension of the central nervous system), described as a painful vision loss. If a patient is diagnosed with optic neuritis early, treatment could change the course of the disease. Before the actual loss of vision, the patient may have visual changes described by many people as blurred or hazy vision, flashing lights, or alterations in color. The tissues around the eye and moving the eye may be painful. Most people recover over several months. Others are left with permanent visual defects. Double vision occurs when the eyes move in different directions and is another common symptom of multiple sclerosis. Multiple Sclerosis Pictures, Symptoms and Treatment What Are the Common Signs and Symptoms of Multiple Sclerosis? Multiple sclerosis commonly affects the cerebellum, the portion of the brain responsible for balance and fine motor coordination. Consequently, people with multiple sclerosis often have difficulty maintaining their balance when walking and performing delicate tasks with their hands. The unexplained dropping of a cup or other objects, or unusual weakness can occur. Electrical-type pain sensations in the chest, abdomen, arms, or legs There appears to be a relationship between multiple sclerosis, higher temperatures, and the worsening of symptoms. occur in about 5% of people with multiple sclerosis. Those with MS may complain of disturbances, , or may feel that they are experiencing changes in attention span or memory. Many symptoms of multiple sclerosis lead to other complications, such as infections of the bladder (urinary infections), kidney, or blood. Any area of the body can be involved, making this disease difficult to distinguish from other nervous system disorders. What Are the Signs and Symptoms of Multiple Sclerosis in Children and Teens (Pediatric MS)? The signs and symptoms of multiple sclerosis in children and teens are similar to those experienced by adults; however, they also may have seizures and extreme or lethargy. Children with MS are considered to have the form of MS known as relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis. The central nervous system is made up of the brain and spinal cord. They process information from our environment and control voluntary muscle movements to allow the body to do certain things. When you touch something hot, for example, signals are sent from sensory nerve endings in your hand up long nerves in your arm, eventually reaching the spinal cord. From there, the signal is transferred up your spinal cord to your brain, where the information is processed. Your brain then sends a signal back down the spinal cord to the nerves in your arm. These nerves cause the muscles in your arm to contract, pulling your hand away from the heat. This system works efficiently, unless there is a disease process affecting the nerve pathways in the spinal cord and brain. MS is one of the diseases that can affect these pathways. The nerves in the body are covered by a fatty substance called myelin (myelin sheath). The myelin sheath insulates the nerves and allows them to transmit information to and from the brain in a fraction of a second. If the myelin is disrupted in any way, the transmitted information is not only delayed, but it may also be misinterpreted by the brain. This autoimmune destruction of the myelin sheath leads to areas of (also known as plaques) in the brain and spinal cord. These plaques disrupt the transmission of information by nerves in the CNS and lead to the symptoms seen in MS. At What Age Can Multiple Sclerosis Start? Who Has MS? MS is more common in individuals of northern European descent. Women are more than twice as likely to develop multiple sclerosis as men. Multiple sclerosis usually affects people between the ages of 20 and 50 years, and the average age of onset is approximately 34 years. Multiple sclerosis can affect children and teens (pediatric MS). It has been estimated that 2%-5% of people with MS develop symptoms prior to age 18. What Is Multiple Sclerosis? MS Symptoms, Causes, Diagnosis Diagnosing multiple sclerosis is difficult. The vague and nonspecific nature of this disease mimics many other diseases. Doctors combine history, physical exam, laboratory work, and sophisticated medical imaging techniques to arrive at a diagnosis. More often than not, a specialist is required to make a diagnosis. Examples of tests and procedures used to diagnose MS include: A (), blood chemistry, , and often spinal fluid evaluation ( or “”) are all routine laboratory tests used to rule out other conditions and help confirm the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis. An MRI, which creates an image of the brain or the spinal cord, is used to search for changes within the brain or spinal cord that are unique to multiple sclerosis. What Medications Are Used for the Treatment of Multiple Sclerosis? There are several treatment options for multiple sclerosis. Listed examples below are US FDA-approved drugs to treat multiple sclerosis. These are known as disease-modifying therapies for MS. Disease-modifying therapies have been found through clinical trials to reduce the number of relapses, delay the progression of disability, and limit new disease activity that is observed on MRI. Examples of drugs used to treat MS include: Beta interferons, for example: (Mavenclad) oral tablets is a drug used to treat two forms of multiple sclerosis; relapsing forms that include relapsing-remitting disease and active secondary progressive disease in adults. Generally, cladribine is used in people with MS who have tried other that were not tolerated well or ineffective. People with clinically isolated syndrome not take cladribine. () is a agent that has been approved by the FDA to treat multiple sclerosis. Treatment with mitoxantrone requires monitoring of cardiac function, and there is a fixed limit to the dose that can be administered to patients. It also carries the long-term risk of . For these reasons, Novantrone is typically reserved for patients with more aggressive forms of multiple sclerosis. New research and treatment methods are currently being investigated and are expected to offer some hope to people with multiple sclerosis. In particular, new research studies have shown that skin patches containing myelin peptides may be a promising therapy. Consult your healthcare team for options. What Drug Therapies Are Used for the Treatment and Symptoms of Multiple Sclerosis? In addition to drugs that target the disease process, other medications used to relieve certain symptoms of MS. Muscle relaxants, for example, () Selective reuptake inhibitor () The oral phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors, for example, (), (, Adcirca), and ) (, Staxyn ODT) What Is the Prognosis and Life Expectancy for MS in Adults, Teens, and Children? Is It Fatal? Most people with the form of MS progress to a stage where relapses become much less frequent, but they continue to accumulate disabling symptoms. This new phase of the disease is termed secondary progressive multiple sclerosis. Symptoms of this type of MS are intermittent and worsen neurologic symptoms, which can last several days or weeks before returning to their original state of health. Some people, however, are left with residual deficits (residual disability) after some attacks. A few people have a form of MS. In this type, people have relapses superimposed on a pattern of continuous progression of disability. Rarely, people with multiple sclerosis have a pure progressive () forms of the disease. Their disability progresses in the absence of attacks over time. Most people with MS usually die from diseases such as or heart attacks, especially in those who are bedridden. Currently, there is no cure for multiple sclerosis. As of yet, no true way of preventing multiple sclerosis has been found. When Should You Seek Medical Care for Multiple Sclerosis? The symptoms of multiple sclerosis are very variable and differ from patient to patient. They can also be confused with symptoms of many other conditions. You should talk with your physician if you or someone you know has any of the signs and symptoms associated with multiple sclerosis or if you have any concerning symptoms. Several of the symptoms of multiple sclerosis may be severe enough to send the patient to a hospital's emergency department. Go to the nearest Emergency Department if you have any of the following symptoms: Visual changes and painful eye movements. Optic neuritis, one of the most common early signs of multiple sclerosis, causes these symptoms. If you experience personality changes or sudden loss of strength in the arms and legs. These symptoms are common with multiple sclerosis, but they can also be signs of other serious diseases that require urgent treatment such as , infection, or chemical imbalances. Managing Symptoms of MS with Diet, Exercise, and Alternative Treatments Some people with MS explore alternative forms of therapy and treatments, including many who are already taking drugs for the disease. Some people with multiple sclerosis have benefited from: Restorative, maintenance, and preventive rehabilitation Talk to your healthcare team about alternative treatments for MS.

a925962c-b7f3-474b-b5fb-6c8c1822b6d1,"Multiple sclerosis is an in which activated invade the and cause , , and tissue damage. The underlying cause is currently unknown. Current research in , , , and , together with , provide support for the notion that MS is not a single disease but rather a spectrum. There are three : , characterized by periods of neurological worsening following by remissions; , in which there is gradual progression of neurological dysfunction with fewer or no relapses; and , in which neurological deterioration is observed from onset. is a convergence of pathology with physiology. Pathology is the medical discipline that describes conditions typically observed during a disease state; whereas physiology is the biological discipline that describes processes or mechanisms operating within an organism. Referring to MS, the physiology refers to the different processes that lead to the development of the lesions and the pathology refers to the condition associated with the lesions. Multiple sclerosis can be pathologically defined as the presence of distributed (or ) in the disseminated in time (DIT) and space (DIS). The gold standard for MS diagnosis is pathological correlation, though given its limited availability, other diagnosis methods are normally used. The scleroses that define the disease are the remainders of previous demyelinating lesions in the CNS white matter of a patient () showing special characteristics, such as confluent instead of perivenous demyelination. There are two phases for how an unknown underlying condition may cause damage in MS: An unknown soluble factor (produced by CD8+ T-cells or CD20+ B-cells), creates a toxic environment that activates microglia. with hidden damage appear in the brain and spine (). Some clusters of activated , axonal transection and myelin degeneration are present. appear and immune cells infiltrate, causing . and axon destruction. Multiple sclerosis differs from other in its confluent cortical lesions. These types of lesions are the most specific finding for MS, being exclusively present in MS patients, though currently they can only be detected at autopsy. Most MS findings take place inside the white matter, and lesions appear mainly in a periventricular distribution (clustered around the ventricles of the brain). Apart from demyelination, the and deep (GM) nuclei can be affected, together with diffuse injury of the NAWM. GM atrophy is independent of classical MS lesions and is associated with physical disability, fatigue, and cognitive impairment in MS At least five characteristics are present in CNS tissues of MS patients: beyond classical white matter lesions, production with , an environment fostering immune cell persistence, and a disruption of the outside of active lesions. The that give the name to the condition are produced by healing old lesions. MS is active even during remission periods. -like aggregates in the are formed only in secondary progressive MS. and correlate with the degree of subpial cortical demyelination and brain atrophy, suggesting that they might contribute to cortical pathology in SPMS These follicles are composed mainly of infected B-cells. Four different damage patterns have been identified in patient's brain tissues. The original report suggests that there may be several types of MS with different immune causes, and that MS may be a family of several diseases. Though originally a biopsy was required to classify the lesions of a patient, since 2012 it is possible to classify them by a blood test looking for antibodies against 7 lipids, three of which are cholesterol derivatives are believed to both impair myelin repair and aggravate inflammation. It is believed that they may correlate with differences in disease type and prognosis, and perhaps with different responses to treatment. In any case, understanding lesion patterns can provide information about differences in disease between individuals and enable doctors to make more effective treatment decisions. According to one of the researchers involved in the original research, ""Two patterns (I and II) showed close similarities to T-cell-mediated or T-cell plus antibody-mediated autoimmune encephalomyelitis, respectively. The other patterns (III and IV) were highly suggestive of a primary oligodendrocyte dystrophy, reminiscent of virus- or toxin-induced demyelination rather than autoimmunity."" The scar presents and around blood vessels, with preservation of , but no signs of activation. The scar presents T-cells and macrophages around blood vessels, with preservation of oligodendrocytes, as before, but also signs of activation can be found. This pattern has been considered similar to damage seen in NMO, though AQP4 damage does not appear in pattern II MS lesions Nevertheless, pattern II has been reported to respond to , which points to something pathogenic into the blood serum. The infiltration in these cases convert this pattern into a candidate for research into autoimmune connections like anti-, anti- or About the last possibility, research has found antiMOG antibodies in some pattern-II MS patients. Pattern II pathogenic T cells has been shown to be different from others The functional characterization shows that T cells releasing Th2 cytokines and helping B cells dominate the T-cell infiltrate in pattern II brain lesions. The scars are diffuse with inflammation, distal , activation and loss of (MAG). It is considered atypical and an overlap between MS and . The scars do not surround the blood vessels, and a rim of preserved myelin appears around the vessels. There is evidence of partial remyelinization and oligodendrocyte apoptosis. At first, some researchers thought it was an early stage of the evolution of the other patterns. Recently, it is thought that it represents ischaemia-like injury with absence of oligoclonal bands in the CSF, related to the pathogenesis of . The scar presents sharp borders and degeneration, with a rim of normal-appearing . There is a lack of oligodendrocytes in the center of the scar. There is no complement activation or MAG loss. These differences are noticeable only in early lesions and the heterogeneity was controversial for some time because some research groups thought that these four patterns could be a consequence of the age of the lesions. Nevertheless, after some debate among research groups, the four patterns model is accepted and the exceptional case found by Prineas has been classified as NMO For some investigation teams this means that MS is an immunopathogenetically heterogeneous disease. The latter hypothesis is further corroborated by a recent study that demonstrated significant differences in routine cerebrospinal fluid findings between patients with pattern I lesions and patients with non-pattern I lesions, including a lack of CSF-restricted oligoclonal bands, in most pattern II and III patients. Finally, some previously diagnosed with pattern II MS were later found to have in fact MOG-IgG-related encephalomyelitis, suggesting that both the current clinicoradiological diagnostic criteria for MS and the histopathological criteria for MS may be insufficiently specific. This was already indicated by previous studies that found a relatively high rate of false diagnoses of MS among patients with AQP4-IgG-positive neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders or MOG encephalomyelitis. Currently antibodies to and in sera, detected by , can be used as markers of the pathological subtype given by brain biopsy. Another development in this area is the finding that some lesions present defects that could distinguish types of lesions. In multiple sclerosis, inflammation, demyelination, and neurodegeneration are observed together. Some clinical trials have shown that the inflammation produces both the relapses and the demyelination, and that neurodegeneration (axonal transection) is independent from inflammation, produces the accumulative disability, and advances even when inflammation and demyelination are delayed. It seems that neurodegeneration is produced by damaged , which in turn comes from activated . Currently it is unknown what the primary cause of MS is; if MS is a heterogeneous disease, the lesion development process would not be unique. In particular, some PPMS patients having a special clinical course named could have a special genetic cause and a different development process. Several types of damage appear in the brain: and characteristic . Changes in NAWM include axonal injury without demyelination, low-grade inflammation, and microglial and astrocytic activation Illustration of the four different types of glial cells found in the central nervous system: ependymal cells, astrocytes, microglial cells, and oligodendrocytes MS lesions develop inside NAWM areas. Their shape is influenced by their activity The most accepted sequence of events is first NAWM appearance, then the so-called pre-active lesions, with activated microglia, and finally the BBB breakdown, which enables the entry of T-cells to the CNS. This marks the beginning of an autoimmune attack which destroys myelin in active lesions. When the attack is resolved, a characteristic is formed by astrocytes. Current models can be divided into two categories: and . In the former, it is hypothesized that a problem in CNS cells produces an immune response that destroys myelin and subsequently breaks the BBB. In latter, an external factor produces BBB leaks, enters the CNS, and destroys myelin and axons. Whatever the underlying condition for MS is, it appears that damage is triggered by an unknown soluble factor in the CSF, potentially produced in meningeal areas; this factor can diffuse into the cortical parenchyma and destroy myelin either directly or indirectly through microglia activation. The evolution of a preactive lesion is related to reactivity. Increased expression of pro-inflammatory cell surface markers have been observed in NAWM and ""initial"" lesions, corresponding to a so-called loss of homeostatic microglial equilibrium. Some authors report active lesion formation before BBB breakdown; others point to as a factor of the breakdown. MS lesions are driven mainly by . It has been found recently that B-cells are also involved. The () is a protective barrier that denies the entrance of foreign material into the nervous system. BBB disruption is the moment in which penetration of the barrier by lymphocytes occur and has been considered one of the early problems in MS lesions. The BBB is composed of which line the walls of the central nervous system. Compared to normal endothelial cells, the cells lining the BBB are connected by and which form in order to create a barrier to keep out larger molecules such as proteins. In order to pass through, molecules must be taken in by or an alteration in the BBB permeability must occur, such as interactions with associated like ZO-1, ZO-2 and ZO-3. The BBB is compromised due to active recruitment of lymphocytes and monocytes and their migration across the barrier. Release of allow for the activation of on the lymphocytes and monocytes, resulting in an interaction with the endothelial cells of the BBB which then activate the expression of to degrade the barrier. This results in disruption of the BBB, causing an increase in barrier permeability due to the degradation of tight junctions which maintain barrier integrity. Inducing the formation of tight junctions can restore BBB integrity and reduces its permeability, which can be used to reduce the damage caused by lymphocyte and monocyte migration across the barrier as restored integrity would restrict their movement. After barrier breakdown symptoms may appear, such as . Activation of and lymphocytes and their migration across the barrier may result in direct attacks on myelin sheaths within the central nervous system, leading to the characteristic demyelination event observed in MS. After demyelination has occurred, the degraded myelin sheath components, such as and , are then used as identifying factors to facilitate further immune activity upon myelin sheaths. Further activation of cytokines is also induced by macrophage and lymphocyte activity, promoting inflammatory activity as well continued activation of such as matrix metalloproteinases, which have detrimental effect on BBB integrity. Recently it has been found that BBB damage happens even in non-enhancing lesions. MS has an important vascular component. Postmortem studies of the BBB, especially the vascular endothelium, show immunological abnormalities. Microvessels in periplaque areas coexpressed HLA-DR and VCAM-1, some others HLA-DR and urokinase plasminogen activator receptor, and others HLA-DR and ICAM-1. The damaged white matter is known as ""Normal-appearing white matter"" (NAWM) and is where lesions appear. These lesions form in NAWM before blood–brain barrier breakdown. BBB can be broken centripetally (the most normal) or centrifugally. Several possible biochemical disrupters were proposed. Some hypotheses about how the BBB is compromised revolve around the presence of compounds in the blood that could interact with vessels only in the NAWM areas. The permeability of two , and , may be involved in BBB breakdown. Breakdown is responsible for infiltration and inflammation in the brain. Monocyte migration and -mediated attachment to brain microvascular endothelia is regulated by through . Using iron nanoparticles, involvement of macrophages in BBB breakdown can be detected. A special role is played by . These increase BBB T-cell permeability, specially in the case of MMP-9 and are supposedly related to the mechanism of action of interferons. Whether BBB dysfunction is the cause or the consequence of MS is disputed, because activated T-Cells can cross a healthy BBB when they express adhesion proteins. Apart from that, activated T-Cells can cross a healthy BBB when they express adhesion proteins. (Adhesion molecules could also play a role in inflammation) In particular, one of these adhesion proteins involved is (Activated Leukocyte Cell Adhesion Molecule, also called ), and is under study as therapeutic target. Another protein involved is , which is found also in brain biopsies of inflammatory elements, and which could be related to the behavior of under therapy. Some molecular biochemical models for relapses have been proposed. Normally, gadolinium enhancement is used to show BBB disruption on MRIs. Abnormal tight junctions are present in both SPMS and PPMS. They appear in active white matter lesions and in gray matter in SPMS. They persist in inactive lesions, particularly in PPMS. A deficiency was implicated in this process. Uric acid added in physiological concentrations (i.e. achieving normal concentrations) is therapeutic in MS by preventing BBB breakdown through inactivation of . The low level of uric acid found in MS victims is manifestedly causative rather than a tissue damage consequence in the white matter lesions, but not in the grey matter lesions. Uric acid levels are lower during relapses. It is not known what causes MS. Several problems appear together with the white matter lesions, like cortical lesions and normal-appearing tissues. Several theories have been proposed to explain it. Some areas that appear normal under normal MRI look abnormal under special MRI, like magnetisation transfer MTR-MRI. These are called Normal Appearing White Matter (NAWM) and Normal Appearing Grey Matter (NAGM). The cause why the normal appearing areas appear in the brain is unknown, but seems clear that they appear mainly in the ventricles and that they predict the course of the disease. Given that MS lesions begin inside the NAWM areas, these areas are expected to be produced by the same underlying condition that produces the lesions, and therefore the ultimate MS underlying condition, whatever it is. Historically, several theories about how these areas appear have been presented: The search for an auto-antigen has taken a long time, but at least there is one reported. It is the enzyme This theory in part could also explain why some patients report amelioration under dietary treatment. (HERVs) have been reported in MS for several years. In fact, one of the families, was first discovered while studying MS patients. Recent research as of 2019 point to one of the HERV-W viruses (pHEV-W), and specifically one of the proteins of the that has been found to activate in vitro. Activated microglia in turn produces demyelination. Some interactions between the and the HERVs could be the trigger of the MS microglia reactions. Supporting this study, a against the viral capside () has shown good results in trials in phase IIb. Venous pathology has been associated with MS for more than a century. Pathologist noted in 1863 that the inflammation-associated lesions were distributed around veins. Some other authors like pointed to venous obstructions. Mechanical flow: Later the focus moved to softer hemodynamic abnormalities, which were showing precede changes in sub-cortical gray matter and in substantia nigra. However, such reports of a ""hemodynamic cause of MS"" are not universal, and possibly not even common. At this time the evidence is largely anecdotal and some MS patients have no blood flow issues. Possibly vascular problems may be an aggravating factor, like many others in MS. Indeed, the research, by demonstrating patients with no hemodynamic problems actually prove that this is not the only cause of MS. Endothelium: Other theories point to a possible primary endothelial dysfunction. The importance of vascular misbehaviour in MS pathogenesis has also been independently confirmed by seven-tesla . It is reported that a number of studies have provided evidence of vascular occlusion in MS, which suggest the possibility of a primary vascular injury in MS lesions or at least that they are occasionally correlated. Venous insufficiency: Some morphologically special medullar lesions (wedge-shaped) have also been linked to venous insufficiency. BBB infection: It has also been pointed out that some infectious agents with positive correlation to MS, specially , can cause problems in veins and arteries walls CCSVI: The term ""chronic cerebrospinal venous insufficiency"" was coined in 2008 by Paolo Zamboni, who described it in patients with multiple sclerosis. Instead of intracranial venous problems he described extracranial blockages, and he stated that the location of those obstructions seemed to influence the clinical course of the disease. According to Zamboni, CCSVI had a high differentiating healthy individuals from those with . Zamboni's results were criticized as some of his studies were not blinded and they need to be verified by further studies. As of 2010 the theory is considered at least defensible A more detailed evidence of a correlation between the place and type of venous malformations imaged and the reported symptoms of multiple sclerosis in the same patients was published in 2010. Haemodynamic problems have been found in the blood flow of MS patients using Doppler, initially using (TCCS), pointing to a relationship with a vascular disease called (CCSVI). In 2010 there were conflicting results when evaluating the relationship between MS and CCSVI. but is important to note that positives have appeared among the blinded studies. CSF flow: Other theories focus in the possible role of flow impairment. This theory could be partially consistent with the previous one. Currently a small trial with 8 participants has been performed Whatever the underlying primary condition is, it is expected to be a soluble factor in the CSF, maybe an unknown or , or a combination of them. Also B-cells and microglia could be involved. In particular, it is known that B-cells of MS patients secrete an unknown toxin against oligodendrocytes It has been reported several times that CSF of some MS patients can damage myelin in culture and mice and have been recently brought into the stage. Whatever the problem is, it produces of neurons respecting astrocytes In 2012 it was reported that a subset of MS patients have a seropositive anti- status, which can represent up to a 47% of the MS cases, and the study has been reproduced by at least two other groups. In 2016 a similar association was reported for anti--2 If the existence of any of these subsets of MS is confirmed, the situation would be similar to what happened for Devic Disease and . MS could be considered a or a new medical entity will be defined for these cases. Some authors propose a primary neurodegenerative factor. Maybe the strongest argument supporting this theory comes from the comparison with NMO. Though autoimmune demyelination is strong, axons are preserved, showing that the standard model of a primary demyelination cannot be hold. The theory of the trans-synaptic degeneration, is compatible with other models based in the CSF biochemistry. Others propose an oligodendrocyte stress as primary dysfunction, which activates microglia creating the NAWM areas and others propose a yet-unknown intrinsic CNS trigger induces the microglial activation and clustering, which they point out could be again axonal injury or oligodendrocyte stress. Finally, other authors point to a cortical pathology which starts in the brain external layer () and progresses extending into the brain inner layers If as expected MS is an heterogeneous disease and the lesion development process would not be unique. In particular, some PPMS patients have been found to have a special genetic variant named which would behave differently from what here is explained. It is due to a mutation inside the , an to mutation in the position p.Arg415Gln, in an area that codifies the . Several for diagnosis, disease evolution and response to medication (current or expected) are under research. While most of them are still under research, there are some of them already well stablished: : They present proteins that are in the CNS or in blood. Those that are in CNS but not in blood suggest a diagnosis of MS. A polyspecific antiviral immune response against the viruses of , and found in 1992. In some reports the MRZR showed a lower sensitivity than OCB (70% vs. 100%), but a higher specificity (69% vs. 92%) for MS. (FLC). Several authors have reported that they are comparable or even better than oligoclonal bands. Golan, Daniel; Staun-Ram, Elsebeth; Miller, Ariel (2016). ""Shifting paradigms in multiple sclerosis"". .

In MS, the myelin sheath, a fatty tissue that surrounds and protects nerve fibers, is damaged. Inflammation also occurs which further destroys the sheath and eventually the nerves that it encompasses. This leads to areas of multiple scarring or sclerosis which can slow down or even block nerve signaling that is responsible for muscle coordination, strength, sensory information, and visual responses. Multiple sclerosis is chronic, however not contagious, and depending upon the severity of damage which occurs, can be debilitating. Most researchers of MS believe that it is an autoimmune disease in which the body mistakenly identifies its own tissues as foreign. This results in a response by the immune system to send antibodies and white blood cells to target the myelin sheath. It is still unclear as to why this action takes place, but it may be caused by a combination of genetic predisposition and exposure to a virus or bacterium. The virus entering the body may carry with it a protein that mimics the proteins of myelin, therefore causing an inappropriate reaction. This may be triggered by such situations as a viral infection of a cold ,flu, or even changes within the body following pregnancy. More than 300,000 people in the United States and over 1 million people worldwide are diagnosed with MS. The disease generally strikes women twice as often as men, between the ages of 20 to 40. The signs and symptoms of MS can vary widely depending on the individual and the specific nerves that may be affected. Some symptoms include abnormal sensations such as tingling, weakness or numbness in the arms or legs and possibly...

Pathophysiology of (MS) is a chronic inflammatory autoimmune demyelinating disease of the central nervous system, affecting the brain and spinal cord. MS affects approximately 400,000 people in the United States alone. The onset of MS is usually between 20 and 40 years of age and is more common in women; men may have a more severe progressive course (Luzzio, 2013). Life expectancy is shortened in persons with MS, and the survival rate is linked to disability. Death usually results from secondary complications but can also be due to primary complications unrelated to MS. The occurrence rate of MS is affected by gene-environment interactions in susceptible individuals (Huether & McCance, 2012). Definition of Disorder is a progressive, inflammatory, demyelinating disorder of the central nervous system (CNS), which can affect the peripheral nervous system (PNS) as well. This disorder affects movements, sensation, and bodily functions (National Society [NMSS], 2012). There are several types of MS, these include: mixed (general), spinal, and cerebellar. General MS affects both the CNS and PNS, while spinal and cerebellar affect the CNS.

Symptoms may be mild, such as numbness in the limbs, or severe, such as paralysis or loss of vision. The progress, severity, and specific symptoms of MS are unpredictable and vary from one person to another. Today, new treatments and advances in research are giving new hope to people affected by the disease. (MS) affects women more than men. The disorder is most commonly diagnosed between ages 20 and 40, but can be seen at any age. MS is caused by damage to the myelin sheath, the protective covering that surrounds nerve cells. When this nerve covering is damaged, nerve signals slow down or stop. The nerve damage is caused by inflammation. Inflammation occurs when the body’s own immune cells attack the nervous system. This can occur along any area of the brain, optic nerve, and spinal cord. It is unknown what exactly causes this to happen. The most common thought is that a virus or gene defect, or both, is to blame. Environmental factors may play a role.

It causes damage the myelin sheath, the material that surrounds and protects nerve cells (Marieb, 2012). This damage slows down the process in which the brain relays messages to the rest of the body, leading to a variety of symptoms. Some of the most common include pain and numbness; fatigue; walking, balance, and coordination problems; bladder and bowel dysfunction; vision problems; cognitive dysfunction; emotional changes and depression (National Society, n.d.). Though the exact cause of MS is unknown, it’s widely thought to be an autoimmune disease. Autoimmune diseases arise from an overactive immune response of the body against substances and tissues normally present in the body (Marieb, 2012). In other words, the body actually attacks its own cells. The immune system mistakes some part of the body as a pathogen and attacks it. The disease affects women more than men, often beginning sometime between the ages of 20 to 40. Recently, a study found that the incidence of MS appears to be higher in African American women than in caucasians, contradicting previous findings (Langer-Gould, Brara, Beaber, & Zhang, 2013).

Abstract Symptom-Specific Treatment and Multidisciplinary Care Abstract Symptom-Specific Treatment and Multidisciplinary Care Multiple sclerosis (MS) is the most common permanently disabling disorder of the central nervous system in young adults. Relapsing remitting MS is the most common type, and typical symptoms include sensory disturbances, Lhermitte sign, motor weakness, optic neuritis, impaired coordination, and fatigue. The course of disease is highly variable. The diagnosis is clinical and involves two neurologic deficits or objective attacks separated in time and space. Magnetic resonance imaging is helpful in confirming the diagnosis and excluding mimics. Symptom exacerbations affect 85% of patients with MS. Corticosteroids are the treatment of choice for patients with acute, significant symptoms. Disease-modifying agents should be initiated early in the treatment of MS to forestall disease and preserve function. Two immunomodulatory agents (interferon beta and glatiramer) and five immunosuppressive agents (fingolimod, teriflunomide, dimethyl fumarate, natalizumab, and mitoxantrone) are approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of MS, each with demonstrated effectiveness and unique adverse effect profiles. Symptom management constitutes a large part of care; neurogenic bladder and bowel, sexual dysfunction, pain, spasticity, and fatigue are best treated with a multidisciplinary approach to improve quality of life. Multiple sclerosis (MS) is the most common permanently disabling disorder of the central nervous system (CNS) in young adults. The prevalence varies by geographic region, ranging from 110 cases per 100,000 persons in the northern United States to 47 per 100,000 in the southern United States. Women, smokers, and persons residing at higher latitudes or with a family history of MS are at increased risk of disease. Those with increased exposure to sunlight and higher 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels are at decreased risk. Total costs associated with MS may exceed $50,000 per person annually.  Enlarge     Print Multiple sclerosis is a clinical diagnosis requiring two neurologic deficits or objective attacks separated in time and space.

For information about the SORT evidence rating system, go to Abstract Symptom-Specific Treatment and Multidisciplinary Care The most common type of MS is relapsing remitting MS . In the acute attack, T cells, B cells, and macrophages interact with adhesion molecules on blood vessel surfaces to traverse a blood-brain barrier weakened by matrix metalloproteinases. Once through, T cells and B cells release inflammatory mediators and immunoglobulins targeting the myelin sheath, while macrophages expose axonal surfaces and release harmful nitrous oxygen and oxygen free radicals. This cascade of events leads to demyelination and axonal injury.  Enlarge     Print Discrete attacks that evolve over days to weeks, followed by some degree of recovery over weeks to months; the patient has no worsening of neurologic function between attacks Initial relapsing remitting disease, followed by gradual neurologic deterioration not associated with acute attacks Primary progressive and progressive relapsing (10% of cases) Characterized by steady functional decline from disease onset; these types cannot be distinguished during early stages until attacks occur (progressive relapsing) or fail to occur (primary progressive); progressive relapsing is rarer than primary progressive *—Develops in about 50% of patients with relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis.

The diagnosis of MS should be questioned in the presence of abrupt/transient symptoms, prominent cortical features (seizures, aphasia), peripheral neuropathy, and other organ (cardiac, hematologic) involvement, because these are not typical of MS.  Enlarge     Print Conditions Potentially Confused with Multiple Sclerosis Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy Human immunodeficiency virus infection, Lyme disease, mycoplasma, syphilis Behçet syndrome, sarcoidosis, Sjögren syndrome, systemic lupus erythematosus Arteriovenous malformation, herniated disk, neoplasm Cerebrovascular accident, diabetes mellitus, hypertensive disease, migraine, vasculitis Alcohol, cocaine, isoniazid, lithium, penicillin, phenytoin (Dilantin) Folate deficiency, vitamin B deficiency, vitamin E deficiency Conditions Potentially Confused with Multiple Sclerosis Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy Human immunodeficiency virus infection, Lyme disease, mycoplasma, syphilis Behçet syndrome, sarcoidosis, Sjögren syndrome, systemic lupus erythematosus Arteriovenous malformation, herniated disk, neoplasm Cerebrovascular accident, diabetes mellitus, hypertensive disease, migraine, vasculitis Alcohol, cocaine, isoniazid, lithium, penicillin, phenytoin (Dilantin) Folate deficiency, vitamin B deficiency, vitamin E deficiency Abstract Symptom-Specific Treatment and Multidisciplinary Care MS is a clinical diagnosis.

In addition to MRI, evoked potentials (visual, auditory, and somatosensory) may provide objective evidence of deficits consistent with MS. Visual evoked potentials are especially helpful for persons with vision-related symptoms. Cerebrospinal fluid may be obtained, although this is not routinely recommended; analysis typically demonstrates oligoclonal bands and an increased immunoglobulin G concentration. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis is more useful in ruling out MS mimics and in diagnosing primary progressive MS than in diagnosing relapsing remitting MS.  Serologic testing is performed to exclude other diseases .  Enlarge     Print Serologic Tests to Rule Out Conditions That Mimic Multiple Sclerosis Rheumatologic disease, systemic lupus erythematosus Performed when appropriate to the clinical situation Autoantibody assays* (e.g., antineutrophil cytoplasmic, anticardiolipin, antiphospholipid, anti–SS-A, and anti–SS-B antibodies) Behçet syndrome, Sjögren syndrome, systemic lupus erythematosus, vasculitis *—These tests are commonly ordered by neurologists on initial consultation.

Abstract Symptom-Specific Treatment and Multidisciplinary Care Exacerbations affect 85% of patients with MS; infections and stress may play a role. For those with significant, acute symptoms, corticosteroids are the treatment of choice and have strong evidence of benefit. Although parenteral steroids build up to peak concentrations faster than oral preparations, a Cochrane review indicates no difference in effectiveness (as measured by clinical or radiologic markers) or safety between oral and parenteral preparations. If the disease is unresponsive to steroids, plasmapheresis may be performed. Plasma exchanges are relatively well tolerated and are usually performed every other day for 14 days. Abstract Symptom-Specific Treatment and Multidisciplinary Care The goal of disease-modifying therapy is to forestall disease, preserve function, and sustain healthy immune function while suppressing the T-cell autoimmune cascade thought to be responsible for demyelination and axonal damage. Early treatment at or before the diagnosis of clinically confirmed MS may delay damage to the CNS.  The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved seven agents for the treatment of MS: interferon beta, glatiramer (Copaxone), fingolimod (Gilenya), teriflunomide (Aubagio), dimethyl fumarate (Tecfidera), natalizumab (Tysabri), and mitoxantrone . Because of the chronic nature and evolving treatment of MS, disease-modifying treatment is typically managed by a neurologist with expertise in prescribing these potentially toxic agents.  Enlarge     Print Disease-Modifying Agents for Relapsing Remitting Multiple Sclerosis Injection site reactions (e.g., edema, inflammation, pain); influenza-like symptoms; leukopenia; elevated liver enzyme levels; depression and suicidal thoughts (increased with preexisting depression, neutralizing antibodies) Decrease in progression: RR = 0.69; (0.55 to 0.87) Injection site reactions, facial flushing, chest tightness, palpitations Decrease in disability at two years: MD = 0.33; (0.08 to 0.58) Annualized relapse rate vs. placebo: 0.18 vs. 0.40 Bradycardia (contraindicated in recent heart disease or arrhythmia); elevated liver enzyme levels Decrease in progression at two years: HR = 0.70; (0.55 to 0.87) Melanoma, macular edema, herpes encephalitis (only occurs at higher doses) Annualized relapse rate vs. placebo: 0.37 vs. 0.54 Alopecia, diarrhea, nausea, decreased white blood cell count, elevated liver enzyme levels, peripheral neuropathy Decrease in progression: HR = 0.76; (0.51 to 0.97) Annualized relapse rate vs. placebo: 0.17 vs. 0.36 Flushing, abdominal pain, lymphocytopenia, elevated liver enzyme levels Decrease in progression: HR = 0.62; (0.44 to 0.87) Infusion reactions, headache, fatigue, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy Decrease in progression at two years: RR = 0.74; (0.62 to 0.89) Myelosuppression, elevated liver enzyme levels, decreased cardiac function, leukemia Decrease in progression: OR = 0.30; (0.09 to 0.99) HR = hazard ratio; MD = mean difference; OR = odds ratio; RR = relative risk. *—Estimated retail price of treatment for one year based on information obtained at .

Interferon beta, an immunomodulatory agent with more than 20 years of safety data, is effective in decreasing exacerbations and the progression of relapsing remitting MS. Interferon beta is available in three injectable formulations. Common adverse effects include local reactions and influenza-like symptoms. Interferon treatment may be associated with suicidal thoughts, so other agents should be considered in patients with depression. Glatiramer is an alternative immunomodulatory daily injection for relapsing remitting MS with a good safety record. Glatiramer decreases relapse and progression of disability at two years. Common adverse effects include local and systemic injection reactions (e.g., chest tightness, palpitations). Glatiramer should be avoided in persons with known hypersensitivity to this agent. Fingolimod is the first oral agent that is FDA approved for disease modification in relapsing remitting MS. A study of 1,272 patients between 18 and 55 years of age with relapsing remitting MS compared fingolimod with placebo, and demonstrated a decrease in annual exacerbations and progression of disease at two years. Bradycardia is a known adverse effect; patients should be observed for six hours after taking their first dose, and the medication is contraindicated in those with recent heart disease or arrhythmia. The FDA has approved two additional oral agents. Teriflunomide, approved in September 2012, has been shown to decrease relapse rates compared with placebo. Adverse effects include elevated transaminase levels, alopecia, and diarrhea. Teriflunomide carries an FDA warning for hepatic toxicity. Dimethyl fumarate, approved in March 2013, has been shown to decrease relapses and disease progression. Adverse effects include flushing, abdominal pain, decreased lymphocyte counts, and elevated transaminase levels. All of these oral agents suppress the immune system and put patients at risk of opportunistic infections. Because of this, these agents are typically used when the disease does not respond to, or the patient is unable to tolerate, an immunomodulatory agent. Natalizumab and mitoxantrone are immunosuppressive agents reserved for disease that does not respond to first-line agents. Although both are effective, natalizumab carries an FDA warning for progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, and mitoxantrone carries a warning for cardiotoxicity. Ongoing trials are evaluating the effectiveness and safety of additional agents in the treatment of MS to include the injectable daclizumab and oral cladribine and siponimod. Symptom-Specific Treatment and Multidisciplinary Care Abstract Symptom-Specific Treatment and Multidisciplinary Care Multidisciplinary treatment of primary and associated symptoms is essential in enhancing the quality of life in younger and older patients with MS. More than 70% of patients with MS have urinary tract dysfunction, with 10% demonstrating urinary symptoms at initial diagnosis. Urinary dysfunction can be classified as failure to store or empty, and can be differentiated with postvoid residual testing. Failure-to-store symptoms are typically treated with anticholinergic medications, although patients should be cautioned about adverse effects, such as dry mouth and confusion. Nocturia may respond to limited evening fluid intake or intranasal desmopressin; if desmopressin is prescribed, patients should be cautioned about the potential for hyponatremia. Injectable onabotulinumtoxinA (Botox) may be used if symptoms do not respond to these agents. Failure-to-empty symptoms are treated with clean intermittent catheterization, although some may respond to an alpha adrenergic blocker. Up to 75% of patients with MS experience constipation, incontinence, or both. Treatment should include dietary fiber, bulk-forming agents, and adequate hydration. Rectal stimulants, stool softeners, and enemas may be used if needed. Colostomy is an option for patients with intolerable symptoms. About 50% to 90% of men and 40% to 85% of women with MS have some type of sexual dysfunction. Although sexual dysfunction may have a considerable negative impact on quality of life, it is often unaddressed. Men are primarily treated with peripherally acting phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors. There is no established pharmacologic agent for women. Collaboration with a sex therapist or couples counselor may be beneficial. Approximately 85% of patients with MS report pain during the course of their illness. Those with pain report poorer health and poorer psychological functioning. Trigeminal neuralgia and dysesthetic (neuropathic) limb pain are common. Trigeminal neuralgia is initially treated with carbamazepine (Tegretol) and baclofen (Lioresal), as it is in persons without MS. Neuropathic pain in MS may be treated with tricyclic antidepressants, anticonvulsants, and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. Hydrotherapy has also been shown to be helpful in pain management, and is beneficial for the spasticity associated with MS. Cannabinoid therapy may be helpful for pain symptoms. It is estimated that 70% to 80% of patients with MS experience muscle spasticity. These symptoms are best treated with a multidisciplinary approach, incorporating modalities such as physical, occupational, and electromagnetic therapy. Baclofen is a first-line agent and works by decreasing alpha motor neuron activity. Oral baclofen has a short half-life and is associated with daytime sedation and muscle weakness. Intrathecal baclofen can be used to avoid daytime sedation, although muscle weakness may still occur. Diazepam (Valium) and gabapentin (Neurontin) may be used alone or in conjunction with baclofen. OnabotulinumtoxinA, with or without concomitant physical therapy, may also be helpful. Although cannabinoid therapy has been used for spasticity, the evidence for its effectiveness is mixed. The American Academy of Neurology states that patients should be counseled that these agents are probably ineffective for objective spasticity. More than 90% of patients with MS report fatigue; one-third report it to be their most troubling symptom, and many present with it. Although fatigue may occur as a result of comorbid depression, it also may appear independently. Fatigue has profound impacts on quality of life and is a leading cause of disability claims. Treatment for fatigue is multifocal. After evaluating for comorbid causes of fatigue (e.g., sleep disorders, thyroid disease, vitamin B deficiency, anemia), environmental manipulation, such as controlling heat and humidity levels, may help prevent flare-ups. Energy conservation measures such as napping and the use of assistive devices for mobility may be recommended based on the individual patient. Amantadine has been used off label in a limited number of trials and has been found to be beneficial for fatigue, although it is associated with insomnia and confusion. Other medications, such as modafinil (Provigil), have been tried with mixed results, and are not FDA approved for patients with MS. Abstract Symptom-Specific Treatment and Multidisciplinary Care The prevalence of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus, and other vascular comorbidities in patients with MS is similar to that in the general population. The presence of these conditions may worsen the course of MS. In addition to using targeted MS and symptom-modifying therapies, physicians should also manage these comorbidities. Surveys show that more than 50% of patients with MS seek treatments such as acupuncture, chiropractic manipulations, massage, yoga, and herbal therapies.  Physicians should ask patients if they are using integrative treatments, and should be prepared to help them find quality information on the risks and benefits of the treatments they choose. provides information and resources on traditional and integrative treatments for MS.  Enlarge     Print Multiple Sclerosis Resources for Patients and Physicians Cleveland Clinic: Mellen Center for Multiple Sclerosis General information: http://my.clevelandclinic.org/multiple_sclerosis_center/default.aspx Information on integrative therapies: http://my.clevelandclinic.org/Documents/Multiple_sclerosis_center/4%20Alternative%20and%20Complementary%20Therapies%20for%20MS.pdf http://my.clevelandclinic.org/Documents/Multiple_sclerosis_center/integrative-medicine.pdf Information on integrative therapies: Information on integrative therapies: General and integrative medicine information: http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/multiplesclerosis.html General information: Information on integrative therapies: http://www.nationalmssociety.org/Treating-MS/Complementary-Alternative-Medicines Multiple Sclerosis Resources for Patients and Physicians Cleveland Clinic: Mellen Center for Multiple Sclerosis General information: http://my.clevelandclinic.org/multiple_sclerosis_center/default.aspx Information on integrative therapies: http://my.clevelandclinic.org/Documents/Multiple_sclerosis_center/4%20Alternative%20and%20Complementary%20Therapies%20for%20MS.pdf http://my.clevelandclinic.org/Documents/Multiple_sclerosis_center/integrative-medicine.pdf Information on integrative therapies: Information on integrative therapies: General and integrative medicine information: http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/multiplesclerosis.html General information: Information on integrative therapies: http://www.nationalmssociety.org/Treating-MS/Complementary-Alternative-Medicines : A PubMed search was completed using the keyword and medical subject heading multiple sclerosis.

c70b3798-33fc-4fb9-9c8b-375d9c673aec,"A well-balanced, healthy diet is important for everybody to maintain optimum health (1). Many people diagnosed with multiple sclerosis (MS) have questions about whether changes to their diet and nutrition can assist in symptom management. Although not conclusively proven, between 50% and 75% of people with MS have made changes to their diet (2). ‘I have been influenced to make diet and lifestyle changes after reading the Brain Health campaign by Professor Gavin Giovannoni.’ Although there is little existing research looking at diet in MS, a recent study using information from nearly 7,000 people with MS from North America, has concluded that a healthy lifestyle and diet are associated with lesser disability and symptom accumulation. The data from this study shows a convincing observational link between diet and disability (3). ‘I was given no options with conventional medicine. If you do your homework to make sure you eat a balanced diet, there is nothing to lose.’ Several diets have been created with MS in mind. Similar themes run through these diets and most involve reducing saturated fats, taking supplements and restricting or eliminating food groups. ‘Keeping to any diet may be tough at first. It's worth being in touch with others following the same diet for support and to answer questions.’ It is always suggested that you consult your GP, neurology specialist or MS nurse before starting to take any supplements or making any changes to your diet.  Below you will find an overview of a selection of the more popular diets and additional information about MS specific dietary research and supplements.  ‘A lot of people dismiss the power of diet. The advice I would give for others with MS is to try a diet and see if it helps you. I would also recommend that you give the diet adequate time, don't quit too early and listen to your body.’ ‘I have found that the lighter my body weight, the less pain I suffer. I have reduced alcohol and restricted some fats and incorporated others and maintain a broadly healthy diet and I feel it has had a positive impact on me and my MS.’ One of the most well-known diet’s relating to MS is the Swank diet. Dr Roy Laver Swank MD PhD, was the first head of neurology at what is now Oregon Health & Science University and began his research into diet and MS in the 1940s. His observations of the prevalence of MS in certain geographic areas led him to believe there was a correlation between MS and diet. Dr Swank believed a low fat diet would help to alleviate some MS symptoms (4). ‘I am on the Swank diet, but also go gluten free. It was hard to start with but fine now and I have been following it for years.’ The Swank diet recommends a reduction in consumption of saturated and unsaturated fat which can be found in meat (particularly red meat) and processed foods, dairy and products containing dairy. The diet recommends reducing the amounts of saturated fat to less than 15 grams a day and having 20-50 grams a day of unsaturated fat (such as olive and flaxseed oils). The Swank diet also recommends cod liver oil and vitamin supplements (5). Follow up research based on the late Dr Swank’s work has been carried out by a former colleague Dr John McDougall. A study titled ‘Low-fat, plant-based diet in multiple sclerosis: A randomised controlled trial’ was published in September 2016. This randomised study was a year in duration and had 61 participants (29 in the control group). The study concluded that although there were no noteworthy positive outcomes in relation to brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), relapse rate or disability (scored by Expanded Disability Status Score) over one year there were other encouraging results. The participants involved in the diet showed significant improvements in fatigue and other health outcomes (such as body mass index). The results of this trial show that further research is needed (6). ‘I followed Swank initially (from 1981), OMS (Professor Jelinek) since 2009. So low saturated fat initially and now plant-based with seafood. Plus high doses of vitamin D and flaxseed oil. I’m healthier in so many ways as a result and do feel better for a clean diet.’ Drawing on the Swank research and learning, Professor George Jelinek’s approach focuses on a largely plant-based, very low saturated fat diet, with omega 3 supplements in the form of cold-pressed flaxseed oil. Professor Jelinek was diagnosed with MS in 1999. His mother also had MS. The Overcoming Multiple Sclerosis (OMS) diet has been in existence for over 15 years, and is constantly being worked on as more evidence is gathered (7).  ‘I have followed the OMS diet for about 7 years and won't go back.’ The OMS diet is part of an ‘evidence based whole lifestyle program approach’ that also includes vitamin D, exercise and meditation (8). In the HOLISM study (Health Outcomes and Lifestyle in a Sample of people with Multiple Sclerosis) Professor Jelinek and colleagues at the University of Melbourne are looking at expanding the literature and studies available on the effects of lifestyle on the progression of MS. They are especially focussing on the possible benefit of diet, exercise, vitamin D, omega-3 supplementation, and reducing stresses. The ongoing study recruits participants via online platforms including forums and social media and 2,469 people have taken part in the study with 2,087 giving full data on their dietary habits. Participants in the HOLISM study are followed at two and a half year intervals. Broadly, the published paper titled ‘The association of diet with quality of life, disability, and relapse rate in an international sample of people with multiple sclerosis’ found that ‘healthy’ consumption of fruit and vegetables and dietary fat predicted better quality of life and less likelihood of higher disability when compared to respondents with a ‘poor’ diet (8). ‘I made changes after consulting a nutritionist when I was diagnosed in 1999 and I am now following the OMS programme.’ Professor Jelinek’s foundation holds regular retreats in Australia, the UK and Ireland. The retreats support people with MS in gaining the knowledge and skills needed to make the lifestyle changes to follow the program. People who follow the OMS lifestyle and diet can also get support from the OMS charity in the form of their active forum, useful exercise videos, regular podcasts and people who are newly diagnosed in the UK or Ireland can request a free copy of the OMS book (7). ‘I'm following Overcoming MS which has a strict diet. It seems to be doing me good! Basically vegan plus fish and nothing fried, the only oil is extra virgin olive oil and flaxseed oil. The latter to be taken daily as a very rich source of omega-3.’ Dr Terry Wahls is a clinical professor of medicine at the University of Iowa. In 2000 she was diagnosed with relapsing remitting MS (RRMS). A diagnosis of secondary progressive MS (SPMS) followed in 2003. As her condition progressed, Dr Wahls started to use a tilt-recline wheelchair, a situation that continued for four years.  Shortly after Dr Wahls underwent chemotherapy in an attempt to arrest the progression of her condition, she began studying biochemistry, immunology and cell biology. She went on to design a regime of supplements to ‘feed the brain’.  ‘I found that reading the book ‘The Wahls Protocol’ really helped focus me.’ In 2007 Dr Wahls worked with Functional Medicine, an organisation focused on working with doctors to improve the health of people with chronic illnesses.  As a result, Dr Wahls designed a diet called the Wahls Protocol. This diet is based on key elements of the paleolithic (or paleo) diet. A paleolithic diet is based on foods similar to those that would have been eaten during the paleolithic era. A paleo diet typically includes lean meats, fish, fruits, vegetables, nuts and seeds — foods that could be obtained by hunting and gathering. Dr Wahls attributes this protocol to an improvement in her health and motor function. She can now walk without mobility aids and cycles to work (4).  ‘I recommend giving the paleo diet a try - like the Wahls protocol but with some leeway - I can’t eat that much meat every day and don’t like fish - but still found an improvement.’ The Wahls protocol eliminates sugar, processed foods, grains (wheat, oats, rice), soy, dairy, eggs, potatoes, tomatoes and legumes (beans and lentils) and increases the intake of grass fed meat, fish, fruit, vegetables (especially green leafy vegetables) and plenty of fat from animal and plant sources, (especially omega-3 fatty acids). The Wahls diet is quite prescriptive about the amounts of certain types of food to eat. The protocol says that a follower should eat six to nine cups of non-starchy vegetables a day and four ounces of protein (fish, specifically twice a week). Dr Wahls uses these diets and protocols in her primary care and traumatic brain injury clinics. Dr Wahls and colleagues ran a small trial for people with SPMS which included a modified paleolithic diet with supplements, stretching, exercises and electrical stimulation (of trunk and lower limb muscles), meditation and massage. The small uncontrolled pilot study found that there was significant improvement in fatigue for those that completed the study. The study had a very small number of participants and not all of those that signed up to the study completed the trial. The results were suggestive that further studies are needed (5). ‘Over thirty years ago when I was diagnosed, I read the book by Judy Graham and made sure I changed my diet and took supplements. After attending a seminar with Dr Terry Wahls I changed to grass fed meat, wheat, gluten and dairy free.’ ‘I have tried Dr Wahls diet but found it too difficult to live with. There is so much conflicting information, it confuses me i.e. no legumes so I cut them out, then read another diet that tells me pulses are good. I don’t have dairy or gluten and I find this does improve my MS.’ A further study was published early in 2017 evaluating a modified paleolithic diet in the treatment of fatigue and other symptoms in RRMS. This small randomised controlled study found that a paleolithic diet may be helpful in both the treatment and management of MS. The outcomes found during the study were that there was a reduction in perceived fatigue, positive reports over mental and physical quality of life, there were gains in exercise capacity and improvements in hand and leg function. Increased vitamin K serum levels were seen in the study participants (compared to the control group) indicating that a modified paleolithic diet may help reduce inflammation (6).  ‘I avoid dairy and majority of gluten. I also follow Wahls protocol (I do a modified version of the diet by having a plateful of fruit or veg for breakfast and lunch). Regarding supplements, I take vitamin D3, a multivitamin and fish oil daily. I feel better for it.’ ‘I eliminated all dairy from my diet is as a result of reading the Wahls Protocol and OMS books. It's the one dietary change they both agree on so seems like a good bet.’ Ashton Embry PhD developed his Best Bet diet and the charity DIRECT-MS (Diet Research into the Cause and Treatment of Multiple Sclerosis) in the late nineteen nineties after his son was diagnosed with MS. His diet is based on the theory that an autoimmune process is ignited by undigested food proteins escaping through the gut wall into the circulatory system. The immune system sees these proteins as invaders and starts to attack. He refers to this as ‘leaky gut syndrome’ (12). ‘I have tried the Best Bet diet, it was hard for me to stick to, but I felt healthier as a result of a ‘clean’ diet.’ The Best Bet diet focuses on four main areas; foods to avoid, foods to eat in moderation, foods to increase and the use of supplements.  The Best Bet diet says that stopping, or restricting the consumption of foods that have a molecular structure similar to myelin, reduces the autoimmune response. Foods that are said to have a similar structure to myelin are listed below.   Including all animal milks and butters, cheeses and yoghurts made from animal milks and all products that contain them. A suitable alternative is rice milk or low-fat coconut milk. Found in wheat, rye, oats and barley, and all products containing them. These can be replaced by rice, corn, quinoa and gluten-free flours and grains. Beans, peas and pulses, especially soya, and all products containing them. All other vegetables are allowed. Although not a protein, refined sugar is believed to make leaking of food proteins worse. Alternative natural sweetening agents include honey, maple syrup, fruit sugar (fructose) and stevia. The Best Bet diet also says that there are certain food types that should be eaten in moderation. These foods are red meats (due to saturated fat levels), omega-6 polyunsaturated fats (found in margarine and cooking oils), grains such as rice and corn/maize and alcohol (other than red wine). The Best Bet diet encourages people to increase and eat freely fish, skinless chicken breast and game meat, and suggests that vegetables are eaten as much as is possible. Fruit is also encouraged with an emphasis on berries (13).   Supplements are an important part of the Best Bet diet. The diet suggests that a wide range of vitamins, minerals and antioxidants are taken daily including high dose vitamin D (14). It is also suggested that a person wishing to follow the Best Bet diet has a food intolerance blood test to identify the foods they may be sensitive to (13). ‘I follow the Best Bet diet and it has become second nature.’ There is often a misconception that all bacteria are harmful to humans and pose a threat to our health. Interestingly, there are more bacteria that establish symbiotic relationships with us than microbes that cause ill health.  ‘My tip for others would be to take good quality probiotics, a healthy gut is important.’ In the last few years, there has been a large increase in the number of studies focused upon connecting the gut microbiome with cases of central nervous system autoimmunity. Recent evidence suggests the presence of microbial imbalances in the gut of people with MS. Unhealthy gut microbiome can be a source of inflammation and this could potentially adversely affect MS, possibly due to the inflammatory response within the gut microbiota. It is felt by some researchers that targeting the gut microbiome with therapeutics could have profound effects in disease progression, as well as managing symptoms of disease. There are various options for targeting the gut microbiome including with antibiotics; phage therapy, which uses bacteria-specific viruses that can be used to target certain bacteria, while leaving others untouched; Faecal Microbiota Transplantation (FMT) which acts as whole gut microbiome replacement in the hope of correcting abnormal gut microbiome structures and functions and dietary supplementation. Diet is the main factor shaping the structure of the gut microbiome and the microbiome is easily changed with dietary and supplement choices (17).  ‘Our body needs the correct fuel via food and supplements to help our brain’s mitochondria perform as well as they can. Reading Dr Wahls, George Jelinek, Dr Mercola and Patrick Holford’s work has meant significant and positive changes to my diet and lifestyle.’ In Issue 110 of MS-UK’s New Pathways magazine Sharon Peck, who lives with MS and who is a Nutrition Scientist wrote about nine anti-inflammatory foods that may influence the gut microbiome positively. Particularly rich dark, leafy greens, as they contain polyphenols and antioxidants, which can directly reduce inflammation. Vegetables’ high fibre content feeds the microbiome. A small Italian trial found a high vegetable diet reduced inflammation, improved gut microbiome and helped to improve overall health. Some fruits, especially deeply coloured berries, which are potent antioxidants can reduce inflammation. They also provide food for the microbiome, helping to keep your gut healthy. Try and make sure you are getting your 5-a-day, and aim for 10 if you can, after the NHS recently reported that 10 portions of fruit and vegetables is even better for us. Mackerel, salmon and sardines are all sources of essential fatty acids (EFAs) omega-3s, which UK researchers found increased anti-inflammatory bacteria in the microbiome and may help directly resolve inflammation. Nuts are a source of required omega-6 EFA, which can be inflammatory in excess. Walnuts have a balance of omega-6 and omega-3, and research has shown they promote anti-inflammatory microbes. Research found that walnut oil reduced inflammation in a mouse model of MS. Seeds are another great source of EFAs. Some seeds, such as flax and chia seeds have a high anti-inflammatory omega-3 content. Extra-virgin olive oil is a source of antioxidant vitamin E and anti-inflammatory polyphenols. A review of multiple trials indicated that this oil could improve inflammatory disease symptoms. Ginger has well known anti-inflammatory properties. An Iranian researcher indicated it may reduce inflammation in mice with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), which is a disease similar to MS. Turmeric has been in the news a lot recently and is now well known for its anti-inflammatory properties, but it has poor absorption. Consume it with healthy fats and black pepper to improve the absorption. Legumes and whole grains are another good sources of fibre which could be of benefit to the gut microbiota. Sharon also posted a more detailed and well-sourced blog on her website updating the article with all relevant links to the trials and research mentioned (16). ‘I read MS-UK’s New Pathways magazine which has always included information about diet and MS.’ Researchers at the University of Southern California (USC) have been looking into a ‘fasting mimicking diet’ to see if it had a positive impact on MS. The diet involves eating half the usual number of calories for three days in every seven. When mice with EAE, which is a disease similar to MS, were fed the diet for three weeks, they showed improvements in their symptoms compared to a control group who maintained a standard diet. The researchers also checked the safety and potential efficacy of the diet over a period of six months on 60 people who have RRMS through a pilot trial in Berlin. Some patients were placed on the fasting mimicking diet for a seven day cycle and then placed on a Mediterranean diet for six months. Some were placed on a ketogenic diet (a high-fat, low carbohydrate diet) for six months. Some participants were part of the control group and retained their normal diet.  Participants who used a fasting mimicking diet cycle followed by the Mediterranean diet and those on a ketogenic diet reported improvements in their quality of life and improvements in physical and mental health. Those on the fasting mimicking and ketogenic diets showed a 'mild improvement' in disability measured with the EDSS scale. The researchers felt that the study had limitations as it did not test whether the Mediterranean diet alone would cause improvements, nor did the study involve a MRI tests to assess disease activity. Larger trials will be needed to better understand the effects and potential benefits of the diet (17). ‘The Mediterranean diet is dead easy to follow and it’s good as it’s only eating fresh food.’ Valter Longo, the lead researcher looking into the fasting mimicking diet, and director of the Longevity Institute at the University of Southern California has written a book called ‘The Longevity Diet’. The book contains recipe ideas and explains the full science behind the diet. All the profits from sale of The Longevity Diet are being donated by the author to the non-profit organisations ‘Valter Longo Foundation’ and ‘Create Cures’ with the aim of promoting and sponsoring research on low cost, alternative, and integrated therapies for diseases and long terms conditions such as Alzheimer’s disease, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes and MS (16). A study titled ‘Diet quality is associated with disability and symptom severity in MS’ was published in December 2017 and involved around 7,000 people with MS. It assessed how diet quality in people with MS is associated with disability.   ‘There have been all round benefits to my overall health from the changes I have made to my diet. I never catch colds and IBS [irritable bowel syndrome] and gastric troubles of the past have never returned. If I accidentally eat dairy or gluten my stomach is immediately very upset and my MS fatigue and clumsiness worsens.’ Researchers at John Hopkins School of Medicine used the NARCOMS (North American Research Committee on Multiple Sclerosis) dataset to look at the intake of specific foods and disability severity in people with MS. Participants completed a dietary screening questionnaire that estimates intake of fruits, vegetables and legumes, wholegrains, added sugars and red or processed meats. The researchers constructed an overall diet quality score for each individual based on these food groups and the higher the score the healthier the diet. They then assessed the association between diet quality and disability status.   ‘I have had MS for 25 years. In the last 5 years my symptoms have worsened, making SPMS the likely diagnosis. Nevertheless, I am still eating a healthy diet, taking supplements and making it to the gym regularly. I am fairly sure my continued diet, supplementation and exercise has had a significant positive impact on my wellbeing and fitness over the last two decades.’ Of the 7,639 responders, 6,989 reported physician-diagnosed MS and provided dietary information. Participants with highest diet quality scores had lower levels of disability and lower depression scores. Individuals reporting a composite healthy lifestyle also had lower odds of reporting severe fatigue, depression, pain, or cognitive impairment.  Researchers concluded that the large cross-sectional survey suggests a healthy diet and a composite healthy lifestyle are associated with lesser disability and symptoms in MS (3). ‘As I am also taking a DMT [disease modifying therapy] I do not know to what extent the diet is helping, but I certainly feel healthier overall.’ There are many dietary supplements available to support a variety of health needs and in recent years the health food market place has been flooded by a variety of supplements and vitamins. Below we list some of the main dietary supplements and vitamins that people with MS may choose to take.  ‘I have taken vitamins and supplements for over 20 years. Do they work? I don't know, but I may be worse if I didn't and they must have been beneficial to my body and what harm can they do?’ Vitamin D is important for a healthy immune system, brain development and function, and the cardiovascular system (heart and blood vessels). Vitamin D helps the body to absorb calcium and phosphorus – the building blocks for strong bones. There has long been an association between MS and vitamin D. MS-UK has a dedicated Choices leaflet on the subject. You can download a copy from our website or order a physical copy by contacting MS-UK. ‘I do feel the difference from taking supplements. With vitamin D there was almost an instant change. It even helped me sleep better.’ Lipoic acid was looked at during a study titled ‘Lipoic acid for neuroprotection in secondary progressive multiple sclerosis: results of a randomised placebo-controlled pilot trial’. The study was a 96 week, double-blind, randomised controlled trial using 1,200mg daily lipoic acid versus a placebo. The main outcome of the study was to look at reduction in whole brain atrophy as observed by MRI. This pilot trial of lipoic acid saw a significant reduction in whole brain atrophy and suggested a clinical benefit whilst maintaining safety, tolerability, and high compliance over 96 weeks. A larger trial is needed to fully confirm the neuroprotective effects, explore clinical benefits (19). The human body needs vitamin B12, also known as cobalamin, hydroxocobalamin or Cobalin-H, to make red blood cells and keep the nervous system healthy. More specifically related to MS, vitamin B12 is needed for a healthy myelin sheath, nervous system and bone marrow. NHS guidelines recommend that adults aged between 19-64 years need about 1.5mcg a day of vitamin B12. Vitamin B12 aids the release of energy from food and can be controlled using diet. Meat, salmon, cod, milk, cheese, eggs and some fortified cereals are a good source. If you do not eat many of these foods you may find a supplement can counter any potential deficiency.. According to NHS guidelines, taking 2mg or less a day of vitamin B12 in supplements is unlikely to cause any harm (20). If you are concerned, consult with your doctor as to your optimum dosage. ‘I took Ginkgo/ginseng and B12 initially and I soon found it helped brain fog and energy levels. I now take CBD oil too.’ In April 2012, a study, titled “Vitamin B(12) Deficiency and Multiple Sclerosis; Is there Any Association?”, was conducted by the Department of Neurology and Isfahan Neuroscience Research Center, in Iran. This study aimed to evaluate the controversial association between vitamin B12 deficiency and MS.  MS and B12 are often linked because vitamin B12 deficiency can present similar symptoms to MS, such as extreme tiredness and lack of energy, pins and needles, muscle weakness and disturbed vision. If your doctor suspects a person may have MS they will conduct initial blood tests to check for vitamin B12 deficiency to rule this out first. The study measured vitamin B12 levels in the blood of 60 patients with MS and 38 healthy controls. Thirteen patients with MS and 10 controls were found to have low B12 levels, but there was no significant difference between the two groups. There was also no correlation between the concentration of vitamin B12 and the age of onset, duration, and subtype or disability status (21).   Another study my Dr T Wade, published in 2002 set out to determine whether a combination therapy known as the “Cari Loder regime” reduces disability in patients with MS. This regime involved a combination of lofepramine (an anti-depressant), L-phenylalanine (an amino acid) and intramuscular vitamin B12. The study was carried out in five UK centres on outpatients with MS with measurable disability on Guy’s Neurological Disability Scale (GNDS). Participants had to have experienced no relapses in the preceding six months and not be taking antidepressants. Over a period of 24 weeks all patients received 1mg of vitamin B12 intramuscularly weekly and either 70mg of lofepramine and 500mg of L-phenylalanine twice daily, or matching placebo tablets.    Of the 134 out of 138 patients who completed the trial, researchers found no statistically significant difference between the two groups at entry or at follow up. However, analysis of covariance suggested that treated patients had better outcomes on four of the five scales used. Patients with MS improved by 2 GNDS points after starting vitamin B12 injections. The addition of lofepramine and L-phenylalanine added a further 0.6 points benefit. These findings suggest some symptomatic improvement and researchers concluded that a small beneficial effect cannot be ruled out. More research is needed to confirm and explore the significance of this clinically small difference (22). It has been known for people with MS to use monthly injections of vitamin B12 to help combat fatigue. However, it should be noted that NICE does not recommend vitamin B12 injections for treating fatigue in people with MS because it is ‘confident that an intervention will not be of benefit for most patients’ (23). Omega-3 is a family of fats that are important for health, also known as polyunsaturated fats. Omega-3 is an essential fat, meaning that it is not produced in the human body and needs to be consumed. Omega-3 fats contain different compounds. Alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) has important functions and is needed to make other omega-3 fats. ALA is found mainly in vegetable oils, flaxseed (linseed), rapeseed and nuts (walnuts, pecans and hazelnuts) and green leafy vegetables Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) are long-chain fats that can be made from ALA in our bodies. They have the most direct health benefits and can play an important anti-inflammatory role (24) According to the British Dietetic Association, everyone should try to eat two portions of fish per week, one of which should be oily fish. In the UK there is no specific recommendation of a dose for omega-3. People who do not eat fish can get omega-3 from the following foods: nuts and seeds e.g. walnuts and pumpkin seeds; vegetable oils e.g. rapeseed and linseed; soya and soya products e.g. beans, milk and tofu; and green leafy vegetables. Some foods have omega-3 added to them and can be useful sources, especially for vegetarians and others who avoid fish. These include eggs and yoghurt, bread and spreads. These foods will help to increase your omega-3 intake (25). In April 2018 Medscape Medical News reported on some new research that found eating fish and seafood rich in omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids at least once a week combined with taking daily fish oil supplements may lower the risk for MS. Researchers looked at 1,153 patients with newly diagnosed MS or clinically isolated syndrome (CIS). They found a 45% reduced risk for MS or CIS among those with high fish intake and daily use of fish oil supplements compared with participants who ate fish less than once a month on average and who did not take supplements. Annette Langer-Gould, MD, PhD, Kaiser Permanente Southern California in Pasadena, told Medscape Medical News that the findings give ""more confidence"" that the omega-3s are providing the observed benefit vs a ""substitution effect"" and ""We found that fish/seafood/fish oil consumption is protective, and we really do think it's through omega-3 fatty acids"". She continued: ""The way I use this kind of data in clinic is when patients ask, 'How do I lower the risk of my children getting MS?' I would add this to the list."" ""When patients ask about their own diet, I would say we don't know for sure,"" Langer-Gould said. She tells her patients that ""two chronic diseases are worse than one, and you already have one, so let's do everything we can to prevent you from getting cardiovascular disease or diabetes"" (26). So far the wider research on omega 3 and MS has been mixed. In a piece of research published in 2016 titled ‘Higher intake of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids is associated with a decreased risk of a first clinical diagnosis of central nervous system demyelination: Results from the Ausimmune Study’, it was found that high omega-3 consumption was linked with a significant decrease in demyelination caused by MS (27). Whilst a study completed in 2012 in Norway titled ‘Omega-3 Fatty Acid Treatment in Multiple Sclerosis (OFAMS Study): A Randomised, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Trial’ found that there were no beneficial effects on MS disease activity (28). In their guidelines for the management of MS, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) have issued a ‘do not do’ recommendation, saying ‘do not offer omega-3 or omega-6 fatty acid compounds to treat MS’. NICE feels that there is no evidence that they affect relapse frequency or progression of MS (29). However, this is not to say that they do not have other benefits. Evening Primrose Oil (EPO) contains high levels of the essential fatty acid gamma-linolenic acid. EPO is a common supplement and has had associations with improving some MS symptoms. A recent small study explored the effect of EPO on fatigue and quality of life in patients with MS and had some positive findings. In this double-blind randomised trial, 52 people with MS were chosen and categorised into two groups which received either EPO or placebo. The ‘quality of life and fatigue scale’ was used in the trial and participants were investigated before the treatment and again three months after therapy. The findings were then compared between the two groups. The research found that EPO consumption had no impact on the quality of life in general; however, it had a significant effect on several important aspects of life quality such as the increase of cognitive function, vitality, and overall life satisfaction. EPO also reduced pain and fatigue in comparison to the placebo consumption, but it did not prevent progression of MS (30). ‘I have taken oil of evening primrose and followed a low fat diet since week one of my diagnosis 31 years ago.’ Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) is a coenzyme found in all living cells. It exists in two forms: an oxidized and reduced form (abbreviated as NAD+ and NADH respectively). These are the active coenzyme form of vitamin B3 (Niacin). There has been research into NAD+ and MS. According to Judy Graham’s book ‘Managing Multiple Sclerosis Naturally’ NAD+ boosts energy and the immune system (31). In a study it was reported that NAD+ has potential to be a future therapeutic drug to treat MS. This early stage study will help researchers look into NAD+ as a potential treatment for many auto immune diseases including MS, but more research is needed in humans to support the findings (32). The dietary supplement Nicotinamide Riboside (B3) and NAD+ is readily available from many health food shops and many stockists via the internet. In a blog post titled ‘The top 15 supplements for natural MS treatment’, Dr Ronald Hoffman, who is a complementary medicine practitioner from New York, recommends that 250mg of NAD+ is taken twice a day (33). Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) is produced by our bodies but diminishes as we age. It is involved in producing adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which is the cell’s main energy source and produces protein. CoQ10 is fat soluble, so Judy suggests that any supplementation should be taken with a meal that contains some fats (31). A double-blind placebo controlled trial in 2016 explored the effect of high-dose CoQ10 (500mg per day) on fatigue and depression in people with MS. This was a small trial with a total of 48 participants, mostly women and the researchers used the ‘Beck Depression Inventory’ and the ‘Fatigue Severity Scale’ to measure outcomes. After 12 weeks, significant improvements were seen and the study suggests that CoQ10 supplementation (500 mg/day) can improve fatigue and depression for people with MS (34). ‘My tip is to have it clear in your mind that you are making a ‘lifestyle change’ to support your MS. This will likely include dietary changes, supplements, yoga, Pilates, walking or exercise, meditation and mindfulness. It’s a lifestyle change that helps us manage symptoms better and improves our health and hence MS.’ We asked the MS community to share their 10 top tips for managing dietary changes, they are... ‘You can exchange white sugar for molasses, maple syrup, coconut sugar or honey if you have to have something sweet. To lessen the sweet addiction, I use drops of apple cider vinegar on anything. It takes a while to work, but it does.’ ‘My tip is to purchase a slow cooker. I use a slow cooker for one pot cooking, great when you are tired at the end of the day and a delicious meal just needs serving up. It makes life so much easier.’ ‘If you fancy cakes and biscuits - make them yourself instead of buying. That way you know what's in them. (And because it means more effort you do it less often!)’ ‘My tip is to plan in advance what you are going to eat, this helps with time management and decision making and helps with fatigue in the kitchen.’ ‘When I am well enough to cook, I make more than I need so I can freeze portions to avoid cooking on bad/busy days.’ ‘Smoothies are a great way to get a burst of fruit.’ ‘I try to plan my meals for the week ahead. I search online for recipes. There’s so much good information out there.’ ‘Scour the internet for yummy recipes (e.g. The Food Allergy Hub). Interestingly, sites for children/babies are a great source of recipes for dairy/gluten free meals, you can use them and adapt them for the adult pallet (more salt/pepper, spices etc).’ ‘I suggest mainly eating wholefoods and have a high vegetable intake, and my tip is to take plenty of B vitamins and Essential Fatty Acids (e.g safflower oil or flaxseed oil).’ ‘Allow yourself a treat occasionally. Having MS is enough without depriving yourself of the occasional chocolate or whatever takes your fancy.’ For more information on all of the above conditions please see the following links.

0dca2b8d-fb18-4f31-89ac-206ba885d9f7,"Rehabilitation interventions in multiple sclerosis: an overview , –() Multiple sclerosis is a complex, heterogeneous disease associated with long-term disability. Despite the availability of advanced disease-modifying and symptomatic therapies that may decrease activity and progression of disease and alleviate complaints to a certain extent, there is still a need for comprehensive rehabilitation interventions in order to reduce sequels and symptoms of the disease on personal activities and social participation to achieve the highest possible independence and the best quality of life. Timing and setting of rehabilitation interventions should be selected individually depending on disease phase, functional deficits, personal requirements, as well as specific goals. In addition, limitations and disease-specific characteristics that may influence rehabilitation outcome should be noted. Rehabilitation interventions should be considered early for maintaining functional capacity and reducing risk for losing important abilities or independence. Due to gradual failure of adaptive compensatory mechanisms along the course of disease, benefits of rehabilitation interventions are generally higher in earlier phases of MS. Inpatient and outpatient multidisciplinary rehabilitation has been shown to be beneficial in improving disability, participation and quality of life despite progression of the disease. Good evidence exists for different specific interventions improving physical and cognitive performance. Other important issues responsible for beneficial effects of comprehensive rehabilitation in MS include education, instruction, and information of patients and caregivers. Comprehensive assessment of health domains in MS patients using standardized framework and common language for describing the impact of disease at different levels, using International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) core sets may increase the knowledge of needs of these patients for more efficient and adapted rehabilitation interventions meeting these individual requirements, and promote perception and acceptance of rehabilitation as a valuable treatment option in MS. ICF core sets may increase the knowledge of more efficient and adapted rehabilitation measures meeting more properly individual requirements, and promote perception and acceptance of rehabilitation as a valuable treatment option in MS.

New information includes the ability of Aubagio to reduce the risk of relapse in people who have experienced a first clinical event suggestive of MS (clinically isolated syndrome) – this is the first such report in anMS treatment. Aubagio was approved by the FDA in September 2012 for people with relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis. Aubagio is an oral compound that inhibits the rapid proliferation of cells, including immune cells that have been implicated in MS. Investigators worldwide recruited 618 people 18-55 years of age with clinically isolated syndrome (CIS, a first clinical episode suggestive of MS) who showed two or more areas of damage on MRI scans and had experienced their neurological symptoms within 90 days prior to entering the study. Participants were randomly assigned to receive 7 mg teriflunomide, 14 mg teriflunomide, or placebo once daily for 108 weeks. The primary outcome measured was time to relapse.  A secondary endpoint was time to relapse or the occurrence of new tissue damage on MRI scans, whichever occurred first. The risk of relapse was reduced by 42.6% among those taking 14 mg of Aubagio, and by 37.2% among those taking 7 mg Aubagio, compared to those taking placebo. For the secondary endpoint, the risk of relapse or occurrence of new tissue damage was reduced by 34.9% in the 14-mg group and 31.4 % in the 7-mg group compared with the placebo group. The most common adverse events reported in the Aubagio groups were liver enzyme elevations, hair thinning, diarrhea, upper respiratory infection, and paresthesia (e.g., burning sensations, pins and needles, stabbing pains). There was one death due to suicide in the placebo arm. () Investigators worldwide recruited 1,169 people with relapsing forms of MS, and randomly assigned them to receive teriflunomide 7 mg or 14 mg, once daily by mouth, or placebo for 48 weeks. The primary endpoint was whether the study drug reduced the average number of relapses per year significantly more than placebo. Secondary endpoints included the time to disability progression confirmed for at least 12 weeks. Teriflunomide 14 mg reduced relapses by 36.3% versus placebo and 7 mg reduced relapses by 22.3% versus placebo. In the 14 mg-group, the risk of sustained disability progression was reduced by 31.5%; the lower dose did not significantly reduce progression. Three deaths occurred in the teriflunomide groups – from sepsis, suicide, and motor vehicle accident. Participants in the teriflunomide groups experienced more liver enzyme elevation, headache, and hair thinning. () Aubagio is Pregnancy Category X, as designated by the FDA, meaning that it may cause major birth defects if used during pregnancy. Aubagio is contraindicated in pregnant women or women of childbearing potential who are not using reliable contraception. Multiple sclerosis is an unpredictable, often disabling . range from numbness and tingling to blindness and paralysis, and there is currently no cure for MS.

b954ad62-631c-4597-9f84-c1d1671165dd,"Your Guide to the Best Mobility Aids for Advanced MS — Staying active and maintaining mobility is often a priority for people living with multiple sclerosis (MS). Although this can be challenging at times, finding ways to remain independent can help boost your confidence and improve your quality of life. Mobility includes things like walking, getting in and out of bed and automobiles, climbing stairs, and participating in other activities. If your symptoms progress and you find it difficult to get around on your own, it may be time to consider a mobility assistive device or aid. According to the , symptoms such as muscular weakness, loss of balance, fatigue, numbness, and pain can all impact your mobility. More specifically, they can increase your risk of falling. To help reduce your risk of injury from falls and improve your safety and confidence, your doctor or physical therapist may recommend that you begin using a mobility aid. “Mobility aids include canes, walkers, manual wheelchairs, and motorized wheelchairs such as scooters,” says Dr. Leslie S. Saland, a neurologist at . There are also orthoses or braces you can wear, such as an ankle-foot orthosis, that can help lift your foot to prevent tripping. Canes typically come in two styles: single-point and quad-point. The quad-point may be more appropriate for advanced MS since it has four support points touching the floor. This gives you more stability and allows you to put more weight on the cane. That said, a cane may not be enough support for someone experiencing advanced stages of MS. For a wider base of support, you may want to consider a two-wheeled or four-wheeled walker. The four-wheeled walker or rollator, as it is often called, is more maneuverable and usually has a seat. A two-wheeled walker provides more stability and support than a four-wheeled walker. In general, walkers are easy to use and transport. If walking or standing is not possible, but you can still use your upper body, you may want to consider a manual wheelchair. This type of wheelchair allows you to sit down, but still gives you the freedom to get around on your own. You can also find models that are attendant-propelled with handles at the back of the seat. This allows a caregiver to push you if your symptoms prevent you from propelling the chair on your own. If you need to conserve energy, can’t propel a manual wheelchair, have weakness in your legs, or are dealing with severe fatigue, consider using a motorized scooter or power wheelchair. These mobility aids are often more expensive and come with numerous features. In these cases, working with your doctor, a physical therapist, or an assistive technology professional is essential for finding the right model for your needs. Additionally, Saland says electronic devices are available to stimulate the peripheral nerves in your legs and help lift your feet when walking. There are newer electronic devices that may help with hip flexion as well. But these devices are expensive and rarely covered by insurance. In some cases, Saland says medications can be recommended as “mobility aids.” One example is dalfampridine (Ampyra), which can help improve gait by improving nerve conduction. Finally, Saland says doctors should always include physical therapy and regular exercise as important aids to help improve and maintain mobility in people with MS. Since no two cases of MS are alike, the symptoms are often unpredictable, and they tend to come and go. Because of this, getting a personalized evaluation is key to finding a mobility aid that fits your needs. Sometimes, this even means getting fitted for several aids over time. Choosing the best mobility aid for your needs is not a decision to take lightly. Since this aid can provide safety, mobility, and security, it’s essential to know what to look for. You should be able to identify the features that are important to you. “Patients with advanced MS will need assistance with maintaining the most upright alignment, ability to sit, stand, walk, and ability to move for pressure relief and comfort,” says Reiko Kurihara-Bliss, a physical therapist at , Centers for Rehabilitation. To help you narrow down the search, Kurihara-Bliss says to answer the following questions: Does it allow for the most normal alignment of your body? Does the device give you the freedom to move on your own, or does it need to move you? Does it allow you a greater amount of independence and safety? Can you transport the device from home to your car to out in public? When using the mobility aid, does it cause any skin breakdown, joint restriction, or discomfort? How much does it cost and what is covered by insurance? Also, Saland says to consider whether or not the mobility aid fits easily in the space you have available. Also, if necessary, find out if you’re able to transport it. “Some walkers are simply too heavy to be lifted out of the car by someone who is already having balance or gait difficulty,” she explains. Yet she does point out that the lightest walkers can be less stable. So, it’s important that you determine your needs along with the accessibility and ease of use of the mobility aid. When it comes to choosing the right mobility aid, working with a specialist is key to finding the best device for you. “Physical and occupational therapists with experience in neurological rehabilitation are the practitioners most suited to perform evaluations and make recommendations on mobility aids for individuals with MS,” says Kurihara-Bliss. These therapists can try a variety of mobility aids with you.

Symptoms range from numbness and tingling to blindness and paralysis. The progress, severity, and specific symptoms of MS in any one person cannot yet be predicted, but advances in research and treatment are moving us closer to a world free of MS. Most people living with MS are diagnosed between the ages of 20 and 50, with more than twice as many women as men being diagnosed with the disease. There are an estimated 8-10,000 children under the age of 18 who also live with MS. Studies indicate that genetic factors could make certain individuals more susceptible to the disease, but there is no evidence that MS is directly inherited. It occurs more commonly among Caucasians, especially those of northern European ancestry, but people of African, Asian, and Hispanic backgrounds are not immune. More than 2.3 million people are affected by MS worldwide. Because the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) does not require U.S. physicians to report new cases, and because symptoms can be completely invisible, the prevalence of MS in the U.S. can only be estimated. The Society continues to advocate for the establishment of a national registry that will track the number of people living with MS and has made a commitment to re-evaluate the current prevalence estimate and investigate the process by which an updated estimate can be identified. The progress, severity, and specific symptoms of MS in any one person cannot yet be predicted. The disease varies greatly from person to person, and from time to time, in the same person. For instance, one person might experience abnormal fatigue, another might have severe vision problems, and another could develop attention and memory issues. Even severe symptoms could disappear completely and the person could regain lost functions. In the worst cases, however, people can have partial or complete paralysis. In MS, symptoms result when inflammation and breakdown occur in myelin, the protective insulation surrounding the nerve fibers of the central nervous system (brain and spinal cord). The nerve fibers themselves are also damaged. Myelin is destroyed and replaced by scars of hardened ""sclerotic"" patches of tissue. Such lesions are called ""plaques,"" and appear in ""multiple"" places within the central nervous system. This can be compared to a loss of insulating material around an electrical wire, which interferes with the transmission of signals. Life expectancy for people with MS has increased over time. We believe this is due to treatment breakthroughs, improved healthcare and life style changes. Recent research however, indicates that people with MS may live an average of about seven years less than the general population because of disease complications or other medical conditions. Many of these complications are preventable or manageable. Attention to overall health and wellness can help reduce the risk of other medical conditions, such as heart disease and stroke, that can contribute to a shortened life expectancy. In some rare instances, there are cases of MS that progress rapidly from disease onset and can be fatal. No. The majority of people living with MS do not become severely disabled. Two-thirds of people who have MS remain able to walk, though many will need an aid, such as a cane or crutches. No. MS is neither contagious nor directly inherited, although studies indicate that genetic factors might make certain individuals more susceptible to the disease. Not yet. However, advances in treating and understanding MS are being achieved daily and the progress in research to find a cure is very encouraging. In addition, many therapeutic and technological advances are helping people manage symptoms and lead more productive lives. Several FDA-approved medications are now available and have been shown to impact the underlying course of MS. What medications and treatments are available for MS?  The National Multiple Sclerosis Society recommends that people living with MS begin treatment with one of the disease modifying drugs, Avonex®, Betaseron®, Copaxone®, or Rebif® as soon as you are diagnosed with a relapsing form (the most common kind) of MS. Those drugs help to lessen the frequency and severity of MS attacks, reduce the accumulation of lesions in the brain, and slow progression of disability. Novantrone® (mitoxantrone) is approved for reducing disability and/or frequency of relapses in patients with worsening relapsing MS. This is the first therapy approved in the United States for individuals with secondary progressive MS or who are experiencing a rapid worsening of the disease. In addition, approved by the FDA for return to market, is Tysabri®, which is generally recommended for patients who have had inadequate response to, or are unable to tolerate, other approved disease-modifying MS therapies for relapsing forms of MS. Many therapies are available to treat symptoms such as spasticity, pain, bladder problems, fatigue, and weakness. People should consult with a knowledgeable physician to develop the most comprehensive approach to managing their MS. In early MS, elusive symptoms that come and go might indicate any number of possible disorders. Some people have symptoms that are very difficult for physicians to interpret, and these people must ""wait and see."" While no single laboratory test is yet available to prove or rule out MS, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a great help in reaching a definitive diagnosis. In an effort to develop a common language when discussing, evaluating, and treating MS, the Society conducted an international survey among scientists who specialize in MS research and patient care. Analysis of the responses resulted in the publication of four disease courses in 1996. In 2013, the International Advisory Committee on Clinical Trials of MS updated the based on advances in the understanding of the disease process in MS and in MRI technology: : a first episode of neurologic symptoms caused by inflammation and demyelination in the central nervous system that may or may not go on to become MS. a disease course characterized by clearly defined flare-ups (relapses) or episodes of acute worsening of neurologic function followed by remissions (with partial or complete recovery) during which no disease progression occurs. Frequency: Approximately 85% of people are diagnosed with RRMS. a disease course characterized by nearly continuous worsening from the onset of symptoms, with or without occasional relapses. The rate or progression varies over time, with occasional plateaus. Frequency: Approximately 15% of people are diagnosed with PPMS. a disease course that follows after an initial RRMS course. Following an initial period of time with RRMS, the disease becomes more steadily progressive, with or without occasional relapses.  Frequency: If left untreated, 50% of people with relapsing-remitting MS develop this form of the disease within about 10 years of initial diagnosis. © 2020 The National Multiple Sclerosis Society is a tax exempt 501(c)3 nonprofit organization.

Instead, a diagnosis of multiple sclerosis often relies on ruling out other conditions that might produce similar signs and symptoms, known as a differential diagnosis. Your doctor is likely to start with a thorough medical history and examination. During a spinal tap (lumbar puncture) procedure, you typically lie on your side with your knees drawn up to your chest. Then a needle is inserted into your spinal canal — in your lower back — to collect cerebrospinal fluid for testing.

Tests to check for specific biomarkers associated with are currently under development and may also aid in diagnosing the disease. in which a small sample of cerebrospinal fluid is removed from your spinal canal for laboratory analysis. This sample can show abnormalities in antibodies that are associated with . A spinal tap can also help rule out infections and other conditions with symptoms similar to . which can reveal areas of (lesions) on your brain and spinal cord. You may receive an intravenous injection of a contrast material to highlight lesions that indicate your disease is in an active phase. which record the electrical signals produced by your nervous system in response to stimuli. An evoked potential test may use visual stimuli or electrical stimuli. In these tests, you watch a moving visual pattern, or short electrical impulses are applied to nerves in your legs or arms. Electrodes measure how quickly the information travels down your nerve pathways. In most people with relapsing-remitting , the diagnosis is fairly straightforward and based on a pattern of symptoms consistent with the disease and confirmed by brain imaging scans, such as MRI. Diagnosing can be more difficult in people with unusual symptoms or progressive disease. In these cases, further testing with spinal fluid analysis, evoked potentials and additional imaging may be needed. Brain MRI is often used to help diagnose multiple sclerosis. Our caring team of Mayo Clinic experts can help you with your multiple sclerosis-related health concerns There is no cure for multiple sclerosis. Treatment typically focuses on speeding recovery from attacks, slowing the progression of the disease and managing symptoms. Some people have such mild symptoms that no treatment is necessary. Multiple sclerosis research laboratory at Mayo Clinic such as oral prednisone and intravenous methylprednisolone, are prescribed to reduce nerve inflammation. Side effects may include insomnia, increased blood pressure, increased blood glucose levels, mood swings and fluid retention. The liquid portion of part of your blood (plasma) is removed and separated from your blood cells. The blood cells are then mixed with a protein solution (albumin) and put back into your body. Plasma exchange may be used if your symptoms are new, severe and haven't responded to steroids. For primary-progressive , ocrelizumab (Ocrevus) is the only FDA-approved disease-modifying therapy (DMT). Those who receive this treatment are slightly less likely to progress than those who are untreated. For relapsing-remitting , several disease-modifying therapies are available. Much of the immune response associated with occurs in the early stages of the disease. Aggressive treatment with these medications as early as possible can lower the relapse rate, slow the formation of new lesions, and potentially reduce risk of brain atrophy and disability accumulation. Many of the disease-modifying therapies used to treat carry significant health risks. Selecting the right therapy for you will depend on careful consideration of many factors, including duration and severity of disease, effectiveness of previous treatments, other health issues, cost, and child-bearing status. Treatment options for relapsing-remitting include injectable and oral medications. These drugs are among the most commonly prescribed medications to treat . They are injected under the skin or into muscle and can reduce the frequency and severity of relapses. Side effects of interferons may include flu-like symptoms and injection-site reactions. You'll need blood tests to monitor your liver enzymes because liver damage is a possible side effect of interferon use. People taking interferons may develop neutralizing antibodies that can reduce drug effectiveness. This medication may help block your immune system's attack on myelin and must be injected beneath the skin. Side effects may include skin irritation at the injection site. This once-daily oral medication reduces relapse rate. You'll need to have your heart rate and blood pressure monitored for six hours after the first dose because your heartbeat may be slowed. Other side effects include rare serious infections, headaches, high blood pressure and blurred vision. This twice-daily oral medication can reduce relapses. Side effects may include flushing, diarrhea, nausea and lowered white blood cell count. This drug requires blood test monitoring on a regular basis. This twice-daily capsule is similar to dimethyl fumarate but typically causes fewer side effects. It's approved for the treatment of relapsing forms of . This once-daily oral medication can reduce relapse rate. Teriflunomide can cause liver damage, hair loss and other side effects. This drug is associated with birth defects when taken by both men and women. Therefore, use contraception when taking this medication and for up to two years afterward. Couples who wish to become pregnant should talk to their doctor about ways to speed elimination of the drug from the body. This drug requires blood test monitoring in a regular basis. Research shows that this once-daily oral medication can reduce relapse rate and help slow progression of . It's also approved for secondary-progressive . Possible side effects include viral infections, liver problems and low white blood cell count. Other possible side effects include changes in heart rate, headaches and vision problems. Siponimod is harmful to a developing fetus, so women who may become pregnant should use contraception when taking this medication and for 10 days after stopping the medication. Some might need to have the heart rate and blood pressure monitored for six hours after the first dose. This drug requires blood test monitoring on a regular basis This medication is generally prescribed as second line treatment for those with relapsing-remitting . It was also approved for secondary-progressive . It is given in two treatment courses, spread over a two-week period, over the course of two years. Side effects include upper respiratory infections, headaches, tumors, serious infections and reduced levels of white blood cells. People who have active chronic infections or cancer should not take this drug, nor should women who are pregnant or breast-feeding. Men and women should use contraception when taking this medication and for the following six months. You may need monitoring with blood tests while taking cladribine. This humanized monoclonal antibody medication is the only approved by the FDA to treat both the relapse-remitting and primary-progressive forms of . Clinical trials showed that it reduced relapse rate in relapsing disease and slowed worsening of disability in both forms of the disease. Ocrelizumab is given via an intravenous infusion by a medical professional. Infusion-related side effects may include irritation at the injection site, low blood pressure, a fever and nausea, among others. Some people may not be able to take ocrelizumab, including those with a hepatitis B infection. Ocrelizumab may also increase the risk of infections and some types of cancer, particularly breast cancer. This medication is designed to block the movement of potentially damaging immune cells from your bloodstream to your brain and spinal cord. It may be considered a first line treatment for some people with severe or as a second line treatment in others. This medication increases the risk of a potentially serious viral infection of the brain called progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) in people who are positive for antibodies to the causative agent of JC virus. People who don't have the antibodies have extremely low risk of . This drug helps reduce relapses of by targeting a protein on the surface of immune cells and depleting white blood cells. This effect can limit potential nerve damage caused by the white blood cells. But it also increases the risk of infections and autoimmune disorders, including a high risk of thyroid autoimmune diseases and rare immune mediated kidney disease. Treatment with alemtuzumab involves five consecutive days of drug infusions followed by another three days of infusions a year later. Infusion reactions are common with alemtuzumab. The drug is only available from registered providers, and people treated with the drug must be registered in a special drug safety monitoring program. Alemtuzumab is usually recommended for those with aggressive or as second line treatment for patients who failed another medication. Physical therapy can build muscle strength and ease some of the symptoms of . A physical or occupational therapist can teach you stretching and strengthening exercises and show you how to use devices to make it easier to perform daily tasks. Physical therapy along with the use of a mobility aid when necessary can also help manage leg weakness and other gait problems often associated with . You may experience painful or uncontrollable muscle stiffness or spasms, particularly in your legs. Muscle relaxants such as baclofen (Lioresal, Gablofen), tizanidine (Zanaflex) and cyclobenzaprine may help. Onabotulinumtoxin A treatment is another option in those with spasticity. Amantadine (Gocovri, Osmolex), modafinil (Provigil) and methylphenidate (Ritalin) may be helpful in reducing -related fatigue. Some drugs used to treat depression, including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, may be recommended. Dalfampridine (Ampyra) may help to slightly increase walking speed in some people. People with a history of seizures or kidney dysfunction should not take this medication.

To help relieve the signs and symptoms of , try to: Look at your sleep habits to make sure you're getting the best possible sleep. To make sure you're getting enough sleep, you may need to be evaluated — and possibly treated — for sleep disorders such as obstructive sleep apnea. If you have mild to moderate , regular exercise can help improve your strength, muscle tone, balance and coordination. Swimming or other water exercises are good options if you're bothered by heat. Other types of mild to moderate exercise recommended for people with include walking, stretching, low-impact aerobics, stationary bicycling, yoga and tai chi. symptoms often worsen when the body temperature rises in some people with . Avoiding exposure to heat and using devices such as cooling scarves or vests can be helpful. Since there's little evidence to support a particular diet, experts recommend a generally healthy diet. Some research suggests that vitamin D may have potential benefit for people with . Stress may trigger or worsen your signs and symptoms. Yoga, tai chi, massage, meditation or deep breathing may help. Mindfulness practice: Can it reduce symptoms of MS? Vitamins for MS: Do supplements make a difference? Many people with use a variety of alternative or complementary treatments or both to help manage their symptoms, such as fatigue and muscle pain. Activities such as exercise, meditation, yoga, massage, eating a healthier diet, acupuncture and relaxation techniques may help boost overall mental and physical well-being, but there are few studies to back up their use in managing symptoms of . According to guidelines from the American Academy of Neurology, research strongly indicates that oral cannabis extract (OCE) may improve symptoms of muscle spasticity and pain. There is a lack of evidence that cannabis in any other form is effective in managing other symptoms. Daily intake of vitamin D3 of 2,000-5,000 international units daily is recommended in those with .

54577771-adaf-4cdb-a0c1-bac3dd4075c4,"The first three long-term treatments for multiple sclerosis (MS) became available in the early to mid 1990s and were dubbed the “A-B-C” drugs because of their brand names: , , and . These are interferon beta-1a, interferon beta-1b, and glatiramer acetate, respectively. In 2002, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved another interferon, (interferon beta-1a), for the long-term treatments of MS. This is the same drug as Avonex, but is injected differently and in more frequent and higher doses. In 2009, (interferon beta-1b) was also approved. This is the same medicinal product as Betaseron and is given in the same doses, but is marketed under a different brand name and by a different pharmaceutical company. In 2014, (peginterferon beta-1a) became the 11th DMT approved for the long-term treatment of relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (MS) – and the fifth interferon medication approved for MS. Plegridy is a pegylated version of interferon beta-1a. Pegylation is a chemical modification of a molecule (in this case the interferon beta-1a molecule) that extends its half-life, which refers to how long a drug stays active in the body before it is metabolized or eliminated. While Copaxone (noted earlier) was initially approved as a daily 20-mg injection, a 40-mg dose of Copaxone injected three-times weekly was approved by the FDA in 2014; physicians and their patients may choose either dose regimen. In April 2015, (glatiramer acetate injection) was approved as the 13th long-term treatment for individuals with relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (MS). Glatopa is a generic version of Copaxone (glatiramer acetate injection), given at the original 20-mg daily dose, and as of February 2018, was also approved at the newer, 40-mg three-times-weekly injected dose. This is the first generic version of a disease-modifying therapy for MS to be approved by the FDA. In October 2017, was approved at both the 20-mg daily injected dose and the 40-mg three-times-weekly injected dose. All eight of these self-injected disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) listed above are approved by the FDA for treating either relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) or all relapsing forms of MS. Some of these DMTs have also been approved for “clinically isolated syndrome” (CIS), which refers to the initial symptom a patient reports prior to a diagnosis of MS. Each of these treatments is administered by self injection at one’s home, with the frequency of injections ranging from once daily to once every two weeks, depending on the drug prescribed. These therapies have been used for several years and research shows that many people are doing well on these medications for extended periods of time (some for more than 20 years). Most side effects (such as flu-like symptoms and injection-site reactions) are manageable through various strategies and over-the-counter medications. Blood tests may be given periodically to monitor various items, such as liver enzymes, the number of red blood cells and white blood cells, and the possible development of neutralizing antibodies* (please see note below). In May 2016, (daclizumab) became the 14th disease-modifying therapy to be approved for the long-term treatment of relapsing forms of MS (RMS) in adults. However, please note that this medication was voluntarily withdrawn from the marketplace in March 2018 by its manufacturers and is no longer available to the MS community. This voluntary withdrawal was due to new safety concerns, including several cases of inflammatory encephalitis and meningoencephalitis (both forms of brain inflammation) that were reported in Europe, as well as earlier issues with liver failure. As background information, this monoclonal antibody was self-administered subcutaneously (under-the-skin) once per month and had been shown to reduce the number of relapses as well as new or newly enhancing lesions, as compared to another approved MS medication and to placebo, in two separate studies. This medication carried safety risks, which included liver injury and immune conditions. The FDA stated that Zinbryta would only be used in patients who had an inadequate response to two or more MS drugs. Zinbryta had a boxed warning, was available only through a restricted distribution program under a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, and monthly liver-function tests were required. In August 2020, the FDA approved (ofatumumab) for adults with relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (RMS), which includes clinically isolated syndrome, relapsing-remitting disease, and active secondary-progressive disease. Kesimpta is a B-cell therapy, which binds to and depletes B-cells shown to be associated with disease activity in MS. Typically this type of therapy is only available via infusion at a hospital or infusion center; however, Kesimpta is the first self-administered B-cell therapy for MS. It is given monthly via subcutaneous injection at one’s home. The approval of Kesimpta is based on results from the Phase III ASCLEPIOS I and II studies, in which Kesimpta demonstrated superiority over Aubagio (oral teriflunomide) in significantly reducing the annualized relapse rate (ARR), three-month confirmed disability progression (CDP), and the number of gadolinium-enhancing (Gd+) T1 and new or enlarging T2 lesions. The most common side effects of Kesimpta include upper respiratory tract infection (URTI), with symptoms that include sore throat, runny nose, and headache, as well as headache not related to a URTI. Other serious but less-common side effects can occur. In 2000 (prior to the approval of some of the medications mentioned above), (mitoxantrone) was approved by the FDA for the long-term treatment of MS. This was the first drug indicated for RRMS, secondary-progressive MS (SPMS), and worsening RRMS. Novantrone has been used for many years to treat cancer. It is given via intravenous infusion once every three months. Side effects may include cardiac disease and leukemia, and for this reason, patients must be closely monitored and are limited to a maximum of two to three years of treatment with this drug. Because of the potential risks and with the approval of more long-term treatments for MS, Novantrone is seldom prescribed for individuals with MS. Anyone taking Novantrone now or given Novantrone previously needs to have (as noted in this advisory), even if no longer receiving this medication. In 2004, (natalizumab), was approved for relapsing forms of MS. It is administered via intravenous infusion every four weeks. After its initial approval, Tysabri was temporarily suspended after two individuals (taking Tysabri in combination with Avonex) developed progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), which if not discovered early, is an often-fatal viral infection of the brain. Since that time, Tysabri has been re-approved and patients are closely monitored through the “TOUCH Prescribing Program.” In 2012, the FDA announced that three factors have been identified with increasing the risk of PML for individuals with multiple sclerosis (MS) being treated with Tysabri. These include: (1) the presence of JC virus antibodies (detected through a blood test); (2) previous treatment with immunosuppressive drugs, such as Novantrone, Imuran, or Cytoxan; and (3) the length of time an individual has been taking Tysabri – specifically beyond the two-year mark. More details are included in MSAA’s article, In November 2014, the FDA announced the approval of (alemtuzumab) for the long-term treatment of relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (MS). This is the 12th DMT to be approved for the long-term treatment of MS, and the third intravenous medication for MS. Given for a course of five days via intravenous (IV) infusion and followed one year later by a second three-day course, Lemtrada has been approved as a second-line therapy. This classification refers to a drug that may only be prescribed when other FDA-approved treatments fail or are not tolerated well by a patient. Lemtrada should generally be prescribed for patients who have had an inadequate response to two or more of the disease-modifying therapies, because of the medication’s safety profile. Adverse events from Lemtrada can include infusion reactions to the medication, an increased risk of infection, emergent autoimmune diseases, and other serious conditions. For early detection and management of these risks, Lemtrada is only available through a restricted distribution program, the Lemtrada REMS (Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy). REMS ensures that prescriptions are only given through certified prescribers and that patients are enrolled in this important safety and monitoring program. In March 2017, (ocrelizumab) became the 15th FDA-approved treatment, notably for two types of MS: relapsing forms of MS (RMS) and primary-progressive MS (PPMS). This is the first time that a medication for MS has been approved for two types of the disease, and the first time that any medication has been approved to treat PPMS. Ocrevus is given via intravenous (IV) infusion every six months. Ocrevus is a humanized monoclonal antibody designed to selectively target CD20-positive B cells. These are a specific type of immune cell that is an important contributor to the MS-disease process. The fact that Ocrevus targets B cells differentiates it from most of the previously approved disease-modifying therapies for MS, which target a different type of immune cell called “T cells.” Side effects can include infusion reactions and an increase in infections. Other rare adverse events, including cancer and PML (described earlier with Tysabri), could potentially occur, but these risks are still being investigated. The eighth DMT for MS is (fingolimod), which was approved in September 2010. Pronounced as “Jil-EN-ee-ah,” this is the first oral drug available for the long-term treatment of MS. Until this time, all of the other approved treatments were given either via self injections at home or infusions at a medical facility. The approval of an oral treatment provides a more convenient and comfortable option to some individuals, particularly if they do not respond to or are unable to tolerate the other approved medications. As with the other treatments, Gilenya also has potential side effects and adverse events, including a temporary slowing of the heart rate, edema (swelling) behind the eye, and liver changes. PML (described earlier with Tysabri), could potentially occur, but this risk is still being investigated. In May 2018, Gilenya became the first DMT also approved for the treatment of children and adolescents, ages 10 through 17, with relapsing forms of MS. At this time, Gilenya is the only DMT approved for this patient population, referred to as “pediatric MS.” In December 2019, FDA approved the applications from three separate pharmaceutical companies for the first for the treatment of relapsing forms of MS in adult patients. While generic treatments carry the same benefits and risks of the initially approved medication, this approval does not include the treatment of children and adolescents. Details on when these generic versions will be available to the MS community have not yet been announced. In September 2012, (oral teriflunomide) became the ninth FDA-approved DMT for relapsing forms of MS — and the second approved DMT that is taken orally. Aubagio has been approved in two dose levels: 7 mg and 14 mg. While the higher dose (14 mg) shows greater effectiveness, for individuals who may be more sensitive to the drug and experience greater side effects, the lower dose (7 mg) may be more appropriate. In October 2014, Phase III data was added to Aubagio’s label, noting that it may (1) reduce the relative risk of sustained disability progression (along with reducing the annual relapse rate) and (2) prevent or delay a second clinical attack (relapse) in individuals with clinically isolated syndrome (CIS). Common adverse events include headache, elevations in liver enzymes, hair thinning, diarrhea, nausea, neutropenia (a condition that reduces the number of certain white blood cells that normally fight infection), and paresthesia (tingling, burning, or numbing sensation). More severe adverse events include the risk of severe liver injury and the risk of birth defects if used during pregnancy. (dimethyl fumarate or DMF, formerly known as BG-12) was approved by the FDA as a first-line therapy for the long-term treatment of relapsing forms of MS in March 2013. This is the 10th DMT for the long-term treatment of MS. Tecfidera is administered in pill form orally and is the third oral DMT approved for MS. The approved dosage is 240 mg to be taken two times daily. Clinical trials with Tecfidera showed a reduction in relapse rate, a delay in progression of physical disability, and a slowing in the development of brain lesions, as compared to placebo. The most commonly reported side effects are flushing and gastrointestinal events, occurring more often at the beginning of treatment, and decreasing in frequency after the first one to two months on this medication. PML (described earlier with Tysabri), could potentially occur, but this risk is still being investigated. In August 2020, the FDA awarded early approval of (dimethyl fumarate), an oral medication approved in 2013 for relapsing forms of MS in adults (as noted above). This is the first generic of any MS oral treatment available to individuals in the United States. Generic treatments have the same active ingredients and carry the same benefits and risks of the initially approved (brand-name) medication. Inactive ingredients can differ with generic medications, and generic treatments are not required to conduct the same degree of rigorous clinical trials prior to approval. Mylan’s generic version of Tecfidera is given in the same dosage, with both 120-mg and 240-mg delayed-release capsules available. In March 2019, (siponimod) oral tablets became the 16th approved DMT to treat adults with relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (MS). The approval includes individuals with clinically isolated syndrome (CIS), relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS), and active secondary-progressive MS (SPMS) – a form of MS where someone with RRMS advances to experiencing a more steady increase in disability, but relapses are still occurring. Taken by mouth once daily, Mayzent has been shown to reduce the risk of three-month and six-month confirmed disability progression (CDP), slow the rate of brain volume loss, and reduce the annual relapse rate. Headache, high blood pressure, and changes in liver function tests were the most common adverse reactions reported. Patients taking Mayzent need to be monitored for changes in vision caused by macular edema, transient decreases in heart rate, decline in lung function, and changes in liver enzymes; women who could become pregnant should use contraception during and for 10 days after stopping treatment. Also in March 2019, (cladribine) oral tablets became the 17th approved DMT to treat adults with relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (MS). The approval is for individuals with relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) and for individuals with active secondary-progressive MS (SPMS). Mavenclad is generally recommended for patients who have had an inadequate response to, or are unable to tolerate, an alternate drug indicated for the treatment of MS. This oral medication is given in two annual courses for a maximum of 20 days over two years; no treatment is needed for Years 3 and 4. Mavenclad has been shown to reduce disease activity in patients with relapsing MS, including disability progression, annualized relapse rate, and MRI activity. Potential adverse events include lymphopenia, a condition that causes abnormally low counts of white blood cells that play a role in fighting infection, and herpes zoster infection. Mavenclad has a Boxed Warning for an increased risk of malignancy (cancer) and fetal harm. The most common adverse reactions include upper respiratory tract infections, headache, and decreased lymphocyte counts. In December 2019, the FDA approved (diroximel fumarate) oral capsules to treat adults with relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (MS). This approval includes the treatment of clinically isolated syndrome (CIS), relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS), and active secondary-progressive MS (SPMS). This medication is taken by mouth twice daily. Vumerity is in the same class of MS therapy as Tecfidera (dimethyl fumarate), but is believed to cause fewer gastrointestinal (GI) side effects – such as diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. (ozanimod) was approved in March 2020 for the treatment of adults with relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (RMS). This once-daily oral medication is a sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) receptor modulator and joins two other previously approved S1P receptor modulators: Gilenya (fingolimod) and Mayzent (siponimod). However, unlike the first two medications, Zeposia does not require a genetic test or label-based first-dose observation. In clinical trials, Zeposia was shown to have a significant effect on reducing the annual relapse rate (ARR) as well as the number of brain lesions, when compared to Avonex (interferon beta-1a). The most common adverse reactions include: upper respiratory infection; elevated liver enzymes; orthostatic hypotension, which is a sudden drop in blood pressure when changing position; urinary tract infection; back pain; and high blood pressure. Warnings and precautions include an increased risk of infections, heart-rhythm issues, liver injury, fetal risk if pregnant while taking Zeposia, a decline in pulmonary (respiratory) function, and macular edema (swelling behind the eye). The launch date for Zeposia has not yet been announced. In April 2020, the FDA approved (monomethyl fumarate) delayed-release oral capsules to treat relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (MS). Bafiertam is a “bioequivalent alternative” to Biogen’s Tecfidera (dimethyl fumarate), which means that the active ingredient and site of action do not differ significantly between the two medications. The therapeutic effect is assumed to be equivalent. Since a lower dose of Bafiertam is equivalent to Tecfidera, this may potentially lead to a reduction in gastrointestinal (GI) side effects, such as diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. However, these side effects have not been evaluated in clinical trials in people with relapsing forms of MS. The launch date for Bafiertam has not yet been announced. Individuals are usually prescribed only one type of DMT during any one time period. Several large clinical trials have been conducted to study each of these drugs separately for their safety and effectiveness in MS. Although differences exist in study design and specific findings, trials generally showed these common results: Reduced the development of new areas of inflammation as seen on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans Showed some evidence of delaying disease progression and/or disability Some may prevent or delay a second clinical attack (relapse) for individuals with clinically isolated syndrome (CIS). CIS refers to individuals who do not meet the criteria to be diagnosed with MS, but have experienced symptoms. The documented effectiveness of each of these drugs varies to some extent, and differences can be attributed to the type of the drug, dose and administration, as well as variations in study design. Stronger drugs may offer greater effectiveness but may also pose greater health risks. Additionally, the effectiveness and side effects of each drug may vary from one patient to another, so individuals need to consult with their physician to determine which treatment might be the best option for them. Each of the approved treatments has side effects that are usually manageable. At this time, Novantrone is the only drug that has a set limit of doses, which is necessary to avoid cardiotoxicity (heart damage). Tysabri increases the risk of PML (described above) and patients are closely monitored through the “TOUCH Prescribing Program.” For early detection and management of potentially severe adverse events, Lemtrada is only available through the Lemtrada REMS (Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy). Patients beginning on Gilenya are monitored for changes in heart rate and are given baseline evaluations for any issues with the heart, lungs, liver, eyes and vision, as well as white-blood-cell count. The other drugs mentioned earlier appear safe provided the person taking the drug is not experiencing any adverse effects and blood tests continue to be normal. While no damage to the reproductive system or the fetus has been observed, these drugs are not recommended if a woman is pregnant or considering pregnancy during her treatment period. Male patients considering certain long-term treatments may want to discuss options for family planning with their doctor. Other treatments are sometimes used to try to slow MS disease progression when other therapies have been ineffective. Such treatments are approved by the FDA for other illnesses, but not specifically for the treatment of MS. These include intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) therapy, methotrexate, azathioprine (Imuran), and cyclophosphamide (Cytoxan). In 2014, the Multiple Sclerosis Coalition (MSC) published two papers detailing the current evidence that supports the FDA-approved disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) for the long-term treatment of multiple sclerosis (MS). The first paper was written for medical professionals. The second paper summarizes the information and has been written for members of the MS community. To view either of these papers, please go to the following links: For medical professionals (updated June 2019): The Use of Disease-Modifying Therapies in Multiple Sclerosis: Principles and Current Evidence For members of the MS community (updated March 2017): The Use of Disease-Modifying Therapies in Multiple Sclerosis: Principles and Current Evidence; SUMMARY *Additional information about interferons: Some individuals develop neutralizing antibodies (NABs) to the interferons (Avonex, Betaseron, Rebif, and Extavia), but their impact on the effectiveness of these medications has not been established. Many continue to do well on these drugs despite the presence of NABs. Others may have sub-optimal results even without NABs present. The MS Council and the American Academy of Neurology have concluded that the higher-dosed interferons are likely to be more effective than lower-dosed interferons. Several factors, however, must be considered when selecting one of these drugs, and this decision must be made on an individual basis under the guidance of a qualified physician. Please note that MSAA does not endorse or recommend any specific drug or treatment. Individuals are advised to consult with a physician about the potential benefits and risks of the different treatment therapies.

According to a company press release, the study met primary and most secondary endpoints, significantly reducing the annual relapse rate in adults with relapsing MS. Side effects were said to be similar to those reported from previous studies of ponesimod and for this class of therapy. These include potential to cause a temporary slowing of heart rate, anxiety, dizziness, breathlessness, raised liver enzymes, influenza, sleeplessness and swelling of the lower legs.  Further details will be presented at the 2019 Congress of the European Committee for Treatment and Research in MS in September. A second Phase 3 trial is underway, and the company plans to apply to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration seeking approval to treat relapsing MS later this year.  DETAILS Multiple sclerosis involves an immune system attack on the brain and spinal cord. Ponesimod is a compound that binds to a docking site (sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 1, or S1Preceptor) on immune cells, including T cells and B cells (lymphocytes) that have been implicated in causing nervous system damage in MS. The pill induces immune cells to remain in lymph nodes, inhibiting their migration into the brain and spinal cord. Similar therapies are approved by the FDA to treat MS—Gilenyafingolimod, Novartis International AG) and Mayzent (siponimod, Novartis International AG), and one is under review by the FDA (ozanimod, Celgene Corporation).  In an earlier phase II study in people with MS, ponesimod significantly reduced disease activity seen on MRI scans ( 2014 Nov; 85(11): 1198–1208).   Participants were randomly assigned to receive oral ponesimod 20 mg once daily or teriflunomide 14 mg once daily for 108 weeks. The primary outcome that was measured was the rate of relapses. Secondary endpoints included fatigue, disease activity on imaging scans, and disability accumulation.   According to a company press release, the study met primary and most secondary endpoints, significantly reducing the annual relapse rate in adults with relapsing MS. Side effects were said to be similar to those reported from previous studies of ponesimod and for this class of therapy. These include potential to cause a temporary slowing of heart rate, anxiety, dizziness, breathlessness, raised liver enzymes, influenza, sleeplessness and swelling of the lower legs. Also in phase 2 studies, an initial temporary slowing of heart rate was minimized by starting people on low doses and gradually increasing over several days.   Further details will be presented at the 2019 Congress of the European Committee for Treatment and Research in MS in September.

Read about progress and challenges in MS research from the world’s largest MS research meeting. We are at a pivotal moment in time where significant progress is being made and breakthrough solutions can change the world for everyone with MS When Sylvia Lawry started the MS movement in 1946 with the founding of the National MS Society, research into multiple sclerosis was almost non-existent. The disease took years to diagnose, and there were no therapies proven to slow the course of MS. Things have changed. Decades of research into MS and the basic workings of the immune and nervous systems have built a critical platform of knowledge now serving as a springboard for progress. The Society’s $1.06 billion research investment has fueled many of these advances, and today’s picture looks different for many: There are  specifically approved for treating and managing MS, and more potential MS therapies in development today than at any other time in history. MS is more quickly diagnosed, enabling early and sustained therapy to slow disease activity There is much greater awareness of the many and ways to address them to improve quality of life Scientists are making breakthroughs in identifying that can increase a person’s susceptibility to MS, which will help lead to ways to prevent the disease. We have made progress but more must be done for those living with forms of progressive MS for which there are limited treatment options.  The hope – and potential - for new, more effective treatments for MS has never been greater.

Researchers are tracking down exciting leads and making headway in virtually every field related to MS. New technologies such as gene chip technology and new MRI-based imaging techniques are also speeding progress.  These advances allow scientists to revisit age-old questions about MS, leading to insights and significant progress toward stopping MS progression, restoring what’s been lost, and ending MS forever. Here are some recent examples: Researchers are making headway to understand how the body’s gut microbiome may influence MS severity, which could lead to new approaches to stopping MS. Testing is underway of approaches to protecting the nervous system from MS damage, including repurposing therapies already approved for other disorders. Major clinical trials are underway testing novel approaches to treating all forms of MS, including progressive MS. The global Progressive MS Alliance is focusing new resources on finding the answers that will lead to new treatments and ultimately, end progressive MS. Scientists are learning new information about how MS damages the nervous system and cells and factors involved in the body’s ability to recover from injury. Early human trials of investigative therapies are underway aimed at repairing myelin. Studies are providing new evidence that exercise and rehabilitation can improve many functions and even help rewire and possibly build areas of the brain, and researchers are pursuing these leads to find the best ways people can maximize quality of life. Studies are uncovering lifestyle factors that people can change – such as smoking, childhood obesity, and vitamin D levels – that may reduce the risk of the next generation developing MS. Researchers have found gene variations that combine to influence whether a person is more susceptible to MS, and are pursuing these clues to help understand what causes MS and how to find better treatments and prevention.

49591d37-bce0-438f-b9ac-327037cabc4d,"— Sciatica is a specific kind of pain caused by pinching or damage to the sciatic nerve. This nerve extends from the lower back, through the hips and buttocks, and splits down both legs. The pain sensation radiates across the nerve, but the frequency and severity varies. Pain, especially neuropathic pain, is a common symptom in people living with multiple sclerosis (MS). It results from damage to the nerves of the central nervous system and can lead to burning or a sharp, stabbing sensation. Understandably, people with MS who also experience sciatica may think it’s rooted in their MS. But most of the neuropathic pain of MS is limited to the central nervous system, which doesn’t involve the sciatic nerve. Pain associated with MS also has different causes and mechanisms than sciatica. Still, MS and sciatica can exist together. Some of the daily difficulties associated with living with MS coincide with suspected causes of sciatica. The current understanding, though, is that the two are mostly unrelated conditions. The difference between MS pain and sciatic nerve pain MS is an autoimmune disorder in which your immune system attacks myelin, the protective layer around nerve fibers. This affects the pathways of your central nervous system that regulate feeling and sensation in the body. MS can cause a variety of painful sensations, including: feelings of burning, tingling, or aching in lower legs shock-like sensations traveling from your back toward your lower limbs Most of these painful sensations result from short circuiting of the brain’s neural pathways. Sciatica is a bit different. Its pathway isn’t an autoimmune response, but bodily stressors on the sciatic nerve itself. This pain is usually caused by lower body changes or habits that pinch or twist the nerve. Herniated disks, bone spurs, and obesity can put pressure on the sciatic nerve. People in sedentary occupations who sit for prolonged periods of time are also more likely to show signs of sciatica. The key difference is that MS causes dysfunction of the central nervous system’s signaling and pathways. In sciatica, the most common cause is pressure that pinches or strains the sciatic nerve. Approximately of Americans will report sciatic pain at some point in their lives. So, it’s not unusual that people with MS may experience sciatica, too. Also, MS can lead to changes to your body and activity level. Decreased mobility may lead to long periods of sitting, which is associated with sciatica. There is some evidence that the lesions that are a sign of MS damage can extend to the sciatic nerve. One compared 36 people with MS to 35 people without MS. All of the participants underwent magnetic resonance neurography, an advanced technology for obtaining high-resolution images of nerves. The researchers found that the people with MS had slightly on the sciatic nerve than those without MS. This study is one of the only to demonstrate peripheral nervous system involvement in people with MS. Some experts believe this research can change the way doctors diagnose and treat MS. But more research is necessary to truly understand the involvement of the peripheral nervous system, including the sciatic nerve, in people with MS. It may be difficult to differentiate the types of pain you’re experiencing. Sciatica is unique in that the sensation seems to move from your lower spine to your buttocks and down the back of your leg, as if traveling the length of the nerve. Also, people with sciatica often feel it in only one leg. The pinch causing the pain is usually only on one side of the body. Treatments for sciatica vary according to severity. They include: medications, like anti-inflammatories, muscle relaxants, narcotics, tricyclic antidepressants, and antiseizure medications physical therapy to correct posture that may be straining the nerve and strengthen the support muscles around the nerve lifestyle changes, like more exercise, weight loss, or better sitting posture Surgery is usually reserved for cases with loss of bowel or bladder control or lack of success with other therapies. In situations where a bone spur or herniated disk is pinching the sciatic nerve, surgery may also be necessary. Certain medications may cause a negative interaction with an MS treatment. Your doctor can help you determine which treatments are right for you. They can also help you come up with an exercise plan that matches your abilities. It’s easy to mistake sciatica as a symptom or related condition of MS, which often causes neuropathic pain. But while the two do coexist, sciatica isn’t caused by MS. It’s caused by strain on the sciatic nerve. Thankfully, there are many remedies for sciatica. Your healthcare provider can point you to treatments to alleviate sciatica pain while also taking your MS and its treatments into consideration. — More in Finding Balance with Progressing Multiple Sclerosis Lifestyle Modifications That Make a Difference for Secondary Progressive MS Understanding Secondary-Progressive Multiple Sclerosis Mobility Support Devices for Secondary Progressive MS: Braces, Walking Devices, and More FDA Approves 2 New Multiple Sclerosis Drugs: What You Need to Know New Medication and Treatment Options for Secondary Progressive MS Understanding Secondary-Progressive Multiple Sclerosis Secondary-progressive MS (SPMS) is a form of multiple sclerosis.

Reaching an evidence-based prognosis for personalized treatment of multiple sclerosis , –() Personalized treatment is ideal for multiple sclerosis (MS) owing to the heterogeneity of clinical features, but current knowledge gaps, including validation of biomarkers and treatment algorithms, limit practical implementation. The contemporary approach to personalized MS therapy depends on evidence-based prognostication, an initial treatment choice and evaluation of early treatment responses to identify the need to switch therapy. Prognostication is directed by baseline clinical, environmental and demographic factors, MRI measures and biomarkers that correlate with long-term disability measures. The initial treatment choice should be a shared decision between the patient and physician. In addition to prognosis, this choice must account for patient-related factors, including comorbidities, pregnancy planning, preferences of the patients and their comfort with risk, and drug-related factors, including safety, cost and implications for treatment sequencing. Treatment response has traditionally been assessed on the basis of relapse rate, MRI lesions and disability progression. Larger longitudinal data sets have enabled development of composite outcome measures and more stringent standards for disease control. Biomarkers, including neurofilament light chain, have potential as early surrogate markers of prognosis and treatment response but require further validation. Overall, attainment of personalized treatment for MS is complex but will be refined as new data become available. Personalized treatment of multiple sclerosis (MS) depends on prognostication at baseline, a shared treatment decision between the physician and patient, and early assessment of response to therapy. Prognosis can be evaluated soon after diagnosis on the basis of demographic and environmental factors, clinical features, MRI measures and biomarkers. Individuals with poor prognostic features should be recommended high-efficacy therapies early on; studies are underway to investigate whether most patients with relapsing–remitting MS could benefit from initial aggressive therapy. During the treatment discussion between the neurologist and patient, factors such as comorbidities, pregnancy planning, patient preferences, risk tolerance, safety, cost and treatment sequencing should be considered in addition to prognosis. Early assessment of treatment response is important to identify the need to switch therapy; composite outcome measures that incorporate clinical and MRI data are best for predicting long-term disability. Personalized MS therapy is currently limited by a lack of evidence-based biomarkers; newer biomarkers, such as neurofilament light chain, have potential, but further validation and standardization of assays are required.

3a7554cd-8346-49e5-aa25-cac19720d76d,"Research Highlights from the AAN and CMSC 2018 Annual Meetings Research Highlights from the AAN and CMSC 2018 Annual Meetings Disease-Modifying Therapies in the Research Pipeline Various Strategies for Wellness and Symptom Management, Physical Activity and Exercise, Vitamin D, and Reproductive-Health Topics Hot Topics in MS: Stem Cells, Lipoic Acid, Diet and MS, Obesity and MS, Gut Microbiome, and Medical Marijuana The cascade of research driving advances in multiple sclerosis (MS) continued at the same heightened pace in the first half of 2018. The results of numerous significant studies were reported at the Annual Meeting of the American Academy of Neurology (AAN), held in Los Angeles in April, and the Annual Meeting of the Consortium of Multiple Sclerosis Centers (CMSC), which took place in Nashville in May. We have summarized some of the most interesting findings from those conferences in this update. Disease-Modifying Therapies in the Research Pipeline The treatment options for people with MS are likely to continue to expand in the years just ahead, as several disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) are in late stages of clinical development and/or are under review by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Five noteworthy studies of such “pipeline” medications are summarized here. Cladribine and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) outcomes Cladribine is an oral medication taken for up to 20 days over a period of two years. It selectively targets the immune system’s B cells and T cells, leading to depletion of those cells followed by a distinct pattern of “reconstitution” as new B cells and T cells are produced. It is approved for use in relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) in several countries, but is not yet approved for use in the United States. In the Phase III CLARITY study, cladribine showed efficacy when compared to placebo over the course of two years of use by people with RRMS. A post-hoc analysis of that study’s data examined the impact of cladribine on a subset of individuals who had high disease activity as measured by relapses, MRI findings, and other characteristics. The analysis found that the effectiveness of cladribine versus placebo in this subpopulation was comparable to that seen in the overall CLARITY population in terms of reducing MRI markers of disease activity. This includes reducing such MRI markers as cumulative new T1 gadolinium-enhancing lesions and cumulative combined unique active lesions. This post-hoc analysis did not focus on safety. However, in the CLARITY study from which this analysis’ MRI data were derived, certain adverse events occurred more frequently in the cladribine groups than in participants receiving placebo. These adverse events included lymphocytopenia (21.6 percent in the 3.5-mg cladribine group and 31.5 percent in the 5.25-mg group, versus 1.8 percent in the placebo group), and herpes zoster (eight patients and 12 patients, respectively, versus no patients). As clinicians experience continued progress in treating MS overall, an increasing focus is placed on improving outcomes in people with high disease activity. Studies of this type help provide informed treatment strategies for these individuals. Opicinumab is a monoclonal antibody that targets LINGO-1, a protein in the central nervous system whose role is to halt myelination (repair of the protective covering of the nerves) and prevent the survival of neurons (nerve cells). The SYNERGY trial assessed various doses of opicinumab, given by intravenous infusion, in combination with interferon beta-1a, over the course of 72 weeks in people with relapsing forms of MS (RMS). The results showed a sort of “inverted U” effect with more favorable outcomes in the 10 mg/kg and 30 mg/kg dose groups, indicating that other factors may have been involved in how the participants responded. That finding prompted investigators to explore those factors associated with a better response to opicinumab. Their post-hoc analysis identified three factors associated with better response to the medication: shorter disease duration (less than 20 years); lower baseline magnetization transfer ratio values in T2 lesions, which may signify lower myelin content in those lesions; and lower baseline diffusion tensor imaging-radial diffusivity values in T2 lesions, a characteristic that may be consistent with greater structural integrity. Practicing “precision medicine” involves identifying those factors that enable clinicians to give the right medication to the right patient at the right time. As this study shows, that effort may entail drawing on highly technical, and possibly even less understood, biomedical characteristics and concepts in the service of individualizing care. Ublituximab and central nervous system lesions in relapsing MS Ublituximab is a monoclonal antibody given by infusion. Like Ocrevus, ublituximab targets the CD20 molecule. Researchers evaluated 24-week data from a Phase II trial of the medication in people with relapsing forms of MS. Among 31 individuals who had a total of 73 T1 gadolinium-enhancing (Gd+) lesions on MRI at baseline, no T1 Gd+ lesions were found at Week 24. Additionally, T2-lesion volume decreased by 8.1 percent from baseline to Week 24, prompting the authors to conclude that ublituximab has “robust efficacy” on MRI endpoints. Ozanimod is an oral, once-daily medication being evaluated for use in RRMS. It is a selective modulator of two types of S1P receptors: S1P1 and S1P5. Data from two Phase III studies, SUNBEAM and RADIANCE Part B, show that ozanimod, given at 1 mg/daily and 0.5 mg/daily, had favorable outcomes relative to Avonex (interferon beta-1a) – both in terms of annualized relapse rate (ARR) and MRI findings. Annualized relapse rate, or ARR, refers to how many relapses a person in a particular study group is likely to have, on average, over a one-year period. For example, if the placebo group in a clinical study had an ARR of “1,” the average person in that group could expect to have one relapse per year. Ozanimod, given at doses of either 1.0 mg or 0.5 mg, reduced the ARR by 48 percent and 31 percent respectively, compared to interferon beta-1a in the SUNBEAM trial. In these same doses, it also reduced the ARR by 38 percent and 21 percent respectively, compared to interferon beta-1a in the RADIANCE trial. Meanwhile, the adjusted mean number of new or enlarging T2 lesions was reduced by 25 percent to 48 percent in people taking ozanimod versus those receiving interferon beta-1a. Additionally, the individuals taking ozanimod had fewer adverse events overall and fewer adverse events leading to study discontinuation. Siponimod, relapses, and disability progression in secondary-progressive MS Siponimod is an oral medication being studied for use in secondary-progressive MS (SPMS). Its mechanism of action is similar to that of Gilenya (fingolimod), in that it works at the S1P receptor family to block the movement of lymph cells from lymph nodes; however, siponimod appears to interact with fewer of the receptors than Gilenya does – with its primary actions at the S1P1 and the S1P5 receptors, the same receptors that ozanimod targets. The Phase III EXPAND study showed that siponimod reduced confirmed disability progression (CDP). Investigators analyzed the results of that trial to understand to what extent, if any, this effect was related to a reduction in relapses. This information is important to uncover, because it could have implications for the effectiveness of the medication in people who do not experience relapses or who have very infrequent relapses. Using sophisticated statistical analyses, the researchers concluded that, “Siponimod treatment reduces the risk for CDP in both relapsing and non-relapsing SPMS patients. Our analyses suggest that siponimod’s effect on disability is largely independent from the effect on relapses.” Research into the safety and effectiveness of a DMT does not stop when that medication wins approval from the FDA. Several recently reported studies provide ongoing information on approved DMTs or findings from focused analyses of data from those medications’ major Phase III clinical trials. Highlights from several such studies are reported below. Ocrevus (ocrelimzumab) was approved by the FDA in 2017 for RMS and PPMS. The medication is administered by IV infusion, with 600 mg given every six months. The safety and efficacy of Ocrevus were assessed in two large clinical trials, OPERA I and OPERA II, in which individuals with relapsing MS received either Ocrevus or Rebif (interferon beta-1a). At the end of those trials, study participants were allowed to continue on Ocrevus or switch from Rebif to Ocrevus during a so-called “open-label extension” (OLE) period. A recent analysis found that switching from Rebif to Ocrevus at the start of the OLE period was associated with rapid and significant reductions in disease activity as identified on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Patients who changed therapies in the OLE went from having an adjusted number of 0.48 T1 gadolinium-enhancing lesions per scan prior to switching, to an average 0.00 such lesions per scan after one year and two years on Ocrevus. Tysabri (natalizumab) is a monoclonal antibody that is administered by IV infusion of a 300-mg dose every four weeks. The medication was approved for use in adults with relapsing MS in 2004. However, Tysabri was voluntarily withdrawn from the market the next year after three cases of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), a rare but potentially fatal brain infection caused by the JC virus, were identified in individuals taking the medication. Tysabri became available again in 2006, following implementation of a comprehensive risk-management program, which includes testing potential Tysabri users to see if they have anti-JC virus antibodies. Now, a team of New Zealand researchers have reported favorable results with administering Tysabri every six weeks rather than every four weeks, noting that they pursued extended-interval dosing with a view toward reducing the risk of PML. Those investigators report that after administering Tysabri at six-week intervals to 27 patients for an average of two years, none of the participants had lesions on MRI, and only one reported relapse. No participants were diagnosed with PML. This treatment strategy reflects ongoing efforts across the MS treatment spectrum to balance efficacy and safety to the patient’s maximal advantage. Aubagio (teriflunomide) was approved in 2012 for use in relapsing MS. It is an oral medication administered as 7-mg or 14-mg once daily. An analysis of long-term data on patients with relapsing MS who participated in two Phase III trials of the medication and the extensions of those trials found that 74 percent taking the 14-mg dose had stable or improved Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) scores over five years. Mean EDSS scores at five years were higher (indicating disease progression) in those who experienced a relapse, compared with those who did not – at 2.70 and 2.43 respectively. A separate study examined 169 pregnancies in women who took Aubagio during pregnancy. Based on findings of teratogenicity – an elevated incidence of birth defects – in animal studies, use of the medication is contraindicated in pregnant women and females of reproductive potential not using effective contraception. Nonetheless, some women have taken the medication shortly before conceiving or while pregnant. In this study, the final dose of Aubagio was administered pre-conception or in the first trimester in all but four cases. Outcomes were known for 67 of the 169 pregnancies. Two structural abnormalities were reported: one case of congenital hydrocephalus in a full-term pregnancy and one cystic hygroma (a fluid-filled sac resulting from a blockage in the lymphatic system) detected on ultrasound during pregnancy (with the outcome of that pregnancy unknown). Researchers concluded that the current data from pregnancies exposed to teriflunomide show no warning signs of a treatment-related increased risk for birth defects. Lemtrada (alemtuzumab) is a monoclonal antibody approved for use in RMS in 2014. It is administered by intravenous infusion over four hours for two multi-day treatment courses 12 months apart. Researchers recently analyzed data on 393 individuals who had participated in clinical trials of Lemtrada and then remained on the medication during a longer-term extension study. The researchers found that after using Lemtrada for six years, 77 percent of the more than 300 patients studied showed stable or improved Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) scores compared to their baseline scores. Additionally, 43 percent achieved a six-month confirmed disability improvement (CDI), further underscoring the long-term benefits of treatment. Another analysis examined outcomes in extension-study patients who received re-treatment with Lemtrada due to disease activity after the initial two courses of therapy. Among 178 participants who received at least one re-treatment, the annualized relapse rate (ARR) fell from 0.85 (12 months before receiving a third course of Lemtrada) to 0.20 (12 months after the third course). The percentage of individuals with a CDI increased from 4 percent to 14 percent over those two time periods. Researchers concluded, “Patients who were re-treated due to relapse and/or MRI activity after the initial two courses demonstrate continued alemtuzumab [Lemtrada] efficacy after [Course 3] with reduced relapses and stable or improved disability.” Glatiramer acetate is an injectable DMT approved for use in relapsing forms of MS. It is available both as a branded medication (Copaxone) and in generic form from two other companies. In a one-year, placebo-controlled study, administering the medication in a dose of 40 mg/mL three-times weekly reduced the annualized relapse rate (ARR) by 34 percent and MRI disease activity by 34.7 percent relative to placebo. A new analysis shows that those benefits were sustained for up to five years in people participating in the open-label phase of the study, which was supported by Teva. The overall ARR during the entire long-term follow-up period was 0.26 for individuals who started on glatiramer acetate in the placebo-controlled phase of the study, and was 0.32 for those who switched from placebo to glatiramer acetate in the open-label phase. Researchers added that the most common adverse events seen over the long term were generally mild and consistent with the medication’s established safety profile. Interferon beta-1b was the first DMT approved for use in MS, and today is available in branded form as Betaseron and Extavia. A 23-year observational follow-up study was conducted with 87 patients treated at the Henry Ford Health System in Detroit. The study found that 29 percent of individuals used the medication for less than one year, while 18 percent remained on therapy for more than 15 years. Of the individuals who stopped treatment, side effects were the reason cited most often in those who discontinued therapy before five years of use, while lack of efficacy was given as the reason for stopping in those who used the medication for longer periods. A stable disease course on a DMT does not predict continued stability after discontinuing that therapy, regardless of a person’s age. Noting that clinicians sometimes recommend stopping DMT therapy as individuals with MS get older, researchers assessed the advisability of this strategy by examining data from the New York State MS Consortium (NYSMSC) database. Of 135 patients who were considered stable on DMT therapy as determined by minimal change in EDSS score, 35.6 percent saw their EDSS score worsen after stopping their DMT. Age did not affect post-discontinuation course, with 34.1 percent of people age 54 years and younger and 37.7 percent of people age 55 years and older recording unfavorable changes in their EDSS scores after going off a DMT. People with MS and their healthcare providers today face a “welcome dilemma” unimaginable even 20 years ago. With more than a dozen disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) now approved by the FDA for use in adults, patients and clinicians have an opportunity (and challenge) to select the medication likely to best address the each individual’s specific health status and needs. That can be a daunting prospect, particularly because few clinical trials have directly compared one agent with another. Given the scarcity of such studies, investigators often rely on sophisticated analytical methods – such as propensity scoring and other techniques – to assess the merits of one agent relative to others. Those methods, while useful, typically are considered by physicians to be less authoritative than a head-to-head trial of two agents. This section highlights five recently presented studies that compared agents within the same trial or via analysis of data drawn from different trials or large patient databases. In considering various treatments, however, it is critical to not only look at clinical trial data and other analyses, but also for individuals to talk with their clinician about their specific history and circumstances – in order to individualize their care and achieve an optimal effect. DMT impact on cognition in patients at increased risk of progressive disease The OPERA 1 and OPERA 2 trials were identical Phase III studies that compared the effectiveness and safety of Ocrevus (ocrelizumab) to Rebif (interferon beta-1a) in people with relapsing MS. Study participants received either 600 mg of Ocrevus every 24 weeks or 44 ug of Rebif three times a week for 96 weeks. The studies included 186 individuals receiving Ocrevus and 180 receiving Rebif who were considered to be at increased risk of progressive disease based on their Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) and pyramidal Kurtzke Functional Systems scores. Participants completed the Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT) at baseline and during the course of 96 weeks to assess their cognitive function. Over the study period, individuals receiving Ocrevus who were at increased risk for disease progression had a greater mean improvement in SDMT scores than did increased-risk individuals receiving Rebif (6.2 for Ocrevus versus 2.6 for Rebif). Assessing DMTs in terms of annualized relapse rates Annualized relapse rate (ARR) is a measure of a DMT’s impact on disease course in MS. Researchers drew on data from two studies of Plegridy (peginterferon beta-1a) and two studies of Aubagio (teriflunomide) to assess the ARR in newly diagnosed individuals starting one or the other of those medications. The participants had been diagnosed with relapsing MS within one year of study enrollment and had not taken other DMTs. The investigators used individual patient data from the studies to match analyzed subjects by key baseline characteristics. Their analysis showed that at 108 weeks after treatment initiation, the ARR was numerically lower in newly diagnosed individuals receiving Plegridy than in newly diagnosed Aubagio patients. However, this difference was not statistically significant. In a separate study, a German network of more than 130 neurologists drew on its database of roughly 25,000 individuals with relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) to assess various DMTs in terms of ARR. The analysis found that Tecfidera (dimethyl fumarate) had a statistically significant reduction in ARR versus interferon medications. Tecfidera also performed better than the other agents in terms of time to first relapse. A third study assessed the ARR in people with highly active RRMS who switched to either Tysabri (natalizumab) or Gilenya (fingolimod) after inadequate response to DMTs that are considered first-line therapies in Europe. Such medications include interferon medications, glatiramer acetate, Aubagio, and Tecfidera. Researchers analyzed data for 897 “patient triplets” or matched sets of individuals who either switched from one first-line therapy to another or from a first-line therapy to Tysabri or Gilenya. The study drew from the MSBase Registry, an international online registry for neurologists studying multiple sclerosis and other neuro-immunological diseases. The analysis found that after switching, individuals moving from a first-line therapy to Tysabri had an ARR of 0.21; those moving to Gilenya had an ARR of 0.30; and those switching from one first-line therapy to another had an ARR of 0.33. The ARR was statistically significantly reduced for Tysabri, with no evidence of difference for Gilenya. Earlier this year, Gilenya (fingolimod) became the first DMT approved to treat relapsing MS in adolescents and children aged 10 years and older. This medication was approved for use in adults with RMS in 2010. The Phase III PARADIGMS study compared use of Gilenya to interferon beta-1a for up to two years in 214 individuals aged 10 to 17 years with pediatric-onset MS. At the end of the study, Gilenya reduced the annualized rate of new or newly enlarging T2 lesions by 52.6 percent and the number of gadolinium-enhancing T1 lesions per scan by 66.0 percent compared with interferon beta-1a. The early recognition of MS and the evidence-based assessment of likely disease course are critical to patients’ and physicians’ ability to engage in shared decision-making on treatment choices and overall wellness strategies. A significant amount of research is being conducted to map the connections between imaging findings or biomarker levels and establishing the diagnosis and predicting the course of MS. Other studies are focused on what measures of physical function may reveal about current and future health status. Several recent studies exploring these issues are highlighted below. 2017 McDonald Criteria apply well to children at MS onset MRI findings play a key role in the diagnosis of MS, but most research on the significance of imaging results has been focused on adults. Now, a study by investigators from The Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia and other institutions, has found that the 2017 McDonald Criteria are largely applicable to children, as well as adults, when assessing patients at clinical disease onset. The researchers assessed more than 2,800 MRI scans from 331 pediatric patients with MS, acquired demyelinating syndrome, and related conditions, and followed those patients’ course over a median of six years. They found that the presence of ≥one T1-hypointense lesions or ≥one periventricular lesions were the MRI features most predictive of MS outcome. The 2010 McDonald criteria and 2017 version of those criteria had comparable utility in predicting a pediatric patient’s disease course, but the investigators said the 2017 criteria were easier to apply. “Both ‘black holes’ and periventricular lesions at baseline are strong predictors of MS” in children, as they are in adults, the researchers concluded, adding that evidence of new disease activity is required to confirm MS in children who present with acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM). Location of brain lesions predictive of walking speed The presence of MRI-detected lesions in the infratentorial/cerebellar region of the brain is associated with slower walking speed in people with MS, according to a retrospective chart review of 82 individuals. A team of Connecticut-based researchers reviewed magnetic resonance images and medical records to determine whether the location of lesions in four areas of the central nervous system – the spinal cord, and the infratentorial/cerebellar, juxtacortical, and periventricular regions of the brain – was associated with mobility and disability in people with MS. No significant relationship was found between number of CNS regions with lesions and Extended Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score or time in performing the Timed 25-Foot Walk test. Similarly, no significant relationship was seen between the presence of lesions in any one region of the CNS and EDSS score. Higher number of oligoclonal bands correlates with relapses and disease progression People with relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) who had 10 or more oligoclonal bands (OCBs) in their cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples were far more likely to have relapses and disease progression over the ensuing two years than individuals with RRMS who had <10 OCBs in their CSF samples. That was the finding from a retrospective study of 128 people with RRMS on DMT therapy. Researchers from the University of Pennsylvania also found that in addition to having more relapses and more new lesions on MRI, people with ≥10 OCBs were more likely to begin using an assistive device relative to their counterparts with fewer OCBs. “As OCBs may have greater diagnostic weight going forward, the quantity may be important in guiding selection of DMTs,” the study’s authors noted. Tapping into a new means of assessing MS subtype and mobility The number of times a person with MS can tap his or her foot in 10 seconds correlates with MS subtype and with results of mobility measures such as the 25-Foot Walk Test (25FWT). This finding was discovered by researchers from the University of Massachusetts Amherst and related institutions. In a study of 30 people with non-progressive MS, 30 with progressive MS, and 17 age- and sex-matched healthy controls, 10-second tap counts distinguished people with MS from healthy controls, and those with progressive MS from their peers with non-progressive MS. Further, slower foot tapping correlated with slower performance on the 25FWT and Timed Up and Go test (TUG). “The associations between foot tap speed and mobility measures, such as the TUG test and 25FWT, suggest that rapid foot-tapping may be a useful marker for tracking or predicting progression of mobility dysfunction in people with MS, regardless of their ability to ambulate,” the researchers noted. Various Strategies for Wellness and Symptom Management, Physical Activity and Exercise, Vitamin D, and Reproductive-Health Topics People with MS often must contend with a wide range of issues affecting their quality of life, overall health status, and general well-being. As the nature and impact of those issues have become better understood in recent years, an array of healthcare professionals – from psychologists and physical therapists to health educators and epidemiologists – are analyzing databases and devising innovative programs to further define and more effectively address challenges involving everything from insomnia to infertility. To follow are highlights of research in these areas. These were reported earlier this year at the Annual Meetings of the American Academy of Neurology (AAN) and the Consortium of Multiple Sclerosis Centers (CMSC). Well, maybe not the absolute best medicine, but apparently good medicine when it comes to addressing depression in people with MS and other neurologic conditions. Researchers at Evergreen Health in Kirkland, Washington, conducted a prospective, open trial of laughter therapy (LT) for 31 participants: 17 with MS, eight with Parkinson’s disease, two with spinal cord injury, and the remainder with other disorders of the central nervous system. After participating in eight, 60-minute laughter therapy classes taught by a certified LT instructor (yes, there is such a thing), participants who completed the course saw an improvement from baseline in their scores on a measure of depression. Scores on a separate measure of anxiety essentially were unchanged from baseline. “Our findings show that LT may reduce depression and be administered across a variety of neurological deficits, including for people with limited exercise options due to severe disability,” the researchers noted. However, they added that the approximate 50 percent attrition rate – with 14 participants not completing the program – may indicate a potential shortcoming for when the intervention is employed in people with neurological conditions. Comparing strategies for stress reduction in people with MS Both mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) and group education on stress reduction can provide short-and long-term benefits to people with MS, according to a randomized study involving 62 adults with MS and Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) scores of ≤8.0. Compared to their status at the start of the study, people in both groups experienced significant reductions in stress both eight weeks and 12 months after participating in an MBRS program or group education. Both groups also saw improvement on a measure of emotional well-being at eight weeks, but that improvement was no longer statistically significant at 12 months. No significant differences were found between the two groups in terms of degree of stress reduction achieved or improvement in emotional well-being, suggesting that both approaches are viable options for addressing the stress and other emotional issues that can be part of living with MS. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) may improve insomnia symptoms, sleep quality, and fatigue in the roughly 40 percent of people with MS who experience chronic insomnia, according to an ongoing study. Seven people have completed the randomized controlled trial thus far, with five participating in a six-week program of CBT for insomnia and two serving as controls. The CBT group showed a 78 percent improvement from baseline on a measure of insomnia symptoms, compared to a 38 percent improvement in the control group. Similarly, sleep quality improved by 63 percent for people in the CBT group and 32 percent in the control group. Additionally, two measures of fatigue showed improvements of 70 percent and 50 percent, respectively, for people receiving CBT, versus a 37 percent improvement and 20 percent worsening, respectively, for control group members. Can shared medical appointments enhance wellness in MS? So much needs to happen in an MS patient’s regular visit with his or her clinician. As a result, education on wellness, managing co-morbidities, and other important topics can get lost in the time crunch. Two researchers from Cleveland explored whether shared medical appointments, or SMAs, may be a solution to that problem. In the typical SMA model, individual appointments for patients are scheduled around a time set aside for group instruction and discussion. In this case, the Cleveland researchers offered a monthly SMA, with group sessions covering topics such as nutrition, therapeutic yoga, and guided imagery. Thirty-three patients attended at least one SMA, with 45 percent of those participants returning for at least one more SMA, and 36 percent attending three or more sessions. Patient-satisfaction assessments found 75 percent of participants had a favorable view of the value of the information presented and regarding attending future SMAs. Female patients attended preferentially relative to men, noted the researchers, adding that “encouraging wellness interventions at an earlier age and to wider demographics and disability level” may encourage more people with MS to adopt healthy lifestyle practices. Becoming physically active is a challenge for people with MS – and for all people, for that matter. Staying active after completing a formal physical therapy or exercise program can be even more of a challenge. However, two New York City physical therapists have reported success in encouraging ongoing physical activity among seven of eight participants in a six-week wellness exercise class (WEC) they conducted. All eight of the program’s participants recently had been discharged from outpatient physical therapy. The weekly exercise class that they then entered consisted of 60 minutes of progressive aerobic and resistance training, as well as stretching. Upon completing the six-week class, participants showed improvement from baseline on several measures of the physical and psychological impact of MS. And, in keeping with the adage that success begets success, at a follow-up four weeks after completing the class, seven of the eight class members reported being active in an independent gym program. The researchers concluded, “Providers should work with physical therapists to assure that, after rehabilitation, affordable opportunities such as group WEC exist to help those with MS have the opportunity to independently engage in an exercise program. This bridge between therapy and discharge could safely enhance adherence to exercise post rehabilitation, and potentially decrease the need for a future prolonged course of PT.” Research supports maximal strength training for people with MS Properly supervised maximal strength training (MST) is safe for people with MS and can help improve their strength, balance, and walking speed, according to a team of researchers from Hunter College in New York City. Those researchers conducted a pilot study in which nine people with MS (six women and three men) participated in an eight-week program. The twice-weekly sessions involved leg press, knee flexion, and ankle plantarflexion, with weights increased based on participant capability and preference. At the end of the exercise program, the participants showed significant improvement from baseline in the Six Minute Walk Test and Mini-BESTest. Meanwhile, measures of fatigue and spasticity did not change significantly from the study’s start until its end, suggesting that the strength training did not increase fatigue or spasticity. The researchers noted that while the study is ongoing, the results to date suggest that “MST is a safe and effective intervention, and that [people with multiple sclerosis] can benefit from a higher intensity of intervention than might have previously been thought.” Time spent in physical activity correlates with higher Vitamin D concentrations in people with MS, according to a study of 23 women and 15 men with multiple sclerosis and an Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score of ≤4.0. Researchers used an activity-monitoring device, patient diaries, and measurement of Vitamin D blood levels to follow patients over a one-month period. The participants did not take Vitamin D supplements before or during the study. The fact that study participants who were more physically active had higher levels of Vitamin D than those who were not as active – despite the fact that they were not taking the Vitamin D supplements, is intriguing. This is because many MS patients have lower-than-normal Vitamin D levels, and because physical activity has been shown to improve outcomes in MS. The study’s authors noted that alternative pathways leading to the connection between disease progression and Vitamin D levels need to be considered. Long-term reduction in spasticity seen with intrathecal baclofen therapy Five years after implantation of a pump to deliver intrathecal baclofen therapy, both ambulatory and non-ambulatory people with MS had significant reductions in spasticity, according to researchers from the Cleveland Clinic Mellen Center and related institutions. Those researchers examined the records of 77 individuals (40 ambulatory and 37 non-ambulatory) who had a pump implanted between 2001 and 2014, and for whom at least three years of follow-up data were available. The patient’s mean age at surgery to implant the pump was 47.1 years; 62 percent of the patients were women. For ambulatory patients, spasticity as measured by the Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS) improved from 14.5 (range 10.8-20.25) at baseline to 2 (range 0-8) after five years on IBT. For non-ambulatory patients, MAS score improved from 24 (range 16.5-26) to 2 (range 0-5) after five years of IBT. Pain scores also improved significantly in both groups. Physical therapy (PT) has been shown to improve gait speed in people with MS. The medication dalfampridine extended-release (DER) also can increase gait speed in those with MS, but only about 38 percent of individuals experience this benefit. Now, the results of a small study support combining the interventions in people with MS who do not see a 20 percent or greater improvement in their Timed 25 Foot Walk test (T25W) after three weeks on the medication. The study involved eight adults with MS. Four of those people had been taking DER for three weeks and did not have a ≥20 percent improvement in T25W at the end of that period. They continued on DER for another six weeks, but also engaged in twice-weekly physical therapy during that period. The other four participants did not receive DER but also engaged in six weeks of twice-weekly PT. Among the DER + PT patients, T25FW results improved by 20.7 percent from Week 3 to Week 9, while the PT-only group had a 6.8 percent improvement in T25W during that period. Infertility and MS – findings from a large database analysis Women with MS are more likely to have a diagnosis of infertility, less likely to use infertility medications, and less likely to have a live birth than their age-matched peers without MS. Those are the main findings from an analysis of United States’ commercial insurance claims for 117,041 women with MS and more than 1.4 million women without MS. The analysis, which spanned the period from 2006 through 2015, found that 8.52 percent of women with MS and 8.02 percent of those without MS had a diagnosis of infertility. While that percentage difference is small, the researchers noted that it is statistically significant. Similarly, a significantly lower proportion of women with MS used any fertility treatment relative to women without MS (1.01 percent versus 1.19 percent). Finally, the rate of live births in women on any infertility treatment was 5.00 percent among women with MS, compared with 6.98 percent among those who did not have MS. Data from the New York State Multiple Sclerosis Consortium (NYSMSC) provide reassuring news regarding both the incidence of relapses during pregnancy and the near-term effect on infants of maternal use of DMTs in pregnancy. Among 109 women who reported a pregnancy after being diagnosed with MS, 48.6 percent had a relapse in the two years before becoming pregnant, but just 11.9 percent reported a relapse during pregnancy. Those relapses were more common in the first and second trimesters than in the third trimester. Meanwhile, 45.8 percent of the women reported a relapse in the first two years after birth, with most of the relapses occurring in the first year after delivery. Women who had experienced a relapse in the 24 months before pregnancy were more likely than others to have a relapse in the 24 months after birth, while relapse during pregnancy was not associated with postpartum relapse. Eleven of the women in the analysis were on disease-modifying therapy (DMT) for at least part of their pregnancy, with six continuing to use their DMT through their entire pregnancy. None of those women reported birth problems, and none of their children had been referred for special medical services at age 1 or 2 years. Hot Topics in MS: Stem Cells, Lipoic Acid, Diet and MS, Obesity and MS, Gut Microbiome, and Medical Marijuana Research into interventions for MS extends far beyond the important efforts to develop new pharmacologic treatments and to better understand the efficacy and safety profile of currently approved medications. Increasingly, investigators are assessing the impact of diet, the gut microbiome – a key component of the immune system – and various substances as they look for ways to manage symptoms and improve outcomes. Studies also are exploring the role of two very different types of interventions long used to treat other conditions — medical marijuana and stem-cell transplantation – in MS. This section reviews pertinent findings in these and other areas reported at the 2018 Annual Meetings of the American Academy of Neurology (AAN) and the Consortium of Multiple Sclerosis Centers (CMSC). When relapses continue while taking a DMT – a role for stem-cell therapy? An international team of researchers is assessing the role of stem-cell transplantation for individuals with highly active RRMS who continue to have relapses despite taking a DMT. At the AAN’s annual meeting, those scientists reported interim results from their Multiple Sclerosis International Stem cell Transplant (MIST) trial. The study involves 110 individuals with RRMS on a DMT who have had two or more relapses in the past 12 months. Fifty-five patients were randomly assigned to receive stem-cell transplantation, while the other 55 continue to receive the DMT that their treating neurologist deemed best for them. Importantly, the study is employing “non-myeloablative” stem-cell transplantation, meaning that patients can go through a less-demanding pre-treatment regimen than what was first used in stem-cell transplantation and still often used in treating certain types of cancer. The study’s main endpoint is treatment failure, defined as a 1.0 increase in EDSS sustained for six months or more. After a mean follow-up of three years, 60 percent of patients in the DMT arm had experienced a treatment failure, compared to just 6 percent of those in the stem-cell transplant group. During the first year after transplant, those receiving stem cells saw their EDDS score improve from 3.5 to 2.4, while it worsened in the DMT group from 3.3 to 3.9. Both of those findings were statistically significant. No deaths occurred in the stem-cell transplant group. These results led the researchers to conclude that in people with RRMS who have more than two relapses in a year while on a DMT, stem-cell transplantation is superior to continued use of a disease-modifying therapy. Meanwhile, a separate, smaller study from a single center suggests that stem-cell transplantation may be a first-line option for the minority of MS patients who have rapidly evolving severe multiple sclerosis (RESMS), also known as highly active relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS). British investigators performed stem-cell transplantation on five men and two women who had not received a disease-modifying therapy (DMT), and who had experienced two or more severe relapses in the 12 months before the procedure. These individuals all had clinical or imaging findings that suggested that their MS would continue to worsen, and all had at least one gadolinium-enhancing lesion seen on MRI associated with their relapses. They ranged in age from 27 to 52 years old, and their median time between symptom onset and treatment was nine months. The investigators used each patient’s own stem cells for the procedure. After a median follow-up period of 18 months, none of the participants had experienced a relapse following the transplantation, although one had a single new gadolinium-enhancing lesion six months after treatment. The median Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score for these individuals improved from a median 5.5 before treatment to 3 at the last follow-up. No serious adverse effects were observed. The investigators concluded that autologous (using the patient’s own cells) hematopoietic (blood-cell producing) stem-cell transplantation is safe and effective for previously untreated patients with rapidly evolving, severe MS. Lipoic acid is a naturally occurring compound that exhibits antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. Its potential role as a dietary supplement for people with MS has been the focus of recent research, including a study by investigators from the Oregon Health & Science University and VA Portland Health Care System. Those researchers administered 1,200 mg of oral lipoic acid to people with relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS), secondary-progressive MS (SPMS), and healthy controls. They then drew blood samples to measure the amount of lipoic acid found in the plasma of all three groups, as well as levels of substances involved in immune system responses. In particular, the investigators wanted to see if taking lipoic acid would stimulate the body’s production of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), which plays a role in modulating the immune system. They found that two hours and four hours after ingesting lipoic acid, the health controls and people with SPMS had increased cAMP levels relative to baseline, while those with RRMS had decreases in cAMP. Also, women with RRMS had lower plasma concentrations of prostaglandin E2, which stimulates cAMP, compared to women with SPMS and women without MS four hours after taking lipoic acid. These findings prompted the investigators to conclude that the differences in the way people with RRMS responded to lipoic acid relative to those without MS or with SPMS may have implications for the efficacy of immunomodulatory agents in RRMS. Following a paleolithic diet can help decrease fatigue in MS through changes in people’s lipid profiles, according to a study reported at the AAN annual meeting. The paleolithic – or so-called “caveman” diet – focuses on eating meat, fish, nuts, and vegetables available before the advent of processed food. A one-year study of 18 people with progressive MS found that a comprehensive intervention that included following a paleolithic diet, neuromuscular stimulation, and stress reduction reduced participants’ mean Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS) score from 5.51 at baseline to 3.03 at 12 months. During that time, participants saw their HDL-C (“good cholesterol”) levels increase, their total cholesterol levels decrease, and their body mass index (BMI) fall (BMI is a measure of healthy or unhealthy weight). The researchers concluded, “Lipid profile variables are associated with the improvements in fatigue in progressive MS patients on a modified Paleolithic diet-based multimodal intervention.” Meanwhile, researchers from Johns Hopkins reported on people with MS who follow a Mediterranean-style diet high in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, seafood and polyunsaturated fats while eating little red meat and drinking in moderation. The researchers found that these individuals appear to have less severe depressive and cognitive symptoms than people with MS who follow a more-traditional American diet. The researchers had 34 people with MS complete dietary recall surveys and then assessed those people for depression, cognitive impairment, and other known symptoms of MS. The investigators noted that the results of this cross-sectional survey need to be validated by interventional studies that could better examine the nature of the relationship seen between diet and the MS symptoms studied. Other research being conducted at Johns Hopkins is examining how caloric restriction affects the metabolite profiles of people with MS. In a six-month study, 19 people with MS who were receiving monthly injections of Tysabri and who had a higher body mass index (BMI) of ≥25 kg/m (indicating that they are overweight) chose from one of two calorie-restriction strategies. The first strategy, chosen by 11 individuals, involved continuous calorie restriction (CCR), with participants consuming 78.6 percent of their daily caloric needs each day. The other approach, chosen by eight participants, entailed intermittent calorie restriction (ICR), with people consuming only 25 percent of their daily caloric needs two days per week, and consuming their full caloric needs on the other days of the week. Nine of the 11 people in the CCR group and six of the eight in the ICR group completed the study. Researchers are assessing blood samples collected at baseline, three months, and six months to see how the two calorie-restriction approaches influenced the production of metabolites. They note that the results of their analysis may provide new information on how dietary changes affect clinical outcomes in MS. People who are obese at the onset of MS are likely to experience greater functional impairment and higher risk of relapses in the first two years after onset than people with a healthy weight, according to a study of more than 1,500 people with MS. Drawing on data for 1,524 participants in the Accelerated Cure Project’s study, researchers found that obesity was associated with a 15-percent increase in the number of impaired functional domains and a 30-percent increase in early relapse activity. People who were obese also were on average 8-percent older than non-obese patients at the onset of MS. The investigators explain, “These results warrant further investigation into the impact of this proinflammatory phenotype [obesity] in MS.” Gut reaction? Exploring potential ties between MS and the digestive tract’s microbiome The mix of bacteria found in the digestive tracts of people with MS or clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) differ from the bacterial milieu found in the gastrointestinal systems of people who don’t have those conditions, two recent studies found. Those studies reflect a growing research focus on potential links between MS and the “gut microbiome,” the digestive tract’s bacterial environment, which is known to play a major role in immune-system function. In the first study, American researchers used sophisticated genetic testing to analyze 42 stool samples from individuals with relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) or secondary-progressive MS (SPMS), as well as stool samples from 28 healthy donors. Compared to the samples from healthy volunteers, stool samples from people with RRMS had a statistically significant greater abundance of several types of bacteria, including Ruminococcus torques, Ruminococcus obeum, and Lactospiraces. Escherichia coli and Oscillibacter also were found more often in people with RRMS than in healthy controls. Conversely, people who did not have MS had a higher concentration of other bacteria – including bacteroides fragilis and Roseburia – than did study participants with MS. The researchers noted that further, larger studies are needed to determine whether these findings can help pave the way for markers of disease activity or even therapies that target the composition of the gut microbiome. Meanwhile, Italian investigators found differences in both the stool and blood samples of individuals with clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) – referring to individuals experiencing a symptom of MS, but who have not yet been diagnosed – relative to healthy volunteers. They found that butyrate-producing bacteria were more abundant in the healthy volunteers compared to those with CIS. Additionally, the blood of people with CIS had an increased level of a type of white blood cell involved in immune function – T helper (Th) 17 – and fewer T regulatory (Treg) cells producing Interleukin 10, compared to healthy volunteers. The researchers said that both findings indicate that gut microbiome dysfunction or imbalance exists at the earliest stages of MS. Most people with MS who use medical marijuana (MM), find that the medication helps manage their pain, spasticity, and other symptoms. This is according to two recent small-scale studies. In the first study, 14 individuals at the University of Rochester MS Center (13 with MS and one with transverse myelitis) enrolled in the New York State Medical Marijuana Program and completed a survey on their experience with MM. Ninety-three percent of these individuals who were certified by the state program to use medical marijuana actually had tried the medication at least once, with 77 percent reporting ongoing use, and 62 percent saying they used MM at least daily. Seventy-seven percent of participants said MM was helpful in managing their symptoms, 70 percent said that their quality of life improved with marijuana use, and most respondents reported no side effects. Most subjects estimated that they spent between $100 and $300 per month on MM, and cost was cited as a factor in stopping use of MM or using the agent less frequently.   The second study is being conducted in Colorado, where cannabis use – for any purpose, not just medical reasons – is legal. The experience and beliefs of 25 patients from the Rocky Mountain Multiple Sclerosis Center at the University of Colorado were reported in preliminary findings from the research. Fifty-six percent of those participants believe cannabis has a beneficial effect on MS symptoms, while 8 percent think marijuana could entail harm in terms of MS symptoms. Seventy-six percent said they would consider cannabis use to ease their symptoms. Pain was the reason most frequently cited for using cannabis (by 57 percent of respondents), followed by spasticity/muscle tightness (29 percent), and muscle spasms (14 percent). Slowed thinking was the most commonly reported side effect, cited by 29 percent of participants. Forty-eight percent of survey respondents said that they were not currently using cannabis, with half of those people saying their non-usage was because they did not know enough about the medication. The authors of the second study noted, “As cannabis becomes more available under the laws of individual states, the results of this ongoing study may have important implications in the future landscape of MS symptom treatment and research exploring the efficacy of cannabis for MS symptom management.” For general information or to speak with a trained Client Services Specialist, please call MSAA’s Helpline at .

Sessions focused on many MS topics including ways to track MS activity, progressive MS, and reversing symptoms.   Many studies showed continued benefits of available therapies and longer-term safety information, as well as advances in basic laboratory studies. Studies presented at meetings such as this are generally considered preliminary until they are published in peer-reviewed journals. Below are select science highlights. Browse here, or follow links below to specific study abstracts.   : Ian D. Duncan, BMVS, PhD, a neuroscientist and Professor of Neurology at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, was awarded the 2020 John Dystel Prize for MS Research for his groundbreaking research on myelin (the protective nerve coating that is damaged in MS). This prize is annually awarded at the AAN conference. Read more about his contributions and the Dystel Prize   Alterations in a person’s sense of smell may be a common issue in MS and may represent a way to track underlying disease activity. In a study of 113 people with relapsing MS, Gabriel Bsteh, MD, PhD (Medical University Vienna) and colleagues tested whether smell sensitivity correlated with responses to treatment. When improvements in the ability to smell occurred in the first three months of starting disease-modifying treatment, and were maintained for 12 months, participants were not likely to experience a relapse for the duration of the 2-year study. If confirmed, sensitivity to odors could become an easily trackable marker of treatment response. Read more about how smell and taste are affected by MS   : Bari Talente, JD (Executive Vice President of Advocacy. National MS Society) reported on an effort to understand the experiences that people living with MS have when accessing disease-modifying treatments, including the financial and emotional effects associated with the price of these medications. An electronic survey was sent to a sample of people with MS in July 2019; 578 people completed it. Seventy percent received financial assistance for their treatments, mostly from pharmaceutical companies, with 81% of them reporting they would face financial burdens without the assistance. Forty percent reported some stress or emotional impact due to high out-of-pocket costs and have adjusted their lifestyle to afford their medication.

Kristen Krysko, MD (University of California at San Francisco), and colleagues nationwide reviewed the records of 504 girls with MS from the network’s database. MS onset occurred before menstruation in 53 girls. Relapses increased during the onset of menstruation and decreased thereafter. The researchers urge healthcare providers to take this into consideration in the therapeutic approach to MS during menstruation onset.   is a common and troublesome symptom experienced by people with MS. Sheila Steiner and colleagues at the University of Utah wanted to make sure they were fully capturing this symptom, so they developed a tool that utilized traditional scales that rate pain numerically (1 to 10) as well as pictorial representations. They used the new approach to capture information from 70 people with MS, and found that it revealed high levels of pain, and that medications used to control pain were not working well enough. They are continuing to use this tool to follow individuals in hopes of improving pain control.   Evidence is growing that alterations in the gut microbiome – which comprises billions of bacteria - play a role in MS disease activity. Zongqi Xia, MD, PhD (University of Pittsburgh) and colleagues examined genes and gut bacteria in people who had first-degree relatives with MS but did not have MS symptoms. Those who had more genes associated with MS risk also had a network of gut bacteria species found in people with MS. Finding evidence of these changes in people at higher risk for MS is an important addition to the .     Jens Kuhle, MD (University of Basel) and colleagues looked at samples taken from 475 people with secondary progressive MS during a clinical trial testing Mayzent (Siponimod, Novartis AG) to see if the protein known as GFAP would be associated with disease progression or response to treatment. GFAP is present in many types of nerve cells and is released when there is damage in the nervous system. The team found that GFAP levels correlated with measures of disability progression and disease activity on MRI scans, but not with relapses. GFAP levels decreased with treatment during the trial. With further study, this marker may help to predict MS progression.     Daniela Pimentel Maldonado, MD (University of Massachusetts) surveyed 2246 people with MS about mental health care, including 143 African Americans and 125 Hispanic Latinos. More than 80% of respondents believed that emotional problems were common and worsened their MS symptoms. Significantly more African Americans and Hispanic Latinos said they would seek mental health care if it was in the same location as their MS care. Significantly more African Americans expressed that they would prefer, trust, and feel better understood by a mental healthcare provider of the same race/ethnicity. are common in MS, and this study provides important information on how mental health care might be better accessed by all people with MS.     Browse all from the meeting here.   Multiple sclerosis is an unpredictable, often disabling . range from numbness and tingling to blindness and paralysis, and there is currently no cure for MS.

In both studies, ozanimod significantly reduced the relapse rate compared with Avonex (interferon beta-1a, Biogen), and also reduced MRI-detected disease activity and brain atrophy. Ozanimod appeared to be well-tolerated during the studies. Both phase III studies were the bases of an application submitted to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for approval of ozanimod to treat relapsing MS. This application was accepted in June 2019. Giancarlo Comi, MD (San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan) and colleagues worldwide published SUNBEAM results in the Lancet Neurology (). Jeffrey Cohen, MD (Cleveland Clinic) and colleagues worldwide published RADIANCE results in the Lancet Neurology ()   DETAILS Ozanimod is a selective sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor modulator. It is thought to act by promoting the retention of certain white blood cells in the body’s lymph nodes, keeping them out of circulation and from entering the brain and spinal cord. Similar therapies are approved by the FDA to treat MS: Gilenya fingolimod, Novartis International AG) and Mayzent (siponimod, Novartis International AG). In an earlier phase II trial, in 258 participants with relapsing MS, disease activity on MRI scans was reduced in people taking two different doses of ozanimod, compared to people taking placebo. (   For this phase III trial, 1,346 participants were randomly assigned to one of three treatment groups, taking either daily oral ozanimod (0.5 mg) and an inactive placebo injected into muscle once weekly; daily oral ozanimod (1 mg) and inactive placebo injected into muscle once weekly; or Avonex and an oral placebo daily for 12 months. The primary outcome was relapse rate, measured at 12 months. Secondary outcomes included disease activity as observed on MRI scans, and measures of brain tissue volume.   The study met the primary endpoint in reducing relapse rates, as well as the secondary MRI endpoints. Both doses of ozanimod significantly reduced the loss of brain tissue volume more than Avonex. No cardiac-related side effects were observed during dose escalation in participants treated with ozanimod. No serious infections occurred in the ozanimod group. Increases in liver enzymes occurred across all groups, and resulted in two participants discontinuing ozanimod. Other safety findings are detailed in the open-access papers.   For the second phase III trial, 1,313 participants were randomly assigned to one of three treatment groups, taking either daily oral ozanimod (0.5 mg) and an inactive placebo injected into muscle once weekly; daily oral ozanimod (1 mg) and inactive placebo injected into muscle once weekly; or Avonex and an oral placebo daily for 24 months.   The study met the primary endpoint in reducing the relapse rate over two years, as well as the secondary MRI measures of disease activity. Both doses of ozanimod significantly reduced the loss of brain tissue volume more than Avonex. Four participants experienced a transient reduced heart rate. No serious infections occurred. Other safety findings are detailed in the open-access papers.   In a pooled analysis of both phase III studies, ozanimod was not shown to slow disability progression significantly more than Avonex.   Giancarlo Comi, MD (San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan) and colleagues worldwide published SUNBEAM results in the Lancet Neurology (). Jeffrey Cohen, MD (Cleveland Clinic) and colleagues worldwide published RADIANCE results in the Lancet Neurology ()   Both phase III studies suggest that ozanimod can reduce MS disease activity, and the results were the bases of an application submitted to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for approval of ozanimod to treat relapsing MS. This application was accepted in June 2019.   In an accompanying editorial, Ellen Mowry, MD (Johns Hopkins) and John Corboy, MD (University of Colorado) comment that more real-world data are necessary to determine the safety and effectiveness of ozanimod in a broader range of people with MS, including people in whom risks may be greater because of advanced age or disability. However, they say, the results of these studies “provide reassurance about the clinical efficacy and safety outcomes” of this class of medication.     Avonex is a registered trademark of Biogen Gilenya is a registered trademark of Novartis Mayzent is a registered trademark of Novartis Multiple sclerosis is an unpredictable, often disabling . range from numbness and tingling to blindness and paralysis, and there is currently no cure for MS.

Jeffrey Cohen, MD (Cleveland Clinic) and colleagues worldwide published RADIANCE results in the Lancet Neurology ()   DETAILS Ozanimod is a selective sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor modulator. It is thought to act by promoting the retention of certain white blood cells in the body’s lymph nodes, keeping them out of circulation and from entering the brain and spinal cord. Similar therapies are approved by the FDA to treat MS: Gilenya fingolimod, Novartis International AG) and Mayzent (siponimod, Novartis International AG). In an earlier phase II trial, in 258 participants with relapsing MS, disease activity on MRI scans was reduced in people taking two different doses of ozanimod, compared to people taking placebo. (   For this phase III trial, 1,346 participants were randomly assigned to one of three treatment groups, taking either daily oral ozanimod (0.5 mg) and an inactive placebo injected into muscle once weekly; daily oral ozanimod (1 mg) and inactive placebo injected into muscle once weekly; or Avonex and an oral placebo daily for 12 months. The primary outcome was relapse rate, measured at 12 months. Secondary outcomes included disease activity as observed on MRI scans, and measures of brain tissue volume.   The study met the primary endpoint in reducing relapse rates, as well as the secondary MRI endpoints. Both doses of ozanimod significantly reduced the loss of brain tissue volume more than Avonex. No cardiac-related side effects were observed during dose escalation in participants treated with ozanimod. No serious infections occurred in the ozanimod group. Increases in liver enzymes occurred across all groups, and resulted in two participants discontinuing ozanimod. Other safety findings are detailed in the open-access papers.   For the second phase III trial, 1,313 participants were randomly assigned to one of three treatment groups, taking either daily oral ozanimod (0.5 mg) and an inactive placebo injected into muscle once weekly; daily oral ozanimod (1 mg) and inactive placebo injected into muscle once weekly; or Avonex and an oral placebo daily for 24 months.   The study met the primary endpoint in reducing the relapse rate over two years, as well as the secondary MRI measures of disease activity. Both doses of ozanimod significantly reduced the loss of brain tissue volume more than Avonex. Four participants experienced a transient reduced heart rate. No serious infections occurred. Other safety findings are detailed in the open-access papers.   In a pooled analysis of both phase III studies, ozanimod was not shown to slow disability progression significantly more than Avonex.   Giancarlo Comi, MD (San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan) and colleagues worldwide published SUNBEAM results in the Lancet Neurology (). Jeffrey Cohen, MD (Cleveland Clinic) and colleagues worldwide published RADIANCE results in the Lancet Neurology ()   Both phase III studies suggest that ozanimod can reduce MS disease activity, and the results were the bases of an application submitted to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for approval of ozanimod to treat relapsing MS. This application was accepted in June 2019.   In an accompanying editorial, Ellen Mowry, MD (Johns Hopkins) and John Corboy, MD (University of Colorado) comment that more real-world data are necessary to determine the safety and effectiveness of ozanimod in a broader range of people with MS, including people in whom risks may be greater because of advanced age or disability. However, they say, the results of these studies “provide reassurance about the clinical efficacy and safety outcomes” of this class of medication.     Avonex is a registered trademark of Biogen Gilenya is a registered trademark of Novartis Mayzent is a registered trademark of Novartis Multiple sclerosis is an unpredictable, often disabling . range from numbness and tingling to blindness and paralysis, and there is currently no cure for MS.

d359081e-c45f-455e-ac2a-bfceab3db4b5,"Reviewed by MSAA Chief Medical Officer While we all know “MS” stands for “multiple sclerosis,” with so much exciting research reported in this edition of “What’s New in MS Research,” we can almost imagine that “MS” could also refer to the quest for “multiple solutions” in MS. Although a great deal of the research looks to further understand the biology, easing the symptoms, and slowing or stopping the physical damage of MS, the studies and other information presented here are very encouraging – and they are only a small sample of the vast array of research under way around the world. Most of the clinical trials and other studies featured in this issue of “What’s New in MS Research” are drawn from virtual presentations given at the September 2020 joint meeting of the Americas Committee for Treatment and Research in Multiple Sclerosis (ACTRIMS) and the European Committee for Treatment and Research in Multiple Sclerosis (ECTRIMS). That meeting, held virtually this year due to the COVID-19 pandemic, was a forum for laboratory scientists and clinical investigators to share their findings from literally thousands of research efforts. As reflected in the reports that follow, those inquiries touch upon everything from enhancing the diagnosis of MS and better understanding its course, to evaluating the effectiveness and safety of approved disease-modifying therapies, investigational agents, and other types of interventions. Impact of Vumerity on brain-volume change: Encouraging interim findings People with relapsing MS who took the oral disease-modifying therapy Vumerity (diroximel fumarate) for up to two years had changes (reductions) in brain volume that approach those seen in people who do not have MS. That’s the encouraging finding from interim results of a study examining the long-term impact of the medication, which the FDA approved in October 2019. The study, EVOLVE-MS-1, is an ongoing, open-label Phase 3 investigation. Analysis of data on 365 patients who had taken Vumerity for a median of 96 weeks showed that their average percent of brain volume change (PBVC) was -0.36 from baseline to Week 48 and -0.35 from Week 48 to Week 96. Meanwhile, the estimated proportion of patients who were free of confirmed disability progression was 94.3% at Week 48 and 90.7% at Week 96. The proportions of patients with no evidence of disease activity at Week 48 and Week 96 were 44.7% and 25.2%, respectively. The study’s authors noted, “Interim findings from the ongoing EVOLVE-MS-1 study demonstrate that yearly PBVC in [Vumerity]-treated patients approached the rate observed in healthy adults.” Newly approved DMT shows efficacy in newly diagnosed, treatment-naïve patients In August, Kesimpta (ofatumumab) became the first self-administered targeted B-cell therapy approved by the FDA to treat relapsing forms of MS. A recent analysis of data from the Phase III ASCLEPIOS I/II trials that led to that approval provide insights into the efficacy and risk profile of the anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody in newly diagnosed patients who had not received any prior disease-modifying therapy (DMT) for their MS. The analysis involved 615 patients with a median age of 36 years who typically had been diagnosed within a year of starting either Kesimpta, or the comparison agent Aubagio (teriflunomide), in the Phase III trials. Compared to Aubagio, the study found that Kesimpta reduced the annual relapse rate (ARR) by 50.3%. It also reduced six-month confirmed disability worsening by 46%, and the number of new or enlarging T2 lesions seen on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in a year by 82.0%. The study’s authors noted that these findings in newly diagnosed patients who had not received prior DMTs were consistent with results for the overall study population. Assessing the long-term impact of Mayzent in secondary-progressive MS Mayzent (siponimod) is an oral DMT approved by the FDA in March 2019 as a treatment for both relapsing and active secondary-progressive MS (aSPMS). In the EXPAND trial that led to its approval, the medication reduced worsening of both clinical disability and cognition at the six-month mark in people with aSPMS. New data show that those benefits may continue for up to five years. An analysis assessed long-term outcomes in 582 people with aSPMS, comparing those who had received Mayzent throughout the EXPAND trial and its open-label extension (Continuous Group), with those who had been on placebo during the main trial and then switched to Mayzent during the extension (Switch Group). Median time to confirmed disability progression over any six-month period was 48 months for the Switch Group, but was not reached for the Continuous Group. Similarly, the risk of confirmed cognitive worsening over any six-month period was reduced by 33% in the Continuous Group vs. the Switch Group, a statistically significant difference. The annual relapse rate (ARR) was also significantly reduced in the Continuous Group relative to the Switch Group. The study’s authors concluded, “Long-term data analyses in the Continuous versus Switch groups showed that siponimod treatment effects on disability, cognitive processing speed, and relapse outcomes in patients with active SPMS are sustained for up to 5 years, and highlight the value of early treatment initiation.” Arnold D, et al.

Evaluating the impact of ponesimod on brain volume and other measures Ponesimod is an oral medication in late stages of investigation for treatment of relapsing forms of MS. It belongs to a class of medications called sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 1 modulators. The class also includes FDA-approved disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) such as Gilenya (fingolimod) and Mayzent (siponimod). The Phase III OPTIMUM study evaluated the efficacy and safety of ponesimod relative to the approved DMT Aubagio (teriflunomide) over two years of treatment. The study included 985 patients. Analysis of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings and other data from the trial showed that patients in the ponesimod group had less change in brain volume than those taking Aubagio and fewer new or enlarging T2 lesions seen on MRI per year. Further, at week 108 of treatment, 28.2% of patients receiving ponesimod had no evidence of disease activity as assessed by three measures (NEDA-3), compared to 18.3% of people taking Aubagio. Evobrutinib shows two-year reduction in relapse rate Evobrutinib is an investigational medication that belongs to a class of medications known as Bruton’s tyrosine kinase inhibitors, or BTKIs. Its developers note that it has a dual mode of action, targeting B cells and myeloid cells, both of which play a role in autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS). In a recent Phase II trial involving people with relapsing MS, evobrutinib significantly reduced T1 gadolinium-enhancing lesions on MRI compared to placebo at Week 24, and showed continued efficacy through Week 48. Patients who participated in that trial were eligible to join an open-label extension study that tracked clinical relapse rates and other measures. The extension included both people who had received various doses of evobrutinib in the Phase II trial and those who had received placebo. All participants in the extension study received evobrutinib. Among 148 patients who completed 108 weeks of treatment, those who had been on the highest dose of evobrutinib in the main trial had an annualized relapse rate of 0.12, which was roughly one-third that of the 0.31 rate for patients who received placebo in the main trial before switching to evobrutinib in the open-label period. Similarly, the estimated time to relapse in the higher-dose evobrutinib patients was almost three times longer than that of patients who started on placebo. For all of the remarkable progress that has been made in expanding treatment options for MS, there also are periodic reminders that drug development is a difficult and complex process that offers no guarantees of success. One such reminder came a few weeks ago, when Biogen noted in its third-quarter report that it will discontinue development of its investigational agent opicinumab. The medication, which is also known as anti-LINGO-1 and BIIB033, is an antibody that was thought to promote repair of the myelin sheath that protects nerves. Damage to that sheath is the hallmark of MS. The agent has been studied in a number of Phase II studies, including RENEW, SYNERGY, and the AFFINITY trial, which was scheduled to run until 2022. Unfortunately, the latter trial did not meet primary or secondary endpoints, so development of opicinumab was discontinued. Kappos L, et al.

Two of those studies are summarized below. Neurofilament light, or NfL, is a protein found in axons, the component of neurons that facilitates transmission of electrical impulses. When neurons are damaged, as occurs in MS and other diseases, the protein is released, eventually reaching the blood, or serum. Researchers seeking biomarkers that can help correctly identify MS and provide clues to its future course have focused in recent years on the sNfL chain, with generally encouraging results. In a multi-center, prospective study, investigators looked for an association between sNfL levels and the diagnosis of MS, MRI parameters, and treatment decisions. The study, which involved 814 patients, found that: Patients with clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) had lower sNfL levels than those with MS, a finding that may help clinicians distinguish between the two conditions. sNfL levels correlated with the number of clinical relapses a person experienced and the number of gadolinium-enhancing lesions seen on MRI. Patients who received disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) in the first two years after diagnosis had higher baseline sNfL levels than patients who did not receive a DMT, suggesting that they may have presented with more pronounced symptoms. Further, sNfL levels measured over four years reflected treatment decisions, supporting the idea that those levels are a marker of disease status. The study’s authors concluded that evaluating sNfL levels may both enhance diagnosis and help guide decisions about initial treatment. A second study found that sNfL levels obtained in the early stages of MS can predict how patients are likely to fare as much as 15 years later. Drawing on long-term data from the BENEFIT study examining use of interferon beta-1b in people with MS, researchers found that patients with baseline sNfL values above the 90th percentile were almost 2.5 times more likely than people with lower sNfL concentrations to have an Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score of 4 or greater 15 years later. An EDSS score of 4 indicates that although fully ambulatory and self-sufficient, an individual is experiencing significant disability. One less headache for people with MS who also suffer from migraines It could be intuitive to think – or at least to worry – that a history of migraines would not bode well for the course of MS, but researchers have found that this isn’t necessarily the case. Those investigators analyzed data on 2,017 people with MS, including 336 people who had reported experiencing migraines. The people who reported migraines tended to be younger than the other patients, and were more likely to also have a history of anxiety, depression, and obstructive sleep apnea. However, they were less likely than the other study subjects to have severe disability (5.4% of those with migraine vs. 12.0% of those without, a statistically significant difference), and did not show differences in walking speed, manual dexterity, cognitive processing speed, relapse rates, or rate of new brain-lesion development. While the investigators cautioned that the evidence gathered to date on migraine and MS is conflicting, and that further studies are needed, their findings nonetheless offer reassurance to people who may have feared that migraine headaches would somehow contribute to or be associated with a more-difficult MS course. Different types of MS impact quality of life similarly Depression, pain, and walking difficulty are the symptoms that have the greatest impact on quality of life for people with MS, regardless of which form of the condition they have. This is the main finding to emerge from a study examining how 13 different MS symptoms affected health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in 1,985 people with MS. Although the study subjects were stratified by MS phenotype, such as relapsing-remitting MS, secondary-progressive MS, and primary-progressive MS, the investigators found that depression, pain, and problems with walking were the main contributors to a reduced quality of life across and among the different subgroups. “Reducing these symptoms may have the largest impact on improving HRQoL in all MS phenotypes of people with MS,” they said.

An MS trial focused exclusively on minority patients In keeping with efforts to address long-standing inequities in society as a whole and within the healthcare system, a new trial will evaluate the efficacy and safety of the disease-modifying therapy Ocrevus (ocrelizumab) in people with relapsing forms of MS who are of African ancestry or Hispanic and Latino ethnicity. In previewing the trial, researchers noted that minority patients with MS tend to have greater disease severity and faster progression than Caucasians, but are significantly under-represented in clinical trials, “owing to poor access and cultural, economic and other participation barriers.” They added that while large-scale clinical trials of Ocrevus showed that the B cell-targeting anti-CD20 therapy reduced rates of disease activity and progression in both relapsing MS and primary-progressive MS, minority participation in those studies was less than 10%. By contrast, the researchers said, the single-arm Phase IV study, called CHIMES, is an industry-sponsored collaborative approach designed to meet the needs of patients of African or Hispanic ancestry. The study’s primary endpoint will be disease activity, defined by the proportion of patients free of protocol-defined events such as relapses, at one year. Study subjects will be eligible to participate in a second-year extension that will assess disease progression and biomarker endpoints. One-third of the patients will take part in a sub-study evaluating cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers. The researchers noted, “Findings from CHIMES are expected to improve current understanding of MS disease biology, treatment response and clinical trial participation among [African ancestry and Hispanic ancestry] patients with MS, with the ultimate goals of increasing high-quality standard of care to traditionally underserved populations and enhancing equality through clinical research.” Examining MS relapse rates during – and after – pregnancy A new study has bolstered prior findings that MS relapses tend to decrease during pregnancy and then increase again in the early postpartum period. The analysis assessed information on 119 women who became pregnant while they were patients at the University of California San Francisco Multiple Sclerosis Center during the period 2005 to 2018. For the 146 live-birth pregnancies that the study subjects had, the pre-pregnancy annual relapse rate (ARR) was 0.33. That rate decreased during pregnancy to 0.10 but then increased to 0.61 by three months after delivery. (Both changes were statistically significant.) Another key finding: Women who exclusively breastfed their babies for at least three months after delivery had a significantly reduced likelihood of having a relapse. Identifying indicators of long-term disability in children with MS Children and adolescents who have optic nerve, brainstem, or spinal cord lesions when they are diagnosed with MS are at greater risk for long-term disability than other pediatric MS patients. That was one of the major findings to emerge from a study of 123 young people followed for an average of nine years after diagnosis. Researchers found that optic nerve involvement at baseline predicted a shorter time to first relapse and 10-year disability worsening. Brainstem lesions at baseline also were predictive of 10-year disability worsening, as well as of a higher 10-year Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score. The number of cervical spinal cord lesions at diagnosis also helped identify patients likely to have higher EDSS scores 10 years after diagnosis. Several other clinical and imaging features seen in the first three years after diagnosis, including number of relapses in the first year and detection of at least two lesions seen on MRI within two years, also provided reliable information on long-term disease course. The study’s investigators noted, “Accurate clinical and MRI monitoring during the first two years of disease has proven to represent a powerful tool for counseling [pediatric] patients about long-term prognosis and personalizing treatment strategies.” Williams M, et al.

Comparing stem cell transplantation with disease-modifying therapies Encouraging results from small- and medium-sized studies have generated considerable interest in treating multiple sclerosis with stem cell therapy, but important questions remain about the long-term outcomes of the treatment strategy, as well as about how it compares with current disease-modifying therapies (DMTs). The StarMS study will examine that last issue: the safety and efficacy of stem cell transplantation relative to DMTs. Funded by the British government, the study will involve 198 people with relapsing-remitting MS. One half of the study participants will receive stem cells that have been taken from their body, treated, and then re-infused after the patient undergoes immunosuppression. This approach is designed to “reboot” the immune system. The other half of the participants will receive one of two DMTs, Ocrevus (ocrelizumab) or Lemtrada (alemtuzumab). The primary endpoint of the study will be the rate of patients achieving no evidence of disease activity (NEDA), based on clinical and imaging assessments, over a two-year follow-up period. Allowing time for full patient enrollment, results are expected in about four years. Study investigators note, “The StarMS trial has the potential to provide definitive data on the comparative efficacy of aHSCT [autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation] versus highly efficacious DMTs, help improve patient outcomes, and impact national and international guidelines.” Might administering microscopic crystals to people with MS prove to be the gold standard – literally – for repairing the nerve-sheath damage that drives MS? Clene Nanomedicine, a biopharmaceutical company based in Salt Lake City, Utah, is pursuing the answer to that question as it develops CNM-Au8, a concentrated, aqueous suspension of clean-surfaced faceted gold nanocrystals that act catalytically to support intracellular biological reactions. The agent is being investigated as a potential treatment not only for MS, but also for Parkinson’s disease (PD) and potentially other neurological conditions. Studies in animals indicate that CNM-Au8 has both remyelination and neuroprotective effects, the Company notes. Clene Nanotechnologies adds that Phase I studies in healthy human volunteers have demonstrated the safety of CNM-Au8. As a next step in the research process, the Company organized the REPAIR-MS and REPAIR-PD studies. The Phase II, single-center, open-label, imaging studies are examining the brain metabolic effects, safety, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of CNM-Au8 in patients who have been diagnosed with MS in the past 15 years (REPAIR-MS) or who have been diagnosed with PD in the past three years (REPAIR-PD). Study participants take either a 15 or 30 mg orally delivered dose of the nanocrystal suspension each morning. Study participants undergo sophisticated brain imaging scanning to assess key bioenergetic brain metabolites at baseline, prior to administration of CNM-Au8, and at the end of the study. The objective is to show that CNM-Au8 engages with targeted central nervous system biomarkers related to bioenergetics and neuronal metabolism in people with MS and PD. The study is taking place at University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center. Survey finds that one in five people with MS are using cannabis for symptom relief Roughly one-third of people with MS have looked to cannabis at least once for relief of spasticity or pain, or to help with sleep, and 20% currently are taking cannabis to ease MS symptoms. Those were the main findings of a recent online survey conducted by the North American Research Committee on Multiple Sclerosis, or NARCOMS, a voluntary self-report registry for people with MS. NARCOMS researchers invited 6,934 registry participants to complete the survey. Forty-seven percent – or 3,249 people – responded. The participants had an average age of 61.2 years and a mean age at MS symptom onset of 31.2 years. Current users were more likely than past users to be male, and also were likely to be somewhat younger. More than 60% of the respondents reported moderate to severe spasticity, pain, and sleep problems. Phase III study examines cannabinoid agent for MS spasticity Americans who look to cannabis-based agents for relief of MS symptoms may have a new treatment option – one already offered in more than two dozen other countries – available to them in the years just ahead. GW Pharmaceuticals and its United States subsidiary, Greenwich Biosciences, on November 3, 2019 announced the initiation of the first United States Phase III clinical trial studying nabiximols for MS-associated spasticity. Nabiximols, which are known as Sativex outside of the United States, are approved for treatment of MS spasticity in more than 25 countries. GW Pharmaceuticals, which focuses on the development and commercialization of cannabinoid prescription medicines, said that nabiximols is a complex botanical medicine formulated from extracts of the cannabis plant. It is administered as an oral spray. The company noted that three European Phase III clinical studies showed that nabiximols was well-tolerated and provided continued reductions in patient-reported spasticity in people with MS. The new Phase III trial is one of five pivotal studies planned for nabiximols in MS spasticity, with the remaining studies on track to begin later this year or in 2021. The company said that it expects that a positive result in any one of the five studies will enable submission of an application for Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of the agent, potentially as early as mid-2021. The Phase III, double-blind, parallel, placebo-controlled study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of nabiximols for spasm frequency over a 12-week period. It is expected to enroll 446 participants. Evaluating the long-term impact of therapeutic plasma exchange Therapeutic plasma exchange – the removal and replacement of the plasma component of a person’s blood through the use of a special machine – is an option sometimes employed when high-dose steroid therapy isn’t effective in treating an MS relapse. A recent study examined the impact of the treatment strategy over 12, 18, and 24 months, and sought to identify whether certain patient characteristics or disease features were associated with a better response to therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE). Researchers analyzed data on 24 people with relapsing-remitting MS who received steroids followed by TPE and 43 patients who received steroids only. Patients in the two groups were matched for age, sex, disease duration, and disability level at the time of the relapse. Good response to treatment was defined as a reduction of at least 50% in one’s Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score. Initial EDSS scores in the two groups were similar. While two-thirds of the people receiving TPE initially had a good response to the treatment, the researchers found no significant differences between their EDSS scores and those of the steroid-only patients at 12, 18, or 24 months of follow-up. Further, preliminary analysis did not identify any patient characteristics or disease features associated with a favorable response to TPE. Although the study did not identify an added long-term benefit from following high-dose steroids with TPE, the fact that most TPE recipients had a good initial response to the therapy is encouraging news, especially considering that up to one-quarter of people experiencing a relapse do not obtain sufficient improvement from steroids alone. Can taking aspirin as a warm-up help avoid overheating during exercise? In addition to the time pressures and other deterrents to regular exercise that all people face, many people with MS also have to cope with the exertion-induced overheating that is a frequent feature of multiple sclerosis. A new study is examining whether taking aspirin before working out can help remove that MS-specific obstacle to maintaining an exercise routine. ASPIRE is a large-scale, double-blind randomized controlled trial that will compare the effects of aspirin with those of acetaminophen (generic version of the brand name Tylenol) and placebo in 60 people with MS. Each study participant will engage in three maximal exercise tests, with the evaluations scheduled at one-week intervals. A study subject will take 650 mg of aspirin before one test, a standard dose of acetaminophen before another session, and placebo prior to the third session. The study’s two main endpoints are time to exhaustion and change in body temperature from the pre-exercise period to the immediate post-exercise period. Study organizers note that a pilot trial showed that aspirin pre-treatment increased exercise time and reduced the post-exercise increase in body temperature by 56% in people with MS who experience overheating on exertion.

b9dd3795-9d5d-417e-9620-e0714e56c276,"How I Learned to Embrace My Mobility Aid for My Advanced MS — Multiple sclerosis (MS) can be a very isolating disease. Losing the ability to walk has the potential to make those of us living with MS feel even more isolated. I know from personal experience that it’s incredibly difficult to accept when you need to start using a mobility aid like a cane, walker, or wheelchair. But I quickly learned that using these devices is better than the alternatives, like falling down and injuring yourself or feeling left out and losing personal connections. Here’s why it’s important to stop thinking of mobility devices as signs of a disability, and instead start seeing and using them as keys to your independence. Facing your fears of canes, walkers, and wheelchairs To be honest, I admit that I was often the person who scared me the most when I was diagnosed with MS more than 22 years ago. My biggest fear was that one day I would become that “woman in the wheelchair.” And yes, this is who I am now about 2 decades later. It took me some time to accept that this is where my disease was taking me. I mean, come on! I was only 23 years old when my neurologist uttered the phrase that I feared the most: “You have MS.” It couldn’t be bad, though, right? I had just graduated with my bachelor’s degree from the University of Michigan-Flint and was starting my first “big girl” job in Detroit. I was young, driven, and full of ambition. MS wasn’t going to stand in my way. But within 5 years of my diagnosis, I was barely able to even attempt to stand in the way of MS and its effects on me. I had stopped working and moved back in with my parents because my disease was quickly overpowering me. I first started using a cane about a year after my diagnosis. My legs were wobbly and made me feel unsteady, but it was just a cane. No big deal, right? I didn’t always need it, so the decision to use it didn’t really faze me. I guess the same could be said about moving from a cane to a quad cane to a walker. These mobility devices were my response to a relentless disease that kept ambushing my myelin. I kept thinking, “I will keep walking. I will continue to get together with my friends for dinners and parties.” I was still young and full of ambition. But all of my life’s ambitions were no match for the dangerous and painful falls I continued to have despite my assistive devices. I couldn’t continue to live my life in fear of the next time I’d collapse to the floor, wondering what this disease would do to me next. My disease had drained my once boundless bravery. I was scared, beat down, and tired. My last resort was a motorized scooter or wheelchair. I needed a motorized one because my MS had weakened the strength in my arms. How did my life get to this point? I had just graduated from college 5 years before this moment. If I wanted to retain any sense of safety and independence, I knew I needed to buy a motorized scooter. This was a painful decision to make as a 27-year-old. I felt embarrassed and defeated, like I was surrendering to the disease. I slowly accepted my new reality and purchased my first scooter. I still struggle with the reality that MS took away my ability to walk. Once my disease advanced to secondary progressive MS, I had to upgrade to a power wheelchair. But I take pride in how I’ve embraced my wheelchair as the key to live my best life. I didn’t let fear get the best of me. Without my wheelchair, I never would have had the independence to live in my own home, earn my graduate degree, travel throughout the United States, and marry Dan, the man of my dreams. Dan has relapsing-remitting MS, and we met at an MS event in September 2002. We fell in love, got married in 2005, and have been living happily ever after. Dan has never known me to walk and wasn’t scared off by my wheelchair. Here’s something we’ve talked about that’s important to remember: I don’t see Dan’s glasses. They’re just what he needs to wear to see better and live a quality life. Likewise, he sees me, not my wheelchair. It’s just what I need to move around better and live a quality life in spite of this disease. Of the challenges that people with MS face, deciding whether it’s time to use an assistive mobility device is one of the most difficult. It wouldn’t be like this if we shifted how we see things like canes, walkers, and wheelchairs. This starts with focusing on what they allow you to do to live a more engaging life. My advice from someone who has had to use a wheelchair for the past 15 years: Name your mobility device! My wheelchairs are named Silver and Grape Ape. This gives you a sense of ownership, and it can help you treat it more like your friend and not your enemy. Lastly, try to remember that using a mobility device may not be permanent. There’s always hope that all of us will one day walk again as we did before our MS diagnosis. Dan and Jennifer Digmann are active in the MS community as public speakers, writers, and advocates.

45e2a7c3-40e3-45c5-b12f-e198e53b9f64,"by Michele R. Berman, MD, and Mark S. Boguski, MD, PhD Actor David Lander, known for his role as Andrew ""Squiggy"" Squiggman on the sitcom ""Laverne & Shirley,"" died at the age of 73 at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, from complications of multiple sclerosis. In a to , ""David's family hopes his fans will remember him for all the laughter he brought into the world."" Lander was originally diagnosed with multiple sclerosis in 1984, a year after ""Laverne & Shirley"" ended its 8-year run. He began to experience dizziness and numbness in his hands and feet. A spinal tap revealed his diagnosis, but he kept it a secret to all but his family, as he thought it would end his career in Hollywood. In 1999, he publicly revealed his diagnosis in a memoir entitled, ""Fall Down Laughing: How Squiggy Caught Multiple Sclerosis and Didn't Tell Nobody."" In 2000, the National MS Society named Lander one of their National Ambassadors. He toured the country and became an advocate for patients with MS, speaking at conventions and fundraisers. He particularly wanted to educate patients about early intervention for those newly diagnosed. In a 2007 with , Lander explained how much the outlook on MS changed since he was diagnosed: ""When I was first diagnosed with multiple sclerosis, there was nothing you could do about it. Doctors would say, 'diagnose and adios.' Now, there are many treatments available to control this progressive disease."" His doctor originally painted a bleak picture, saying he wasn't sure that Lander would ever walk again. After trials of corticosteroid and interferon-beta-1a, Lander was able to live a very full life. In addition to his MS advocacy work, he was a scout for baseball's Seattle Mariners, did voice-over work for a number of television shows and video games, and wrote reviews of handicap-accessible areas in ballparks. We first wrote about multiple sclerosis for in December 2010. The , which included Lander, also pointed out a number of public figures (including Michelle Obama's father) who were diagnosed with the disease. Quite a bit has changed in the treatment of MS since that time. MS is a neuroinflammatory disease that affects myelin, nerve cell bodies, and the axons in the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve. The term multiple sclerosis refers to the distinctive areas of scar tissue (sclerosis or plaques) that are visible in the white matter of people who have MS. MS is the most common disabling neurological disease of young adults with symptom onset generally occurring between the ages of 20 to 40 years. In MS, the immune system cells that normally protect us from viruses, bacteria, and unhealthy cells mistakenly attack the protective myelin sheath of nerves in the central nervous system. According to the , MS is thought to affect more than 1 million people in the U.S. As with most autoimmune disorders, twice as many women as men are affected by MS. In addition, MS is more common in colder climates: the further from the equator, the higher the risk. The symptoms of MS usually begin over one to several days, but in some forms, they may develop more slowly. They may be mild or severe and may go away quickly or last for months. Sometimes the initial symptoms of MS are overlooked because they disappear in a day or so and normal function returns. Most people with MS have a relapsing-remitting form of the disease, in contrast to a more slowly developing form called primary progressive MS. Progressive MS can also be a second stage of the illness that follows years of relapsing-remitting symptoms (called secondary progressive MS). Relapsing-remitting MS accounts for approximately 85%-90% of cases at onset. Secondary progressive MS usually occurs 10-20 years after the onset of the disease. Primary progressive MS is characterized by progressive disability from the onset of the disease with occasional plateaus or temporary minor improvements. The mean age of onset is 40. A diagnosis of MS is often delayed because MS shares symptoms with other neurological conditions and diseases. Vision problems such as blurred or double vision, or optic neuritis, which causes pain with eye movement and a rapid loss of vision Muscle weakness, often in the hands and legs, and muscle stiffness accompanied by painful muscle spasms. It may be severe enough to affect walking or standing Tingling, numbness, or pain in the arms, legs, trunk, or face Clumsiness, particularly difficulty staying balanced when walking Mental or physical fatigue which accompanies the early symptoms during an attack Mood changes such as depression or difficulty with emotional expression or control Cognitive dysfunction -- problems concentrating, multitasking, thinking, learning, or difficulties with memory or judgment There is no cure for MS, but there are treatments that can reduce the number and severity of relapses and delay the long-term disability progression of the disease. Corticosteroids, such as intravenous methylprednisolone, are prescribed for courses of 3 to 5 days. Intravenous steroids quickly and potently suppress the immune system and reduce inflammation. They may be followed by tapered doses of oral corticosteroids. Clinical trials have shown that these drugs hasten recovery from MS attacks, but do not alter the long-term outcome of the disease. Plasma exchange (plasmapheresis) can treat severe flare-ups in people with relapsing forms of MS who do not have a good response to methylprednisolone. This treatment has not been shown to be effective for secondary progressive or chronic progressive MS. Current therapies approved by the FDA are designed to modulate or suppress the inflammatory reactions of the disease. They are most effective for relapsing-remitting MS at early stages of the disease. drugs (Rebif, Betaseron, others) are among the most common medications to treat MS. Interferons are signaling molecules that regulate immune cells. Potential side effects of these drugs include flu-like symptoms (which usually fade with continued therapy), depression, or elevation of liver enzymes. Some individuals will notice a decrease in the effectiveness of the drugs after 18 to 24 months of treatment. If flare-ups occur or symptoms worsen, doctors may switch treatment to alternative drugs. changes the balance of immune cells in the body, but how it works is not entirely clear. Side effects are usually mild and consist of local injection site reactions or swelling. is administered intravenously once a month. It works by preventing cells of the immune system from entering the brain and spinal cord. It is very effective but is associated with increased risk of a called progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML). Natalizumab is generally recommended only for individuals who have not responded well to or who are unable to tolerate other first-line therapies. is administered intravenously every six months and treats adults with relapsing or primary progressive forms of MS. It is the only FDA-approved disease-modifying therapy for primary progressive MS. The drug targets the circulating immune cells that produce antibodies, which also play a role in the formation of MS lesions. Side effects include infusion-related reactions and increased risk of infections. Ocrelizumab may increase the risk of cancer as well. is administered for 5 consecutive days followed by 3 days of infusions one year later. It targets proteins on the surface of immune cells. Because this drug increases the risk of autoimmune disorders, it is recommended for those who have had inadequate responses to two or more MS therapies. , which is administered intravenously four times a year, has been approved for especially severe forms of relapsing-remitting and secondary progressive MS. Side effects include the development of certain types of blood cancers in up to 1% of those with MS, as well as with heart damage. This drug should be considered as a last resort to treat people with a form of MS that leads to rapid loss of function and for whom other treatments did not work. is a once-daily medication that reduces the MS relapse rate in adults and children. It is the first FDA-approved drug to treat MS in adolescents and children as young as 10. The drug prevents lymphocytes from leaving the lymph nodes and entering the blood, brain, and spinal cord. Fingolimod may result in a slow heart rate and eye problems when first taken. Fingolimod can also increase the risk of infections, such as herpes virus infections, or in rare cases be associated with PML. is a twice-daily medication used to treat relapsing forms of MS. Its exact mechanism of action is not currently known. Side effects of dimethyl fumarate are flushing, diarrhea, nausea, and lowered white blood cell count. is a once-daily medication that reduces the rate of proliferation of activated immune cells. Teriflunomide's side effects can include nausea, diarrhea, liver damage, and hair loss. is administered as two courses of tablets about one year apart. Cladribine targets certain types of white blood cells that drive immune attacks in MS. The drug may increase the risk of developing cancer and should be considered for individuals who have not responded well to other MS treatments. is a twice-daily drug similar to dimethyl fumarate but with fewer gastrointestinal side effects. Scientists suspect these drugs, which have been approved to treat secondary progressive MS, reduce damage to the brain and spinal cord by making the immune response less inflammatory, although their exact mechanism of action is poorly understood. is taken orally and has a similar mechanism of action to fingolimod. Siponimod has been approved by the FDA to treat secondary progressive MS. Clinical trials have shown that cladribine, diroximel fumarate, and dimethyl fumarate decrease the number of relapses, delay the progress of physical disability, and slow the development of brain lesions.

Doctors at are experts at identifying the different types of multiple sclerosis, or MS, in children. This chronic disorder of the central nervous system leads to damage in the brain and spinal cord. It is considered to be an autoimmune disorder, meaning the body’s immune system mistakenly attacks healthy tissue. In MS, the immune system attacks the protective coating of nerves, called the myelin sheath, throughout the central nervous system. Scar tissue called sclerosis—or lesions—forms at the sites of the damaged myelin. This disrupts nerve impulses traveling to and from the brain and spinal cord. The resulting neurological symptoms vary from person to person, depending on the amount of damage to the myelin and the part of the central nervous system that is affected. Although MS most commonly occurs , it can also affect children and teens. Approximately 2 to 5 percent of people with MS begin to experience symptoms before age 18. Symptoms and Causes of Multiple Sclerosis in Children No one knows what causes MS, though experts believe that genetics and environmental factors play a role in its development. Whereas the genetic factors related to MS are very complex, the risk of a child being diagnosed with MS is somewhat increased if the child has several family members who have the disease. No two people with MS experience exactly the same symptoms. In addition, symptoms can change or fluctuate over time. Some people may have tremors, fatigue, and muscle tightness, also called spasticity. Others may have sudden vision loss or paralysis, which may be temporary or permanent. MS can also cause forgetfulness or difficulty concentrating, as well as problems with bladder and bowel function. The symptoms of MS in children are similar to those in adults, but younger children are more likely than adults to have difficulty with balance and coordination of movements. Some develop numbness, and others have itching or irregular sensations, such as a “pins and needles” feeling or burning pains in the arms and legs. Most of these symptoms are the direct result of damage to the myelin in the central nervous system, which is why doctors consider them to be the main symptoms of MS. Secondary symptoms can arise from neurological changes. Bladder dysfunction, for example, may cause an increase in urinary frequency. This can lead to a child needing frequent bathroom breaks. Another frequent symptom is fatigue, which can interfere with daily activities. The times when a child experiences new, abrupt MS symptoms are referred to as relapses, or flare-ups. These can be followed by a period when the child does not have symptoms, which is called remission. By tracking the course of the condition over time, doctors can determine which type of MS is affecting your child. The first time a child experiences neurological symptoms that last at least 24 hours and are determined to be caused by inflammation and damage to the myelin sheath, this episode, or “attack,” is known as a clinically isolated syndrome. These attacks are the same as those that occur with MS, but a diagnosis of MS is not made until there are at least two attacks. Some children may experience only one attack and not go on to develop MS. Depending on the results of testing, such as an MRI scan, our doctors can determine if your child is in the early stages of MS and likely to experience another attack. If symptoms recur, the condition is then referred to as relapsing-remitting MS. Children with relapsing–remitting MS have attacks that alternate with periods of remission. When symptoms appear, it’s described as a relapse. The child is considered to be in remission when symptoms subside, with or without treatment. Most children are diagnosed as having relapsing-remitting MS. Typically, symptoms develop over the course of days and then spontaneously improve over weeks or months. Relapses can occur at any time, even after years of remission. Children often experience more frequent relapses than adults who have early MS, but they usually enter remission more quickly. Heat, fever, infection, fatigue, and stress can increase the severity of symptoms. The severity of a child’s symptoms may change from day to day, and even from hour to hour. Each of these variations in symptom severity is not considered to be a relapse. A symptom must last for more than 24 hours to be considered a relapse. As they age into adulthood, children with relapsing-remitting MS may transition into secondary-progressive MS. This is when the disease begins to progress more steadily, without alternating periods of relapse and remission. Adults usually transition to secondary-progressive MS about 7 to 10 years after diagnosis. However, children with MS transition more slowly, entering this stage about 20 years after diagnosis. With the availability of MS therapies, this transition may be even further forestalled. Primary-progressive MS is when the condition’s neurological dysfunctions occur without relapses or remissions. Children are almost never diagnosed with this form of MS. If a child experiences the onset of progressive neurologic dysfunction without relapse, it might not be MS but another disorder.

8ae5757c-45d8-4f3f-a080-d480d9d358ad,"Reviewed by MSAA Chief Medical Officer Experimental and Approved Disease-Modifying Therapies This edition of MSAA’s “What’s New in MS Research” provides highlights from this year’s European Committee for Treatment and Research in Multiple Sclerosis (ECTRIMS) annual meeting. Experts from throughout the world gathered in Stockholm, Sweden in mid-September to share and discuss the latest research into the causes, diagnosis, course, and treatment of multiple sclerosis. Those investigators and clinicians were gathered for the 35th annual Congress of ECTRIMS, a key forum for presenting the findings that help advance evidence-based management of MS. This article focuses on more than a dozen studies with significance for people living with MS. The studies featured obviously constitute a very small sampling of the research unveiled in Stockholm. However, they provide a good sense of the depth, breadth, and innovation that mark the current state of research into multiple sclerosis. Experimental and Approved Disease-Modifying Therapies Ofatumumab: Favorable Phase III results set stage for seeking FDA approval Ofatumumab is a monoclonal antibody that people with relapsing-remitting MS could inject at home once a month. This experimental medication demonstrated positive Phase III study results, which were announced at the ECTRIMS 2019 meeting. Based on those results, the pharmaceutical company Novartis said it will file paperwork with the FDA by the end of this year seeking approval for use of ofatumumab in relapsing-remitting MS. The medication is already approved for the treatment of certain forms of leukemia under the brand name Arzerra. Two identically designed Phase III trials, ASCLEPIOS I and ASCEPLIOS II, compared ofatumumab to Aubagio (teriflunomide). More than 1,800 patients from 37 countries were enrolled in the trials. Those people were randomized on a 1:1 basis to receive either 20 mg of ofatumumab injected subcutaneously every four weeks, or daily, oral doses of 14 mg of Aubagio, for up to 30 months. The primary endpoint of both trials was impact on the annualized relapse rate, or ARR. In both studies, the ARR for patients receiving ofatumumab was less than half that of those receiving Aubagio. Ofatumumab also demonstrated greater suppression of gadolinium-enhancing T1 lesions on MRI – an indication of inflammatory activity – compared with Aubagio, and reduced the risk of three-month and six-month confirmed disability progression by roughly one-third relative to Aubagio. Meanwhile, safety data in the trial were comparable with that seen in earlier studies of the agent. Mayzent and delay in time to disability progression in secondary-progressive MS Mayzent (siponimod) helps patients with secondary-progressive multiple sclerosis (SPMS) delay the time until they need to use a wheelchair, according to a team of international researchers. In March 2019, the FDA approved Mayzent as the first oral drug to treat SPMS with active disease. The FDA’s approval was based on results of the Phase III EXPAND trial. Researchers drew on data from that trial to assess the impact that Mayzent had on people reaching an Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score of 7.0, which reflects an inability to walk beyond a few steps and the need for wheelchair use. Analysis of data on more than 1,100 study participants found that, compared to placebo, Mayzent lengthened the median time to reaching an EDSS score of 7 or greater by 4.3 years (12.0 years for placebo vs 16.3 years for Mayzent). The reduction in risk of need for a wheelchair was greatest in people with more significant disability. In more than 400 study participants with an EDSS score of 6.5 at the study’s start, Mayzent cut the risk of needing a wheelchair by 28% to 36%, depending on the type of analysis employed. Impact of extending Tysabri dosing interval on relapse rates Tysabri (natalizumab) has demonstrated its efficacy in treating relapsing-remitting MS, but the standard dosing schedule of a 300-mg infusion every four weeks is associated with increased risk for progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), a serious and potentially life-threatening disease. In an effort to continue providing people with MS with the benefits of Tysabri while reducing their risk for PML, researchers have explored whether extending the period between infusions can preserve the disease-modifying effects of the drug while diminishing the chances of developing PML. With earlier research showing that extended interval dosing (EID) lowers the risk of PML compared to standard interval dosing (SID), a large, long-term observational study presented at ECTRIMS 2019 examined the differences in effectiveness when extending the time between treatments. Investigators drew on data from the Tysabri Observational Program (TOP) to compare 135 pairs of patients. One patient in each pair had received Tysabri on the standard-interval schedule, while the other had extended-interval dosing. The researchers found no significant difference in annualized relapse rate (ARR) or risk of relapse between the two groups. They added that a randomized, prospective study comparing the two treatment approaches is needed to provide more-definitive evidence. What’s the risk of “rebound” disease activity after stopping Gilenya? People with MS may decide to stop a disease-modifying therapy (DMT) for any number of reasons, ranging from side effects or a perceived lack of effectiveness to a desire to switch to another agent or to be “treatment-free” for a period of time. The importance of consulting with a clinician before stopping treatment is underscored by the risk for rebound disease activity, or RDA, which can occur once a medication that is taken to control MS is discontinued. Investigators recently examined the records of 117 patients to determine the risk for RDA after stopping Gilenya, and to see if any factors made people more prone to experiencing “rebound.” The group included 86 women and 31 men. Nine of the 117 patients, or 7.7%, had RDA after stopping Gilenya, with the rebound activity marked by severe clinical relapses with exaggerated MRI lesions compared to their level of disease activity before starting the DMT. Compared to patients who did not experience RDA upon stopping treatment, those who did have rebound activity had a higher annualized relapse rate (ARR) before initiating Gilenya, and also had a shorter interval between their last relapse and their first dose of the medication. The duration of Gilenya treatment did not appear to affect the likelihood of rebound. The researchers added that eight of the nine people experiencing RDA had stopped treatment abruptly. In an observation that again reinforces the importance of working closely with a clinician when considering any change to treatment approach, the investigators concluded, “Our results indicate that [a] fingolimod every-other-day cessation strategy may help to prevent RDA.” Patients at the Cleveland Clinic’s Mellen Center for Multiple Sclerosis had lower rates of adverse events (AEs) with Ocrevus (ocrelizumab) than did patients in the Phase III clinical trials that led to the disease-modifying therapy’s approval in March 2017, according to Mellen Center researchers. In the Mellen Center cohort, 3.3% had a serious adverse event, while 21% had an infection – typically a urinary tract infection or upper respiratory infection – and 18% had an infusion-related reaction. By contrast, in the OPERA I and OPERA II trials of Ocrevus in RRMS, 6.9% and 7.0%, respectively, of patients receiving Ocrevus had a serious adverse event, 56.9% and 60.2% had an infection, and 30.9% and 37.6% had at least one infusion-related reaction. Similarly, in the ORATORIO trial of Ocrevus in PPMS, 20.4% of Ocrevus patients had a serious adverse event, and 39.9% had one or more infusion-related reactions. The Mellen Center researchers noted that the lower rates of adverse events that they recorded may have been due to differences in reporting. They also observed that patients at their institution had longer average disease duration and fewer enhancing lesions at baseline than clinical trial participants. The real-world findings are, nonetheless, welcome and reassuring. FDA approves Vumerity™, a fumarate medication designed to address GI tolerability Clinicians know that the medications that work best are those that patients take regularly. For this reason, the tolerability of an agent can be as important as its effectiveness. In a nod to this reality, Biogen and Alkermes developed Vumerity™ (diroximel fumarate) to provide the efficacy already demonstrated by Biogen’s disease-modifying therapy Tecfidera (dimethyl fumarate), but with fewer of the gastrointestinal (GI) side effects reported with the latter medication. In late October, a few weeks after MS researchers returned from ECTRIMS 2019, the FDA announced that it had approved Vumerity for use in relapsing forms of MS, including clinically isolated syndrome and relapsing-remitting MS. In pursuing FDA approval for Vumerity, Biogen provided data from the EVOLVE-MS-1 study, an ongoing, Phase III, single-arm, open-label, two-year safety study enrolling patients with relapsing-remitting MS. Interim results from the study submitted to the FDA showed that 6.3% of patients had stopped Vumerity due to adverse events, with fewer than 1% stopping because of gastrointestinal events. In the clinical trials leading to approval of Tecfidera, 18% of patients reported abdominal pain, 14% reported diarrhea, 12% cited nausea, and 9% reported vomiting. A tilt toward monoclonal antibody therapy as first-line MS treatment Neurologists’ top choice of an initial multiple sclerosis (MS) treatment has shifted from interferon-based medications to monoclonal antibodies. That was the main finding of an analysis of data on more than 1,000 people with MS who began their first disease-modifying therapy (DMT) in late 2018 or early 2019. In December 2018 and January 2019, investigators drew on records from 213 U.S. neurologists to examine those physicians’ prescribing of MS medications over the prior three months. They then compared that 2018-2019 information with comparable data on the first medications prescribed to more than 1,000 “treatment-naïve” patients (individuals who had never taken a DMT previously) in early 2018, and another 1,020 patients who received their first DMT in 2017. Researchers found that in late 2018-early 2019, 18% of treatment-naïve patients started a monoclonal antibody medication as their first DMT, compared with 8% in 2017. Conversely, the proportion of newly treated patients receiving an interferon-based medication declined from 26% in 2017 to 17% in 2019. The investigators noted that greater prescribing of Ocrevus (ocrelizumab) drove much of the increase in monoclonal antibody use, and was accompanied by a quantitatively measured increase in neurologists’ comfort level with using Ocrevus for relapsing-remitting forms of MS. They added that the 2017 approval of a generic version of Copaxone (glatiramer acetate, or GA) also had significantly affected neurologists’ choice of a first-line DMT, with branded GA seeing its share of first-line prescriptions declining from 27% in 2017 to 18% in 2019, while generic GA went from accounting for 4% of first-line prescriptions in 2017 to 13% in 2019. Further evidence supporting early initiation of disease-modifying therapy Increasing age, duration of multiple sclerosis (MS), and greater disability detract from the effectiveness of disease-modifying therapies, according to an analysis of data on more than 14,000 patients. While those findings may seem intuitive, the researchers went further and quantified the extent to which medication therapy was diminished per year, per 1-point change in Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score, and other measures. The study drew on the MSBase Registry, examining data for 14,717 people who had been followed for at least one year. Seventy-two percent of the patients were female. The mean age at first visit was 36 years, and the patients had a mean duration of disease of 5.7 years and a median EDSS score of 2. Roughly three-quarters had clinically definite MS, while 20% had a clinically isolated syndrome (CIS). The researchers found that patients receiving treatment were 39% more likely to experience confirmed improvement of disability than their untreated counterparts. However, this effect of therapy declined with age (-2% per year), disease duration (-6% per year), and disability (-8% per EDSS step). In an observation that reinforces the value of early initiation of treatment, the investigators concluded, “Immunotherapies exert their maximum effect in young patients with shorter disease course, mild disability and a previous stability on treatment.” Tracking changes in use of DMTs as well as complementary and alternative interventions People with MS are drawing on both disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) and complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) interventions in managing their health, according to a recent survey of more than 1,100 patients in Oregon and southwest Washington. Fielded from September 2018 to April 2019, the survey identified respondents’ use of both prescription medications for MS and interventions such as herbs and supplements, cannabis, dietary plans, and yoga. In addition to assessing current approaches to MS, researchers compared results from the 2018-2019 questionnaire with answers to a similar survey conducted in 2001. Those investigators found that the proportion of people taking a DMT at the time they were surveyed increased from 47% in 2001 to 69% now. Use of CAM at time of survey response also increased during that period, from 68% to 93%. Eighty-six percent of respondents to the 2018-2019 survey reported having employed exercise in managing their MS, with the proportion of people who have tried yoga increasing from 23% in 2001 to 46% in the recent survey. The proportion of people reporting having used meditation also increased, 16% to 39%. A majority of respondents to both surveys reported having used diet to manage their MS, with a slight increase from 59% in 2001 to 66% more recently. Low-carbohydrate and anti-inflammatory diets were the most commonly followed approaches in both surveys. Researchers noted that they will further analyze their data to explore differences in perceived benefit of DMTs between CAM users and nonusers. Three key take-aways emerge from this research. First, more people are doing more than ever before to take a pro-active approach to dealing with their MS. Second, many people have rejected the false dichotomy of either using only a prescription medication or rejecting such agents in favor of exclusive reliance on alternative approaches. Third, as use of alternative approaches grows, it is important for patients to talk openly with their clinicians about all interventions they are employing or considering, particularly given the potential for interaction between herbs and some supplements and prescription medications. Ninety-three percent of the 81 MS patients to undergo stem-cell transplantation at a Swedish center between 2004 and February 2019 remained progression free over an average follow-up period of 3.9 years, and none have died since undergoing the procedure. The investigators presenting that heartening news at the 2019 ECTRIMS meeting added that 87% of the patients had not experienced a relapse since transplantation, and that the annualized relapse rate (ARR) for the entire group was 0.022. By comparison, the group’s mean ARR for the year prior to the procedure was 2.2. The patients consisted of 56 women and 25 men. Their median age was 29 years, and 95% had relapsing-remitting MS. Conversely, stem-cell transplantation did not reduce the number of active lesions seen on MRI after 24 weeks of treatment in a major international study, but did show promise in reducing the relapse rate, one of the investigation’s lead researchers told the press in discussing preliminary results presented at the 2019 ECTRIMS meeting. The MESEMS trial (MEsenchymal StEm cells for Multiple Sclerosis) was a randomized, double-blind, cross-over phase II trial examining the impact of autologous mesenchymal stem cells (MSC). Most of the 144 patients randomized for treatment had relapsing-remitting MS, while roughly 20% had secondary-progressive MS, and a little over 10% had primary-progressive MS. The study’s authors noted that the results presented at ECTRIMS were preliminary, and that further analysis is needed. Assessing the impact of plasma exchange when steroids don’t help with relapses Therapeutic plasma exchange – or plasmapheresis – is a technique clinicians sometimes employ when steroids aren’t helping to resolve an MS relapse. The process involves withdrawing whole blood from a vein, separating the plasma – or liquid portion of the blood – from the red and white blood cells, and then transfusing the red and white blood cells back into the patient, along with plasma replacement fluid. This “blood cleansing” approach is fairly uncommon, so Austrian and German researchers recently analyzed 14 years’ worth of data on 133 patients at their MS clinics to better understand its effectiveness. The investigators assessed clinical response to plasma exchange, with a marked clinical response defined as ≥1 step improvement in the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) and mild clinical improvement – which was characterized by improvement in neurological examination with change of EDSS <1 step. They also identified patients who had no improvement. Seventy-six percent of patients undergoing therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) saw improvement, with 36% having marked improvement and 40% experiencing mild improvement. In general, TPE was more effective in younger patients, those with a shorter duration of disease, and with a shorter interval between relapse and receiving TPE. By exploring how often and to what extent TPE helps patients who have not benefited sufficiently from steroids during relapses – and by identifying which patients are likely to have the best response to the treatment – the researchers have provided clinicians with valuable insights on a less commonly employed treatment option. A team of Canadian researchers showed in a small study that blood levels of a protein called serum neurofilament light chain (NfL) measured in the first five years after onset of symptoms can provide important insights on a patient’s likely course over the next 15 years. In analyzing data on 64 people with MS, they found that patients with a serum NfL level greater than 7.62 pg/mL had a nine-times greater risk of developing secondary-progressive MS over the following several years than people with lower blood levels of the protein. Similarly, when they divided patients into three groups, based on whether they had low, medium, or high NfL levels, they found that those with the highest level had more aggressive disease progression, with their Expanded Disability Stats Scale (EDSS) score increasing by 0.16 per year, reflecting greater impairment. Similarly, patients in the lowest NfL levels were 5.3-times less likely than others to reach an EDSS of 4.0 or greater. The researchers noted that their findings were consistent across the adult age range and in both men and women. They concluded that their study “demonstrates an association between early disease serum NfL and long term clinical outcomes over the longest follow-up to-date. Whether the course of such patients can be altered by earlier treatment will require further study.” In another study, a Spanish investigator has developed evidence indicating that the presence and prevalence of certain types of bacteria in the gastrointestinal tract can serve as predictive factors in assessing the long-term course of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS). The gut microbiome – the milieu of bacteria and other molecules found in the gastrointestinal tract – is a major component of the body’s immune system, and in recent years has emerged as a focus of intense study in MS. Earlier research indicates that people with MS or at heightened risk for MS have imbalances in the mix of bacteria normally found in the GI tract of healthy people. The study reported at the 2019 ECTRIMS meeting involved using molecular sequencing of stool samples to study the gut microbiota – or composition of bacterial species – of 16 people with RRMS and 15 healthy controls. The investigators then followed the people with MS over 24 months. They found that levels of family of bacteria, and particularly two types of bacteria within that family known as and were associated with an increased risk of relapses and new lesions appearing on MRI. While this was a small study whose findings need to be explored on a larger scale, it points to the many ways researchers are homing in on factors that help chart the likely course of disease – and that eventually will help patients and their clinicians formulate treatment plans accordingly. People with MS have elevated risk for other conditions even before their MS diagnosis Even before they are diagnosed with multiple sclerosis, people with MS are more likely than others to have bladder problems, eye issues, and other conditions, according to a Swedish study involving more than 6,600 people with MS and almost 62,000 healthy controls. The people ultimately identified as having MS had a higher pre-diagnosis incidence of epilepsy (1.5% vs. 0.8%), autoimmune disease (1.3% vs 0.7%), bladder dysfunction (1.2% vs 0.2%), and retinal disorders (2.4% vs 1.2%) compared with controls. After MS diagnosis, the patients continued to have considerably higher rates of epilepsy, autoimmune diseases, and bladder dysfunction, as well as of toxic liver disease. The research team concluded, “Before a diagnosis of MS, patients already displayed an increased rate of comorbidity compared with MS-free controls. After diagnosis, patients with MS continued to display increased risk of several comorbidities, some of which may be explained by surveillance bias due to more frequent contact with healthcare.” Measuring the toll of MS on women’s physical, mental function Multiple sclerosis accelerates age-related physiologic decline in physical and mental function by 10-20 years in women with MS compared to their same-age counterparts. That is the unwelcome but important conclusion of researchers who drew on data from the large-scale Nurses Health Study and Nurses Health Study II and compared participants’ physical function and cognitive function scores with those of 582 women with confirmed MS. They found that women with MS who were ages 36 to 41 years had, on average, physical function comparable to that of unaffected women aged 58 to 62 years. Middle-aged women with MS were about three-times more likely than their age peers to report a slower walking pace and more than twice as likely to report almost daily urine leaks. At higher ages, women with MS were five-times more likely than unaffected peers to report problems with balance. Among women over age 75 years, women with MS were less likely to report good cognitive function than women without MS. The results, while not encouraging, are not entirely surprising either, and underscore the importance of pursuing overall good health through clinician-approved diet and exercise programs in order to optimize well-being. Recurrent demyelinating events in children: Identifying frequency and risk factors Two-thirds of children who have a first demyelinating event (FDE) will go on to have at least one more such event, with older age at FDE, presence of more than five lesions on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and symptoms suggestive of a brainstem syndrome being among several risk factors for further events. Those were the key findings to emerge from an observational cohort study involving 75 children who had an FDE between 1999 and 2018. The children included 46 girls and 29 boys; their median age was 12 years. In 80% of cases, the FDE involved a single neurological symptom. Thirty-six had optic neuritis, while 15 had transverse myelitis, and 14 had symptoms indicative of a brainstem syndrome. Final diagnoses included multiple sclerosis (32 children), relapsing optic neuritis (7), and syndromes including polyphasic acute disseminated encephalomyelitis and neuromyelitis optica. Fifty-six percent of the children experienced a relapse within 60 months of their FDE, and the overall risk of relapse was calculated at 65%. A clinical presentation indicating a brainstem syndrome was associated with a 10-fold higher risk for a second demyelinating event compared with other clinical presentations, while being age 11 years or older at the time of the FDE more than doubled the risk of recurrence compared to younger children. MRI findings of periventricular, subcortical, brainstem, and lateral spinal lesions also were associated with increased risk. As investigators better understand the risks of – and risk factors for – recurrent demyelinating events in young people, clinicians can formulate their counseling approaches, diagnostic strategies, and treatment decisions accordingly to enhance care and help children and their families know what to anticipate.

It can cause symptoms that come and go, including numbness or tingling, muscle weakness, vision problems and trouble walking or talking. In this protocol, learn about the causes of MS and what treatments are available. Discover how an imbalanced immune system contributes to the inflammation that drives the disease. Vitamin D supplementation has been shown to modulate the immune response in MS and help improve symptoms, in some clinical trials. What is Multiple Sclerosis? Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune and inflammatory disease characterized by destruction of the myelin sheath—the coating that insulates and protects neurons. This demyelination causes disruptions in neural communication and potentially neuronal death, leading to disability. MS may follow several disease courses, the most common of which is relapsing remitting. Relapsing remitting MS is characterized by clearly defined acute attacks followed by periods of remission. Natural interventions such as vitamin D and essential fatty acids may help relieve inflammation and improve symptoms of MS. What are the Risk Factors for Multiple Sclerosis? Genetic predisposition Viral infection (eg, Epstein-Barr virus) Vitamin D deficiency Hormonal imbalance Exposure to organic solvents Food sensitivities Smoking What are the Signs and Symptoms of Multiple Sclerosis? Note: Symptoms of MS vary widely, depending on the location of affected nerve fibers. Symptoms may include: Fatigue Numbness or tingling in limbs Impaired vision Muscle weakness, clumsiness Loss of balance, dizziness, potential nausea and vomiting Bladder dysfunction Changes in memory, reasoning, and spatial perception What are Conventional Medical Treatments for Multiple Sclerosis? Note: There is currently no cure for MS. Treatments include therapies to calm acute attacks, slow or modify the disease course, and alleviate symptoms. Several experimental therapies are currently being evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration. Therapies for acute attacks: Corticosteroids Plasmapheresis (plasma exchange to remove inflammatory factors and antibodies) Disease-modifying therapies: Beta interferons to reduce inflammation and slow disease progression Glatiramer acetate, an immunomodulator Immunosuppressant drugs (eg, mitoxantrone) Monoclonal antibodies (eg, natalizumab) Dalfampridine, a potassium channel blocker, to increase the ability of nerve cells to conduct impulses Symptom management may include: muscle relaxants medications to reduce fatigue antidepressants What are Additional Therapies for Multiple Sclerosis? Physical therapy Occupational therapy Speech therapy Cognitive rehabilitation Vocational rehabilitation Swank low-fat diet Hormone therapy What Natural Interventions May Be Beneficial for Multiple Sclerosis? Vitamin D. As vitamin D deficiency is a risk factor for MS, supplementation may be helpful. Several clinical studies have demonstrated that MS patients taking vitamin D had fewer relapses and less inflammation. Essential fatty acids. Omega-3 (ie, DHA and EPA) and certain omega-6 (ie, GLA) fatty acids have been shown to reduce inflammation and improve some symptoms of MS. Antioxidants. Oxidative stress may play a role in the pathogenesis of MS, and MS patients tend to have low levels of the endogenous antioxidant glutathione peroxidase. Supplementing with selenium, vitamin E, vitamin C, and/or N-acetylcysteine may boost glutathione peroxidase levels for potential benefits. Lipoic acid. Lipoic acid has been shown to inhibit the activity of ICAM-1, a protein believed to be involved in the pathogenesis of MS. Supplementation with lipoic acid reduced ICAM-1 levels and T-cell migration into the central nervous system in patients with MS. Vitamin B12. Patients with MS may be deficient in vitamin B12. Supplementation has been shown in several studies to improve symptoms and the clinical course of the disease in patients with MS. Biotin. Biotin (vitamin B7) has demonstrated positive effects in patients with MS. Studies showed high doses of biotin improved measures of MS-related disabilities in some patients. Other natural interventions that may benefit patients with MS include coenzyme Q10, ginkgo biloba, green tea, and curcumin. 2 Introduction Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a disease of autoimmunity and inflammation characterized by destruction of the myelin sheath that insulates and protects neurons. When a patient experiences an ""attack,"" or episode of increased disease activity, the resultant impairment of neuronal communication can manifest as a broad spectrum of symptoms, affecting sensory processing, locomotion, and cognition. Scientific research suggests both genetic and environmental factors contribute to the development of the disease. Current medical treatments for MS include potent immunosuppressive drugs, which reduce immune function, and anti-inflammatory medications as well as invasive procedures such as plasma exchange, which attempts to reduce inflammatory mediators in a patient's blood. Largely ignored and discounted by mainstream medicine, nutrients offer immune-modifying benefits that can help complement pharmacological and clinical interventions and improve quality of life for MS patients. Furthermore, mounting evidence suggests vitamin D may be a missing link in virtually all autoimmune diseases, including MS. This single vitamin has the ability to modulate the immune system in ways that even pharmaceutical drugs cannot. A multitude of epidemiological studies have revealed that individuals with low levels of vitamin D in their blood are at considerably increased risk for developing MS; in fact, up to 90% of MS patients are deficient in vitamin D.1 3 Understanding Multiple Sclerosis Within the central nervous system (brain and spinal cord) a vast network of neurons are constantly communicating amongst themselves, and with the peripheral nervous system (outside of the brain and spinal cord), to control every aspect of human function, from sight and hearing, to cognition and mobility. The efficiency and accuracy of communication between individual neurons form the basis for our ability to do things as diverse as complete simple daily tasks and comprehend complex philosophical or mathematical ideas. Neuronal communication is similar to the transmission of an electrical current through a series of wires. Droves of neurons work together to deliver messages to every corner of the body by transmitting signals along their long, cylindrical mid-sections called axons and passing it on to the next neuron. This is repeated until the message reaches its destination. Like electrical wires, neuronal axons require insulation to ensure that they are able to transmit a signal accurately, and at high speeds. Specialized cells called oligodendrocytes provide this insulation to neurons by wrapping the axons in an insulating material called myelin. Without this myelin sheath, neuronal communication becomes nearly impossible, and neurons become susceptible to damage. Multiple sclerosis is a disease which ultimately leads to the inability of neurons to communicate amongst themselves. Because multiple sclerosis is not selective for specific neurons, and can progress through the brain and spinal cord randomly, each patient's symptoms may vary considerably. During the initial stages of the disease, symptoms often emerge for a finite time before regressing for an extended period. 4 Pathology of Disease Progression Demyelination MS is an immuno-inflammatory disease in which immune cells enter the central nervous system (CNS) and destroy the myelin sheath. Immune cells, which become activated through complex mechanisms migrate into the CNS, and attack the myelin sheath. The resultant demyelination is thought to be carried out by T lymphocytes, B lymphocytes, and macrophages, three primary classes of immune cells, which are routinely found in MS lesions.2 Loss of myelin followed by subsequent lack of neural communication and neuronal death is accepted as the primary cause of disability in MS patients.3 Axonal transection, or the severing of axons, occurs under conditions of both acute and chronic demyelination.4-6 Remyelination Remyelination is the process by which demyelinated axons are naturally re-wrapped with myelin, restoring nerve conduction and functionality.7 This phenomenon is the result of oligodendrocytes repairing the damage to the myelin sheath that occurs during an episode of increased disease activity. However, as the disease progresses over years (usually decades) the oligodendrocytes begin to lose their ability to repair the damage, and symptoms become progressively worse and episodes more frequent due to remyelination failure. In addition to developing therapies that slow MS disease progression, many laboratories are developing novel therapeutics that aim to promote remyelination and reverse existing CNS damage. Inflammation In addition to immune-mediated loss of myelin, another characteristic feature of MS is inflammation caused by a class of white blood cells called T cells.8,9 Some of the damage in the CNS is directly carried out by two subpopulations of T lymphocytes called T helper 1 and T helper 17 which produce pro-inflammatory factors.10 Recent studies have identified that chemical mediators, interleukin-23 (IL-23) and granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), contribute to the autoimmune characteristics of these T cells. Data suggest absence of these pro-inflammatory signals was sufficient to prevent inflammation in the brain.11 This suggests that therapeutic strategies directed at blocking the production of inflammatory mediators could be effective for treating MS. Vitamin D and Multiple Sclerosis: A Panacea? Mainstream medicine has failed to recognize the pivotal role of vitamin D in regulating the overactive immune system in MS patients. Greater than 30 years have passed since vitamin D was originally hypothesized to be an important environmental determinant of the prevalence of MS.12,13 During the three decades following the initial linking of vitamin D and MS, evidence has continued to mount. It is now known that MS occurs more frequently in individuals with lower blood levels of vitamin D. A study published in the prestigious Journal of the American Medical Association found that, compared to those with the highest vitamin D blood levels, those with the lowest blood levels were 62% more likely to develop MS. MS attacks occur less frequently during seasons corresponding with the highest exposure to sunlight; since vitamin D synthesis depends upon exposure of the skin to sunlight, the summer months also bring the highest blood levels of vitamin D.14 A recent study has quantified the impact of vitamin D blood levels on risk for MS relapse—for each 4 ng/ml increase in 25-hydroxy vitamin D in the blood, the risk for MS relapse is reduced by 12%. The investigators who conducted this study concluded that ""Clinically, raising 25-hydroxy vitamin D levels by [20 ng/ml] could halve the hazard of a relapse.""15 Vitamin D mediates these disease-modifying effects through complex and powerful interactions with the immune system. Hostile immune cells, which attack the myelin sheath, are calmed upon exposure to vitamin D. In fact, when aggressive immune cells taken directly from MS patients are exposed to the active form of vitamin D, the cells divide and reproduce much more slowly, indicating that vitamin D has the ability to impede the aberrant autoimmunity that is a driving force in MS. However, vitamin D does more than just arrest damaging immune cells; it also supercharges protective immune cells. T-reg cells are specialized components of the immune system that help keep immunity balanced. If too few T-reg cells are present, the immune system becomes overactive, as in autoimmune diseases like MS. Vitamin D increases the number of protective T-reg cells, restoring equilibrium to an overactive immune system.16 In a randomized controlled trial, supplementation with doses of vitamin D ranging from 10,000 IU to 40,000 IU daily over the course of 52 weeks resulted in a reduction in relapses and a reduction in the number of aggressive immune cells in patients with MS.17 Despite robust findings across a range of studies on the link between vitamin D and MS, mainstream medicine and the federal government have only just recently begun to realize the need to initiate federally funded trials. Results of a large scale, randomized, controlled clinical trial to assess the effects of vitamin D in MS are currently pending.1 Life Extension customers should not be surprised if vitamin D emerges as a frontline treatment for MS in the coming years. However, instead of waiting for mainstream physicians to begin recommending vitamin D to MS patients, Life Extension suggests all individuals monitor their blood levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D and maintain a blood level of 50–80 ng/mL. This is because low vitamin D levels are also an emerging risk factor for numerous other diseases, such as type 1 diabetes, heart disease, and rheumatoid arthritis.18-22 The amount of supplementation required to achieve this blood level varies from person to person, but it appears many individuals require supplementation of 5,000‒8,000 IU vitamin D daily to reach these levels. More information about the role of vitamin D in health is available in the compelling Life Extension Magazine article entitled ""Startling Findings About Vitamin D Levels in Life Extension Members."" 5 Risk Factors for MS Genetics and Family History Studies have established a definitive role for genetics as contributing factor for developing MS. The most compelling data reveal that while unrelated adopted siblings have a 0‒2% disease risk, identical twins demonstrate a 25% disease risk.23 Several studies have identified susceptibility genes related to many aspects of immune function.24-28 While these genetic links are helpful in understanding MS population clusters, findings such as the 25% disease risk among identical twins and the geographic distribution of MS suggest that up to 75% of MS must be attributable to non-genetic or environmental factors. Infection Infection is one of the more widely suspected non-genetic risk factors for MS. Data suggest that, in genetically predisposed individuals, exposure to an infectious agent may lead to MS.29 One common theory, molecular mimicry, proposes that presentation of foreign antigens that are molecularly similar to self-antigens leads to an autoimmune response.30,31 In other words, viruses involved in the development of autoimmune diseases could possibly display very similar proteins to the proteins found on nerves making these nerves also a target for antibodies. Investigators have probed the involvement of several viruses including: herpes simplex virus (HSV), rubella, measles, mumps, and Epstein Barr virus (EBV).32 Currently, the strongest evidence for the involvement of an infectious agent implicates EBV. Virtually all patients who have MS are infected with the EBV.32 Further, levels of antibodies to EBV are strongly correlated with the risk of developing the disease.33 Low Vitamin D Levels Considering the regulatory role that vitamin D plays in immune system reactivity, it is not surprising that population-based studies have consistently found lower levels of vitamin D in the blood of patients with MS compared to healthy control subjects. Data from the Nurses' Health Study (more than 92,000 women followed from 1980 to 2000) and the Nurses' Health Study II (more than 95,000 women followed from 1991 to 2001), support the notion of a protective effect for vitamin D against the risk of developing MS. The incidence of MS was 33% lower in women that consumed the most vitamin D as compared to those that consumed the least. In addition, those that consumed at least 400 IU daily of vitamin D from supplements had an astounding 41% lower incidence of MS.18 In a recent study, researchers at the University of California, San Francisco discovered low 25-hydroxyvitamin D blood levels in African Americans with MS as compared to controls.34 The senior author, who is also the associate director of UCSF Multiple Sclerosis Center concluded, ""It seems relatively clear low vitamin D levels are a risk factor for developing multiple sclerosis."" Hormones Studies have shown that MS is more common in women than men, and that the disease course is affected by the fluctuation of steroid hormones during the female menstrual cycle.35 It is also widely reported that MS patients who become pregnant experience a significant decrease in relapses, enabling women who have MS to bear children safely.36 Animal models of multiple sclerosis have shown that the pregnancy hormone, estriol, can ameliorate disease and can cause an immune shift.36,37 Other studies note that pregnant women who have MS tend to experience a rebound of their disease within three months post-delivery.38 These findings suggest hormones can regulate the course of MS, and this theory is further supported by research demonstrating that steroid hormones (eg, estrogens, testosterone, progesterone, and, dehydroepiandrosterone [DHEA]) can modulate the immune system.39-41 The specific relationship of hormones to the disease process of MS is complex, with ratios between the individual hormones also playing a role. For example, during a human study that examined the presence of MS lesions by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), patients with high estradiol and low progesterone levels had more lesions that those who had low levels of both hormones. Further, patients with a high estrogen to progesterone ratio had a significantly greater number of ""active,"" inflamed lesions than patients who had a low ratio.42 These studies suggest that maintaining youthful hormone balance may ease the symptoms of MS. A study from Italy provided further evidence that abnormal hormone levels may play a role in the development of MS. The investigators measured hormone levels in 35 women and 25 men with MS, and in 36 people without the disease. Women with low testosterone levels were found to have more brain tissue damage, as determined using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The women with MS had lower levels of testosterone throughout their monthly cycle compared to women who did not have the condition. Testosterone levels did not vary between men with MS and unaffected men. However, men with MS who had the highest levels of the female hormone estradiol were found to have the greatest degree of brain tissue damage.43 More information about optimizing and balancing hormone levels can be found in Life Extension's ""Male Hormone Restoration"" and ""Female Hormone Restoration"" protocols. Organic Solvents In the mid-1990s, researchers in Sweden evaluated 13 studies investigating the connection between solvent exposure and autoimmune disease. Organic solvents include chemicals such as toluene, paint thinner, and acetone, the latter of which is commonly found in nail polish remover. Ten of those studies indicated a significant relationship between organic solvent exposure and MS. All of the analyses suggested exposure to solvents increases a person's relative risk of developing MS.44 In another study scientists analyzed the occupational health records of more than 57,000 workers in Norway, covering a 16-year period. They concluded that workers, such as painters, who are routinely exposed to organic solvents, had twice the risk of developing MS than those who were not occupationally exposed. These results were compatible with the hypothesis that organic solvents are a possible risk factor for MS.45 Individuals interested in protecting themselves from organic solvents and other environmental toxins should read Life Extension's ""Metabolic Detoxification"" protocol. Food Sensitivities Sensitivities to certain foods may also play a role in the development or exacerbation of MS. Antibodies to gluten, which is a protein found in wheat, is more common in patients with MS.46,47 MS is also most prevalent in areas where consumption of wheat gluten and milk are also high.48 This relationship led scientists to explore a possible link between antibodies produced to bovine milk proteins and the ability of those antibodies to cross-react to the protective sheathes around nerves triggering an MS episode. Indeed, this immunologic cross-reactivity has been demonstrated in the laboratory in rodents that have MS.49,50 Further investigations have revealed that in MS patients, higher levels of these antibodies are produced within the central nervous system.51 Additional studies are still needed to understand how this cross-reactivity plays into the development and progression of MS. To help rule out food sensitivities, Life Extension suggests blood testing such as the Food Safe Allergy test and the Celiac Disease Antibody Screen. Call 800-226-2370 for more information on how to obtain this type of testing. Additional information about food allergies is available in the Life Extension Magazine article entitled ""What's Really Making You Sick?"" Smoking A recently published literature review, evaluating more than 3,000 MS cases and 450,000 controls, supports the emerging consensus that smoking increases the risk of developing MS by approximately 50%.52 It is unlikely that smoking alone accounts for the worldwide variation in MS prevalence, and thus, the interplay between genetic markers and smoking has also been investigated. One such study reported that smokers that have two known genetic markers for MS had two times the risk for developing MS than their non-smoking counterparts.53 Another study has also verified that smokers diagnosed with MS but in remission have 3.5 times the risk of reactivating and progression of their disease than their non-smoking counterparts.54,55 6 Symptoms and Diagnosis MS can affect people of all ages; however, the average age of disease onset is between 20 and 40 years.48 Fatigue, numbness in the limbs, impaired vision, muscle weakness, loss of balance, and bladder dysfunction are frequent symptoms. Symptoms of multiple sclerosis vary widely, depending on the location of affected nerve fibers.48 Symptoms affecting mobility tend to appear early in the course of MS and they may include weakness, clumsiness, leg dragging, stiffness, and a tendency to drop objects. Common sensory symptoms include numbness, sensations of heaviness, tingling, and electrical sensations. Visual symptoms are also common, affecting more than one-third of all people who have MS. The classic visual disturbances, such as blurred or foggy vision and eyeball pain, usually appear early in the course of the disease. MS can also interfere with the nerves that supply the vestibular apparatus in the inner ear, which is where balance is perceived. This can result in dizziness, nausea, and vomiting. In the later stages of the disease, involvement of the genitourinary tract may result in loss of bladder, sexual, and bowel function.56 Over 40% of MS patients suffer from changes in memory, reasoning, spatial perception, and verbal fluency.57 Symptoms of MS are often triggered or worsened by an increase in body temperature. MS is a tremendously variable and unpredictable disease. Different patients will experience different symptoms, rates of disease progression, and responses to treatment. Four Disease Courses Have Been Identified in MS Progressive relapsing (PR) MS, which is the least common disease course, shows progression of disability from onset but with clear acute relapses, with or without full recovery. Approximately 5% of people with MS appear to have PRMS at diagnosis. Secondary progressive (SP) MS begins with an initial relapsing-remitting disease course, followed by progression of disability. Typically, secondary-progressive disease is characterized by: less recovery following attacks, persistently worsening functioning during and between attacks, and accompanied by progressive disability. Many patients with RRMS do develop SPMS ultimately. Primary progressive (PP) MS is characterized by progression of disability from onset, without plateaus or remissions or with occasional plateaus and temporary minor improvements. A person with PPMS, by definition, does not experience acute attacks. Ten percent of diagnosed MS are PPMS. Relapsing remitting (RR) MS represents 85% of clinical diagnoses of the disease. It is characterized by clearly defined acute attacks with full recovery or with residual deficit upon recovery. Periods between disease relapses are characterized by a lack of disease progression. Diagnosis No single test gives a definitive diagnosis for MS, and variable symptoms and disease course make early diagnosis a challenge. Most presumptive diagnoses of MS are based on the clinical symptoms seen in an acute attack. These presumptions are then supported by a combination of diagnostic imaging with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), antibody testing of the fluid found in the CNS, measurements to evaluate how efficiently nerves conduct impulses (since demyelination slows nerve conduction) and evaluation of how the symptoms progress through time.58 7 Conventional Therapies A cure for MS has yet to be discovered, and although recent efforts have brought advances in available treatments, substantial room for improvement remains. Presently, conventional medical treatment typically focuses on strategies to treat acute attacks, to slow the progression of the disease, and to treat symptoms. Conventional Medical Treatments to Treat Acute Disease Flares Corticosteroids. For acute MS flares, corticosteroids, such as methylprednisolone, are commonly administered in high doses to suppress the immune system and decrease the production of proinflammatory factors. These drugs are often prescribed for short periods and can be effective at alleviating the symptoms of MS. Corticosteroids should not be used for long-term therapy, however, because of their many side effects, including increased risk of infection, osteoporosis, high blood pressure, cataracts, elevated blood sugar, mood swings and weight gain. Also, while corticosteroids may reduce the symptoms of the disease, they have no effect on its progression.59 Plasma exchange (plasmapheresis). Plasmapheresis is a process in which whole blood is separated into blood cells and plasma, the liquid part of blood. In MS patients the plasma contains unusually high levels of antibodies and proinflammatory factors that exacerbate symptoms. Plasma exchange helps remove these factors quickly and is sometimes used to help combat severe symptoms of multiple sclerosis relapses in people who are not responding to intravenous steroids. Conventional Medical Treatment to Modify the Course of the Disease Beta interferons. Beta interferons (Avonex, Betaseron) reduce inflammation and slow progression of the disease, but like many medications used in conventional medical treatment of MS, the mechanism of action is poorly understood60,61 This specific treatment may be accompanied by adverse effects such as suicidal depression, liver damage, flu-like symptoms, and injection site reactions.62 Glatiramer acetate. Glatiramer acetate (Copaxone) is an MS treatment that yields fewer adverse side effects than beta interferon while still remaining clinically effective. Glatiramer has a chemical structure similar to the protective myelin sheath around nerves and serves as a decoy for antibodies that would otherwise attack this sheath.63 Side effects may include flushing, rapid heartbeat, nausea, shortness of breath after injection, and injection site reactions.64 Mitoxantrone and fingolimod. Mitoxantrone (Novantrone) and fingolimod (Gilenya) are immunosuppressants. Clinical data show these drugs can slow the rates at which disability progresses and the rate at which new lesions form in the brain and spinal cord. These therapies, however, are not used as a first-line treatment as they can cause severe side effects including heart disease, leukemia, decreased white blood cell counts, and increased rates of infection.65 Natalizumab. Natalizumab (Tysabri) is thought to block a protein that allows white blood cells to enter the brain and spinal cord and cause disease progression in MS. Due to an association with three cases of a potentially fatal infection of the CNS,66 this is a controversial drug that is only available for patients enrolled in the Tysabri Outreach Unified Commitment to Health (TOUCH) program.67 This medication is reserved for people who do not see results from other types of treatments. Dalfampridine. Dalfampridine (Ampyra) is a medication approved in 2010 that increases the ability of nerve cells to conduct impulses.68 This drug represents a new class of therapies that is aimed at addressing neurologic deficits directly. Medications to Treat Symptoms Muscle relaxants. Multiple sclerosis patients may experience painful or uncontrollable muscle stiffness or spasms, particularly in the legs. Muscle relaxants such as baclofen (Lioresal) and tizanidine (Zanaflex) may improve muscle spasticity. However, baclofen may increase weakness in the legs, and tizanidine may cause drowsiness or a dry mouth. Medications to reduce fatigue. Drugs such as amantadine (Symmetrel) may help reduce fatigue. Other medications. Medications may also be prescribed for depression, pain and bladder or bowel control problems that may be associated with multiple sclerosis. Medications on the Horizon There are approximately 20 experimental therapies that are on the pathway to approval by the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA). Investigators are making progress toward developing treatments that may be capable of protecting the CNS as well as encouraging repair of brain and spinal cord lesions. Many of these drugs are potentially valuable as treatments for MS, but are months or years from traversing all phases of the FDA process. Laquinimod. Laquinimodhas been shown to decrease proinflammatory factors and increase factors that promote nerve protection without increasing risk of infection. Laquinimod was well tolerated by most patients, with only a few reports of adverse effects.69 Alemtuzumab. Alemtuzumab (Campath) is an antibody specific for mature white blood cells that targets them for destruction by the immune system. This drug is approved for the treatment of certain types of lymphoma and leukemia. In one study, it was shown to be more effective than beta interferon in reducing disability progression and relapse rate, however, the trial was discontinued early due to serious side effects.70 Fumaric acid. Fumaric acid is a substance that has been used in the treatment of psoriasis and shows promise in MS to decrease white blood cell infiltration into the spinal cord.71 Therapy and Rehabilitation to Improve Quality of Life In addition to one or more drug-based therapies, MS patients will often participate in rehabilitation programs intended to maintain or improve their ability to perform at home and at work. More specifically these programs focus on general fitness and aim to address problems related to mobility, speech and swallowing, and cognitive deficits. Common rehabilitation strategies include: Physical therapy. Practices that aide mobility and functionality through structured physical activity on a scheduled basis. Occupational therapy. Skills aimed at using work, self-care, and leisure activities to foster development and limit disability. Speech therapy. Work with speech therapists can help MS patients overcome speech and language difficulties and help with troublesome swallowing. Cognitive rehabilitation. Assistance in managing difficulties with memory, high order thinking, and perception. A variety cognitive rehabilitation options are available. For example, playing chess regularly is a great way to promote neuronal function and communication; computer-based ""brain training"" programs are also helpful. Vocational rehabilitation. Support in making career plans, gaining job skills, and approaches to remaining gainfully employed. 8 Multiple Sclerosis Nutritional Protocol Most patients that employ complementary treatments for MS do so as an accompaniment with conventional drug treatments and find both classes of therapy to provide clinical benefits.72 The following section outlines key details and evidence-based findings concerning the latest complementary approaches to treating MS. Vitamin D As previously mentioned, mainstream medicine has overlooked a critical missing link in MS management—vitamin D. This hormone-like vitamin is capable of safely interacting directly with the genome to modulate a variety of physiological functions, including aspects of immune function involved in autoimmune diseases like MS. Two human clinical trials demonstrated that individuals with MS using vitamin D tended to have fewer relapses and less inflammation.17,73,74 In a year-long Vitamin D study, recurrence rate of MS ""attacks"" was 27% lower compared to baseline.74 In another large-dose Vitamin D trial, MS patients given 28,000‒280,000 IU weekly were found to have fewer active lesions during the 28-week long study.75 In light of the accumulating epidemiological and clinical evidence of the importance of vitamin D in this disease, supplementing the diet with vitamin D appears to be a low cost means to address this risk. Omega-3 Fatty Acids Omega-3 fatty acids (FAs) are polyunsaturated FAs which cannot be synthesized in humans and therefore must be provided via dietary sources. Both plant and animal foods are potential sources of omega-3 FAs. For example, linolenic acid, found in flaxseed, flaxseed oil, and preferably, fish and fish oils have very high levels of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). A small study looking at the effects of omega-3 FAs on MS found that immune cells from treated patients and healthy controls produced significantly fewer pro-inflammatory cytokines after three months of treatment with 6 grams of fish oil per day.76 One double-blind placebo-controlled study exists to date looking at the effect of omega-3 FAs on MS disease progression. In this study 312 patients were given either fish oil or olive oil placebo for two years. The results of this trial exhibited a trend toward decreased disease severity in the omega-3 FA group when compared with control.77 More recent studies have shown that MS patients given 10 grams of fish oil per day for three months exhibited significantly reduced levels of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), a factor correlated with disease progression, and also had greater concentrations of omega-3 FAs in their red blood cell membranes.78 Other work has shown that MS patients, while on a low-fat diet with omega-3 FA supplementation, experienced significantly reduced fatigue and lower relapse rates.79 Based upon clinical data and patient accounts, omega-3 FAs appear to be well tolerated and safe with no reports of adverse events. Linoleic Acid and Omega-6 Fatty Acids Linoleic acid is converted to gamma-linolenic acid (GLA), a beneficial omega-6 FA, after it is taken orally. However, this conversion is occasionally impaired, especially during inflammatory disease states.48,80 GLA has been shown to quell inflammation and research involving an animal model of MS has demonstrated that GLA administration significantly improved clinical outcomes when compared with control treatment.81 Some studies have shown significantly reduced relapse rates and disease progression scores, while others have found no differences between treatment and control groups.81-83 A closer look at data from these trials revealed that patients with lower levels of disability at the beginning of the trial exhibited a smaller increase in disability over the study period than did controls. In addition, linoleic acid was found to reduce the severity and duration of MS episodes in patients at all levels of disease severity.84 Selenium and Vitamin E Patients who have MS tend to have abnormally low levels of glutathione peroxidase, a powerful endogenous antioxidant.85,86 Researchers in Denmark conducted a small study in which patients with MS were given an antioxidant mixture containing about 2,000 mcg selenium, 2 grams vitamin C, and 480 mg vitamin E once daily for five weeks. Although glutathione peroxidase levels were initially lower in patients with MS than in normal control subjects, after five weeks of antioxidant therapy, levels of this antioxidant enzyme increased five-fold and reported side effects were minimal.85 ""[O]xidative stress plays an important role in pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis. This finding also suggests the importance of antioxidants in diet and therapy of MS patients.""87 N-Acetylcysteine An effective strategy for increasing the body's supply of the powerful antioxidant glutathione is taking the oral supplement N-acetylcysteine (NAC), a potent antioxidant that serves as a precursor to glutathione.48,88 NAC's potential benefit in the context of MS has been noted by some researchers.48,89 In a rodent MS model, NAC was able to diminish clinical symptoms and pathological evidence of CNS injury, and attenuate inflammation.90 Lipoic Acid Lipoic acid (LA) is a dietary supplement with antioxidant properties and has been studied specifically in MS. Reactive oxygen species (ROS), generated primarily by immune cells, are implicated as mediators of demyelination and nerve damage.91,92 Known to cross the blood-brain barrier, LA decreases the activity of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), which is thought to play a role in the pathogenesis of MS. It is believed that ICAM-1 and other adhesion molecules are responsible for allowing certain pro-inflammatory immune cells, like T-lymphocytes, to enter the CNS, paving the way for induction or exacerbation of inflammation and tissue damage.93-95 In an animal MS model, LA produced a significant reduction of demyelination and infiltration of the CNS by T lymphocytes.96-98 Other researchers have followed up on these studies. In a pilot clinical trial, 37 patients with MS were randomly assigned to receive various doses of LA (up to 2,400 mg/day) or placebo. After two weeks, patients were assessed for levels of ICAM-1 and tolerability of high-dose LA. In addition to being well tolerated by patients, LA treatment was associated with reduced ICAM-1 levels and reduced T-cell migration into the CNS.99 Coenzyme Q10 Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) is an antioxidant that is an essential part of healthy mitochondrial function and energy production with potential usefulness in treating MS. Decreased levels of CoQ10 are associated with many disease states, including heart disease, cancer, and neurodegenerative diseases.100,101 CoQ10 was low in patients with MS.102 Several clinical trials of CoQ10 have been performed in neurodegenerative disease, such as Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, Alzheimer disease, Friedreich's ataxia, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.103 CoQ10 is a powerful lipid-soluble antioxidant that is also capable of regenerating the antioxidant capacity of vitamin E in the body. Based upon clinical evidence, CoQ10 appears to be well tolerated and safe with potential usefulness in the management of MS. Vitamin B12 Some data suggest patients with MS have abnormally low levels of vitamin B12 in their cerebrospinal fluid, blood serum, or both.104 In fact, clinical vitamin B12 deficiency and MS share remarkably similar characteristics, occasionally rendering correct diagnosis difficult.105 Notably, vitamin B12 plays a key role in the generation of myelin and thus, for decades, integrative physicians have prescribed B12 injections for patients who have MS. Data suggest patients given vitamin B12 supplements have experienced clinical improvements in their symptoms.48 For example, in the United Kingdom, researchers investigated the effects of six months of vitamin B12 (1 mg/week injection) on 138 patients with MS. The researchers concluded that the clinical course of patients with MS improved after beginning vitamin B12 treatment.106 Ginkgo Biloba Ginkgo biloba extracts are primarily composed of flavonoids and terpenoids and have been reported to have properties that can influence neural activity and improve cognitive performance. While controlled trials of the effects of ginkgo biloba on cognitive function have generated inconsistent findings, more recent studies found encouraging results for patients with MS.107-109 In one study, patients received 120 mg of ginkgo biloba extract or placebo twice per day for 12 weeks. Those patients taking ginkgo biloba exhibited improved measures of attention and reported fewer difficulties with memory. Green Tea (Epigallocatechin-3-Gallate) Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) is one of many active ingredients of green tea that have been reported to have beneficial effects on the nervous and immune systems. In an animal study of MS, ECGC was found to prevent severity of clinical signs by decreasing inflammation and protecting nerve cells.110 According to animal research, green tea has the ability to significantly increase regulatory T cells which are critical to providing balance to the immune system and suppressing autoimmunity.111 Curcumin Curcumin is an active component of turmeric, a popular Indian spice. Laboratory studies have demonstrated that curcumin has potent anti-inflammatory effects.112 A research group carrying out animal studies has demonstrated exciting findings that curcumin treatment results in a significant reduction in disease severity and a reduction in duration of acute attacks.113 In a follow-up study, laboratory researchers found curcumin not only suppressed disease severity, but also was associated with reduction of levels of IL-17 a cytokine that has been directly implicated in the progression of MS.114 Biotin Biotin, a water-soluble B-complex vitamin, is sometimes referred to as vitamin B7. Biotin participates in biochemical reactions catalyzed by decarboxylase enzymes, supporting energy production and fatty acid and myelin synthesis.115,116 The Adequate Intake for biotin is 30 micrograms, and low-to-moderate amounts are common in multivitamin supplements.117,118 Biotin's role in neuron functioning is evidenced by its therapeutic effect in a rare genetic disease known as biotin-thiamine responsive basal ganglia disease.118 Children affected by this disease experience progressive neurological dysfunction, including speech and motor dysfunction, mental retardation, seizures, and possibly death. Early treatment with biotin and thiamine (vitamin B1) appears to prevent progression in most cases.119,120 More recently, researchers have been exploring biotin's potential benefits in patients with MS. In the first clinical trial to demonstrate the potential of high-dose biotin in MS therapy, 23 patients with progressive MS were treated with 100–300 mg biotin daily for an average of 9.2 months. While improvements were not seen for two to eight months after initiating biotin therapy—suggesting biotin may instigate a slow and progressive repair of MS-related nerve damage—vision improved in all four participants with MS-related optic nerve injury, and motor function and overall disability improved in 16 of 18 participants (89%) with prominent spinal cord involvement.116,118 In a randomized controlled trial, 154 patients with progressive MS received either 100 mg biotin three times daily or placebo for 12 months. Thirteen (12.6%) of the biotin-treated subjects versus none of the placebo subjects exhibited improvements in measures of MS-related disability after nine months that persisted through the end of the trial. In addition, only 4.2% of biotin-treated subjects compared with 13.6% of placebo subjects had progressively worsening disability scores at nine months. At the end of the 12 months, placebo subjects were switched to high-dose biotin, and overall stabilization of disability was seen in all subjects at a 24-month follow-up.121 Biotin levels in the cerebrospinal fluid of MS patients have been observed to be lower than those of healthy people, leading to speculation that low biotin availability may contribute to the pathology of MS.122 Although the mechanism of biotin's ability to prevent or repair nerve damage is unknown, biotin may prevent progressive demyelination by improving mitochondrial function, increasing brain energy production, supporting myelin production by increasing lipid synthesis, and affecting gene expression.118,123 Biotin is excreted through the urinary system, and high doses appear to be well tolerated in trials to date.118,124 However, high doses of biotin may interfere with certain lab tests, including thyroid function tests, leading to misdiagnosis of thyrotoxicosis.117,125,126 In addition, the possibility of teratogenicity has been suggested by animal research124; therefore, the safety of high-dose biotin in pregnancy is not established. Swank Diet Dr. Roy Swank first proposed a connection between increased consumption of saturated animal fat and the incidence of MS in 1950.127 He conducted a study which enrolled 208 patients with MS in the early 1950s, all of whom had experienced at least two acute relapses, and followed their progress over 34 years.128 In this study, patients maintained the now termed Swank diet, which consists of: less than 15 grams/day of saturated animal fat, 10‒15 grams/day of vegetable oil, 5 grams/day of cod liver oil, and one multivitamin. Long-term follow-up results from this study indicate that the patients adhering to the Swank diet experienced reduced MS disease activity and progression of disability when compared to patients that did not follow the regimen. While these results are encouraging, this trial is criticized for its lack of a proper control group and un-blinded design. Nevertheless, the Swank diet remains one of the most popular complementary approaches to treating MS. Swank Low-Fat Diet: Detailed Guidelines Saturated fat should remain less than 15 grams per day Unsaturated fat should be approximately 20‒50 grams per day No red meat should be consumed during the first year After the first year, a maximum of 3 oz. of red meat per week Dairy products must have 1% butterfat or less Processed foods containing saturated fat should not be eaten A source of omega-3, a multivitamin, and a mineral supplement are recommended daily Wheat, gluten or dairy product quantities are not restricted, unless they are foods which cause allergies or reactions. 9 Hormone Therapy Because women often experience improvement of MS symptoms while pregnant, hormone therapy using estrogen has been studied as a treatment for the disease. In human studies, estriol treatment (8 mg/day) in nonpregnant women with MS was associated with reduced lesion numbers and lesion volumes and when treatment ceased, these values returned to levels observed before treatment.37 Patients given estriol also had enhanced cognitive function. With respect to immune studies, estriol was associated with reduced pro-inflammatory and increased anti-inflammatory cytokine production and these changes correlated well with the reduced formation of lesions.39 Other studies have shown that male MS patients treated with 10 mg of testosterone exhibited improved cognitive performance and reduced brain atrophy, although MRI data showed no change in lesion formation.129 In another similar study, testosterone treatment in males was associated with reduced production of inflammatory cytokines and increased production of neuroprotective factors.130 There is currently debate among researchers about the role of hormones with MS and how that relationship may be exploited as a means of therapy. Some studies argue for hormone replacement as a new therapeutic approach.131 More information can be found in Life Extension's ""Male Hormone Restoration"" and ""Female Hormone Restoration"" protocols.

Quality of life (QoL) has gained increasing importance in multiple sclerosis (MS). We aimed to assess QoL and potentially associated factors such as depression, sexual dysfunction and work absenteeism in patients starting glatiramer acetate (GA) in clinical practice. A prospective cohort study carried out in relapsing-remitting MS patients starting GA as first-line treatment. Patient information on QoL (Multiple Sclerosis Quality of Life-54 [MSQoL-54]), depression (Beck Depression Inventory), sexual dysfunction (Multiple Sclerosis Intimacy and Sexuality Questionnaire-19) and work absenteeism was assessed from starting GA to week 96. Ninety-eight evaluable patients were enrolled in the study (mean age, 38.0 ± 8.4 years; female, 69.4%; mean MS duration, 42.6 ± 62.9 months; annual relapse rate since MS diagnosis, 0.4), and followed up at weeks 24 (n=96), 48 (n=94), 72 (n=89) and 96 (n=80). Patient QoL was preserved during the study, with improvements on the MSQoL-54 subscales of change in health (p<0.05) and health distress (p<0.05). Depression, primary and secondary sexual dysfunction remained stable, but the number of patients with tertiary sexual dysfunction decreased at week 96 (p<0.05). Work absenteeism also decreased over the study (p<0.01). Depression, sexual dysfunction and work absenteeism affected MSQoL-54 physical and mental health composites (p<0.05). QoL of our patients was preserved during the 96-week administration of GA. Though depression, sexual dysfunction and work absenteeism impair patient QoL, they remained stable or even improved during the study. Absenteeism; Depression; Glatiramer acetate; Quality of life; Multiple sclerosis; Sexual dysfunction Quality of life assessment in patients with has gained increasing importance as it encompasses all aspects of patients lives that may be affected by the disease. Though patients quality of life worsens as multiple sclerosis progresses and physical function deteriorates, it depends not only on the disability caused by physical limitations but also on their emotional status, which may also affect the perception of wellbeing and quality of life [-]. In this scenario, depression has been shown to have a notable impact on quality of life, and is considered a significant and independent predictor of impaired quality of life [-]. Sexual dysfunction is another common and often underestimated clinical symptom of multiple sclerosis that, along with its emotional , has been shown to affect patients quality of life [,]. The information available on the impact of sexual dysfunction on quality of life, however, is still limited. The consequences of multiple sclerosis often negatively affect patients working life and may even lead to permanent unemployment []. This unemployment represents one of the factors that most modifies patients way of living as a result of its influence on their usual activities or interests and its impact on increasing emotional distress [], while sustaining employment has been shown to be associated with improved quality of life [,]. First-line disease-modifying drugs for relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis including (INFb)-1a, INFb-1b and glatiramer acetate have been shown to improve the course of the disease. However, their effect on patients quality of life has not yet been fully clarified. Indeed, the information available on INFb's effect on quality of life is controversial, ranging from some benefit [] to absence of effect [-] or even to quality of life detriment []. The effect of glatiramer acetate treatment on quality of life has not been well assessed, and improvements in quality of life have been reported in treatment-naïve patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis six months after starting GA treatment that were sustained for another six months []. In light of the above, this study aimed to expand the information available on quality of life and potentially associated factors such as depression, and work absenteeism in patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis starting glatiramer acetate as first-line treatment in clinical practice. This study was conducted in the Departments of at 37 Spanish hospitals in accordance with the World Medical Association Declaration of Helsinki, all its amendments and national regulations. The study was approved by the ethic committee of Hospital Donostia (San Sebastián, Spain) and all patients gave their written informed consent. Between November 2009 and November 2010, all patients meeting selection criteria who agreed to participate in the study were consecutively recruited into the study. Inclusion criteria were patients aged 18 to 60 years, with a diagnosis of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis, no previous treatment for multiple sclerosis and a score of 5.5 or less on the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS). Patients were to start (Copaxone®, Teva Pharmaceuticals Ltd., London, United Kingdom) for multiple sclerosis treatment and must not have had any cognitive impairment that precluded understanding of the patients information sheet and informed consent form. This was a prospective cohort study conducted in patients with -remitting multiple sclerosis receiving glatiramer acetate treatment for multiple sclerosis and followed-up for two years according to clinical practice. All treatments were administered from commercial sources and according to routine clinical practice. No restrictions regarding patients treatment were specified in the study protocol. Patients information was retrieved from their medical charts at the start of glatiramer acetate treatment (baseline) and at weeks 24, 48, 72 and 96. The data retrieved at these visits included , medical history of multiple sclerosis, patients disability according to the EDSS [], quality of life measured according to scores on the Multiple Sclerosis Quality of Live-54 (MSQoL-54) questionnaire [,], depression according to scores on the 21-item Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) [,], sexual disfunction according to the Multiple Sclerosis Intimacy and Sexuality Questionnaire-19 (MSISQ-19), [,] and work absenteeism related to multiple sclerosis according to the occurrence of work absenteeism, the number of working days missed and the causes of work absenteeism. EDSS scores, which range from 0 (normal neurological status) to 10 (death from multiple sclerosis), were obtained by the same researcher in a given patient. The MSQoL-54 questionnaire consists of 54 items distributed in 12 multiple-item scales and two single-item scales, including questions from the Short Form 36-Item Health Survey as a generic core measure and 18 additional items specific for multiple sclerosis that assess health , sexual function, overall quality of life, cognitive function and energy. Physical and mental health composite scores are calculated as a simplified two-dimension solution to MSQoL-54 questionnaire. The composites scores range from 0 (poor health) to 100 (optimal health). The BDI is composed of 21 categories of symptoms and attitudes which describe a specific behavioral manifestation of depression and consist of a graded series of four to five self-evaluative statements. Numerical values are assigned for each statement from 0 (neutral) to 3 (maximal severity) indicating the degree of severity of the manifestations of depression. Total scores range from 0 to 63, where higher scores indicate worse depressive states. Patients may also be categorized as having ups and downs considered normal if their BDI scores were 10 or less, as having mild mood disturbance if their BDI scores were between 11 and 16, as having borderline clinical depression if their BDI scores were between 17 and 20, as having moderate depression if their BDI scores were between 21 and 30, as having severe depression if their BDI scores were between 31 and 40 and as having extreme depression if their BDI scores were higher than 40. The cut-off value of at least 17 points was established as suggestive of the presence of depression. The MSISQ-19 consists of 19 items assessing the perceived influence of multiple sclerosis symptoms on sexual activity and satisfaction. Scores on the MSISQ-19 show the presence of primary, secondary and tertiary sexual dysfunction. Primary sexual dysfunction occurs as a result of neurologic changes related to multiple sclerosis that directly affect sexual feelings and/or sexual response, secondary sexual dysfunction refers to physical changes related to multiple sclerosis that affect the sexual response indirectly and tertiary sexual dysfunction refers to psychological, emotional, social and cultural aspects of multiple sclerosis that impact upon sexuality. The primary efficacy endpoint was the change in patients quality of life during the 96-week study period, measured according to scores on the physical and mental health composites of the MSQoL-54 questionnaire. Sample size was calculated to fulfill the primary objective of the study. At the time of study design, the only data available on the impact of multiple sclerosis therapy on quality of life measured by the MSQoL-54 questionnaire was reported by Simone et al., who found that multiple sclerosis patients followed up for two years experienced a decrease of six or more points in 80% of MSQoL-45 measurements (dimensions and summary composite scores), with an standard deviation of approximately 20 points []. Taking into account these data, an alpha risk of 0.05 and a beta risk of 0.20 in a two-sided analysis, the number of evaluable patients needed to be enrolled into the study to detect a difference of six or more points in MSQoL-54 scores would be of 92 patients; considering a percentage of missing data of 20% or lower, e.g. due to non-evaluable patients, the total sample size would be of 110 patients. Analysis of the primary endpoint included the calculation of mean scores and standard deviations (SD) of both physical and mental health composites of MSQoL-54 questionnaire throughout the study. Comparison of these scores during the study was performed using the repeated measures general linear model. Comparison of scores on the MSQoL-54 questionnaire at baseline with those reported at week 24, 48, 72 and 96 were also performed using paired t-tests. The secondary endpoints included assessment of depression, sexual dysfunction and work absenteeism at baseline. Other secondary endpoints were the change in depression, sexual dysfunction and work absenteeism during the study and their impact on patients quality of life. The distribution of patients according to the following categories of the BDI was calculated as the frequency and valid percentage in each study visit: ups and downs considered normal (BDI scores, =10), mild mood disturbance (BDI scores, 11-16), borderline clinical depression (BDI scores, 17-20), moderate depression (BDI scores, 21-30), severe depression (BDI scores, 31-40) and extreme depression (BDI scores, >40). The overall frequency of patients with depression, which was defined as a BDI score =17, was also calculated. Comparison of mean BDI scores and the proportion of patients within the above categories during the study was performed using paired t-tests and McNemars tests, respectively. The impact of depression on patients quality of life was assessed comparing the scores on the physical and mental health composites of MSQoL-54 questionnaire reported by patients with those without depression using t-tests or Mann-Whitney tests. The frequencies and valid percentages of patients with primary, secondary and tertiary sexual dysfunction according to MSISQ-19 scores were calculated in each study visit. The overall frequency of sexual dysfunction in each study visit was also assessed according to patients with at least one of these categories (primary, secondary or tertiary sexual dysfunction). Changes during the study were assessed using McNemars tests. The impact of sexual dysfunction on patients quality of life was assessed comparing the scores on the physical and mental health composites of MSQoL-54 questionnaire between patients without sexual dysfunction and those with any kind of sexual dysfunction by using Mann-Whitney tests. Work absenteeism related to multiple sclerosis was assessed according to the frequency and valid percentage of patients missing at least one day from work, the mean (SD) number of working days missed and the causes for work absenteeism. Changes in the frequency of patients absent from work and the number of working days missed during the study were assessed using McNemars tests and Wilcoxon tests, respectively. The impact of work absenteeism on patients quality of life was assessed by comparing the scores on the physical and mental health composites of the MSQoL-54 questionnaire in patients at least one day absent from work versus those with no day absent from work using Mann-Whitney tests. A correction method for multiple testing was not performed in the statistical analysis for the present study due to the controversy about its use in observational studies leading to potential risks and errors [,]. Further information on this subject is provided in Appendix 1. Missing data were not considered in the analyses and a significance level of 0.05 was used for statistical testing. The statistical analyses were performed with the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) version 17.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, Illinois, USA). A total of 101 patients agreed to participate in the study, three of whom were excluded from the analysis due to insufficient available data. Therefore, the evaluable population comprised a total of 98 patients, whose characteristics are described in Table 1. Patients disposition during the study is shown in Figure 1. When paired comparisons were performed to assess differences in EDSS scores from baseline, it was shown that the mean EDSS scores remained stable throughout the study period but with a slight tendency to improvement at week 96 (mean [SD], 1.1 [0.3] versus 1.0 [0.2], p=0.058). In addition, the proportion of patients with minimal disability slightly increased and the proportion of patients with moderate disability that did not need any technical aid slightly decreased, though not significantly, reaching 95.0% (n=76) and 5.0% (n=4) of patients, respectively, at week 96. Even though scores on the MSQoL-54 questionnaire improved slightly during the 96-week study period, the results obtained from the repeated measures general linear model showed that statistically significant differences were not attained in either the physical or mental health composites (Figure 3). Similarly, comparison of scores on the physical and mental health composites between baseline and weeks 24, 48, 72 and 96 only showed statistically significant differences in the mental health composite at week 72, in which the scores were significantly higher than baseline (mean [SD], 70.6 [15.3] versus 73.9 [15.9], p<0.05; Figure 4). In addition, consistent statistically significant improvements from baseline to weeks 24, 48, 72 and 96 were observed in the MSQoL-54 subscales of change in health and health distress (Figure 4). A total of 65 (66.3%) patients reported experiencing ups and downs considered normal according to the BDI at baseline, while 20 (20.4%) patients showed mild mood disturbance, 10 (10.2%) borderline clinical depression and 3 (3.1%) patients moderate depression. Therefore, a total of 13 (13.3%) patients showed overall depression (Table 2). No significant differences were found in either the mean BDI scores or the distribution of patients among the BDI categories throughout the study. The analysis of the impact of depression on patients quality of life showed that patients with depression reported worse scores on both physical and mental health composites of the MSQoL-54 questionnaire throughout the study period (Figure 5a). Multiple sclerosis intimacy and sexuality questionnaire-19 The overall frequency of patients with baseline sexual dysfunction according to MSISQ-19 scores reached 43 (45.3%) patients, and remained stable throughout the 96-week study period. When the type of sexual dysfunction according to MSISQ-19 was analyzed at baseline, primary sexual dysfunction was found in 31 (32.6%) patients, secondary sexual dysfunction in 21 (22.1%) patients and tertiary sexual dysfunction in 17 (17.9%) patients (Table 2). Distribution of patients with primary and secondary sexual dysfunction did not significantly change from baseline to weeks 24, 48, 72 or 96. However, the proportion of patients with tertiary sexual dysfunction tended to decrease from baseline to week 72 (p=0.057), reaching statistically significance at week 96 (p<0.05). The presence of sexual dysfunction was shown to worsen patients quality of life, as patients with sexual dysfunction reported lower scores on the physical and mental health composites of the MSQoL-54 questionnaire during the whole study period (Figure 5b). *p<0.001; p<0.005; p<0.01; §p<0.05. D: depression; MHC: mental health composite; ND: no depression; NSD: no sexual dysfunction; NWA: no work absenteeism; PHC: physical health composite; SD: sexual dysfunction; WA: work absenteeism. At baseline, 46 (52.9%) patients reported having missed at least one day from work in the previous six months due to multiple sclerosis. The mean (SD) number of working days missed was 45.8 (56.5) days and the main reasons for work absenteeism were clinical signs of multiple sclerosis and disease relapses (Table 2). When work absenteeism was analyzed over the whole study, statistically significant decreases from baseline were observed in the proportion of patients missing at least one day from work at week 24 (p<0.01), week 48 (p<0.001), week 72 (p<0.01) and week 96 (p<0.01). Even though the number of working days missed from work decreased from baseline, statistically significant differences were only reached at week 48 (p<0.05). Work absenteeism was associated with patients quality of life during the 96-week study period, as patients absent from work reported worse scores on both the physical and mental health composites of the MSQoL-54 questionnaire at baseline, week 24, week 48, week 72 and week 96 (Figure 5c). This prospective cohort study showed that the quality of life of our population of patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis was preserved during the 96-week administration of glatiramer acetate under clinical practice conditions. Although glatiramer acetate treatment may have played a role in slowing down worsening of multiple sclerosis, this finding must be considered with caution since our patient population had intrinsically low disease activity in terms of EDSS scores and annual relapse rate. However, other studies also showed low disease activity in patients treated under clinical practice conditions [,], and another reported early gain in quality of life measured by the Leeds Multiple Sclerosis Quality of Life scale in patients receiving glatiramer acetate in daily practice []. A protective effect on quality of life of other first-line treatments for multiple sclerosis such as IFNb has also been previously suggested in patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis[], whose quality of life measured by the MSQoL-54, Short Form 36-Item Health Survey and Functional Assessment of Multiple Sclerosis questionnaires remained stable for up to three years [-]. However, though some improvements in the physical health composite of the MSQoL-54 questionnaire have been reported after two years of treatment with IFNb [], detriments in patients quality of life have also been reported during the same duration of IFNb treatment, mainly as a result of worsening of the mental health composite []. In our study, disability, depression, primary sexual dysfunction and secondary sexual dysfunction were observed to remain stable during the study period, while tertiary sexual dysfunction and work absenteeism due to multiple sclerosis were significantly improved at week 96. Maintenance of disability even during 15 years of glatiramer acetate administration has been previously reported, showing a mean EDSS change of 0.6 points from the start of treatment []. However, since the EDSS is highly dependent on ambulation and does not provide information on parameters associated with patients wellbeing [], other parameters that might be potentially associated with patients wellbeing needed to be assessed. Indeed, our results support the influence of depression, sexual dysfunction and work absenteeism on the quality of life of patients with relapsing remitting-multiple sclerosis. These results are in line with previous studies reporting that multiple sclerosis patients with lifetime major depression show lower quality of life measured by the MSQoL-54 questionnaire, mainly in terms of energy, mental health, cognitive function, general quality of life, and emotional role limitations []. Depression measured according to the BDI or the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression has been reported to be associated with both physical and mental health composites of the MSQoL-54 questionnaire [-], regardless of the disease-related physical disability and disease type []. Depression has been claimed to be a significant independent predictor of impaired patient quality of life measured using the MSQoL-54 and Functional Assessment of Multiple Sclerosis questionnaires [-]. Patients with sexual dysfunction have also been shown to have poorer quality of life, with significantly lower scores on all scales of the Short Form 36-Item Health Survey [] and on all of scales of the MSQoL-54 questionnaire except for pain and cognitive function []. Similar detriments in quality of life were observed in unemployed versus unemployed patients, who had lower scores on most dimensions of the MSQoL-54 questionnaire [,], suggesting the importance of sustained employment after the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis []. Though the low disease activity of our study patient population does not allow conclusions to be drawn about the effect of glatiramer acetate, decreased work absenteeism has previously been reported in patients receiving this agent [,]. In addition, there is no evidence that glatiramer acetate aggravates depression and it might even induce an antidepressant effect through its neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory activity []. Indeed, switching to glatiramer acetate has been recommended when a depressive episode is confirmed in patients receiving INFb []. Moreover, recently published data on patients switching from IFNb to glatiramer acetate [], and preliminary results from ongoing studies in patients switching to glatiramer acetate [,] showed patients quality of life remained stable or even improved. The authors acknowledge that although observational studies provide valuable information on treatments administered in clinical practice, their limitations should be considered when interpreting the results. The open-label study design, the absence of a comparator group and the potential regression to the mean effect should also be taken into account. In addition, data on other factors that might have influenced patients quality of life such as relapses, fatigue and treatment-related adverse events were not retrieved, and longer follow-up might have been needed for potential differences to become evident. The low disease activity of the study patient population precluded drawing conclusions about the effect of glatiramer acetate and may limit the representativeness of the study findings. Though caution is advisable when interpreting the study results, we consider that they still provide helpful information to physicians when treating multiple sclerosis in clinical practice. In conclusion, the study results show that the quality of life of our population of patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis was preserved during the 96-week administration of glatiramer acetate in clinical practice conditions. Depression, sexual dysfunction and work absenteeism due to multiple sclerosis are factors that significantly impair patients quality of life. However, our study shows stable disability, depression and primary/secondary sexual dysfunction as well as improved tertiary sexual dysfunction and work absenteeism. The study findings should be interpreted with caution based on the low disease activity of the patient population. Further research is still needed to confirm the effect of glatiramer acetate, and to increase knowledge of other potentially associated factors, the long-term effect of multiple sclerosis therapies and the impact of the switch to glatiramer acetate on patients quality of life. There is currently no unanimity about the use of multiple test corrections (methods such as those of Bonferroni, Holm, Benjamini, etc.). In general, these methods reduce the probability of making type I errors, but they increase the probability of making type II errors. It seems cautious to prioritize minimizing the probability of type I errors over type II errors in studies where: several treatments are compared, probabilistic independence is expected between analysis groups and/or variables that would give rise to multiple tests, results have confirmatory implications for practical use. Methods of correcting for multiple testing provide solutions for these situations. However, if any of the above conditions are not a priority or are not applicable to the study, it would be cautious to minimize the probability of making a type II error rather than a type I error. Using multiple test corrections would minimize type I errors, but it would also increase the probability of type II errors, which would imply that differences that are really related to the phenomena under study would not be detected. In the present study, the effect of only one treatment was assessed during the study follow-up, and its use was supported by certain evidence of effectiveness. Therefore, it appears reasonable to assume the overall absence of probabilistic independence in the measurements of variables of patients included in the study. Consequently, the authors decided to prioritize the avoidance of increasing the probability of committing type II errors. For readers who may be interested in the effect of multiple test corrections, Bonferroni correction would result in a p-value that was estimated to be of 0.0003 for the analyses carried out in this study. The authors would also like to explain that significant p-values of the study analyses were classified to be shown in the article as p<0.05, p<0.01, p<0.005 or p<0.001. The data included in this appendix is intended to provide the reader interested in knowing more about multiple test corrections with some information to interpret the study results based on the multiple test correction approach used. Finally, the authors would like to advise the reader that the study conclusions should not be considered as definitive. As mentioned in the article, the study findings should be interpreted with caution and further research is still needed to confirm them.
