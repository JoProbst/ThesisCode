Breastmilk: The gift that keeps on giving… Babies who were exclusively breastfed have less than half the risk of eczema as teenagers than those that were not Sunday, November 19, 2017 by: Tags: , , , , , , , , () Adding to the wealth of evidence that prove the benefits of beast milk, a new study finds that breastfeeding could lower the risk of eczema in children by half, as reported by the A team of researchers from King’s College London, Harvard University, University of Bristol, and McGill University assessed whether prolonged and exclusive breastfeeding lowered the risk of asthma, atopic eczema, and low lung function in adolescence. In the study, published in the (JAMA) , they analyzed data from a total of 13,557 teenagers aged 16 from Belarus, all of whom were enrolled in the (PROBIT). The PROBIT study initially recruited 17,046 mothers and their newborn babies from June 1996 to December 1997. The researchers studied 31 maternity hospitals and one outpatient clinic associated to each hospital. These participating institutions were randomly assigned to either take part in a breastfeeding program or not. Breastfeeding programs trained nurses, midwives, and doctors to promote and support mothers to breastfeed their babies. The researchers then followed up with the babies until they reached adolescence to determine the effect of supported breastfeeding to their lung function, asthma, and eczema. The participants were tasked to answer surveys on the three health issues. In addition, the researchers conducted a skin examination for eczema, and a breath examination for lung health. “PROBIT, the largest randomized trial ever carried out in the area of human lactation, continues to yield scientifically and clinically important information more than two decades after its inception,” said Michael Kramer of McGill’s Faculty of Medicine and the Research Institute of the McGill University Health Centre (RI-MUHC), the lead investigator on the PROBIT study. The findings of the study revealed that children whose mothers received support to breastfeed exclusively for a sustained time from birth had a 54 percent lower risk of eczema at the age of 16. However, there was no association between breastfeeding and the risk of asthma. Eczema is a skin condition that causes the skin to be itchy, dry, cracked, sore, and red. About one in every five children and one in 10 adults suffer from eczema. “The [] WHO recommends between four and six months of exclusive breastfeeding to aid prevention of allergy and associated illnesses. Our findings add further weight to the importance of campaigns like the (BFHI), which is tackling low rates of breastfeeding globally,” Carsten Flohr, lead author of the study, explained. Moms who breastfeed longer will become more attentive mothers Breastfeeding does not only benefit the babies, but also the mothers. A study revealed that women who breastfeed for longer will continuously become more attentive mothers up to 10 years, as reported by . (Related: .) Researchers from Boise State University examined data from 1,272 families who took part in the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development’s Study of Early Child Care. They measured maternal sensitivity by the timing of a mother’s responsiveness to her child, her emotional tone, how flexible her behavior was, and her ability to recognize her child’s cues by conducting interviews and videotaping participating families in the homes until the child turned 11 years old. “It was surprising to us that breastfeeding duration predicted change over time in maternal sensitivity,” said Jennifer Weaver, lead author of the study. The study, which was published by the , suggested that the time spent breastfeeding helps develop the relationship of the child and mother. “Ultimately, I do hope that we will see breastfeeding examined more closely as a parenting factor, not just as a health consideration, to allow us to more fully understand the role that breastfeeding plays in family life,” Weaver expressed.

You haven't been near poison ivy in weeks, you aren't allergic to latex and you don't have allergies that give you hives -- at least, you don't think you do. So what's that red patch of itchy dry skin? It could be a type of eczema. An estimated 15 million Americans are affected by it [source: ]. The name eczema is actually an all-encompassing title for a range of that produce the same itching and redness, the most common of which is called atopic dermatitis (or atopic eczema). Atopic dermatitis is the most common type of eczema found in infants and children under the age of two. In fact, about 10 to 20 percent of infants have eczema [source: ]. The disease occurs less frequently in adults, but they can still be affected through periodical flare-ups that are triggered by different allergic reactions or reactions to skin irritants. The symptoms of atopic dermatitis are overshadowed by one major characteristic -- itchiness. Atopic dermatitis is almost always itchy; it can be itchy even before a rash appears, and scratching can both cause and worsen the rash. In babies, eczema most often occurs on the face, arms, legs, scalp and neck. In children and adults, it usually shows up in the folds of elbows and knees. Skin affected by eczema can appear , thickened and scaly. people who have the condition may have reddish patches of skin that turn brown, while dark-skinned people can experience changes in pigment that either darken or lighten the affected skin [source: ]. Other diseases grouped under the label of eczema include: Contact dermatitis, which is caused by the skin being exposed to irritants or allergens Nummular dermatitis, which consists of coin-sized patches of affected skin and is usually found in adults Hand eczema, which causes a rash on the hands Stasis dermatitis, which appears on the calves, ankles and feet of people who have poor blood circulation Seborrheic dermatitis, which affects the scalp and may cause dandruff in adults Similar factors cause these types of eczema, and you treat most of them in similar ways. Read on to find out more about what can cause those itchy red patches. As with many skin conditions, the exact causes of eczema are unknown, although experts believe that it may be caused by the immune system's overactive response to certain triggers [source: ]. Asthma and hay fever are other atopic diseases, so people with a family history of these conditions are likely to be affected by atopic dermatitis. Though the scientific cause of eczema is unknown, it's fairly easy to identify some of the more common causes of eczema flare-ups in adults. Substances that cause burning, itching or redness are often sources of flare-ups. Common irritants include rough materials such as wool, household products such as soap or detergent, or fumes from paint or cigarettes. It really depends on what your immune system responds to. Allergens like animal dander and dust mites can also spark a flare-up. If you're allergic to certain types of food, you may have a short bout of eczema. However, it can be difficult to pinpoint exactly which food it is that's causing the outbreaks. To find out what might trigger your eczema, see your doctor. A doctor can do a skin test, where he or she touches the skin with the possible allergens and observes the reaction, or conduct blood work to find what you're allergic to, if anything. Both of these tests may have false positive reactions, so they are not always reliable [source: ]. Exposing your skin to certain environmental conditions may also result in flare-ups. Sudden changes in temperature or humidity, sweating, upper respiratory infections and colds commonly trigger eczema. And though stress and emotional disorders don't cause eczema, they can worsen its effects. Although there is no cure for eczema, it is not contagious, so don't worry about contracting it from or giving it to others [source: ]. To find out how to treat eczema symptoms and what to do if your skin becomes infected, keep reading. The most common form of eczema is called atopic dermatitis because it is closely related to asthma and hay fever. Together, the three conditions are called ""the atopic triad"" [source: ]. According to one study, 35 percent of adults who had atopic dermatitis as children no longer had the skin condition when they got older, but had asthma or hay fever, 20 percent still had atopic dermatitis, and 15 percent had both atopic dermatitis and asthma or hay fever. Weeping eczema refers to eczema that has worsened and resulted in an infection, which consists of pus-filled blisters that are wet and oozing -- basically, they ""weep"" [source: ]. Infections like this happen most often when you continually scratch the itchy areas of your skin. For this reason, weeping eczema is more common in children, because it can be more difficult to prevent them from scratching. If your child has eczema, watch him carefully to make sure that he is not scratching the areas of his skin that have eczema. The blister-produced ooze that gives weeping eczema its name is usually golden in color and dries to become a crusty layer on the skin's surface [source: ]. Cold compresses and wet cloths may help soothe the itching and pain, but don't rub the affected skin with them, because scratching will only worsen the infection. Other signs of infection include extreme redness, cold sores and fever blisters. Eczema, if scratched enough, can become infected with bacteria (most commonly a staphylococcus or ""staph"" infection) that live happily and harmlessly on the surface of your skin. Once staph gets through the barrier of your dermis, then it can cause problems. At the sign of infection, consult your doctor, and he or she can prescribe either topical or oral antibiotics that will heal the infected areas. Fortunately, not all eczema becomes infected. To find out how to treat eczema that hasn't been infected, read on. A skin condition that is commonly confused with eczema, impetigo is most prevalent in children but it can also occur in adults in conjunction with eczema [source: ]. The red bumps or blisters that signify impetigo most often appear on the face, near the nose or mouth. Impetigo can be cured with antibiotics that your doctor prescribes. Unlike eczema, it is contagious, so be sure to wash infected areas carefully and frequently to prevent spreading. Since scratching the affected areas can lead to infection, the goal in treating atopic dermatitis is to stop the itch and prevent future outbreaks [source: ]. At home, try applying lotions and to your skin while it is damp (after taking a shower or bath). Your skin will retain moisture, which helps soothe itching, as does a cold compress. You can also use an over-the-counter hydrocortisone cream to tone down the itch. If you visit your doctor, he or she can prescribe medications with topical corticosteriods that will help to reduce inflammation. In severe cases, doctors may prescribe corticosteroids in pill form instead of topical creams. You can also take antihistamines to reduce itching or talk to your doctor about chemical treatments that use tar to stop itching and irritation. In addition, some eczema patients use phototherapy treatments, which consist of ultraviolet (UV) light that targets areas affected by atopic dermatitis [source: ]. Your treatment will typically depend on comfort, cost and convenience. The second task is prevention. If you know that you are prone to flare-ups, take steps to prevent them. your skin regularly, avoid sudden changes in temperature or humidity, and try to stay dry and cool. Stay away from scratchy materials, harsh soaps and detergents, and solvents. Find ways to reduce stress, and know that exposure to environmental factors such as pollen, mold, dust mites, animal saliva and pet dander can cause flare-ups [source: ]. And most importantly -- even though we've said it a few times already, it bears repeating -- don't scratch! Eczema is a fairly treatable condition but it can only get worse if you scratch it. So, after you've applied moisturizer, break out the potholders or mittens and keep your mitts off the itchy bits. For more information about eczema, look over the Web sites listed on the next page. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved two topical drugs that affect the immune system and treat eczema. They are called topical immunomodulators, or TIMs. The first is pimecrolimus (formerly known as Elidel) and the second is tacrolimus (also known as Protopic and Prograf); both drugs have been labeled with the ""black box warning"" of the FDA because they have risks related to cancer. Using these drugs is only recommended for moderate to severe cases of eczema, and only for short-term use after other treatments have failed. These prescriptions should not be given to anyone under two years of age [source: ]. Aetna InteliHealth. ""Eczema."" March 28, 2007.

c941f09a-4d2d-411f-8f08-c66c13a9fa2c,"What to Do When You Think You Have Contact Dermatitis on Your Face — Got a nasty rash on your face? A big, irritating splotch is never fun, especially when it’s on full display. So, what the heck are you dealing with and how can you make it go away ASAP? Red, itchy face rashes are often cases of — rashes caused by direct contact with a substance that’s irritating or that triggers an allergic reaction. Getting contact dermatitis on your face isn’t unusual, and it’s not dangerous or contagious either. It’s also, for the most part, easy to treat and prevent. Here’s a handy guide to getting that pretty face back to normal. Contact dermatitis is a red, eczema-like, itchy rash that can develop when your skin comes in contact with an irritating substance or allergen. You can get contact dermatitis on your face or anywhere else on your body. Sometimes the rash will form right away, but often, it develops after a few hours, or sometimes a few days. There are two types of contact dermatitis that can occur on your face: happens when your skin comes in contact with an irritating substance — anything from bleach, to pepper spray, to a harsh soap or cleaning agent. occurs when your skin has an allergic reaction to a foreign substance, like nickel, or poison ivy. The classic sign of contact dermatitis on your face is a red, eczema-like, itchy rash. You might experience other symptoms too, depending on what caused the rash and how severe your reaction is. Contact dermatitis on your face (or elsewhere) might not look great, but it’s rarely something to worry about and is usually easy to treat. Still, face rashes have the potential to affect your eyes, nasal passages, or mouth. So, it’s a good idea to call your doctor as soon as you notice the rash, even if it seems mild. They can check it out and determine the best way to treat the rash. And hopefully, keep it from coming back. Contact dermatitis on your face can often be treated at home. But before taking measures into your own hands, it’s a good idea to have your doctor examine the rash. They’ll be able to gauge the rash’s severity and recommend the best way to ease your discomfort and get rid of the redness. Sometimes contact dermatitis on your face will go away on its own within 2 to 3 weeks just by avoiding the culprit substance and repairing the skin. But there are also options that can help you to quickly feel better in the meantime: Give your tender skin a break by going bare-faced until the rash clears up. The one exception to the no-product rule? Apply a thick layer of a hypoallergenic cream (i.e. CeraVe or Vanicream) to stave off dryness, repair the skin, and help prevent further inflammation. Vaseline is also an option, but it has the potential to cause acne. As much as possible, to try protect your skin from cold, dry air, or hot sun. Pull a soft scarf up over your cheeks in the winter or wear a wide-brimmed hat in the summer. These may ease inflammation and sooth your skin. It’ll further irritate the rash and slow your healing. And if you break the skin, it ups the chance for infection. Depending on your rash, your doctor might recommend an over-the-counter (OTC) corticosteroid cream or an oral antihistamine like Benadryl to help with the itching. Usually steering clear of the allergic or irritating substance is enough to keep contact dermatitis on your face from coming back. If you’re having trouble pinpointing the cause of the rash, try keeping a log. Note the date of your flare-up, the products you used that day, plus anything unusual that might’ve irritated your skin (Was it especially cold and windy outside? Did you change your jewelry?). Having a record should help you suss out the suspect. …could be the name of a Nancy Drew book, but really we’re just summarizing how difficult it can be to figure out what triggered your face rash. A number of different irritants or allergens could be to blame. A rash can show up the first time you’re exposed to a substance, like when you use a new skin care product. Other times, you might not show symptoms until you’ve been exposed to a substance repeatedly. A person could be using a product for months or years without any irritation, and then suddenly BAM, allergic contact dermatitis occurs. Either way, when the skin on your face doesn’t like a substance it’s been exposed to, it gets inflamed. And it’s that inflammation that causes the redness, itchiness, and other unpleasant side effects. So, what kinds of things can trigger a rash on your face? Below are some of the most common culprits. harsh chemicals like solvents, rubbing alcohol, or bleach excessive washing (water is an irritant… who knew!) personal care or hair products containing strong perfumes, preservatives, or detergents Very harsh substances — think bleach — could cause a rash almost immediately after touching your skin. But in many cases, a rash might not pop up for 2 or 3 days after exposure. Contact dermatitis on your face isn’t usually serious. But you should always loop your healthcare provider in, even if the rash seems mild. Allergic contact dermatitis and irritant contact dermatitis are also two different disorders. Rashes can form immediately or within a few days of coming in contact with the culprit substance. If you’re not sure what caused the rash, keeping a log can help. Avoiding the substance (allergen in allergic contact dermatitis, and irritant in irritant contact dermatitis) is key for getting the rash to go away. You can speed up the process and ease your discomfort by skipping makeup and other products, applying a hypoallergenic topical cream, and keeping your skin shielded from the elements. — Smiling Through the Sadness?

9cd46d2e-fb82-4976-813f-c8ad4b9caeaa,"Yep, You Can Get Eczema on Your Boobs — Here's How to Heal Those Tatas — Any part of your skin can get eczema. That includes your boobs. Itchy boob bumps aren’t a lot of fun, but breast eczema is fairly common and usually easy to treat. Before you start to worry about irritated areolas, here are some ways to heal those Grand Tetons. (the most common form of eczema) usually makes the skin red and sometimes bumpy. But the main symptom is itching. Eczema itches a lot and breczema (the nickname we’re giving breast eczema) is no exception. Often, eczema will break out around the nipple, between the breasts, or under the boobs. Though again, eczema can pop up wherever you have skin, so it can make itself at home anywhere on your girls. In addition to redness, your skin may also feel really dry and look a little scaly. Other times the rash can look and feel like you have patches of thick skin. Or, if you’re really lucky, you might have a bumpy rash that leaks and crusts over. The joy of atopic dermatitis, right? As unpleasant as that sounds, all of those symptoms are normal. But, if your skin starts to crack (due to dryness), keep on the lookout for signs of infection. If you ever see pus or sudden discoloration, it’s time to head to your healthcare provider ASAP. It’s your old pal breczema (the best portmanteau that starts with “br” since Brexit). Unfortunately, breczema is just as mysterious as regular eczema. The rash has no known cause, though general eczema is usually passed down through genetics. One common cause is . Breastfeeding can cause cracked, dry nipples, which sometimes leads to atopic dermatitis. If you already have general eczema, your chances of getting boob specific eczema while breastfeeding is pretty high. Though there aren’t clear causes of atopic dermatitis and you can’t exactly tell your baby to stop eating if you have breastfeeding induced eczema, you shorten your breczema flares with some simple treatments or a trip to the doctor’s office. Have you recently switched soaps or laundry detergents? That could be the cause of your itchy boobs. Chemical irritants can trigger an eczema flare up, and since your bra sits right against your skin all day, it’s best to avoid detergents that contain harsh chemicals. That also goes for soaps and shampoos with harsh ingredients. Instead, opt for cleansers that have natural ingredients or are designed for sensitive skin. The most common over the counter treatment is a hydrocortisone cream. This mild steroid calms inflammation and reduces itching and redness. Typically, you’ll apply the cream to your boobs up to four times a day for about a week. Be sure to follow the instructions on your particular tube of cream and don’t use for longer than instructed. An eczema flare-up makes your skin extra dry and sensitive. If you let it get even dry, you risk irritating the skin further. The next time you’re putting lotion on your legs or going through a ten step skin care routine for your face, spread a little of that moisturizing love to your boobs. Be sure to pick a moisturizer without any harsh ingredients, but it doesn’t have to be fancy. Even a slathering of petroleum jelly will do the trick. Hot temperatures and sweat buildup make eczema worse. Ditch the boobsweat by wearing a bra (and shirt) made from breathable fabric. If it’s moisture wicking, that’s even better! During a bad flare, avoid hot temps or sweaty activities the best you can. Treating your tatas to a nice hot shower seems like a treat, right? Sadly, it can make breast eczema worse. Hot showers are actually drying to the skin and it can irritate the rash. Instead, turn the shower temps down a bit. Warm is fine, but extra hot and steamy is not what your boobs want right now. Also, shorten your shower time. More time spent in the water means drier skin. Keep showers to 15 minutes or less, and apply a nourishing moisturizer when you’re done. If you’re not sure what triggers your eczema flare-ups, you may want to . can cause inflammation, which might make your tata-topic dermatitis come out and play. Eggs, milk, shellfish, tree nuts, peanuts, and gluten are the biggest inflammatory culprits. You can try removing these potentially irritating ingredients from your diet and see if your breast eczema improves. During a flare-up, fill up on anti-inflammatory foods like fruits, vegetables, and Omega-3 fatty acids to help your body fight off the eczema as quickly as possible. It’s also wise to consult your doctor before making any major changes to your diet (especially if you’re considering an elimination diet). They can help you figure out the best way to tinker with your meal plan. Stress makes just about everything worse, including breast eczema. If your stress levels are high, it can trigger flare-ups or make eczema stick around longer. Prioritize relaxation the next time your skin acts up. During a tense situation, take a moment to do a breathing exercise, meditate, walk, take a nap, or watch a . Whenever you have a flare, see if you notice any particular triggers. Eczema doesn’t usually flare up right away, so symptoms may not appear until days after the trigger in question. Still, if you can connect the dots, you’ll be able to track what’s upsetting your skin. Though this won’t help during an eczema breakout, it can help you avoid them in the future. Eczema isn’t the only thing that can cause an irritated chest area. A variety of rashes and other ailments can cause skin inflammation that looks a lot like atopic dermatitis. If you have an eczema flare up on your nipples that won’t go away, there’s a slight chance that it might be Paget’s disease. This condition is a form of cancer that starts in the nipple and grows out toward the areola. Again, this is rare, but if nipple eczema starts burning, tingling, or you have bloody or yellow discharge, it’s best to see a doctor to make sure Paget’s isn’t the cause. Contact dermatitis and atopic dermatitis look exactly the same (hence the similar name), but contact dermatitis comes from a direct reaction to an irritation. That means, it goes away once the irritant is removed. So if you suddenly get a boob rash, make sure it isn’t your bra, detergent, or soap that’s the root of the problem. Like most skin conditions, psoriasis can show up anywhere on the epidermis, including the boobs. in particular effects skin folds. Sometimes, a boob rubs against the underboob area and this irritation causes inverse psoriasis. If your rash is specifically in the folds of your breasts, this might be the issue. Yeast infections: not just for vaginas! Yeast can grow in any place that tends to stay warm and moist (sorry, there’s no way to say that in a non-gross way). Sometimes, yeast thrives under or between the breasts. This kind of yeast infection is called and is easily treatable. Mastitis almost exclusively occurs in breast feeding mothers and is an infection of the breast tissue. This can cause swelling, itching, and irritation. Don’t think a bug is too good to bite your boobs. Whether it’s bed bugs or mosquitos, irritating insects can get to your breasts and leave you with miserable itchy bumps. If your rash is just a few distinct bumps (and you just went camping or bought a mattress off Craigslist), bugs might be the culprit. If your nipples are sunburnt, congrats on that topless sunbathing you bold smoke show. Even if you haven’t hit the beach European style, a sunburn on your chest can cause redness, peeling, and a lot of itching. Eczema is incredibly common and if it camps out on your boobs, that’s okay. You may experience redness and itching, but it can be treated by over-the-counter (OTC) cortisone, keeping the area moisturized, and avoiding food and chemical triggers. Though there’s no particular cause or cure (you can help eczema go away, but it almost always comes back at some point), it’s rarely serious and easily treated. — Morning Diarrhea: Dirty Deets and Causes of the A.M.

e6537799-7db7-42cd-aaa4-77bf73df3568,"Dermatitis, sometimes also called eczema, can create a vicious cycle. Your skin itches, so you scratch it. It becomes red and swollen, and then tiny, red, oozing bumps appear that eventually crust over. You keep scratching because the itching is unbearable, so the rash gets even more irritated and perhaps even infected. All too often, you don't even know what's causing the itching. It could be an allergy to the soap you use in the shower each morning. It could be irritation from a chemical you're exposed to at work. It could even be atopic dermatitis, which is a mysterious, chronic skin condition that usually begins in childhood and most often strikes people with a personal or family history of allergic conditions. Dermatitis is sometimes used as a catch-all term for any inflammation or swelling of the skin. The term eczema is used interchangeably with dermatitis by some experts, while others use ""eczema"" only to refer to the specific condition known medically as atopic dermatitis. Regardless of the kind of dermatitis you're suffering from, some general rules apply when you're seeking relief. In this article, we will review the various types of dermatitis and how to tell them apart, then we'll give you specific home remedies to protect your skin from the most common types of dermatitis.

Home Remedy Treatments for Allergic Contact Dermatitis Home Remedy Treatments for Irritant Contact Dermatitis ©2007 Publications International, Ltd. Determining what's causing your dermatitis is important in treating it, but if you can't think of anything but the itching at the moment, here are some home remedies you can follow for fast relief: Cool compresses will help. Use a folded handkerchief or a piece of bed linen folded several layers thick. Dip the clean cloth into cool water or Burow's solution (available over-the-counter at your pharmacy), and place it on the rash for 10 to 15 minutes every hour. Wet compresses are also appropriate when weeping, oozing blisters are present; ironically, you'll actually dry up the rash by repeatedly wetting it (just as frequent wetting dries out healthy skin if moisturizer isn't applied). Whole-milk compresses are effective, too, since the protein in dairy products helps relieve itching. This old standby can help relieve the itch. Apply it thinly, so the pores aren't sealed, two to three times a day. The downside to calamine lotion is that it leaves your skin the color of bubble gum. At least one manufacturer, however, has come out with a version of this itch buster that will leave you less ""in the pink."" Check your local pharmacy. This all-purpose salve is a mainstay in any dermatologist's practice and is also available over the counter (OTC) in 0.5 and 1 percent strengths. It can ease the itch and inflammation of dermatitis (although it won't help, and it can even suppress, the body's ability to fight a bacterial or fungal infection, which may develop if excessive scratching has torn the skin). Topical hydrocortisone may be a better treatment choice for allergic dermatitis than for irritant dermatitis, however. (The distinction between these two types of dermatitis is explained shortly.) If a skin product's generic name ends with the letters ""caine"" (such as benzocaine), the medicine is derived from an anesthetic, and anesthetics often cause or aggravate allergic reactions in sensitive individuals. Treating a bad sunburn with one of these products, for example, could produce an itchy allergic rash to go along with the painful burn. These products can cause allergic reactions, in the form of severe rashes, when rubbed on the skin. Try an OTC antihistamine that you take by mouth, such as Benadryl or Chlor-Trimeton, to help relieve itching. Such products generally cause drowsiness, but that side effect may actually be helpful at night when itching is most severe. If you take an antihistamine during the day and it makes you drowsy, avoid driving or operating heavy machinery. Doing so could break the skin and cause a secondary infection. If you simply can't resist the urge, rub the itch with your fingertips instead of scratching with your nails. If a child is affected, trim his or her fingernails short and, if necessary, have the child wear mittens, at least at night, to prevent harmful scratching. Adding oatmeal or baking soda to bathwater will make it more soothing, although it won't cure your rash. Buy an OTC colloidal oatmeal bath treatment (the oatmeal is ground up so it dissolves better) or add a cup of baking soda to warm, not hot, bathwater. There are three basic types of dermatitis.

Home Remedy Treatments for Allergic Contact Dermatitis ©2007 Publications International, Ltd. Some people sneeze when confronted with ragweed pollen or dander from cats. And some people break out in a rash, known as allergic contact dermatitis, when their skin comes in direct contact with substances that are normally harmless to most people, such as certain ingredients in costume jewelry or makeup. In allergic contact dermatitis, the body's immune system reacts to direct contact with an allergen (a substance the body incorrectly identifies as harmful) by producing an itchy rash on the skin where that contact occurred. So, for example, a person with an allergy to the nickel in a bracelet will develop a bracelet-shaped rash on the skin where that piece of jewelry was worn. The most common allergen in allergic contact dermatitis is poison ivy, which can cause reactions in at least half of the people exposed to it. The next most common contact allergen is nickel, a metal commonly used in costume jewelry. Up to 10 percent of the population may suffer an allergic reaction to this metal. Other possible causes of allergic contact dermatitis include: Formaldehyde, which is used in shampoo, detergent, nail hardeners, waterless hand cleaners, and mouthwashes Identifying a rash as allergic contact dermatitis is not always easy, however. An airborne allergen, like ragweed or animal dander, usually elicits sneezing or a runny nose within 15 minutes of exposure. But it may take up to 72 hours after contact with the sensitizing substance before a reaction shows up on your skin. That can make identifying the culprit and choosing a home remedy pretty tough.Complicating the diagnosis further is the fact that you have to become sensitized to a substance before it can cause a rash. That means you have to come in contact with it at least once before the next contact will provoke an allergic response. And indeed, sometimes it requires repeated contacts with a substance before the body becomes sensitized to it. So, for example, you may wear that nickel-containing bracelet once or even dozens of times without any problems, but then one day, out of the blue, it causes an allergic rash.Isolating the cause of a rash and selecting a home remedy can be challenging, since it may be triggered by tiny amounts of the offending chemicals. What's more, it may take only a tiny amount of the offending substance to cause an allergic rash, and thanks to our concerns with hygiene and appearance, we expose ourselves to a variety of potentially offending substances every day. For instance, the average woman uses more than a dozen different products on her scalp and head each morning. If you are sensitive to nickel, wearing nickel-containing jewelry in a hot, humid environment may worsen the allergy, as perspiration leaches out some of the nickel. So before you start a workout or go out into the heat, take off any nickel-containing jewelry. If you decide to get your ears pierced but you have an allergy to nickel, make sure those first earring studs have stainless steel posts. Also make sure the needle is stainless steel. Otherwise, the studs or needle may contain nickel, and you'll be risking an itchy, inflamed rash on those recently pierced earlobes. Paint the surfaces that come in contact with your skin with clear nail polish. Even 14 karat gold jewelry has some nickel in it, so if your skin reacts strongly to nickel, you may need to restrict your gold purchases to 24 karat (which is pure gold). Other safe options include platinum and stainless steel. If your skin breaks out in a rash when it meets PABA or another chemical common in consumer products, do your skin a favor by reading ingredients lists carefully and choosing only those without the offender. Some products are even conveniently labeled as ""free"" of certain substances known to cause allergic reactions (you will likely find sunscreens, for example, advertised and labeled as ""PABA-free""). It's an ambiguous term with no legal meaning. The Food and Drug Administration has not established a standard to define ""hypoallergenic."" If you can't tell whether a product contains a substance you're allergic to, try querying the manufacturer or performing your own patch test by applying a little of the product on the skin of your inner forearm and waiting three or four days to see if a rash develops. Guard against exposure to poisonous plants by wearing long pants and long-sleeved shirts when you're in areas where these plants are likely to be.

Home Remedy Treatments for Irritant Contact Dermatitis ©2007 Publications International, Ltd. Soap can cause both irritant and allergic reactions. Some things in this world are so harsh that frequent or prolonged exposure to them can result in a rash known as irritant contact dermatitis. Numerous industrial chemicals cause problems for workers, but the typical household is not without its share of hazards to your skin. Soaps, detergents, oven cleaners, bathroom cleaners, and many other products can irritate the skin and remove its protective oils. What's the difference between irritant and allergic contact dermatitis? Soap, for example, can cause either one. Allergic contact dermatitis occurs only in people who have an oversensitive immune system that reacts to the soap's ingredients as if they were somehow harmful. Irritant contact dermatitis occurs when the skin contacts a substance that is harmful and that actually causes damage to the skin, especially when that contact is prolonged or frequent; the immune system is not involved. On the other hand, both irritant and allergic contact dermatitis produce itching, rashes, and inflammation only in the areas of skin that have actually come in contact with the offending substance, so the rash location often points to the cause. Therefore, making a list like the one described for allergic contact dermatitis can be useful in identifying the culprit in irritant contact dermatitis (although the irritating product is often more obvious in this type of contact dermatitis). If you suspect that an irritant has caused your red, itchy, bumpy rash, there's one very important home remedy you should follow: Until you manage to do that, the rash will continue. If exposure to household products is the problem and it's your hands that are suffering, wear gloves made of vinyl, which doesn't cause allergic reactions, rather than rubber or latex, when using those products. Wearing cotton liners with the gloves will help keep perspiration from further irritating your skin, although this can be a bulky combination. In addition, take a look at the remedies discussed under Atopic Dermatitis, since they may also help you avoid the substances irritating your skin. As mentioned above, atopic dermatitis will be discussed in the next section. We'll give you some home remedies on how to take on this chronic inflammation of the skin.

Atopic dermatitis takes its name from ""atopy,"" an inherited condition in which a person is predisposed to developing multiple allergic disorders, including asthma, hay fever, and food allergies. If you or a family member has an allergic disorder, you are at increased risk of developing atopic dermatitis. Although atopic dermatitis is associated with allergic disorders, it is not itself an allergic reaction to a specific substance, as allergic contact dermatitis is. Rather, atopic dermatitis is a chronic and intensely itchy inflammation of the outer layer of skin. Its cause is unknown, although it appears to be related to an overly sensitive or malfunctioning immune system, and it can be aggravated by a variety of factors, such as temperature changes, skin infections, irritation from clothes or chemicals, and emotional stress. Atopic dermatitis most frequently develops in children younger than five years old, and the majority of cases resolve by adulthood. However, the condition can first appear in adulthood or continue into adulthood after developing in childhood. The main symptom of atopic dermatitis is an intensely itchy skin rash, although the itchiness may actually precede the appearance of the rash. In infants, the rash may first appear in patches on the cheeks and chin, although it may also occur on the scalp, diaper area, and extremities and eventually cover large areas of the body. In older children and adults, the rash tends to appear in fewer and more limited areas, such as around the mouth and in skin folds, especially at the crook of the elbow and the back of the knee. The rash may appear dry and flaky at first, but the incredible itching often prompts scratching that further inflames the skin, increases itching, and can lead to blistering and crusting or cracking and secondary infection; some areas of skin may eventually become thick and leathery as a result. The skin of someone who has had atopic dermatitis tends to lose moisture and dry out easily and is more vulnerable to irritant contact dermatitis. Beyond easing the itching, coping with this condition requires protecting the skin from additional irritation. The following home remedies may help: This helps remove formaldehyde and other potentially irritating chemicals used to treat fabrics. Even if you use a mild laundry detergent, it's a good idea to rinse your clothes twice to make sure all of the soap is removed. You want your skin to be able to ""breathe,"" so choose loose-fitting, open-weave, cotton or cotton-blend clothes. Abrupt temperature changes (hot to cold or vice versa) can irritate the skin, so try to avoid them whenever possible. Try to maintain constant humidity levels in your home, too. It's hard to scratch effectively, and therefore hard to cause further damage to your sensitive skin, if your fingernails are short. Use warm, not hot, water, and soak or shower for at least 15 or 20 minutes. Avoid using a washcloth because it's abrasive. Choose a gentle soap, such as Dove, Oiltum, Alpha Keri, Neutrogena, Purpose, or Basis; a nonsoap cleanser, such as Aveeno or Emulave; or a liquid cleaner, such as Moisturel, Neutrogena, or Dove. Rinse thoroughly, gently pat away excess moisture, and then apply moisturizer to your damp skin to seal in the water. Plain petroleum jelly is the best after-bath sealant. It's extremely important for people with atopic dermatitis to keep their skin from becoming too dry. Some good moisturizers include Aquaphor ointment, Eucerin cream, Moisturel cream or lotion, D.M.L. cream or lotion, Lubriderm cream or lotion, Neutrogena emulsion, Eutra, Vaseline dermatology lotion, or LactiCare lotion. A sunburn is only going to irritate the skin further. The chlorine and other chemicals in most swimming pools can irritate sensitive skin. So shortly after you've finished your swim, take a shower or bath and use a mild soap all over. Don't forget to reapply your moisturizer, as well. Some physicians believe food allergies may play a role in atopic dermatitis, especially in childhood, while others say it hasn't been proven. If you suspect a particular food aggravates your rash, omit it from your diet for a few weeks. If the rash clears up but then returns when you reintroduce the food in your diet, consider permanently avoiding the food. Do not eliminate a large number of foods or an entire food group, however, without consulting your doctor first. If your child has atopic dermatitis and you suspect a food-allergy link, work with the child's pediatrician to investigate this possibility. Sometimes adding certain foods to your diet can help ease dermatitis. In the next section, we will discuss how home remedies like nutritional therapy, herbal medicine, and other alternative treatments can help relieve itching and other symptoms.

Visiting your doctor is an important step to treating whatever type of dermatitis you are experiencing. But dermatitis sufferers looking for more answers beyond traditional medicine can consider the following alternative home remedies. Dermatitis sufferers may benefit from adding essential fatty acids, which promote healthy skin. In one study, a group of Italian researchers treated two- and four-year-olds suffering from atopic dermatitis with daily doses of primrose oil (rich in essential fatty acids). After four weeks, the children's symptoms dramatically improved. After 20 weeks, they experienced the same results with no adverse side effects. And, supplementation with vitamin A, vitamin E, and zinc can also be useful in some cases of atopic dermatitis. Herbal medicine practitioners think some parts of the body -- such as the liver and the nervous system -- may need strengthening  and tuning to head off a case of dermatitis. Several herbs can assist in cleansing the body and getting rid of toxins. Burdock, for example, is a liver tonic; when the liver is working well to filter toxins from the blood, the skin is generally healthier. Similarly, red clover is a very effective blood purifier. Other herbs like licorice root, calendula (marigold) flower heads, and especially ginkgo all have potent anti-inflammatory effects when used topically. Regular meditation is useful for stress reduction and deep breathing, which both are important to a well-rounded dermatitis treatment program. The menu of treatments can include herbal medicine, acupuncture, or dietary recommendations. A traditional Chinese physician tailors the therapy to the needs of each dermatitis sufferer. For example, two people with the same condition won't necessarily take the same herbs or follow the same exercise routine. A dermatitis treatment might call for a daily herbal tea, made by boiling and then simmering dried herbs for an hour and a half. Because traditional Chinese medicine's remedies are individualized, it is necessary to contact a qualified practitioner or obtain an accurate diagnosis and a specific prescription for your condition. No matter what type of dermatitis is making your skin itch, there are many home remedies for you to soothe your skin. The key is trying not to scratch and finding the right medication or at-home remedy to ease your symptoms. Hopefully these home remedies have given you some helpful suggestions on overcoming this skin condition before the itching becomes unbearable.

105a9de7-d372-4139-9dc3-da301d1b07dc,"Childhood Eczema and Mental Health: Where is the Link? Research Project Coordinator Ludmer Centre for Neuroinformatics & Mental Health The link between eczema in childhood and mental health problems in later life has been the subject of research for many years. The evidence was recently compounded by a large, population-based study which found a strong association between eczema and attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), anxiety and depression, amongst others. The prevalence of allergic diseases has increased in the past few decades, especially within highly developed countries. Atopic dermatitis (AD) or eczema is a cutaneous allergy and the most common chronic medical condition in children. Eczema is characterized by an inflammatory rash associated with excessive itching and scratching. This medical condition is associated with significant health care costs and reduces the quality of life of affected children and their families. The disease is most common in young children and becomes less common with increasing age. Since the early 1900’s studies have shown a link between eczema and other allergies and mental health problems.  More recently, several European studies have shown that children with eczema have an increased prevalence of psychological and behavioral problems or mental health disorders. These findings have been confirmed in a large population-based study in the United States. In particular, eczema is associated with an increased risk for attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), conduct disorder, autism, anxiety and depression. While the association between eczema and mental health disorders has been established, the role of gender in this association has not been fully examined. Some studies have found higher rates of anxiety and depression in females with eczema than in males. These studies were conducted in adulthood though and the role of sex in influencing the association between eczema and risk for mental illness has not been extensively studied in young children. Recently, we used data collected from the Maternal Adversity, Vulnerability, and Neurodevelopment (MAVAN) community study to determine if boys and girls with early life cutaneous allergies including eczema have greater emotional and behavioral problems in childhood. We recruited 630 mothers and their babies for the study, which was carried out in Montreal and Hamilton, Canada. In the MAVAN community study, we found that girls with early childhood cutaneous allergies including eczema were at greater risk for mental health issues later on in life than girls without childhood cutaneous allergies. However, this was not true for boys, who had similar rates of emotional and behavioral problems with or without cutaneous allergies in early childhood. Daily moisturizer does not prevent eczema according to new research Human to Labskin Skin Models for Dermatology Research Several studies emphasize a greater risk for psychological and behavioral problems in adult females with eczema. For example, women with hand eczema show greater impairments in mental health-related quality of life compared to men with eczema. Adult female patients with eczema were also found to have greater anxiety and depression compared to male patients with eczema.  Meanwhile asthma, hay fever or eczema in mid adolescence associated with greater internalizing problems in late adolescent girls only. Females show a greater immune response than males and this leads to an increased prevalence of autoimmune diseases in females compared to males. The greater severity of allergic symptoms noted in young girls compared to boys may be due to both sex based differences and due to the less studied immunomodulatory role of gender in eczema disease predisposition and severity. Hormonal and genetic differences due to the presence of two X chromosomes in girls may predispose girls to greater immune responses and possibly greater symptoms due to eczema. Disease severity in girls may also be greater because of greater environmental exposure to allergens and skin irritants in girls than boys and differences in the recognition and treatment of the disease in girls compared to boys. Eczema is caused by inappropriate immune activation and  the release of higher levels of inflammatory proteins called cytokines. It is thought that this physiological process may be mediating the association between eczema and mental health. Cytokines are known to affect the functioning of brain regions that influence emotions and behavior and important interactions exist between sex hormones and cytokines. Psychological stress exacerbates eczema symptoms and may even trigger the development of eczema skin rashes. There are differences in how males and females react to emotional stress. Further, stress can induce sensitization of cytokines in brain regions that regulate emotions and behavior. Girls with eczema may have greater brain pro-inflammatory cytokine levels or cytokine sensitization than boys with eczema. This, in turn, may predispose girls with eczema to greater behavioral disturbances such as increased conduct problems compared to boys with eczema. It was previously shown that asthma in early childhood precedes the development of internalizing behaviors in adolescence inferring a potential causal relationship between allergy and mental health disturbances. Health care practitioners should then be made aware of the increased vulnerability for mental health problems in young girls with childhood eczema in order to plan effective treatment interventions in this potentially at-risk population.

She is currently a neuroscientist at the Douglas Mental Health University Institute, an institution affiliated with McGill University in Montreal, Canada. She studies how early life stress increases the risk for mental health disorders using both animal models and human cohorts. Part of her research focus is on how early life stress, infectious burden in early life and components of the immune system including cytokines can be used to predict the risk for mental health disorders in later life. 1.

Last Updated: Mar 20, 2018 Since the early 1900’s studies have shown a link between eczema and other allergies and mental health problems. To learn that doctors, five, six decades later, did nothing but give my mother ointment for my hands… as I morphed from being a social pariah on the playground into the desolate adult I am today… I wish I didn’t know this. My miserable existence for nearly 70-years is now absolutely intolerable. I have frantically struggled to assemble my shattered life for as long as I can remember. It’s been extremely grueling to escape the label I was given during my early adolescence. I was diagnosed with a mental health disorder and subsequently treated with myriad medications and cocktails for decades that served only to exacerbate the problem. I was never properly diagnosed and treated for the developmental and mental disorders I actually have. I now know that the numerous medical doctors were complicit in this decades-old mistreatment, and this information is too staggering for me to comprehend. As an atheist, I consider life a random cause and effect of a cosmic process. And, I’m all right with that. But to have spent my life in such utter pain, loneliness, and misery only to learn that it could have been prevented, or appropriately treated, is so grossly beyond the pale that it mocks my purposeless existence.

9dedfb2a-5cc4-4691-8ff1-345e7e0b2e6c,"Information about the 2019 Novel Coronavirus. Información sobre el coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19). Atopic dermatitis is a long-term (chronic) skin disorder. It causes dry, itchy, scaly patches. These are often on the face and the head in babies. It’s most common in infants or very young children. Most will show signs of the condition in the first year of life. Symptoms may last until the teens or adulthood. It rarely starts in adulthood. It is not contagious. Atopic dermatitis tends to run in families. This suggests a genetic link. It’s also linked to asthma and allergies. These are immune hypersensitivity disorders. Treatment for this condition is aimed at calming the skin inflammation, decreasing the itching, and preventing infections. Good skin care and medicine to control itching and infection are used. This condition is a type of eczema. Eczema is a general term that includes conditions that make the skin red, itchy, and inflamed. Atopic dermatitis is the most common type of eczema. So it is often called eczema. Experts don't know what causes this condition. It runs in families, which suggests a genetic link. It’s also linked to asthma and allergies. There is likely a change of the proteins in the skin that leads to atopic dermatitis.  Certain triggers can make this condition worse. For example, stress, hot or cold temperature, dry conditions, certain fabrics, metals, or detergents can cause a flare-up. The area of the body affected by atopic dermatitis may change with age. In babies and young children, it often affects the face, outside of the elbows, and the knees. In older children and adults, it tends to be on the hands and feet, the arms, the back of the knees, and the folds of the elbows. Symptoms can be a bit different for each person. Common symptoms include: Small bumps that open and ooze (weep) a clear fluid when scratched Too much rubbing and scratching can tear the skin and lead to infection. The symptoms of atopic dermatitis may seem like other skin conditions. Always talk with your healthcare provider for a diagnosis. Your healthcare provider will ask about your health history and if you have allergies or asthma. He or she will also ask about any family history of dermatitis, allergies, or asthma.   A healthcare provider can often make a diagnosis by examining your skin. You may also have a patch test. This is a test to find allergies. Small amounts of allergens are placed on the skin. Then the skin is watched for a response. A skin biopsy may also be done to rule out other causes of the rash.  Treatment will depend on your symptoms, age, and general health. It will also depend on how severe the condition is. There is no cure. The goals of treatment are to reduce itching and skin inflammation, to keep the skin moist, and to prevent infection. Your healthcare provider may also prescribe medicines in severe cases. The following are often used to treat atopic dermatitis: These medicines are taken by mouth (oral). They may help to ease itching. Some examples include diphenhydramine and hydroxyzine. They may cause drowsiness. Some newer antihistamines don’t cause drowsiness. These are put on the skin to help ease inflammation, itching, and swelling. Many topical steroids are available in different strengths. If overused, they can cause skin thinning and discoloration. These medicines ease inflammation, which can relieve itching. They are used for severe cases. They are available as a pill, liquid, or shot. These steroids have serious side effects from long-term use. So they are only used for a short time to stop a flare-up.  These medicines kill bacteria that cause infections. Scratching the affected skin can bring bacteria to the area. This can lead to infection. Always take the antibiotic exactly as prescribed until it is all gone.  This medicine has been used for years to treat atopic dermatitis that doesn’t respond to other treatments. It was first developed to prevent rejection after organ transplantation. It suppresses the immune system. This stops it from overreacting. This helps prevent flare-ups. The medicine has many side effects. This should be considered carefully. Two types are used to treat atopic dermatitis: ultraviolet (UV) light therapy and PUVA (chemophototherapy). Light therapy uses UV light of certain wavelengths to target the immune system. It stops the responses that lead to inflammation. PUVA therapy combines medicine and phototherapy. Phototherapy may be used along with other treatment. There are risks and benefits of light therapy. Weigh these risks with your healthcare provider.  . These are nonsteroidal medicines that are put on the skin. They stop a part of the immune response that helps to reduce redness and itching. An immunosuppressive medicine that can be used to manage atopic dermatitis long term. But it can possibly harm the liver. Similar to moisturizers, they help repair the skin and provide moisture.  This medicine blocks an enzyme that plays a role in causing inflammation. It is put on the skin, often twice a day. An injectable medicine called dupilumab is now available. This medicine blocks certain proteins from attaching to cells and causing inflammation. But this medicine is mostly used when other treatments haven't worked as well to control the condition. What are possible complications of atopic dermatitis? Eye problems, such as eyelid dermatitis or cataracts Trouble in personal, family, or work relationships Experts don't know what causes atopic dermatitis. So there is no known way to prevent it. But staying away from triggers may reduce flare-ups. The following steps can help manage atopic dermatitis: Don’t use harsh soaps. Ask your healthcare provider to recommend a brand. Dress in light clothes. Sweating can make atopic dermatitis worse. Use a good moisturizer at least once a day. Ask your healthcare provider to recommend a brand. Don't scratch the affected area. Keep fingernails short and smooth. Don't use skin products that have fragrances and dyes. Atopic dermatitis is a chronic skin disorder. It is often called eczema. It tends to run in families. It is most common in infants or very young children. It causes itching and dry, scaly, red skin. It has red bumps that open and ooze (weep) clear fluid when scratched. It’s important to find and stay away from the things that make it worse. Triggers include stress, high or low temperatures, bacterial infections, fabrics such as wool, metals, and detergents. There is no cure. The goals of treatment are to reduce itching and skin inflammation, keep the skin moisturized, and prevent infection. Tips to help you get the most from a visit to your healthcare provider: Know the reason for your visit and what you want to happen. Before your visit, write down questions you want answered. Bring someone with you to help you ask questions and remember what your provider tells you. At the visit, write down the name of a new diagnosis, and any new medicines, treatments, or tests. Also write down any new instructions your provider gives you. Know why a new medicine or treatment is prescribed, and how it will help you. Also know what the side effects are. Ask if your condition can be treated in other ways. Know why a test or procedure is recommended and what the results could mean. Know what to expect if you do not take the medicine or have the test or procedure. If you have a follow-up appointment, write down the date, time, and purpose for that visit. Know how you can contact your provider if you have questions.",102,randomly gotten eczema,-4.034430503845215,16
17c0ca2e-cea8-4f64-bb80-8364305f20b3,"— Your skin is the largest organ of your body, shielding all those inside bits yet totally exposed to the environment around it. is the scientific moniker for eczema, a condition characterized by dry, itchy, red patches of skin. Eczema affects children and adults alike and can lead to further complications when the skin cracks, forming open wounds that can become infiltrated by harmful contaminants. Infected eczema can make an uncomfortable situation even worse, so it’s important to know the warning signs and best courses of treatment to avoid painful itchy-scratchies. Eczema (atopic dermatitis) is a dry, red rash that can flare up pretty much anywhere on the body, but in older children and young adults it likes the areas behind the knees and the crease between the forearm and arm (aka elbow pit). If the skin cracks or tears from scratching, open wounds are at risk of infection by microscopic bacterial, fungal, or viral invaders. One of the more common infections that can occur with eczema is Staph is a bacteria that usually just hangs around harmlessly on the skin. However, it can get into wounds caused by scratching or cracking skin and cause problems. A staphinfection can make an eczema flare-up worse, causing further risks and potentially life threatening complications. Fungal infections are common in skin areas where eczema is chilling in skin folds. Thrush and ringworm are a couple fungal infections that can accompany eczema and cause discomfort. Herpes simplex is a viral infection that can be particularly problematic in eczema, as folks with eczema are more prone to catching the virus. This can result in a condition called eczema herpeticum (more on that in a second), so people with eczema should steer clear of coming into contact with people who have the virus or are showing signs of cold sores. is another contagious viral infection that commonly affects those with eczema. It appears as skin colored, round, painless bumps with a divot in the center that are usually a few millimeters in size. You gotta know it (it’s infected!) Boogie woogie woogie Identifying a case of infected eczema is the first step toward relief. Common symptoms of infection are: flu-like symptoms, such as fever or swollen glands Infection is a complication of eczema, but infections themselves carry their own risks. It can be difficult for an eczema flare-up to heal while there’s an infection on the scene. Along with cases of infected eczema, there may also be heightened discomfort when it comes to itching, pain, and blisters or sores on the skin. In some cases, skin infections can cause abscesses and swelling. When exposed to the herpes simplex virus, people with eczema may be at risk of developing , a condition that characteristically has little “punched out” cookie-cutter-like yellowish erosions and tenderness in the skin, sometimes accompanied by flu-like symptoms. This condition is very serious, so if it’s suspected then call your doctor ASAP. One of the most serious complications that can occur as a result of infected eczema is sepsis (aka blood poisoning). Sepsis occurs when a severe infection, such as , is left untreated for too long and seeps into the bloodstream. This can lead to all sorts of problems, including organ failure and even death. Risks of serious complications are generally higher in babies and children. Younger people may also be more likely to get infections in the first place, so it’s important to monitor your little ones with eczema carefully and get medical attention as needed. There are many for infected eczema. Knowing whether the infection is bacterial, viral, or fungal will be the factor in determining a treatment plan. For bacterial infections, antibiotics are used. Sometimes these are in the form of topical creams or ointments, but they might also be taken orally for short courses. Corticosteroid creams are also used in many cases to reduce the inflammation that accompanies infection and eczema. Many people may want to using topical steroid medications when their eczema is infected because steroids may exacerbate an infection. Your dermatologist will let you know how to properly use these medications for your particular infection. Fungal infections are typically treated with antifungal topicals or oral medications. Viral infections such as herpes simplex infections are treated with antiviral medications. Some peeps swear by specific home remedies to treat eczema. But when it comes to infections, it’s important to review any home remedies with your healthcare provider so they can monitor your condition and skirt the risk of making things worse. When using home remedies, keep in mind that they haven’t been widely studied and could potentially cause further irritation since everyone’s skin may react differently. Some popular for eczema are: such as evening primrose oil, calendula, and witch hazel such as tea tree, neem, or evening primrose : used to aid stomach issues from antibiotic use : free of harsh detergents, to help soothe and moisturize the skin Some other options that may be used to complement traditional treatments include: : used in bathing, to soothe aches and irritated skin to soothe and soften irritated skin To prevent infected eczema, make sure to monitor your flare-ups and take good care of your skin. Although it may be easier said than done, avoid scratching the skin. This can cause open wounds to form, increasing the risk of infection. Topical steroids are the first-line treatment for itchy, inflamed patches of eczema. See your dermatologist work out a proper treatment strategy. Moisturizing can be an effective way to both soothe and protect your skin. If that’s not enough, inflammation can be managed with the use of steroid creams, topical immunomodulators, and even light therapy. Attempting to pinpoint eczema triggers can be a really helpful way to save your future self some trouble when it comes to managing this condition. You should see a doctor ASAP if you suspect a case of infected eczema. They’ll check your skin to ID the type of infection and prescribe the proper course of treatment. Your doctor may also suggest lifestyle changes to help avoid more eczema flare-ups in the future (such as avoiding common triggers). There’s no need to suffer through unnecessary pain and discomfort — get that skin checked out. — Smiling Through the Sadness?

Eczema, aka atopic dermatitis, can appear nearly anywhere on the body. People with atopic dermatitis are more sensitive to products on their skin and can manifest eczema in many places, even on the ears. Contact dermatitis looks just like like atopic dermatitis, but this is technically due to an external cause such as an irritant or an allergic substance (i.e. earrings). Ear eczema is sometimes used interchangeably to refer to an eczema-like rash on the ears, even if it’s not always true atopic dermatitis (eczema) on the ears. In this article, we use it in a general sense and not specifically to refer to only atopic dermatitis. Thankfully, this eczema on the ears isn’t contagious, and there are treatments to reduce the risk of infection or inflammation. The symptoms of ear eczema can affect the outside of the ear, inside the ear canal, the area behind the ear, and the crease where your ears are attached. Dry weather and hot, sweaty environments are known to worsen eczema in some individuals. Doctors and researchers haven’t determined the exact cause of eczema yet. One possible factor may be , a gene mutation that creates a protective barrier on the skin — increasing skin vulnerability. This is thought to be an underlying genetic cause of atopic dermatitis. Atopic dermatitis is essentially due to a . People with this disorder may be more apt to react to irritants or allergic substances on the skin including: soaps, detergents, disinfectants, baby wipes, and scented products The cause of ear eczema depends on which type you’re dealing with.

They’ll do a visual assessment, shine a light inside your ears, and ask about your symptoms and family history. A doctor may want to do a biopsy to rule out similar conditions, like psoriasis. For a biopsy, the doctor removes a portion of the affected skin and sends it to the pathology lab to be reviewed under a microscope. Be prepared to answer questions about your medical history and provide as much information as possible about ingredients and beauty products you use. Your doctor may suggest allergy testing if allergic contact dermatitis is suspected. Treatment requires avoiding certain ingredients or materials. If you have seborrheic eczema your doctor may recommend an antifungal cream or shampoo. To reduce inflammation, your doctor may prescribe a topical steroid.

It’s a common skin condition that isn’t contagious. You’re high risk if you have asthma or allergies. There are treatments that manage symptoms, but there’s no cure. As many as 15% to 20% of people experience eczema or another form of dermatitis at some point. Eczema (also called atopic dermatitis) is a condition that causes your skin to become dry, red, itchy and bumpy. It’s one of many types of . Eczema damages the skin barrier function (the ""glue"" of your skin). This loss of barrier function makes your skin more sensitive and more prone to infection and dryness. Eczema doesn’t harm your body. It doesn’t mean that your skin is dirty or infected, and it’s not contagious. There are treatments that can help manage your symptoms. In the word “dermatitis,” “derm” means “skin” and “itis” means “inflammation.” The word as a whole means “inflammation of the skin.” “Eczema” originates from the Greek word “ekzein” which means to “boil over” or “break out.” Eczema affects up to 15 million Americans. Infants are prone to eczema and 10% to 20% will have it. However, nearly half outgrow the condition or have significant improvement as they get older. Eczema affects males and females equally and is more common in people who have a personal or family history of , environmental allergies and/or food allergies. The first signs of eczema are itchiness and redness. Eczema can show up anywhere on your skin. In teens and adults, it’s typically found on your hands, neck, inner elbows, ankles, knees, feet and around your eyes. Eczema (atopic dermatitis) usually begins in childhood, but anyone at any age can get it. You’re high risk if you are: Part of a family with a history of dermatitis, or asthma. Is eczema (atopic dermatitis) contagious? Can it spread? No. No type of dermatitis is contagious. It can’t be spread to anyone else. Although some types of dermatitis are painful (contact dermatitis, for example) or cause a burning sensation, eczema is usually itchy. Eczema and other types of dermatitis are not harmful to the rest of your body. The condition is not deadly. What’s the difference between dermatitis and psoriasis? Psoriasis and dermatitis can appear similar. Both cause patches of red skin. However, in psoriasis, the scales are thick and the edges of those scales are well-defined. Discuss with your healthcare provider your questions about which type of skin condition you have. You can have more than one skin condition at a time. Treatments for one may not work for the other. Eczema (atopic dermatitis) is caused by a combination of immune system activation, genetics, environmental triggers and stress. If you have eczema, your immune system overreacts to small irritants or allergens. This overreaction can inflame your skin. You’re more likely to have eczema if there is a history of dermatitis in your family. You’re also at a higher risk if there’s a history of asthma, hay fever and/or allergens. Allergens are substances like pollen, pet hair or foods that trigger an allergic reaction. Also, there might be a change in your genes that control a protein that helps your body maintain healthy skin. Without normal levels of that protein, your skin will not be completely healthy. There is a lot in your environment that can irritate your skin. Some examples include exposure to tobacco smoke, air pollutants, harsh soaps, fabrics such as wool and some skin products. Low humidity (dry air) can cause your skin to become dry and itchy. Heat and high humidity can cause sweating and that can make the itchiness even worse. Your stress levels can cause or worsen your eczema. There are mental/emotional signs of stress and physical signs of stress. They include: Use of alcohol, tobacco, or illegal drugs to relax. If you have eczema, you might also have another condition that doesn’t cause it, but is often found alongside it: Notice that diabetes is not included in this list. Low humidity (dry air) can dry out your skin, and sweating caused by high heat can make the itchiness worse. Eczema can be lifelong, but symptoms can be managed with at-home remedies, over-the-counter medications and prescribed medications.

If you buy through links on this page, we may earn a small commission. Know what’s worse than having an intense itch that you just can’t reach? Having an itch that you absolutely reach — but it’s on your penis and you’re at work, and you might get fired for doing so. (Unless you happen to be a professional baseball player, in which case it’s apparently encouraged.) Skin irritations on the penis therefore present perils that more safe-for-work skin versions don’t, which is one reason it can feel extra urgent to identify the cause and move on quickly to treatment. Eczema is one common cause of penile skin irritation, but given the neighborhood of the body we’re talking about, there are other causes to rule out as well — particularly those related to sexually transmitted infections. So pull out your junk (in private, of course!) and read on to decipher what it’s trying to tell you. Eczema is often not used as a very specific term. Formally, it refers to a condition called atopic dermatitis. But in casual use it often refers to that can cause skin irritation symptoms such as: Individual conditions in the eczema family that can affect the penis include: : The qualifier “atopic” means this form of eczema can occur even on skin that hasn’t come into contact with an external allergen. of eczema is most common in young children, but can also occur into adulthood. : As opposed to atopic dermatitis, contact dermatitis is caused by contact with an external irritant or allergen. Thus, contact dermatitis can be divided into: . The most common of the two, irritant contact dermatitis happens from skin exposure to a harsh chemical, heat, friction, or even water. Symptoms show up quickly after contact, and they normally don’t spread far beyond the contact site. . This form is caused by contact with an allergen such as metals containing nickel or cobalt, chromium salts in paint or leather, fragrances found in cosmetics or food, formaldehyde, and antibacterial ointments. It can take up to 4 days to appear following contact with the allergen. Contact dermatitis isn’t the only way your penis can react badly to a brush with a foreign object — yes, it’s time to talk about sexually transmitted infections. Hopefully, you and everyone your penis contacts, knows and follows the basics of safe sex. But sex is never completely free of risk. STIs can happen even to the best of us, so it’s good to know how to identify symptoms of common STIs and how they differ from eczema. While eczema and contact dermatitis merely affect the skin, skin issues caused by an STI are often accompanied by additional symptoms that go beyond the skin. For example, while can produce itchiness, bumps, and discoloration on skin around the penis, they may also involve flu-like symptoms such as headache, fever, achiness, and even swollen lymph nodes in the groin. Another key difference between STIs and eczema is that STIs are by their very nature communicable (passed from person to person), while eczema is not contagious. If you have irritated skin on your penis that’s accompanied by other worrying symptoms, it’s definitely a good idea to get screened for an STI. The exact of atopic dermatitis is unknown. But it’s believed that both genetics and environmental triggers are behind most cases. . When the body detects an infectious threat, white blood cells trigger an inflammation response to protect the body’s cells. In some people, their immune system is “wired” differently and is overactive in some parts, resulting in eczema symptoms. . There’s a gene in our bodies that creates a protein called filaggrin, which creates a protective barrier on the skin’s surface that keeps moisture in and protects the skin from marauding pathogens and other harmful substances. Among those with eczema, some have a mutation to this gene that reduces filaggrin production — making skin drier and more prone to harm from environmental triggers like those listed below. Environmental factors that can trigger irritant or allergic contact dermatitis include: Some environmental causes of irritant contact dermatitis: prolonged water exposure ( water can be an irritant!) Some environmental causes of allergic contact dermatitis: formaldehyde — found in household cleaners, adhesives (all good things to keep well away from your penis, anyway) certain metals, especially nickel and cobalt (double-check the metal composition of that Prince Albert) isothiazolinones (antibiotic chemicals found in baby wipes and other disinfectants) cocamidopropyl betaine (found in some *ahem* lotions, as well as in hair care products) paraphenylene-diamine (found in leather dyes and temporary tattoos) Again, if it’s eczema or contact dermatitis, there’s no need to worry about contracting or transmitting it. Once you’ve ruled out an STI as the cause of your penile skin symptoms, you can be assured that it’s safe to play. However, bear in mind that eczema symptoms, especially when aggravated by excessive itching, can open up the skin and allow easier transmission of any other infection that you or your partner may have. Here are some home remedies you can try as a first line of defense for mild eczema or contact dermatitis symptoms, on the penis and beyond. . That’s warm water, not hot! (Hot water can make symptoms worse.) Follow up immediately with a cream or ointment (like Vaseline) to lock moisture in — the National Eczema Association doing this within 3 minutes of bathing. . Available in and , colloidal oatmeal helps maintain a moisture barrier on the skin’s surface and can be effective at reducing discomfort. . Not just for sunburns, gives a soothing, cooling sensation to irritated skin too. . A 2010 found that has anti-inflammatory properties, which may help soothe your eczema or contact dermatitis symptoms. If contact dermatitis is suspected, identification and avoidance of the allergen (like an allergy to condoms) is key. Be mindful not to have penetrative sex with a partner after applying topical treatments, as some may be unsafe for internal use — that’s just good manners. Eczema is a personal thing, and this goes double for the penile variety. In addition to the fact that the visible signs of eczema may look differently from person to person, not many people have a passing familiarity with what penis eczema looks like. If you’re experiencing any of the telltale signs of atopic or contact dermatitis listed earlier in this article, it’s a good idea to get checked by a doctor. Doctors — especially dermatologists — are trained to identify these conditions and to differentiate them from various other conditions. They can generally atopic dermatitis with visual examination and a patient’s history. They may also perform a patch test to rule out allergic contact dermatitis. It’s good to know your family medical history before visiting the doctor, as this information may help with diagnosis. A doctor can hook you up with a variety of clinical treatments for what ails your skin. If you have atopic dermatitis, some of the treatments a doctor may recommend include: such as: . These form a physical barrier on the skin to lock in moisture and repair the skin, lasting for several hours before they need to be reapplied. . Corticosteroids are applied to the skin to reduce inflammation and calm irritation. Mild versions are available over the counter, but stronger versions are available by prescription only. . These fight inflammation by a different mechanism than steroids but with a better safety profile when used in areas with thin skin, such as the penis. . , or PDE4, is an enzyme also plays a role in generating inflammation as part of the immune response. Topical PDE4 inhibitors can help calm inflammation. . Skin is exposed to narrow-band ultraviolet B light, which helps to reduce inflammation. . This class of includes azathioprine (oral), cyclosporine (oral), and methotrexate (oral). They’re not approved by the FDA to treat eczema, but they’re sometimes prescribed “off-label” for that purpose. They’re intended to reduce itchiness in order to break the urge to scratch so that skin can heal. . If you’ve ever watched television for more than 5 consecutive minutes, you’ve heard of these — but you may not know what they are. Basically, they’re a specific protein usually delivered via an injection that target and block certain parts of the immune system in the body. It calms an overactive immune response and reduces inflammation and irritation. Dupixent is currently the only FDA approved biologic medication for atopic dermatitis ages 12 years and up. Having dry, cracked, or bleeding skin means your skin barrier won’t be as effective at keeping the bad things out as it would otherwise be. This means there’s an increased likelihood of skin infections from bacteria and viruses. Two of the most common for those with eczema are staph infections and herpes, in the form of eczema herpeticum. Staph is the most common skin infection for those with eczema, and its symptoms include: . Also known as “furuncles,” boils are swollen, painful, pus-filled bumps on the skin caused by infected hair follicles. . Impetigo is characterized by red sores that usually appear on the face, hands, or feet. . Cellulitis is an infection that makes skin red, swollen, painful, and warm to the touch. It’s potentially very serious if left untreated, as it can spread into the bloodstream and become life-threatening. is an unfortunate possibility when a person has both eczema and herpes (either herpes simplex virus 1 or 2). Its symptoms can include: clusters of itchy, painful small erosions or pus bumps that are red, purple, or black in color (and may ooze pus) Like cellulitis, eczema herpeticum is dangerous, especially if it’s all over the skin. Exposure to herpes is therefore a particular concern for those with eczema on the penis who are sexually active, as genital herpes is quite common in the U.S. — , over 1 in 6 of those aged 14 to 49 carry the virus. There’s no guarantee against herpes even if you’re wearing a condom, as herpes is spread by skin-to-skin contact, and only the skin underneath the condom is protected. The virus can be spread even if no visible herpes sores are present. Other comorbid conditions that can affect those with eczema include: Eczema flare-ups may usually last a few days and then gradually clear up with proper treatment and skin care, but their duration can be hard to predict. There may be periods of remission that last for weeks or months, and it isn’t always clear what causes relapse. But there are some precautions you can take to help prevent or calm a flare-up. . Apply a gentle, eczema-formulated moisturizer to your penis as needed, and always after showering or bathing. . Even without eczema, there’s nothing pleasant about scratchy fabric rubbing your parts or underpants that turn the whole region into a swamp; these factors can irritate skin and aggravate eczema. If your skin symptoms are caused by contact dermatitis, the most essential prevention is: . If you’re aware of particular irritants or allergens that cause a skin reaction, avoid them if at all possible. Your doctor or an allergist can help identify such environmental triggers so you can stay one step ahead of trouble. Eczema and eczema-like rashes like contact dermatitis on the penis can feel painful and embarrassing, but rest assured that it happens and there are plenty of treatment options to loosen its grip on your life (and penis). Once you’ve ruled out other possible conditions and obtained a diagnosis, you’ve taken a major step toward a more comfortable future.

Eczema is the most common type of dermatitis. Eczema first appears as an episode of itching and redness of the skin. You also may have tiny bumps or blisters. When eczema develops into a long-term condition, it is called chronic eczema. This leads to: There are many types of eczema. The type depends on the cause, shape and location of the rash. Most eczemas are related to allergies or to contact with irritating substances. Some are associated with fluid retention in the legs. Atopic eczema (atopic dermatitis) — This type of eczema comes and goes repeatedly. It usually occurs in people with an inherited tendency to allergies. These allergies may include allergic asthma, hay fever or food allergies. Atopic eczema appears early in life, usually by 18 months. In babies, atopic eczema primarily affects the: Atopic eczema in older children, teenagers and adults usually involves the: Skin inside the creases of the elbowKneeAnkle or wrist jointsHandsUpper eyelids Contact dermatitis — When irritants touch the skin, they can produce two types of contact dermatitis. Irritant contact dermatitis is the direct irritation of the skin. It can be caused by prolonged contact with irritants such as:DetergentsBubble bathHarsh soapSweatSalivaUrine The second type of contact dermatitis is allergic contact dermatitis. This is an allergic reaction in the skin. This type occurs in people who have an allergy to a specific substance. The most common allergens are poison ivy, poison oak and poison sumac. Other substances that can trigger skin allergies include: Some building materialsCleaning productsDeodorantsCosmetics MedicationsNickel in earrings Chemicals in:FragrancesSkin cream and lotionsShampoosShoesClothing Hand eczema — Hand eczema is limited to the hands. It can be related to atopic eczema. Or it can result from repeated hand washing or exposure to strong detergents. Occasionally, it is caused by an allergy, such as to latex. Nummular eczema — This eczema causes coin sized patches of irritated skin. It typically appears on the legs, arms or chest. It usually occurs in adults. It can be related to atopic dermatitis and, less often, allergic contact dermatitis. Sometimes, it is an allergic reaction to a fungal infection such as athlete's foot. It still appears on the arms, legs or chest, even if the fungal infection is elsewhere on the body. Asteatotic eczema — This eczema dries the skin, causing fine cracks. It often first involves the lower legs. It commonly occurs in the elderly. It is common during winter months spent indoors in low humidity environments. Stasis dermatitis — This type appears on the calves, ankles and feet. It occurs in people who have poorly functioning veins in the lower legs. The veins cause blood to collect in the legs (stasis). This leads to leg swelling, which leads to the signs of stasis dermatitis:ItchingFine red bumpsSkin redness or darkeningWeeping sores Lichen simplex chronicus — This eczema is a reaction to repeated scratching or rubbing of the skin. A nervous scratching habit can lead to thickened, discolored skin. Skin picking can lead to smaller bumps of the same type of rash. Seborrheic dermatitis — This type creates a greasier rash than usual for eczema. This scaly dermatitis commonly appears on the scalp of infants (as cradle cap). In adults, it appears as dandruff. It commonly affects the face or neck around the nose and at the scalp line. Short-term symptoms of eczema include itchy skin, redness and tiny bumps or blisters. If these symptoms remain untreated, the skin can become thick, scaly and dry. There can be areas of hair loss and color changes. Skin affected by long-term eczema is more vulnerable to secondary infections. Each type of eczema has specific characteristics and patterns of symptoms: Atopic eczema (atopic dermatitis) — Atopic dermatitis appears as irritated, red, dry, crusted patches on the skin. If the skin becomes infected, it may develop a wet (weeping) look. Scratching the itchy patches causes more irritation. It increases the risk of infection. Contact dermatitis — When an irritant causes contact dermatitis, symptoms can range from a mild redness to severe skin blistering or ulceration. When triggered by an allergic reaction, it usually causes skin redness, fine red bumps or blisters and severe itching. A reaction caused by plant allergies (like poison ivy or poison oak) is usually intense. It appears as bumps and blisters in lines or streaks where the plant brushed against the skin. Hand eczema — Hand eczema usually appears during the winter as patches of dry, cracked skin. There may or may not be redness. Hand eczema may also cause itching, red bumps or blisters and scaling. Irritation often occurs under rings from soap trapped under the rings. Nummular eczema — Nummular eczema begins as small areas of irritation. They turn into round red, crusted or scaly patches. Asteatotic eczema — This type usually occurs on the lower legs. It causes itching or stinging pain in areas of dry, cracked, reddened skin. There may or may not be tiny bumps. Stasis dermatitis — Stasis dermatitis occurs in legs that are already puffy or swollen. It usually begins with mild redness and itching of the lower legs. If redness and tenderness develop suddenly, it could be caused by a secondary bacterial infection. Bacterial infections require immediate medical attention. Lichen simplex chronicus — This rash creates thickened, leathery skin with darkening of skin color. It is very itchy. Scratching makes the problem worse. Seborrheic dermatitis— Seborrheic dermatitis causes red, scaly patches with yellow, greasy crusts. These patches can be itchy or can cause burning. Patches appear most commonly on the scalp as dandruff. But they also can occur elsewhere on the body. They may appear on the eyebrows, eyelids, ears and skin creases near the mouth and nose. Scalp lesions in infants (cradle cap) can appear yellowish and greasy. They usually cause no discomfort. Depending on your pattern of skin symptoms, your doctor will ask about your: Contact with potential allergy triggers, such as poison ivy In many cases, your doctor can diagnose eczema by examining the skin. If your doctor suspects that allergies are involved, patch testing with various allergy-causing chemicals may be necessary. Duration depends on the type of eczema. Symptoms may go away after a week or two. Or they may persist for years. There are many things you can do to prevent or reduce eczema flare-ups. Avoid exposure to:Extreme temperaturesDry airHarsh soapsPerfumed productsBubble baths Use blankets and clothing made of cotton. Avoid more irritating fabrics, such as wool. Avoid stiff synthetics, such as polyester. After showering or bathing, pat dry (rather than rub). That way, you leave a little moisture on your skin. Then apply a moisturizing cream or lotion to trap moisture in the skin. Use a humidifier to add moisture to indoor air during the winter heating season. To help to prevent contact dermatitis, avoid skin contact with: Dish detergent, cleaning solutions, and other irritating chemicals If you have leg swelling, you can help prevent stasis dermatitis by: Your doctor should review your skin care routine. Your doctor can ensure you are doing everything possible to prevent symptoms. But sometimes eczema remains bothersome despite these measures. Your doctor may prescribe a corticosteroid ointment or cream. In atopic dermatitis, mild or medium strength topical steroids generally are used. These are applied to the affected areas of the skin. Strong steroids and oral antihistamines may be needed to treat allergic contact dermatitis. If there are signs of bacterial skin infection, oral antibiotics usually are needed. Sometimes, in very severe cases of eczema, your doctor will prescribe a short course of oral steroids or stronger immunosuppressants. However, these medications can have serious side effects. They must be used cautiously. In some people, treatment with ultraviolet (UV) light is another option. Seborrhea in adults is best treated with dandruff shampoo. Occasionally prescription antifungal facial creams or rinses may be needed. Cradle cap in infants eventually clears up without treatment. However, it can last several months. The crust usually can be loosened. To do so, apply baby oil to the scalp 30 to 60 minutes before brushing with a soft brush. Then wash with baby shampoo. When treating a contact allergy in a child, avoid topical treatments containing antihistamines. Skin reactions can occur. Call your doctor if you have an area of skin that is red and very itchy. Also call if your skin is cracked, blistered or painfully dry. Ask your doctor for an urgent evaluation if you have signs of infection. These include an area of skin that: The prognosis varies from person to person. It depends on the type of eczema and its response to treatment. Most contact dermatitis heals within two to three weeks. Most stasis dermatitis lasts for years. About half of children with atopic eczema still have the problem as adults. 4460 Redwood Highway, Suite 16DSan Rafael, CA  94903-1953Phone:  (415) 499.3474Toll-Free: (800) 818-7546Fax:  (415) 472-5345   National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin DiseasesInformation ClearinghouseNational Institutes of Health1 AMS CircleBethesda, MD 20892-3675Phone: (301) 495-4484Toll-Free: (877) 226-4267Fax: (301) 718-6366TTY: (301) 565-2966   Medical content reviewed by the Faculty of the Harvard Medical School.

Even worse: It’s not always easy to identify whether or not eczema is actually the culprit. Everything from to a condition like can cause skin issues that may seem like eczema symptoms. Still, if your dry skin makes you think you might be half-alligator, you may be curious about eczema. Below we’ll get into exactly what eczema is, what causes it, and whether or not it’s more than dry skin. You’ll also find a few tips on how to prevent an outbreak and how to find relief. is a chronic skin condition that causes itching and inflammation, the explains. It can develop at any age, but it usually begins in children around the age of five, according to the (AAD). For the record, eczema is not contagious, but there is some evidence that it can run in families, . And though many people think of eczema as one specific skin condition, there are actually a few main types: Atopic dermatitis is considered “classic eczema,” , M.D., assistant clinical professor of dermatology at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai Hospital, . This means that when most people say “eczema,” they’re probably talking about atopic dermatitis. It is the medical term for eczema as a condition, though, and all of the other types are considered subtypes of eczema, . Dyshidrosis, or dyshidrotic eczema, is a condition that leaves people with small, fluid-filled blisters that often show up on the palms of the hands and soles of the feet, according to the . It’s more common in people who already have atopic dermatitis, according to the . These rashes also tend to include extreme itching and last for several weeks, the explains. This type of eczema—often called nummular eczema or discoid eczema—happens after some kind of skin injury (like a bug bite, burn, or cut), . Basically, these small reddened bumps commonly start on your arms, legs, hands, feet, or torso. Then they cluster to form a coin-shaped rash, the explains. These bumps can last for weeks or even months, and they tend to burn and itch while they’re around. Seborrheic dermatitis occurs on your scalp and is often called seborrheic eczema or seborrheic psoriasis, the explains. This type of eczema causes large flakes on your scalp (yep, dandruff) as well as on the sides of your nose, your eyelids, ears, and chest, the says. As , doctors aren’t exactly sure why people get seborrheic dermatitis, but they suspect it’s due to something called malassezia, which is a yeast that is typically in the oil that your skin normally secretes. It might also be due to an overactive immune system, the explains. Sometimes called venous eczema, the says that this type of eczema is often caused by poor circulation. More specifically, venous eczema starts on your lower legs and ankles (which tends to be where starts), the explains. You might feel heaviness and aching when you walk for a while, but symptoms also include swelling and varicose veins with dry, itchy skin over them. Additionally, your skin might feel swollen, sore, and irritated, the says. Generally speaking, eczema happens because of a skin barrier dysfunction that makes your top layer of skin unable to properly retain moisture and protect you from things like irritants, allergens, and environmental elements, according to the . This can result in inflammation that leads to dry, irritated skin, , M.D., a New York City-based and board-certified dermatologist, tells SELF. Eczema is a chronic condition, but different things can make it worse and trigger outbreaks. For instance, eczema is associated with health issues like and hay fever, so it’s no surprise that all three conditions have some similar triggers, like pollen, mold, dust mites, pet dander, cold and dry air, having a , being exposed to irritating chemicals or fabrics, stress, and fragrances. Some other factors can also make eczema worse, like taking a long, steaming-hot shower and not moisturizing your skin well afterward, according to the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID). While that might make anyone’s skin feel tight and uncomfortable, people with eczema can experience a serious symptom flare-up due to their frail skin barriers, Cynthia Bailey, M.D., a diplomate of the American Board of Dermatology and founder of , tells SELF. If you have eczema, you might also notice that using certain soaps when you shower or wash your hands results in worse symptoms. (This can even happen with your shampoo because, as we mentioned, you can get .) This is because fragrant, antibacterial, or otherwise harsh products can wash away too much of your skin’s natural moisture, according to the . Nope, it’s way more complicated than that. For starters, there are times when it’s completely normal for anyone’s skin to feel super dry, Dr. Bailey says. For instance, if you’ve been out in cold, windy weather, haven’t been lately, or haven’t used lotion in so long you barely remember what it is, you may experience dry skin as a result. If your skin is dry, it’s probably going to be a little itchy at some point. But itchiness from eczema can be a whole other ball game. Depending on how severe your eczema is, the itching can be intense and constant, even pulling the unfair move of feeling worse when you try to go to sleep. (After you’ve wrapped up your day, there’s less stuff to distract you from the itching sensation, Dr. Bailey explains.) Besides dry, itchy skin, what are the other eczema symptoms? The itching may also come along with a rash of red or brown patches in a few key areas of your body. These patches are most likely to show up on your hands, feet, ankles, wrists, neck, upper chest, eyelids, and inside the bends of your elbows and knees, according to the . You might have small, raised bumps that itch, then weep fluid and crust over when you scratch them. It might feel irresistible to attack your eczema with your nails, but try not to. “Scratching tends to only make it worse,” , an assistant professor of dermatology at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, tells SELF. If you scratch, your skin may also become swollen and raw, the explains. If you do indeed have eczema, your doctor can advise you about which anti-itch cream might be right for you. It could be a prescription corticosteroid cream to combat inflammation, or it might be an over-the-counter hydrocortisone cream to do the same, according to the . Depending on the type of eczema you have, your doctor might also prescribe an antibiotic to treat any bacterial infections that might have occurred from scratching or blistering. If you have stasis dermatitis, your doctor might also suggest wearing compression tights to improve circulation, along with some of the aforementioned treatments to help manage other symptoms, . You should reach for gentle soaps and shampoos if your skin gets irritated easily, whether or not you have eczema, , M.D., a New York City–based board-certified dermatologist, tells SELF. Look for ones that have as few fragrances, alcohols, and dyes as possible. help seal moisture into your skin, making it less dry in the process, the explains. But if you have eczema, skin irritation, dryness, and itching can still persist even after using your garden-variety moisturizer, , M.D., assistant clinical professor of dermatology at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, tells SELF. That doesn’t mean you should just skip this step if you have eczema—it’s the exact opposite because your skin desperately needs the moisture. You may just need to pick your moisturizer wisely and apply it more often. Moisturizing your skin two to three times a day with heavy ointments like petroleum jelly may help, the says. Much like your soap, your moisturizers should be free of alcohol, scents, dyes, and other skin-irritating chemicals. You might even consider getting a to keep more moisture in the air at your home. But if you’ve followed these guidelines and your skin is still parched, irritated, and generally giving you grief, it’s time to see a doctor. Whether you know you have eczema for a fact or just suspect you have the skin condition, it’s really a good idea to talk to a dermatologist to come up with an individualized treatment plan that works for you, Dr. Gunn says. While there’s no cure for , there are plenty of treatments that can keep dry skin and itchiness at bay.

e46ad9e1-5461-4ed0-867b-97cf82e4518e,"Blocking Nerve Cells Could Provide Eczema Itch Relief — Researchers have identified the “first responders” that set off the cycle of itching and scratching in atopic dermatitis. For the 10 percent of people who have ever experienced the dry, itchy skin and rashes of a type of eczema called atopic dermatitis, relief from this chronic condition is long overdue. Researchers at the University of California, Berkeley have developed a new understanding of how the nervous and immune systems interact to cause the itching and inflammation typical of atopic dermatitis, which could one day lead to new therapies. Atopic dermatitis, or allergic eczema, which and two percent of adults in the U.S., involves changes to the skin’s normal mechanisms of inflammation. In people with atopic dermatitis, when the skin becomes irritated—by chemicals, allergens, or other irritants—a cycle of itching and scratching occurs that causes cracked or scaly skin. In severe cases, scratching may also lead to skin infections that require treatment with antibiotics. There’s currently no cure for atopic dermatitis. Most treatments attempt to reduce inflammation, relieve itching, or prevent flare-ups. These include over-the-counter anti-itch creams and antihistamines like Benadryl. To date, most of the research on atopic dermatitis has focused on identifying the chemicals that cause the itching and inflammation. Drugs in development are aimed at blocking the response of the immune system to damaged skin cells caused by repeated scratching. Learn About Eczema Symptoms, Causes, and Treatments Researchers Identify First Responders to Atopic Dermatitis In a , published in the journal , Berkeley researchers instead turned their attention to sensory neurons—or nerves—in the skin. These are the first components of the skin that react to irritating chemicals. “Most drug development has focused on trying to find a way to inhibit the immune response,” says UC Berkeley neuroscientist Diana Bautista, Ph.D., in a . “Now that we have found that sensory neurons may be the first responders, that changes how we think about the disease.” Blocking these nerves would stop the itching before it even began. This would prevent people from scratching, which damages the skin and leads to more inflammation. It might also head off the immune system response that can result in other allergic reactions in people with atopic dermatitis. This “atopic march,” as it’s called, can lead to food allergies, asthma, and nasal allergies. Read More: How the Immune Response Helps Defend the Body Against Pathogens Currently, there are no drugs that are approved to block these sensory nerves in the skin, but the researchers have identified a potential medicine that’s currently being tested for another inflammatory disease. This topical drug has been shown to stop mice from scratching. The skin’s reaction to irritants hinges on a cytokine known as thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP). This chemical, which is released by skin cells, acts on sensory nerves and immune cells—both of which are involved in causing the symptoms of atopic dermatitis. Researchers once thought that sensory nerves wouldn’t react unless the immune cells were first triggered by TSLP. The current study, though, showed that this is not the case. Bautista and her colleagues have identified two possible ways to prevent sensory nerves from reacting to skin irritants. One is to block part of the receptor on the nerve that responds to TSLP, which is known as the wasabi ion channel because it responds to “mustard compounds” like those found in wasabi. The other option would be to block the release of TSLP from damaged skin cells. Both would be potential targets for new drugs—which have yet to be developed. One of the advantages of blocking the sensory nerves that react to TSLP is that it is a more focused approach than stopping the reaction of large numbers of immune cells. “These itch-sensitive neurons are a small population,” says Bautista. “If we could just block the two percent of neurons that respond to TSLP, we could have a really selective drug that treats chronic itch, but keeps all of the important functions of skin—normal pain function, normal temperature and tactile sensations—and the many parts of the immune system intact.” — Medically reviewed by For most people, eczema is a lifelong condition that consists of occasional flare-ups.

fca8fe51-1e94-41a3-857d-22e02a88c209,"To revisit this article, visit My Profile, then . 5 Types of Eczema You Should Know, Because There’s Actually More Than One 5 Types of Eczema You Should Know, Because There’s Actually More Than One Not-so-fun fact: There are way more types of out there than you might realize. “Eczema” is often used as a blanket term to describe different types of rashes, , M.D., a New York City-based board-certified dermatologist and director of cosmetic and clinical research in dermatology at Mount Sinai Medical Center, tells SELF. In general, these rashes will make it feel like your skin has taken you hostage, encasing you (or part of you, at least) in an itchy shell. Beyond that, each type of eczema has its own distinct features. “I see patients with eczema many times a day because there are so many types,” Cynthia Bailey, M.D., a diplomate of the American Board of Dermatology and president and CEO of Inc., tells SELF. Here are the common types of eczema dermatologists want you to know. “This is the classic eczema,” , M.D., assistant clinical professor of dermatology at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai Hospital, tells SELF, meaning it’s the one most people are thinking of when they hear the word “eczema.” That’s fitting, since atopic dermatitis is indeed the clinical name for plain ol’ , as opposed to the other items on this list, which are special forms of eczema. Atopic dermatitis is not to be confused with , which is basically any skin inflammation caused by direct contact with an irritating substance—like poison ivy, makeup that irritates you, or even a toxic substance like pepper spray. Atopic dermatitis is most common in children, according to the , but about half of people who develop atopic dermatitis as a kid will have milder signs of the condition as an adult. These symptoms run the gamut. They include , itching, and red or brownish-gray patches that can appear anywhere—like your —but are most likely to pop up on your , feet, ankles, wrists, neck, upper chest, eyelids, and inside the crooks of your elbows and knees, according to the . Atopic dermatitis can also appear as thick, cracked, scaly skin or small bumps that might release fluid, then crust over if you scratch them. This can lead to skin infections, which is why it’s key that anyone with atopic dermatitis is under a dermatologist’s care. While researchers are still trying to figure out what exactly causes atopic dermatitis, it seems to run in families that have a history of the condition, or of or hay fever, the says. Treatment options depend on how severe your atopic dermatitis is, but they generally center around increasing your skin’s moisture and calming itchy inflammation or irritation. Your doctor might recommend creams or ointments with those goals in mind, the says. They may also suggest a bare minimum of times you should moisturize each day, plus other lifestyle modifications, like using a humidifier to try to add more moisture to the air. You might think you can just handle all of this on your own, but your doctor may also be able to ID things that are irritating your without you realizing it. “Proper skincare is extremely important in treating eczema,” Dr. Zeichner says. “The right skin care products can keep your skin under control, but the wrong ones can make it worse.” Here are some to look into—ask your doctor if you’d like more specific guidance from there. This just...shouldn’t even exist. Dyshidrotic eczema makes very small, fluid-filled blisters bubble up on your skin, typically on the palms of your hands, sides of your fingers, and soles of your feet, the says. “It is intensely itchy,” Dr. Bailey says. “It can be very debilitating,” she adds, which makes sense if you think about how often you use your hands and walk on your feet. The blisters usually last around three weeks and, once they dry out, your skin might be scaly in the aftermath, the says. Relentless, the blisters usually come back for another go, sometimes before your skin even has a chance to heal completely from the previous round. You have a higher risk of developing dyshidrotic eczema if you also have atopic dermatitis, contact dermatitis, dyshidrotic eczema in your family, or hay fever, the says. People who have sweaty or moist hands may also have flares every spring and summer when the temperature rises and they’re more prone to perspiring. Finally, the condition is more common in people whose hands are wet a lot throughout the day like health care workers, hairstylists, and florists, as well as people who work with cement, chromium, cobalt, or nickel, the says. There are a few ways to treat this condition, per the , including corticosteroid creams and ointments to speed up the blisters’ progress. The only way to figure out what exactly is best for you is to discuss your case with a doctor so you can get back to using your hands and walking around in peace. Sometimes called , this describes coin-shaped or oval sores that may pop up on your skin after an injury like a burn, abrasion, or insect bite (because apparently those just aren’t enough?). Nummular dermatitis usually starts on your legs, torso, arms, hands, and feet as tiny, red spots and blister-like sores that weep fluid and crust over, the says. Then different spots actually join together and grow into a distinct coin-shaped patch. The patches can last for weeks or even months, itching and burning as they stick around. Experts aren’t 100 percent sure why people get nummular dermatitis, but risk factors include having injured your skin in some way, having very dry skin, living in a cold, dry area, or having some other form of eczema like atopic dermatitis. Your risk may also rise if you take medications like (which is used to treat ) and interferon (which is used to treat several cancers and some viral infections), the says. Having a sensitivity to substances like nickel may also play a role. Doctors generally treat nummular dermatitis with drugs to reduce inflammation and itchiness, the says. But, if your oozing blisters create a portal for a bacterial skin infection, you may also need an antibiotic. Your doctor will also recommend that you hydrate your skin really well, the says, and they can offer specific tips to help you do just that. Seborrheic dermatitis, sometimes known as seborrheic eczema, mainly impacts people’s scalps. It usually causes scaly patches, red skin, and, yup, that just won’t quit. It can also impact other oily areas of your body like your face, the sides of your nose, and your eyebrows, ears, eyelids, and chest, the says. Experts aren’t 100 percent sure what causes seborrheic dermatitis, but they think it may have something to do with a yeast called malassezia that’s normally in your skin’s oil secretions, according to the . An overactive immune system may also be a factor. Treatment generally includes things like drugs to control inflammation and antifungal shampoos to combat yeast overgrowth, the says. You may even be able to use these shampoos on parts of your body besides your scalp that are affected, or use mild shampoo to wash areas like your eyelids. As with many other conditions, warding off seborrheic dermatitis involves babying your skin while using the right combination of products to make your skin behave as well as possible. Your doctor can help you land on the right mix of methods for you. Also called venous eczema, this condition is distinct from others on this list in that it’s linked with poor circulation. Since poor blood flow usually happens in your lower legs, this is where stasis dermatitis most often crops up, the says. Insufficient circulation can make fluid build up in your legs, creating pressure and making it hard for oxygen and blood to reach your skin, which is when symptoms arise. Swelling around your ankles is usually the first sign of stasis dermatitis, the says. The swelling tends to happen when you sleep and come back the next day. Discolored skin and varicose veins can also be early signs. As stasis dermatitis progresses, you might grapple with dry, cracked, itchy skin, red or purplish open sores, sores that leak fluid and scab over, and shiny skin. Stasis dermatitis is largely an issue for people over the age of 50, the says, but having varicose veins, high blood pressure, a history of , many pregnancies, being very overweight, or having a heart condition that reduces blood flow can increase your risk at any age. Doctors may choose to treat stasis dermatitis with compression stockings to reduce swelling, a corticosteroid cream to reduce inflammation, an antihistamine to treat the itch, and a moisturizer that’s free of fragrances, dyes, or perfumes to help with the dry skin, the says. With that said, like all the other conditions on this list, treatment will depend on the specifics of your particular dry, itchy, aggravatingly inflamed case. 11 Things Dermatologists Want You to Know About Sensitive Skin 9 People Describe What It's Really Like to Have Eczema Korin is a former New Yorker who now lives at the beach.

A person with an itchy skin situation which does not improve and the skin becomes inflamed, bumpy, or swollen; ; or areas contain crusty sores or blisters that seep clear liquid, should consult with a medical practitioner or dermatologist. The majority of itchy skin problems related to medical conditions are generally diagnosed as one of the three most typical skin conditions: , Atopic Dermatitis, or Psoriases.

Eczema is a generic word, applied to a number of skin rashes, and is often used interchangeably with the term Atopic Dermatitis.

Eczema symptoms, not related to Dermatitis, involve dry, sensitive skin with mild, moderate, or severe itchy sensations; red, inflamed skin; recurring rash; skin swelling; rough or dark colored patches; and bumpy areas that may ooze a clear fluid. A family doctor or dermatologist may conduct various tests to arrive at a diagnosis and a treatment plan to treat the precise form of a patient’s Eczema. Depending on the degree of an Eczema attack, treatment may involve hydrocortisone or corticosteroid creams to be applied topically; calcineurin inhibitors instead of a steroid cream for small to moderate itchy areas; oral antihistamines to reduce the itch; ultraviolet light therapy; or antidepressants to work against certain types of itching. There is no definitive cause for Atopic Dermatitis, but according to the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, nearly one-third of all children with this type of Eczema have . Atopic Dermatitis is not contagious, not an allergy, has no known current cure, and is the most long-lasting form of Eczema. Treatment for this infection may include hydrocortisone or corticosteroid creams to be applied to the exterior of the skin; oral antihistamines to calm the itching sensation; calcineurin inhibitor cream for smaller affected areas; and ultraviolet light therapy for severe rashes. Psoriasis, an itchy skin condition, is an autoimmune disease that typically attacks the surface skin of the scalp, and the outside of the knees and elbows. According to , a health care physician or dermatologist is able to make a visual inspection to make a psoriasis diagnosis. Psoriasis resembles Eczema with several distinct differences. Psoriasis plaques are thicker, more inflamed, better defined and fuller in texture than the flatter Eczema plaques. Psoriasis also appears on the lower back, on the palms of hands, on the face, and on the soles of the feet. A rare form of Psoriasis, Erythrodermic, is extremely inflammatory and affects almost all body surfaces. This form of Psoriasis is very serious, may be life-threatening, and requires immediate medical attention. may involve one or a combination of treatments that may include topical prescription creams, either with or without steroids; ultraviolet light therapy; or systemic medications taken orally or by injections for individuals with arthritis or those with symptoms unresponsive to other forms of treatments.

58e447f0-ee14-4194-9d3d-6f683851e39e,"Medically reviewed by — — Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic skin condition characterized by dry, itchy skin. AD is often referred to as , a word that refers to a broader group of skin conditions. “Dermatitis” refers to a condition of the skin and “atopic” relates to diseases caused by allergic reactions. As an atopic disease, AD is in the same classification as and . All types of eczema cause itching and redness, but AD is the most severe and chronic type of eczema. Other types of eczema include: contact dermatitis, which occurs only when the skin makes contact with certain substances dyshidrotic eczema, a blistering form of eczema that’s found only on the fingers, palms, and soles of the feet Doctors and researchers are working to better understand how eczema works and why it affects so many people. There’s currently no known cure for this common disease. The primary symptom of AD is dry, itchy skin that often turns into a red rash. During a flare, AD becomes a red, itchy rash. Many different physical and internal factors can trigger an eczema flare-up. The resulting inflammation causes increased blood flow and the urge to itch. Eczema flares are part of the agonizing itch-scratch cycle. It’s hard to fight the physical and psychological components that drive the itch-scratch cycle. Scratching feels good at the time but can lead to more inflammation and even skin infections. AD presents different symptoms depending on a person’s age. Infants with these symptoms may have trouble sleeping due to itchy skin. Infants with AD may also develop skin infections from scratching. a rash in the creases of the elbows, knees, or both rashes on the neck and face, especially around the eyes Adults who had AD as children may have discolored skin that is easily irritated. About people have eczema and people have AD. Statistics from the show how common AD and eczema are. The prevalence of childhood AD is 10.7 percent in the United States. Approximately one in three children with AD has a moderate to severe form. For adults, the prevalence is as high as 10.2 percent. According to the , 90 percent of people with AD get it before age 5. It’s rare that somebody will be diagnosed with AD if they didn’t have it as a child. There seems to be a genetic component to AD. People with AD typically have a family member affected by AD, allergies, or asthma. The exact cause of AD is unknown. AD isn’t contagious, so you can’t give the rash to someone else. The basic understanding of AD is that inflammation results from the presence of too many inflammatory cells in the skin. There’s also evidence that people with AD have a compromised skin barrier compared to normal skin. Because of the altered skin barrier, people with AD have drier skin. AD skin is more prone to water loss and the entry of irritants. This all leads to the development of red, itchy rashes. You’ll need to learn what triggers your AD flare-ups, but common lifestyle and environmental triggers include: There’s no known cure for AD. Finding the right treatment is important to help reduce itching and discomfort. Calming the skin reduces stress and helps prevent excessive scratching that leads to skin infections. Treatment options vary from over-the-counter skin care, prescription medication, and lifestyle changes. The best preventive measure is to moisturize the skin. This improves the function of the skin barrier. Healthier skin will become inflamed less often and provide a better barrier against allergens and irritants. Bathing and moisturizing each day is the simplest way to hydrate your skin. It’s important to apply a moisturizer within minutes of bathing. You should see your primary care physician or a dermatologist to receive your initial diagnosis. A doctor can help you create an effective treatment plan and help you understand your triggers. If you’re feeling stressed due to AD or are losing sleep, speak with your doctor. Call your doctor right away if you see signs of a bacterial skin infection, such as: pain, swelling, tenderness, or heat around the rash By learning your triggers and taking good care of your skin, you can reduce the frequency and severity of AD flare-ups. Even if your first treatment plan doesn’t work, there are many different things you can try. You and your doctor can work together to find a combination that works for you and your skin.

3fb9ede1-fd7a-4d67-9218-d82fc39d8b83,"Medically reviewed by — — Pityriasis alba is a that mostly affects children and young adults. The exact cause is unknown. However, it’s believed that the condition may be associated with eczema, a common skin disorder that causes scaly, itchy rashes. People with pityriasis alba develop red or pink patches on their skin that are usually round or oval. The patches usually clear up with moisturizing creams or go away on their own. However, they often leave pale marks on the skin after the redness has faded. People with pityriasis alba get round, oval, or irregularly shaped patches of pale pink or red skin. The patches are usually scaly and dry. They may appear on the: Pale pink or red spots may fade into light-colored patches after several weeks. These patches usually clear up within a few months, but they can last for several years in some cases. They’re more noticeable in the summer months when the surrounding skin becomes tan. This is because the pityriasis patches don’t tan. Wearing sunscreen may make the patches less noticeable in the summer months. The light patches are also more noticeable in people with darker skin. The exact cause of pityriasis alba isn’t known. However, it’s commonly considered a mild form of , a type of . Eczema may be caused by an overactive immune system that responds to irritants aggressively. The skin’s ability to act as a barrier is reduced in people with eczema. Normally, the immune system ignores normal proteins and only attacks the proteins of harmful substances, such as bacteria and viruses. If you have eczema, however, your immune system may not always distinguish between the two, and instead attack healthy substances in your body. This causes inflammation. It’s similar to having an allergic reaction. Most people outgrow eczema and pityriasis alba by early adulthood. Pityriasis alba is most common in children and adolescents. It occurs in approximately of children. It’s most frequently seen in children between the ages of 6 and 12 years. It’s also very common in children with atopic dermatitis, an itchy inflammation of the skin. Pityriasis alba often appears in children who take hot baths frequently or who are exposed to the sun without sunscreen. However, it’s unclear if these factors cause the skin condition. No treatment is required for pityriasis alba. The patches usually go away with time. Your doctor may prescribe a moisturizing cream or topical steroid cream such as hydrocortisone to treat the condition. In some cases, your doctor may prescribe a nonsteroid cream, such as pimecrolimus. Both types of creams can help reduce skin discoloration and relieve any dryness, scaling, or itchiness. Even if you’ve had treatment, the patches can return in the future. You may need to use the creams again. In most cases, however, pityriasis alba goes away by adulthood.

20faf7bb-4d48-41d6-bd5f-8caf422990da,"Nummular eczema – Definition, Complications, Causes, Treatments and Pictures – Baby How nummular eczema looks like? What are typical manifestations? What should I do to reduce nummular eczema relapses? Nummular (means coin-shaped) eczema or nummular dermatitis or discoid eczema is a rare inflammatory skin form of eczema characterized with coin-shaped/discoid and itchy spots or patches on the skin. It usually appears after a skin injury including: burns, abrasions or insect bite. 1 or many patches may affect the skin that can last for weeks or months. The condition aims to be chronic, with reappearances and exacerbations that may last several years. The exact cause of nummular eczema isn’t known. However, the skin condition is most common among people with a history of asthma, allergies or atopic dermatitis. The prevalence of this condition is rare and is around 2 per 1,000 people. It is more prevalent in men than in women. It can be most commonly seen in males and females of around 50-65 years of age or in women of around 15-25 years of age. It is rare in children. Nummular eczema may never be healed completely. However, it can be treated with different lifestyle changes and medical treatment. Different from other types of eczemas, it is very rare and difficult to treat. How nummular eczema looks like? What are typical manifestations? Following characteristics are typical for nummular eczema: Nummular eczema can be described as round or oval erythematous plaques. They are most often localized on extremities, particularly on the legs. However, they may also occur on the hands, trunk or feet. The face and scalp are usually not involved. The lesions begin to appear as erythematous or violaceous vesicles or papules. They then coalesce forming confluent plaques. Due to excoriation, erosions may appear over the lesions, and itch may become very intense. Initial lesions, especially vesicles, are often infected with staphylococci, producing yellowish crust. Intense infections, with the signs of cellulitis surrounding the plaques, need oral antibiotics treatment. After some days, plaques usually become dry, crusty and more violaceous, particularly when they are localized above the knee. The lesions become macules after some time, usually with brown hyperpigmentation caused by inflammation. It progressively lightens, and the pigment will probably never fade, particularly when they are below the knee. Plaques may be cleared in the center and be similar to tinea corporis. Intensity of the condition usually varies rather than being constant. The skin eruptions are very itchy; they may also burn or sting. Itching is always the most intensive at night. It has been showed that nummular eczema has seasonal difference in intensity. It is the worse during dry and cold weather and better in warm and humid conditions. There is no exact cause for defining true mechanism of nummular eczema developing, but there are some theories. One study found that elderly patients with nummular eczema had higher sensitivity to environmental aeroallergens compared to controls. Impaired cutaneous barrier in the case of nummular eczema may also cause increased vulnerability to allergic contact dermatitis to materials such as metals, soaps, and chemicals. The other study identified neurogenic factors that may lead to inflammation in both atopic dermatitis and nummular eczema by examining the correlation between mast cells and sensory nerves and recognizing the supply of neuropeptides compounds in the skin (epidermis and upper dermis) of patients with nummular eczema. It has been proposed that release of histamine and other inflammatory substances from mast cells may cause pruritus due to interaction with neural C-fibers. Furthermore, substance P and calcitonin gene-related peptide fibers were obviously increased in lesion samples when compared with nonlesional samples in patients with nummular eczema. These neuropeptides compounds may stimulate release of other cytokines and further promote inflammation. The true cause and mechanism of causing nummular eczema is yet unknown. However it has been proposed that sensitivity plays an important role in some cases. A person with nummular eczema may be sensitive to: Metals, including nickel and rarely mercury that can be found in dental fillings. The best way to avoid nummular eczema is to avoid contact with substances that may lead to hypersensitivity reactions. Findings also suggest that except sensitivity the incidence of nummular dermatitis may be increased if you live in a cold, dry climate or have: Different type of eczema, for example atopic dermatitis or stasis dermatitis. Injured your skin caused by insect bite, contact with chemicals, or abrasion Taken certain drugs such as isotretinoin or interferon. Isotretinoin, that is used to treat severe acne, may increase the risk for this skin problem. Interferon can cause as a side effect severe widespread nummular eczema. In most cases, the typical appearance of nummular eczema is quite characteristic that diagnosis can be confirmed already after physical examination. In some cases following laboratory procedures can be done in order to confirm the diagnosis: Bacterial swabs may confirm colonization or infection. Scrapings are usually taken for mycology, as nummular eczema can be misdiagnosed with tinea corporis or ringworm infection. Patch testing is sometimes needed in order to see if the contact allergy is responsible for this eczema. In most cases no specific allergy can be found. Nummular eczema is very similar to following skin conditions, thus in order to avoid misdiagnosis, differential diagnosis should be considered: This condition usually has only a few vesicles that are raised narrow border and scale on the outside of the plaque. , including atopic dermatitis and asteatotic eczema are very similar but fortunately treatment is similar. may sometimes show a similar pattern. often occurs on the lower extremities, neck, scalp, or on the scrotum. The main difference from nummular eczema is that it is lichenified or thickened by chronic scratching, and often has no clear border. may occur concurrently on the lower extremities and venous stasis may lead to the development of both conditions. are often found elbows, knees and the scalp. The scale is usually thick and silver. Excoriation or infection may leave permanent scars. Lesions on the lower extremities may leave permanent brown macules. What should I do to reduce nummular eczema relapses? In order to reduce nummular eczema reoccurrence following tips may be helpful: Use moisturizers in order to keep the skin well hydrated. Take cool or lukewarm bathes, avoid hot one. Do not use soap. Oils should be added to the bath. After a bath or shower, dry the skin and apply an emollient. Wear loose clothes of materials that do not irritate. A room humidifier may be helpful, especially those with central heating or air conditioning. Apply oil such as Alpha-Keri oil or Neutrogena body oil to the skin at the end of ones shower. Vaseline is also very helpful if not too oily. Do not take more than 2 baths or shower a day. Soap may irritate and dry off the skin, so keep it away from the eczema. When bathing reduce the use of soap to the face, genital area, armpits and feet. For soap, use Oil of Olay, Cetaphil, Dove or Basis. Avoid contact with rough clothing such as wool. Cotton clothes (100%) are recommended. When laundering, use no fabric softener, such as Kling or dryer sheets. Wash the clothes using dye free, fragrance free detergents with sign “All free” detergent. It is possible to find a treatment routine that controls nummular eczema, thus it is very important to avoid all potential materials that you are hypersensitive to. Patients should shower in cold water or take a cold/lukewarm bath 1-2 a day. Moisturizers or medicated topical preparations should be used to cover the water in the skin. If medication is applied on damp skin it helps seal it and aids penetration. Topical corticosteroids very efficiently reduce inflammation. Usually mild ones are recommendable but in severe disease, stronger corticosteroids may be required and in most severe cases, oral steroids are required. Mild topical corticosteroids such as hydrocortisone are safe for daily use if necessary. Strong corticosteroids should not be used during a period longer than 2 weeks, more than 2 times a day. Intralesional steroid injection is sometimes injected into one or two mostly persistent areas of discoid eczema. This treatment is unsuitable for multiple lesions. Ointments aim to be more effective than creams. Topical applications effects can be improved by occlusion or by applying ointment on wet skin that has been soaking and has not been dried. Tacrolimus and pimecrolimus can be used as an alternative for steroid-resistant cases. If secondary infection occurs then topical antibiotics such as flucloxacilin are needed. Oral antibiotics such as dicloxacillin, cephalexin, or erythromycin that are effective against staphylococci and streptococci infections are recommended. Severe pruritus that may be very unpleasant and cause sleep disturbance is typical for nummular eczema. Antihistamines may be very effective in that case. As the pruritus is often not directly associated with histamine, the sedative effect is more important than the antihistamine action so the older, 1 generation antihistamines are recommended. A higher dose at night will aid sleep. Tar preparations may be helpful for inflammation relief, particularly in older, thickened, scaly plaques. After the eruption has been resolved, patients should continue with aggressive hydration in order to reduce relapses especially in dry climates. Moisturizers for sensitive skin can be administrated Petroleum jelly can be also applied to damp skin after showering. Resting in a moist and cool environment helps, whilst a hot dry environment worsens the symptoms Sunlight or phototherapy can be considered for intense chronic cases. Phototherapy several times weekly during the period of 6–12 weeks can reduce degree and severity of nummular eczema. UV radiation may relieve inflammatory activity within the skin but there is risk of heat worsening the pruritus and UV has its own disadvantages such as provoking carcinogenesis. Persistent and intensive nummular eczema can be treated with immunosuppressant drugs such as methotrexate, azathioprine or cyclosporine. Studies showed that children responded well to methotrexate therapy. An emollient or moisturizing cream or ointment is very important if the surface of the chronic patches is dry and scaly. These preparations should be applied to unaffected skin, especially if dryness is severe. The emollient should be continued even after the patches have cleared and the corticosteroid preparation has been discontinued. Emollient creams are essentially moisturizers that are very important for eczema treatment. The more you use emollients the less steroid creams or other aggressive products you will need. Emollients work by filling the gaps between the skin cells so they can fill with water and swell up again. Patients with eczema should use emollient cream very frequently, almost every hour if the skin is very dry, all over their body, even where the skin isn’t affected. Apply after bathing, while water is still trapped in the skin, for extra hydration. Emollients with a higher oil are better moisturizers but also greasy. Those with mild nummular eczema should try light emollients such as Oilatum lotion and E45. For moderate nummular eczema, more oily products should be used such as: Aveeno cream, E45 cream, DiproBase cream, Dexeryl and Oilatum. For severe eczema Hydromol ointment, Diprobase ointment, 50/50, are recommended. Urea absorbs water to the skin. There are some studies suggesting that urea creams are more effective than typical emollients, however urea products have not been examined well in children. However, it has to be known that when urea is applied on very dry skin it can irritate the skin so you might need to apply regular emollient cream first. Products you may try are: Balneum Plus, Balneum cream, Aquadrate, Calmurid and Eucerin urea cream. “Herpetic whitlow (whitlow finger) in Adults: Condition, Treatments, and Pictures“ 6 Unconventional Weight Loss Tips That Will Actually Work Popular Heartburn Drug Contains Chemicals Linked To Cancer 10 Diet and Weight Loss Products Available at Urban Outfitters Aspirin Linked To Higher Survival Rates For Head, Neck, and Lung Cancers Vitamin D Supplements May Slow Diabetes Progression Eating Between Certain Hours Can Accelerate Weight Loss 3 Mistakes You’re Making When Exercising In the Heat © 2021 All texts are the intellectual property of this site.

Types of common eczemas Atopic eczema (aka infantile e., flexural e., atopic dermatitis) is an allergic disease believed to have a hereditary component, and often runs in families whose members also have hay fever and asthma. Itchy rash is particularly noticeable on head and scalp, neck, inside of elbows, behind knees, and buttocks. Experts are urging doctors to be more vigilant in weeding out cases that are, in actuality, irritant contact dermatitis. It is very common in developed countries, and rising. Contact dermatitis is of two types: allergic (resulting from a delayed reaction to some allergen, such as poison ivy or nickel), and irritant (resulting from direct reaction to a detergent, such as sodium lauryl sulfate, for example). Some substances act both as allergen and irritant (wet cement, for example). Other substances cause a problem after sunlight exposure, bringing on phototoxic dermatitis. About three quarters of cases of contact eczema are of the irritant type, which is the most common occupational skin disease. Contact eczema is curable provided the offending substance can be avoided, and its traces removed from ones environment. Xerotic eczema (aka asteatotic e., e. craquele or craquelatum, winter itch, pruritus hiemalis) is dry skin that becomes so serious it turns into eczema. It worsens in dry winter weather, and limbs and trunk are most often affected. The itchy, tender skin resembles a dry, cracked, river bed. This disorder is very common among the older population. Ichthyosis is a related disorder. Seborrhoeic dermatitis or Seborrheic dermatitis (""cradle cap"" in infants) is a condition sometimes classified as a form of eczema which is closely related to dandruff. It causes dry or greasy peeling of the scalp, eyebrows, and face, and sometimes trunk. The condition is harmless except in severe cases of cradle cap. In newborns it causes a thick, yellow crusty scalp rash called cradle cap which seems related to lack of biotin, and is often curable. Less common eczemas Dyshidrosis (aka dyshidrotic e., pompholyx, vesicular palmoplantar dermatitis, housewifes eczema) only occurs on palms, soles, and sides of fingers and toes. Tiny opaque bumps called vesicles, thickening, and cracks are accompanied by itching which gets worse at night. A common type of hand eczema, it worsens in warm weather. Discoid eczema (aka nummular e., exudative e., microbial e.) is characterized by round spots of oozing or dry rash, with clear boundaries, often on lower legs. It is usually worse in winter. Cause is unknown, and the condition tends to come and go. Venous eczema (aka gravitational e., stasis dermatitis, varicose e.) occurs in people with impaired circulation, varicose veins and edema, and is particularly common in the ankle area of people over 50. There is redness, scaling, darkening of the skin and itching. The disorder predisposes to leg ulcers. Dermatitis herpetiformis (aka Duhrings Disease) causes intensely itchy and typically symmetrical rash on arms, thighs, knees, and back. It is directly related to celiac disease and can often be put into remission with appropriate diet. Neurodermatitis (aka lichen simplex chronicus, localized scratch dermatitis) is an itchy area of thickened, pigmented eczema patch that results from habitual rubbing and scratching. Usually there is only one spot. Often curable through behavior modification and anti-inflammatory medication. Prurigo nodularis is a related disorder showing multiple lumps. Autoeczematization (aka id reaction, autosensitization) is an eczematous reaction to an infection with parasites, fungi, bacteria or viruses. It is completely curable with the clearance of the original infection that caused it. The appearance varies depending on the cause. It always occurs some distance away from the original infection. (L30.2) There are also eczemas overlaid by viral infections (e. herpeticum, e. vaccinatum), and eczemas resulting from underlying disease (e.g. lymphoma). Eczemas originating from ingestion of medications, foods, and chemicals, have not yet been clearly systematized. Other rare eczematous disorders exist in addition to those listed here. Side effects Prolonged use of topical corticosteroids is thought to increase the risk of possible side effects, the most common of which is the skin becoming thin and fragile (atrophy).[6] Because of this, if used on the face or other delicate skin, only a low-strength steroid should be used. Additionally, high-strength steroids used over large areas, or under occlusion, may be significantly absorbed into the body, causing hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis suppression (HPA axis suppression).[7] Finally by their immunosuppressive action they can, if used without antibiotics or antifungal drugs, lead to some skin infections (fungal or bacterial). Care must be taken to avoid the eyes, as topical corticosteroids applied to the eye can cause glaucoma [8] or cataracts. Because of the risks associated with this type of drug, a steroid of an appropriate strength should be sparingly applied only to control an episode of eczema. Once the desired response has been achieved, it should be discontinued and replaced with emollients as maintenance therapy. Corticosteroids are generally considered safe to use in the short- to medium-term for controlling eczema, with no significant side effects differing from treatment with non-steroidal ointment.[9] However, recent research has shown that topically applied corticosteroids did not significantly increase the risk of skin thinning, stretch marks or HPA axis suppression (and where such suppression did occur, it was mild and reversible where the corticosteroids were used for limited periods of time). Further, skin conditions are often under-treated because of fears of side effects. This has led some researchers to suggest that the usual dosage instructions should be changed from ""Use sparingly"" to ""Apply enough to cover affected areas,"" and that specific dosage directions using ""fingertip units"" or FTU's be provided, along with photos to illustrate FTU's.[10] Diet and nutrition Recent studies provide hints that food allergy may trigger atopic dermatitis. For these people, identifying the allergens could lead to an avoidance diet to help minimize symptoms, although this approach is still in an experimental stage. [35] Dietary elements that have been reported to trigger eczema include dairy products and coffee (both caffeinated and decaffeinated), soybean products, eggs, nuts, wheat and maize (sweet corn), though food allergies may vary from person to person.[citation needed] In certain individuals eczema is triggered by MSG (monosodium glutamate).[citation needed] Recently German scientists discovered that a diet rich in Omega-3 may be able to reduce symptoms. [36] Vegetarian sources that are most beneficial are wheatgerm oil and Evening Primrose oil and animal sources include Cod-liver oil, although some individuals may be allergic to seafood.[citation needed] Alternative therapies Non-conventional medical approaches include traditional Chinese medicine and Western herbalism. There is a wide variety of treatments, each of which may vary from individual to individual as to efficacy or harm. Chinese medicine is known for successfully and permanently resolving eczema. In Chinese Medicine diagnosis, eczema is often a manifestation of underlying ill health. Treatment works by improving the overall health of the individual, therefore not only resolving the eczema but improving quality of life (energy level, digestion, disease resistance, etc.).[37] A recent study published in the British Journal of Dermatology describes improvements in quality of life and reduced need for topical corticosteroid application[38]. Another British trial was carried out in 47 children with extensive nonexudative atopic eczema, over an eight week treatment period. Active intervention comprised ten different plants traditionally used in Chinese medicine for eczema treatment. Of the 37 children analysed, for erythema scores there was a 51% decrease (95% CI 34.5 to 72.6) with active and a 6.1% decrease (95% CI -25.2 to 30.7) for placebo. For surface damage scores there was a 63.1% decrease (95 CI 34.5 to 72.6) with active and a 6.2% decrease (95% CI -25.2 to 30.7) with placebo. Both scores suggest a benefit with herbal remedy.[39] It must be emphasized that Traditional Chinese Medicine is a licensed medical profession and must only be prescribed by physicians with proper education and board certification.[40]Patients should inform their doctor/allergist/dermatologist if they are pursuing one of these treatment routes. Alleged remedies include: Oatmeal is a common remedy to relieve itching, and can be applied topically as a cream or, as a colloid, in the bath. It is also part of many commercially available products intended for eczema treatment and for other skin conditions. Sea water: According to the British Association of Dermatologists, there is considerable anecdotal evidence that salt water baths may help some children with atopic eczema.[41] One reason might be that seawater has antiseptic properties. The Dead sea is popular for alleviating skin problems including eczema. Sulfur has been used for many years as a topical treatment in the alleviation of eczema, although this could be suppressive. It was fashionable in the Victorian and Edwardian eras. Recently sulfur has regained some popularity as a homeopathic alternative to steroids and coal tar. However, there is currently no scientific evidence for the claim that sulfur treatment relieves eczema.[42] Probiotics are live microorganisms taken by mouth, such as the Lactobacillus bacteria found in yogurt. They are not effective for treating eczema, and have a small risk of adverse events such as infection.[43] Other remedies lacking scientific evidence include chiropractic spinal manipulation[44] and Shea butter.[citation needed] Patients can also wear clothing designed specifically to manage the itching, scratching and peeling associated with eczema.[45] Behavioural approach In the 1980s, Swedish dermatologist Peter Noren developed a behavioural approach to the treatment of long term atopic eczema. This approach has been further developed by dermatologist Richard Staughton and psychiatrist Christopher Bridgett at the Chelsea and Westminster Hospital in London.[46][47] Patients undergo a 6 week monitored program involving scratch habit reversal and self awareness of scratching levels. For long term eczema sufferers, scratching can become habitual. Sometimes scratching becomes a reflex, resulting in scratching without conscious awareness, rather than from the feeling of itchiness itself. The habit reversal program is done in conjunction with the standard applied emollient/corticosteroid treatments so that the skin can heal. It also reduces future scratching, as well as reduces the likelihood of further flareups. The behavioural approach can give an eczema sufferer some control over the degree of severity of eczema. Home treatments - Liver Flush - Bowel Cleanse - Diet & Nutrition - Fittness Dyshidrosis can be treated locally by braking early on the tiny vesicles with a small needle and disinfecting the scratch. It will reverse the eczemic inflammation and begin a scarring process, which stops the vesicle formation and the drying of the skin around the braked vesicle, and temporarily prevents the formation of new vesicles to the same area of the skin. When kept clean properly, the braked vesicles will first turn into scars, after which using dexpanthenol (vitamin B12) ointment heals the cracked and dry area of old vesicles. Vulnerability to live vaccinia virus In June, 2007, Science magazine reported that an American soldier who had been vaccinated for smallpox, a vaccine that contains live vaccinia virus, had transmitted vaccinia virus to his two-year-old son.[51] The soldier and his son both had a history of eczema. The son rapidly came down with a rare side effect, eczema vaccinatum, which had been seen during the 1960s when children were routinely vaccinated against smallpox. The child developed a severe full-body pustular rash, his abdomen filled with fluid, and his kidneys nearly failed. Intense consultation with experts from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and a donation of an experimental antiviral drug by SIGA Technologies saved the child's life. Those with a family history of eczema are advised not to accept the smallpox vaccination, or anything else that contains live vaccinia virus.

Typically, eczema is characterised by an itchy rash that comes and goes. Eczema is not contagious but does tend to run in families and commonly first appears in early childhood. Treatment involves keeping the skin hydrated and healthy between flare-ups, reducing environmental triggers where possible and treating the inflammation during the flare-ups with creams prescribed by your child's doctor. There are other treatments available for severe eczema. Your doctor will work with you to devise an ongoing management plan to keep your child's eczema under control. Babies usually have a rash on their face and neck which may weep and crust. Children often have a dry rash, characteristically in the creases of knees and elbows, around the mouth, neck, wrists and ankles. From age 12, the it may be more widespread and severe. When the skin is red, dry and itchy, it is known as a 'flare-up'. It is common for the severity of eczema to change, sometimes it is very mild and other times it gets worse. Between flare-ups, people with eczema tend to have dry sensitive skin. See your doctor to diagnose your child's rash, as other skin conditions can look similar to eczema. Your doctor will examine the rash, ask you about how and when it began, and ask whether other family members have noticed a similar rash. This is because while not contagious, eczema may have a genetic basis and does tend to run in families. A child with eczema often has one or more relative with eczema or a related condition, such as asthma, or allergic . Each child with eczema has their own set of individual triggers, although sometimes the condition can flare and subside for no apparent reason. Examples of common exacerbating factors and triggers in children include: Heat — avoid overheating with blankets and long hot showers Irritants — soaps, shampoos, chlorine, chemicals, fragrances, make-up, scratchy clothes and materials Allergens — , moulds, , , , soaps and shampoos, Affected skin can be very . The itchiness can cause sleep difficulties for your child or infant and scratching can also lead to breaking of the skin. Broken skin may become infected with bacteria that commonly live on children’s hands. Bacterial infections may cause inflamed blisters which can weep and form crusts. Warts and herpes () can also infect eczema rash. Infection with herpes can cause serious problems and is an emergency which needs to be treated urgently. If someone has a cold sore, make sure to keep a distance from a child with eczema. How do I prevent my child with eczema having flare-ups? The goal of treating eczema is to prevent and minimise flare-ups, as well as maintain skin health between flare-ups. Moisturisers should be used between flare-ups to keep the skin in good condition, reduce the itch associated with dry skin and reduce the chance of infections. It is important to moisturise after showering or bathing once the skin is dry. People with eczema have sensitive skin so irritants should be avoided. This includes many soaps and moisturisers. Your pharmacist can help you choose products suitable for eczema. Trying to avoid triggers is worthwhile. Food allergies are not common eczema triggers. It is important not to put your child on a diet without medical advice, as nutrition for children shouldn't be compromised unnecessarily. Your child’s eczema will improve more quickly if it is treated soon after you first notice the rash. Prompt treatment will also reduce the likelihood of complications, so it’s best to see your doctor or pharmacist at the first sign of a flare-up. Keep your child’s fingernails short to avoid them scratching as much as possible. Eczema is often treated using a steroid cream or ointment. You should get advice from your doctor or pharmacist about the best one to use for your specific case as different creams are used depending on the part of the body, the severity and the age of the child. If your child’s eczema does not improve after two days of regular treatment or if there are signs of infection, weepy, crusted or broken areas, it is important to see a doctor. There are many treatments that can be used to treat eczema. For many children, eczema is a condition that comes and goes, and changes in intensity over time, so you may need to see your doctor a few times for the same condition.

Other times, allergies to certain or airborne allergens may cause an allergic reaction in your skin. Reactions typically appear within a day or two of exposure to an allergen. Symptoms can be itchy, bumpy, red, blistered, swollen or painful skin. Hives are a relatively common symptom of allergies that appear on your skin. Also called urticaria, hives are raised, red, itchy areas of skin and they can show up anywhere on your body. Hives are frequently related to food and drug allergies. Angioedema is another skin-based symptom related to food and drug allergies; it's when deep layers of skin become swollen and it isn't usually characterized by redness or itchiness. Angioedema commonly affects eyelids, lips, tongue, hands and feet. Contact dermatitis is a symptom of an allergic reaction to something you've touched; it shows up in the form of a rash. It's normally not as itchy as it is painful. Meanwhile, allergic contact dermatitis typically is itchy, red and blistered; an example of allergic contact dermatitis is the reaction you get to poison ivy or poison sumac. Sometimes, allergic contact dermatitis involves a secondary bacterial infection, as well. People with dark skin occasionally end up with extra or too little pigmentation in the spot where they had an allergic contact dermatitis reaction. Atopic dermatitis is a type of allergic reaction that's displayed on your skin. Also known as eczema, atopic dermatitis is a red, scaly and itchy rash that normally affects the face, elbows and knees. It can be caused by airborne allergens like dander and dust, or by contact with certain irritants. Other causes include food allergens, overheating and stress.

ff961150-1bc0-4f40-943a-9acc80203822,"An inflammatory condition of the skin; various forms include lesions such as eczema, vesicles, or papules. The three main categories of dermatitis are atopic, contact, and seborrheic. Atopic dermatitis is a chronic, relapsing from of dermatitus (atopic is ""excessive inflammation from allergies""). Irritants and allergens trigger reactions that include dry, cracking skin. The redness, itching, and dehydration of the dermatitis make the conditions worse. Use of humidifiers and lotions can help keep the skin more hydrated. Topical corticosteroids can relieve the symptoms. An inflammatory skin condition caused by an allergic reaction from contact with a substance or chemical. Contact dermatitis can be caused by either an allergic reaction or contact with an irritant. Makeup, skin care products, detergents, dyes, fabrics, jewelry, and plants can call cause red, itchy skin. Allergies top red dyes in products and nickel in jewelry are common. An acne-like condition around the mouth; consists mainly of small clusters of papules. It may be caused by toothpaste or products used on the face. It is not contagious. Antibiotics can help treat the condition. An inflammatory, painful, itching disease of the skin; acute or chronic in nature, with dry or moist lesions. This should be referred to a physician. Avoid contact and skin care treatments if a client has eczema. Seborrheic dermatitis is a common form of eczema as well as a sebaceous gland disorder; characterized by scaling around the noise, ears, scalp, eyebrows, and mid-chest areas. This flaking mainly affects oilier areas. Swelling from a fluid imbalance in the cells or from a response to injury, infections, or medication. Hair grows under the surface instead of growing up and out of the follicle, causing a bacterial infection. These ingrown hairs are common in men, usually from shaving (referred to as barbae folliculitis, folliculitis barbae, sycosis barbae, or barber's itch. Pseudofolliculitis, also known as razor bumps, resembles folliculitis without the pus or infection. An itchy skin disease characterized by red patches covered with white-silver scales; caused by an over-proliferation of skin cells that replicate too fast. Psoriasis is usually found in patches on the scalp, elbows, knees, chest, and lower back. If patches are irritated, bleeding can occur. Psoriasis is not contagious but can be spread by irritating the affected area. Also know as hives. An allergic reaction by the body's histamine production. An inflammation of the skin characterized by extreme redness, dilation of blood vessels, and in severe cases the formation of papules and pustules. It is chronic congestion primarily on the cheeks and nose. The cause and treatment of rosacea is a primary skin care concern. The cause is unknown =, but may be due to heredity, bacteria, mites, or fungus. Certain factors are known to aggravate the condition. Vasodilation of the blood vessels makes rosacea worse. Spicy foods, alcohol, caffeine, temperature extremes, hear, sun, and stress aggravate rosacea. A vascular lesion; describes capillaries that have been damaged and are now larger, or distended blood vessels. Commonly called couperose skin and characterized by redness. Vacular lesions that are abnormally dilated and twisted veins which can occur anywhere in the body. Sometimes treated with sclerotherapy, a nonsurgical injection into the vein. Surgery is a treatment option for serious vein problems. Allergic contact dermatitis is cased by exposure and direct skin contact to an allergen. Normally the immune system protects us from pathogens and disease, but in an allergic reaction the immune system actually causes the problem by trying to do its job too well. An allergic reaction occurs when our immune systems mistakes a substance for a toxic one and initiates a major defense against it. Irritant reactions affect everyone who comes in contact with an irritant, although the degree of irritation will vary depending on the individual. In acute case, symptoms are noticed immediately or within just a few hours. Chronic cases may be delayed reactions from redness, swelling, scaling, and itching to serious, painful chemical burns. Caustic substances are examples of irritants. When the skin is damaged by irritating substances, the immune system springs into actions. It floods the tissue with water, trying to dilute the irritant. This why swelling occurs.

c2b8790d-8eee-41e2-b31e-fc9df973b71d,"Dermatitis means an inflammation of the skin. It is commonly manifested as redness, swelling, itching. It is different from eczema as in all eczemas are types of dermatitis of some sort but all types of dermatitis are not eczemas. There are various classifications of dermatitis. Here are the common ones: Caused due to some irritant chemicals for example detergents, soaps, perfumes, etc. ICD is usually seen on the hands first as an inflammation in the skin with scaling. The first step to treating this condition is stopping the usage of agents causing it. When the skin infection is due to an allergy or allergic reaction during which the body’s antibodies react with the allergens, it is called allergic dermatitis. The reaction is delayed and does not take place the first time your skin touches something it is allergic to. But your skin becomes sensitive to it and the next time it comes in contact with the allergen, the skin shows a reaction. Usually the immune system is also involved in this kind of dermatitis. It is commonly seen in young children characterised by dry skin, itching and may even lead to eczema patches. Approximately 50% of patients develop this condition by the first year of life and additional 30% develop it within 1-5 years. Initially, it was thought that these children would outgrow this eczema by adolescence; however due to changes in our lifestyle, atopic dermatitis is seen in adults as well. Usually, the cheeks and lips are affected first in atopic dermatitis. It isa more severe form of the common dandruff – greasy, scaly lesions seen over the scalp as well as on the chest and back and other hair bearing areas.  It is more prevalent among males but usually occurs in infants within the first three months of life. Mostly affects the oily areas white to yellowish scales with or without reddened skin. This results in round, coin-shaped patches on the skin (particularly where the skin is dry) but can be anywhere on the body. The patches are whitish or reddish in colour and may be itchy or crusty. This type usually affects older men but is quite uncommon. It is also not contagious. It is a dermatitis that develops due to the presence of another intense inflammatory reaction somewhere else in the body e.g. fungal infections. It is characterised by deep vesicles and in some cases blisters over the hands and feet, intensely itchy lesions. : This is a dermatitis that happens due some long standing skin condition associated with chronic itching. The skin becomes thick. People who have anxiety disorders are prone to it. There are multiple causes of dermatitis including: But on a broad basis, we see dermatitis due to some internal skin disorder or external contact irritation or allergic irritation. In severe cases, the patient can also have oozing/blistering/secondary infections. The treatment depends on the type and cause of dermatitis. Keeping the skin moisturised is usually one of the mainstays of any dermatitis treatment. Along with this, antihistamines and steroids may be prescribed. It is important that the patient adheres to doctor’s medication to keep the condition under control. Follow up and regular check-up are equally important to monitor the dose of the medication from time to time. In case of allergies, the causative factors need to be avoided at all costs. Any other triggers should also be avoided. Since it affects the skin, dermatitis can lead to possible complications such as low self-esteem or embarrassment. It can also cause psychological distress. Constant scratching of skin can at times lead to an open sore which may spread the condition to other parts of the body. Some of these are due to an allergic reaction where the immune system is also involved. Dermatitis can also get worse in the winter season due to the rough and dry climate so it is vital to take better care of the skin during this time. Keeping the skin moisturised at all times is the best way to prevent any sort of dermatitis. Using mild soaps, not letting harsh detergents come in contact with the skin is another way to prevent it. Getting any rash or skin allergy checked at the earliest to prevent the infection or condition from spreading or getting worse is also important. Many forms of dermatitis can be chronic conditions which mean that they can only be kept under control with the help of medication once the symptoms start appearing.

Examples include atopic dermatitis (eczema), contact dermatitis and seborrheic dermatitis (dandruff). These conditions cause red rashes, dry skin and itchiness among other symptoms. Your dermatitis can be managed by your regular healthcare provider or by a dermatologist. “Dermatitis” is a word used to describe a number of skin irritations and rashes caused by genetics, an overactive immune system, infections, allergies, irritating substances and more. Common symptoms include dry skin, redness and itchiness. In the word “dermatitis,” “derm” means “skin” and “itis” means “inflammation.” The word as a whole means “inflammation of the skin.” The rashes range from mild to severe and can cause a variety of problems, depending on their cause. Dermatitis causes no serious harm to your body. It is not contagious, and it does not mean that your skin is unclean or infected. There are treatment methods and medications that can manage your symptoms. The types of dermatitis include, but are not limited to: See the “Causes and Symptoms” section for more details about the types of dermatitis. Anyone – young and old – can get dermatitis. Some examples include: Atopic dermatitis (eczema) usually begins in childhood, but anyone at any age can get it. Anyone can get contact dermatitis as it just involves skin to substance contact. Individuals with celiac disease are prone to dermatitis herpetiformis. There are several factors that put you at risk of getting dermatitis. Some examples include: A family history of dermatitis, hay fever or asthma. If you work around chemicals such as in a factory, restaurant or garden.

Periorificial dermatitis is found around your eyes, mouth, nostrils and sometimes the genitals. Some types of dermatitis are very common while others are less common. Atopic dermatitis affects two percent to three percent of adults and 25% of children. Contact dermatitis happens at some point to 15% to 20% of people. What’s the difference between dermatitis and psoriasis? Psoriasis and dermatitis – especially seborrheic dermatitis – can look similar. Both look like patches of red skin with flakes of skin on top of and around the redness. However, in psoriasis, the scales are often thicker and the edges of those scales are well-defined. Seborrheic dermatitis and psoriasis do overlap in a condition called “sebopsoriasis.” That is when you have the symptoms of both. Discuss your questions with your healthcare provider regarding which type of skin condition you have. You can have more than one skin condition at a time. Treatments for one may not work for the other. What’s the difference between dermatitis and eczema? Eczema is actually a type of dermatitis. It is also known as atopic dermatitis.

The symptoms can be different depending on the type of dermatitis. Some people feel a burning sensation. Others feel itchiness or both itchiness and a burning feeling. The sensations vary from person to person, and from type to type. Dermatitis is caused by a combination of immune system activation, genetics and environmental triggers. .

Researchers have observed that if others in your family have dermatitis, you’re more likely to have it. Additionally, experts have identified changes to genes that control a protein that helps your body maintain healthy skin. Your skin cannot remain healthy without normal levels of that protein. . Your environment may make your immune system change the protective barrier of your skin. That causes more moisture to escape, and that can lead to dermatitis. Possible environmental factors include exposure to tobacco smoke and some types of air pollutants. Fragrances in some skin products and soap are also possible. . Some types of dermatitis are caused by exposure to chemicals and other irritants. Perioral dermatitis, for example, may be caused by exposure to fluoride in water or toothpaste. If you have dermatitis, you might also have another condition that doesn’t cause it, but is often found alongside it: The symptoms depend on the type of dermatitis. You may have one type, or you may have several. Each type may have one or more of the following symptoms: When scratched, the rashes may ooze fluid or bleed.

Do you get it every time you go to your uncle’s house, because he’s a smoker? Does your scalp feel itchy since you started that new shampoo? Did that rash on the inside of your wrist appear after you tried that new perfume? Does excessive sunlight make your dermatitis better or worse?

Medical Author: Jeffrey John Meffert, MD Medical Editor: Are There Medical Treatments and Medications for Eczema? What Are Complications of Eczema? What Is the Prognosis for Eczema? Treatments like prescription and OTC creams help manage eczema symptoms. The term is derived from the Greek, meaning ""to out."" The name is particularly apt since to ancient medical practitioners it may have appeared that the skin was ""boiling."" Today the usage is rather imprecise since this term is frequently used to describe any sort of dermatitis (inflammatory skin condition). But not all dermatitis is eczematous. All eczematous dermatitis, whether due to a familial or an acquired , has a similar appearance. Acute lesions are composed of many small fluid-filled structures called vesicles that usually reside on red, swollen skin. When these vesicles break, clear or yellowish fluid leaks out, causing characteristic weeping and oozing. When the fluid dries, it produces a thin crust which may mimic . In older lesions, these vesicles may be harder to appreciate, but an examination of the tissue under the microscope will reveal their presence. Eczematous dermatitis has many causes. One of the most common is a condition called . Often those using the term are referring to . Although atopy refers to a lifelong inherited (genetic) predisposition to inhalant such as and allergic rhinitis (), atopic dermatitis is not known at this time to be a pure allergic disease. Atopic patients are likely to have , hay , and dermatitis. Atopy is a very common condition, and it affects all races and ages, including infants. About 1%-2% of adults have the skin , and it is even more common in children. Most affected individuals have their first episode before 5 years of age. For most, the dermatitis will improve with time. For an unlucky few, atopic dermatitis is a chronic, recurrent disorder. Other eczematous dermatoses include, but are not limited to, allergic (cell-mediated to a common substance such as or nickel), irritant dermatitis (from excessive contact with a harsh chemical substance), (), infestations, stasis dermatitis, very (asteatosis), pompholyx (dyshidrosis), nummular dermatitis, and . The differentiation among these conditions is often difficult and time consuming. In addition, it is not uncommon for atopic dermatitis to coexist with another eczematous dermatitis. It is generally agreed that the tendency to atopy is inherited. For the purposes of this discussion, the term and atopic dermatitis will be synonymous. Individuals with atopic dermatitis have a variety of abnormal immunologic findings, like elevated IgE antibody (immunoglobulin E) levels and defective cell-mediated immunity, which causes difficulty in fighting off certain viral, bacterial, and fungal infections. Despite a susceptibility to certain infections, eczema is not itself in any way. Like most other noninfectious diseases, atopic skin disease can be triggered by environmental factors. One of the hallmarks of atopic dermatitis is excessive skin dryness, which seems to be due a lack of certain skin proteins called filaggrins. Any factor that promotes dryness is likely to worsen atopic dermatitis. A very dry sleeping environment may be improved with a bedroom or house humidifier. Common triggers of atopic dermatitis include the following: Repeated wetting and drying of the skin (as occurs with food handling or other professions requiring frequent hand washing) While food are implicated as triggers in some patients, there is no dietary restriction or recommendation which is universally helpful. Eczema may be worsened by the development of additional problems such as allergic contact dermatitis, which may occur as a reaction to preservatives and active ingredients in moisturizers, and even as a reaction to the topical corticosteroids used themselves. Rosacea, Acne, Shingles, Covid-19 Rashes: Common Adult Skin Diseases Medical professionals sometimes refer to eczema as ""the itch that rashes."" Usually, the first symptom of eczema is intense itching. The rash appears later and is red and has of different sizes. The rash itches and may , especially in thin skin like the eyelids. If it is scratched, it may ooze and become crusty. In adults, chronic rubbing produces thickened plaques of skin. Having one or more round areas is referred to as nummular (coin shaped) eczema and may be confused with fungal infections. Some people develop red bumps or clear fluid-filled bumps that look ""bubbly"" and, when scratched, add wetness to the overall appearance. This type of eczema is especially common on the sides of the finger in and also goes by the name pompholyx. Although the rash can be located anywhere on the body, in adults and older children, it is most often found on the neck, flexures of the arms (opposite the elbow), and flexures of legs (opposite the knee). Infants may exhibit the rash on the torso and face. It usually first appears in areas where the child can rub against sheets, since he or she may not have the coordination to precisely scratch yet. As the child begins to crawl, the rash involves the skin of the elbows and knees. The area is often spared. While the skin behind the ear may be involved, the itself is usually spared. The itching may be so intense that it interferes with . While classic eczema and are distinctly different and seldom coexist, both conditions may have severe erythrodermic (red skin) forms in which the patient has inflammation of most of the skin surface area. Asteatotic eczema is a term often applied to describe patients who have thin, dried, cracked-appearing skin, usually especially bad on the lower legs. Significant involvement of the palms and soles of the is not usual and may suggest a different condition such as fungal infection, infestation, or allergic contact dermatitis. If twice daily applications of 0.5% or 1% cream (available without a prescription) are insufficient to control the rash, then the individual should see a physician. If someone is so uncomfortable that his/her , work, or other daily activities are disrupted, he/she needs a more effective treatment and should see a health care professional. Generally, eczematous dermatitis is not an emergency and should not be handled in a hospital emergency department. Exceptions include the following: When the skin becomes so irritated that it breaks down and becomes infected; if the rash has become red, hot, and painful; if red streaks are coming from the rash; or if the individual has a fever, an emergency department visit may be necessary if it's not possible to see a health care professional within 24 hours. Any person with a weakened immune system or certain medical conditions (such as , on , , , older than 70 years of age) and the above symptoms of infection should go immediately to a hospital emergency department. Most eczema can be managed by primary care physicians (family practice, pediatrics, or internal-medicine doctors). Dermatologists may be consulted when either the diagnosis is in doubt, patients are not responding to treatments that should be working, or higher-risk medications and long-term systemic medications may be needed to get adequate control of the disease. When seeing a physician, it is important that the doctor know of everything (prescription and over-the-counter drugs, and home remedies) that the patient has tried and which things helped and which did not. As it is normal for eczema to come and go depending upon many factors, a photo taken to show things at their best or worst may also be useful to the physician. A medical professional can usually identify the type of eczematous dermatitis by looking at the rash and asking questions about how it appeared. Samples of scale from the rash may need to be examined microscopically to search for a (). Occasionally, a portion of skin may be removed (a biopsy) to be examined by a pathologist, but this will not distinguish atopic dermatitis from allergic contact dermatitis. A baby with what appears to be eczema of the palms and soles may have , which may be confirmed with a skin scraping. will lead to scaly skin but only rarely shows the weeping commonly seen with eczema. also doesn't itch much if at all, and eczema seldom involves the scalp while and seborrheic dermatitis often do. While it is possible to have more than one chronic skin condition at a time, it would be unusual to have very active psoriasis and very active atopic dermatitis in the same patient at the same time. On lighter skin, active eczema is usually red and can leave discoloration as it improves. On dark skin, there may be a mixture of light and dark color changes to the skin during and after a flare. Not enough color (hypopigmentation) is common, but total lack of color (depigmentation) should suggest other conditions, such as or discoid . The three key elements in identifying atopic dermatitis are characteristic appearance and distribution of a chronic rash; atopy, or a personal or family tendency toward and hay fever. Treatment for eczema can be managed at home by changing laundry detergents or soaps that may be causing the irritant. Avoid tight-fitting or rough clothing. Avoid scratching the affected area. Medical treatment includes prescription anti-inflammatory medications, and steroid creams. may have to be prescribed to clear the affected irritation. Anti-itch creams, especially those containing hydrocortisone, may be helpful, but many experts recommend avoiding topical and topical anesthetics because of concern of becoming sensitized and developing a secondary allergic contact dermatitis in reaction to these medications. Anti-itch creams containing and menthol may be safer in this regard. Eczema (also atopic eczema or atopic dermatitis) is a general medical term for many types of skin inflammation. Removing exacerbating factors is a good place to start. This may be as simple as changing the laundry detergent to one that is fragrance free or as difficult as moving to a new climate or changing jobs. Long baths in soapy water or long hot showers may worsen eczema. On the other hand, soaking in warm, non-soapy water followed immediately by moisturizers to ""seal in the moisture"" is helpful. Prevent dry skin by taking short lukewarm showers or baths. Use a mild soap or body cleanser. Short contact of the skin with a shampoo is generally not a problem, but prolonged contact may worsen the rash on the neck and face. Prior to drying off, apply an effective emollient to wet skin. Emollients are substances that inhibit the evaporation of water. Generally, they are available in jars and have a ""stiff"" consistency. They do not flow and ought to leave a shine with a slightly greasy feel on the skin. Most good emollients contain petroleum jelly although certain solid vegetable shortenings do a more than creditable job. The thicker, the better, although patient preference is usually toward thinner lotions because of ease of application and avoidance of a greasy feel. Oatmeal baths (Aveeno and others) may be soothing to itchy, fissured skin although best outcomes will still result from applying moisturizers after rinsing off. People with longstanding eczema may become sensitized to the products they are putting on the skin and develop allergic contact dermatitis that may be identical in clinical appearance. Skin may develop to over-the-counter (OTC) products such as topical anesthetics, topical diphenhydramine (Benadryl), lanolin (an ingredient in Eucerin and other common moisturizers), coconut oil, and tea tree oil or even such as topical steroid creams. Avoid wearing tight-fitting, rough, or scratchy clothing. Avoid scratching the rash. If it's not possible to stop scratching, cover the area with a dressing. Wear gloves at night to minimize skin damage from scratching. Anything that causes can irritate the rash. Avoid strenuous during a flare. An anti-inflammatory topical cream may be necessary to control a flare of atopic dermatitis. Apply a nonprescription steroid cream (1% hydrocortisone). The cream must be applied two to four times a day without skipping days until the rash is gone. Diphenhydramine (Benadryl) in pill form may be taken for the itching. Caution: This medication may make people too drowsy to drive a car or operate machinery safely. The topical form may sensitize people and cause allergic contact dermatitis. Clean the area with a hypoallergenic soap as necessary. Most antibacterial soaps are too irritating for eczema patients. Apply an emollient over the topical steroid. lotion may also be soothing to the itch but will tend to dry out the skin. For this reason, it may be more useful in the management of an acute flare-up of the condition rather than a good long-term therapy. Avoid physical and mental . Eating right, light activity, and adequate sleep will help someone stay healthy, which can help prevent flares. A variety of home remedies such as apple cider vinegar and tea tree oil are frequently touted as cures for eczema, but there is little or no scientific basis for these claims. Bleach baths, on the other hand, may help. The goal of bleach baths is to suppress colonization by bacteria with the resulting flare that may cause. Several formulas exist, but a ½ cup of bleach for a full bathtub full of water (or ¼ cup for a half bath) is a good balance between getting the desired effect and generating an irritant dermatitis. A summer substitution for bleach baths would be regular use of overchlorinated community swimming pools. Do not expect a quick response. Atopic dermatitis is controllable but consistency in application of treatment products is necessary. Are There Medical Treatments and Medications for Eczema? Once a health care professional is sure someone has atopic dermatitis, the mainstays of therapy are anti-inflammatory medications and relief from the itching. Prescription-strength steroid cream and antihistamine medications are the usual treatments. If a health care professional determines that someone has a secondary bacterial infection complicating their rash, an oral antibiotic may be prescribed. For severe cases not responding to high-potency steroid cream, alternate treatments may be tried. These include , ultraviolet light exposure, and systemic anti-inflammatory agents. (immunotherapy) usually do not work in eczema. A variety of diets have been proposed for eczema relief. These may be structured on the results of allergy testing or may be chosen for their content of foods that tend not to provoke allergic responses. Not everyone put on restrictive eczema diets improves, and many patients with severe eczema show no testing evidence of food allergies. For that reason, a change in , if desired, should be considered as an additional step in treatment rather than a primary one, and if patients notice they itch more when eating any identified food or drink, it would be best if they avoid it. What Are Complications of Eczema? What Is the Prognosis for Eczema? Atopic dermatitis usually spontaneously improves in most individuals after . In a few unfortunate individuals, it becomes chronic, resulting in occasional flares often at times of very low humidity (such as wintertime with the heat on). It may also return much later in adulthood and may prove especially difficult to manage. The role of psychological inducing flares of the dermatitis is poorly understood. There is no question that when the condition flares and sleep is inhibited by itching, one's normal ability to deal with emotional problems is diminished. Repeated scratching of the rash can cause toughening of the skin. Small patches of the skin can become thickened and like leather. This condition is called . The scrotum and vulva are common areas for adult patients with a history of eczema to develop a persistent itch and develop such lichenification. (It would be very unusual for the penis itself to be involved in such cases and other diagnoses should be considered if it appears to be affected.) Eczema causes skin sores and cracks that are susceptible to infection. These infections are usually very minor, but they do require treatment with antibiotics or they may become very severe. See a health care professional if an infection is suspected. Eczema may fade in adulthood, but people who have eczema tend to have lifelong problems with skin irritation and related problems. Take all medicines as prescribed and expect slow gradual improvement. Keep the affected area as clean, dry, and protected as possible to avoid further breakdown of the skin and prevent infection. Apply steroid cream until the rash has completely gone away. If prescription medications are not controlling the eczema or the prescription medications are out, make an appointment with a health care professional. Watch the area carefully for signs of infection: increased redness, warmth, pain, pustules, or a discharge from the area. See a health care professional if an infection is suspected.

Guttate psoriasis, which often begins in childhood or young adulthood and can be triggered by a strep infection, appears as small, droplike lesions.

A textbook case of eczema begins during infancy or early childhood, Dr. Minars says. “There are some controversies as to whether eczema is primarily an immune-mediated disease or a skin-barrier-defect disease,” Dr. Wu says. “Like psoriasis, it also tends to run in families,” suggesting that there may also be a hereditary component. There’s no doubt that living with psoriasis and eczema can be stressful, and their connection to stress has been widely discussed in the dermatology community. Although experts often advise people with psoriasis and eczema to avoid stressful situations, a lot remains to be proven about exactly how stress can influence these conditions. A November 2017 meta-analysis in the evaluated 39 studies with more than 32,500 patients, concluding that “no convincing evidence exists that preceding stress is strongly associated with psoriasis exacerbation/onset.” As for eczema, an October 2017 study in the reported that psychological stress may exacerbate atopic dermatitis, and it might be mediated by the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. Just because science hasn’t fully clarified the role stress plays in these conditions doesn’t mean the link doesn’t exist. Dr. Wu says he’s seen patients experience stress-related psoriasis or eczema flare-ups in the past, and the AAD mentions stress when discussing both and . Though psoriasis and eczema are different conditions, treatment for the two is often similar. While there’s no cure for either condition, they can be treated. If you’re diagnosed with psoriasis or eczema, your doctor may recommend: Topical medications to reduce inflammation, like corticosteroids, calcineurin inhibitors, and Oral steroids, like prednisone, which can help calm a severe case when used for a short period of time Wet dressings, which involve wrapping the area with a wet bandage to soothe the itchiness Phototherapy, in which a special machine emits ultraviolet light onto the skin to help reduce itching and inflammation Although psoriasis and eczema are both frustrating, irritating conditions, they shouldn’t be life-ruiners. If you’re struggling with managing your psoriasis or eczema, see a dermatologist, who can help determine the best treatment plan for you. 9 Tips for Managing a Psoriasis Flare-Up That Dermatologists Swear By The 13 Best New Body Skin-Care Products for Every Skin Type has been writing forever.

The only thing with fish oil is you have to be careful of the manufacturer otherwise you could get contamination from mercury. Flax oil must be fresh and refrigerated. Other than that these kind of fats are good for you. I don't believe in shunning butter or some animal fat and have it in moderation. However too much saturated fat is bad and that is what causes inflammation as well as when the oil is heated at a high temperature like frying.

I still have a long journey ahead of me as I have had this for over 25 years or maybe since childhood. The one big thing that helped me figure out how I got where I am today was to do a health time line. I went back to my childhood and wrote down everything I could think of health wise that happened to me including accidents and traumatic events. I then wrote down any health problems my parents and grandparents had. I read as many books as I could on candida, low thyroid, adrenal fatigue and emotional stress. I read these books daily during my 'coffee break"". My stress level has gone down and I find I am not as anxious or impatient with my family as I once was. Am I cured? Hell no. This will take a long time but ANY holistic treatment ALWAYS does. We have to keep that in mind. If not, and we succumb to our fears or impatient rationalizations, we will go back to a mainstream medical doc who will give us a quick fix and we begin the roller coaster ride again. Am I perfect? No, I gave in to temptation and had a piece of cheesecake the other day and today I had a couple of french fries. I am resolved to just pick up where I was and prod onward and not berate myself for this minor indiscretion. Just keep coming back here and read as much as you can about eczema. Mackenzie has great suggestions, especially about diet AND stress. Why not try an or candida diet. There are a lot of free ebooks here at curezone, check them out. I do recommend Healing Eczema by Christine Nevada and you can read it free on her site I also recommend The Skin Cure Diet by Kathleen Waterford Can you take 5 minutes each morning to meditate and ""de-stress""?

Hi! Thanks for the healing prayers! I guess I am really stressed out. The baby just turned 13 mths and is so much work and now he has asthma as I just developed it a couple of weeks ago.

That sounds so nice. Feel like I have no time for myself. THe oldest two are in soccer so I practically live at the soccer field. This darn itch. I feel like if I could get rid of the itching then I could heal. I continue to scratch even though I'm bleeding.

Benadryl cream is excellent for stopping the itch. It has both an antihistamine in it and zinc, which is an antioxident. Eczema shows an increase in free radicals in the body due to different possible factors, including stress. The way to lower the free radicals is by increasing antioxidents, such as beta carotene and zinc. One person who posts here got well from eczema after watermelon. is high in beta carotene. I got well after taking a zinc supplement (30 mg.) You should be getting at least 30 mg of zinc a day, either through food or supplements. Focus on eating foods that are high in antioxidents, including Vitamin E. Sunflower seeds are high in vitamin E, as are other seeds and nuts. You may also be allergic to the soap or detergent that you are using in the shower and to wash your clothes. You may want to switch to a hypo-allergenic soap such as Dove for sensitive skin, and use fragrance free detergents for the wash, such as fragrance free Tide and Downy. I also used a creme very successfully called Doctor's Defense. It has Chinese herbs in it, but it's very expensive ($36, including shipping and handling for a little jar), so I'd start with the Benadryl creme since you have such a large area to treat.   AdvertisementThe Tesla Shield.

THank you all for responding. I am getting really scared because my hands are so bad that they are becoming stiff and I just started wearing gloves to keep the moisture in but as soon as I take them off a few hours later they are all scaly and stuff. I need gloves to take care of my 1, 5 & 6 yr olds. My hands get so beat up but I hate wearing them in public. I've read about the liver/colon flushing and I was discouraged b/c it said you need to do 11-15 flushes for a 14% success rate. I tried benadryl cream but it burns my skin. Just about everything burns my skin except for Burt's bees moisturizing lotion. Everything also makes my skin itch even more even pure shea butter. Can't figure it out. I am so incredibly desperate and getting depressed about this. It's on my face, ears, neck, hands and fingers and as we speak it's spreading to other fingers. I'm afraid I am going to be completely covered in it. Can I just eat the watermelon? Or do i have to juice it? What do you do when it's out of season?   AdvertisementCancer-proof your body with little known immune boosters!         AdvertisementClarkia Tincture 2 oz, 4 oz, 8 oz, and 16 oz I'm just heartbroken to hear about your problems. I'm so sorry that Benadryl cream doesn't work for you, because it was so helpful to me, and so soothing. Since your eczema covers so much of your body, I would definatly look to whether you are allergic to something you are using as a detergent or soap. Try using hypoallergenic products such as Cetaphil gentle cleanser for sensitive skin or Aveeno non-fragrance body wash. I use fragrance free Tide and Downy for the laundry, but there are other fragrance-free detergents. Non-fragrance shampoos are also helpful. I like California Baby, which I order online, and DHS, which I have bought at the drug store. Shea butter is a wonderful moisturizer because it's natural. Oatmeal bath soaks also help to relieve dry, itchy skin and eczema. Aveeno makes a colloidal oatmeal powder for the bath that is very soothing. The oatmeal works as a silky skin protectant, too. It's also very important to eat a very healthy diet. Are you under a lot of stress right now? Stress is an eczema magnet because it increases the level of cortisol in our bodies, which increases the free radicals. The free radicals inflame our nerve endings, which causes eczema. I wouldn't think that is what is key, but instead, eating the beta carotene found in the watermelon. As goes out of season, however, there are other foods high in beta carotene, such as sweet potatoes, yams, and pumpkin, but there are others. You may want to Google ""foods high in antioxidents"" to see if there are any you like in particular. One thing about eczema, is that we have a laboratory on our skin that shows us just how bad cortisol and free radicals are for our bodies. No one has to tell us that free radicals are harmful to us internally, because we can see their effects on our skin. I don't like using prescription hydoochortisone cremes, but since you are so miserable, it might be the best place to start at first. If you can get your symptoms under control with hycrocortisone cremes, then you can move to the more natural solutions. I'm wishing you the very best, and please, please, let us know how you are getting along.

Sounds like you have given the all natural products a good shot and that is excellent because they usually are not caustic. I have found that if something works for you, it will probably eventually not which is why I choose natural products ( if it doesn't clear me it at least cleans me). You have to find out what your triggers are and eliminate them if possible. Often it just goes away by itself, you have to be aware of what changes you made when it does go away. MOITURIZE until the cows come home. For me the softer my skin the less it hurts. Find skin products that moisturize and do not have chemicals or in them. Tea tree oil is good for reducing redness and itching and inflammation. Plus it is is antibacterial and antifungal. Don't use it straight, use it with a moisturizing agent like jojoba, olive oil or lotion or soap with Tea Tree oil.

Hi- Thanks so so much for passing along the article! I am just curious as to why my eczema itches when it is moisturized. I now wear latex free gloves 24/7 b/c it keeps the moisture in and also protects my hands. I even wear them in public now. So, it iches while the gloves are on and there defintely not dry. I am going to get porridge oats and try that. I use vitamin e, castor oil and shea butter as moiturizers. I take zinc now but I'm not sure how to crush them, they are soft, not tablets. I can't have my hair touching my neck or ears because they hurt. It's also driving me nuts to close my arms due to it in my creases. I had a revelation this morning. The eczema got really severe when we got our new frig and I've been drinking alot of the water from the water line from the fridge. It's supossed to be filered but wondering if the town water has chemicals in it that I am reacting to and maybe it's not 100% filtered. We are currently doing a mold test now b/c the common denominator to all 3 of my illness (asthma, allergies, eczema) is mold. SO far no mold is showing up in the dish. Thanks so much!   AdvertisementCancer-proof your body with little known immune boosters!   Re: How to stop itching from Eczema       AdvertisementClarkia Tincture 2 oz, 4 oz, 8 oz, and 16 oz Yes, mold is really bad for people with allergies, asthma and eczema. I had an eczema and asthma flare-up this past summer after visiting Austin, Texas where the mold was very high, even though it had been very dry. I don't have asthma flare-ups that often, but I did have one after being around all of that mold. One thing to try is clipping your finger nails very short. That way, there won't be so much damage to the skin if you should feel the urge to scratch. Zinc has really helped me. My eczema cleared up after I started taking it about six weeks ago, and I haven't had an eczema outbreak since. Also, it has made me stronger and improved my skin in general. I no longer mind climbing escalator steps or going up a flight of steps when the escalator is out. This is new for me. Even with zinc, however, I still have to be very careful. One shampoo that is wonderful for sensitive skin is California Baby Super Sensitive Shampoo and Body Wash. When I ordered it, the company sent me a trial size of their moisturizing calming creme with botanicals. When I first tried it, I noticed a fragrance, which concerned me, because I have a lot of problems with fragrances. I found the creme wonderfully moisturizing, though, and thought that I'd give it a try. By the second day, however, I noticed my skin becoming very sensitive, so I immediately stopped using that moisturizing creme. At least I've learned to pay attention to these early signs of potential problems ahead. Good luck with the mold tests. I think you may be onto something that what may be causing your problems is environmental. That may explain why all of your symptoms came on at once.

Transformational Technology For Mind Body And Soul. Hi Momo! After taking the zinc beginning in mid-August, I started noticing a difference in the eczema about two weeks later. What I noticed was that as the older eczema wounds were healing, new ones weren't forming. Eventually the older wounds healed, and the eczema was gone. I also made a determination not to scratch the eczema at all, which is very hard to do when your skin is itching so much. To keep it from itching, I started alternating between applying Doctors Defense Zen Fusion Creme and Benadryl creme to the eczema spots over and over. I would apply one or the other every 15 minutes or so. That helped to alleviate the itch a lot, and the cremes helped to promote the healing. After the eczema was healed, my skin was still very fragile because of all the trauma caused by the repeated eczema episodes, so I kept my skin very moisturized for weeks until the skin grew stronger, while trying not to touch the healing areas at all. I even tried to sleep with my hands extended instead of under my head so that there wouldn't be any friction on them. The scratching and rubbing is what is really bad, and when I stopped scratching or even touching the area, the eczema got better and my skin got stronger. It's very good that you will be going to see an allergist. The allergist will test to find out what you are allergic to. I've been taking allergy shots for four years, and they've helped so much. The only allergen I continue to have problems with is mold. Last fall, my allergist added additional mold to my serum to see if it would help, and I'm very hopeful that my next allergy test in November will show that I'm showing improvement. My allergist said, however, that once mold gets extremely high, it will make anyone sick, whether they are allergic to mold or not. With the allergy shots, though, I'm now O.K. with mold in the environment in moderate amounts. It's only when mold is very high that I run into trouble. Here's one thing that may have really started to cause my eczema problems beginning this past spring when my eczema started to really flare up and get out of control. For ten years, I used a Sonicare Advance electric toothbrush. It was a great toothbrush, but then the battery gave out. After ten years, it was entitled. So, I ordered a new Sonicare, but then I found out that Sonicare has replaced the Advance model with the Elite model. No problem, I thought, improvements do occur. NOT! The original Sonicare company has been taken over by a conglomerate that has changed the design (no doubt to cheapen the manufacturing expense.) The new design allows water to seep into the brush head and stay for weeks, or even months, where black mold grows and fosters. I didn't know anything about this mold developing because it hadn't been a problem with the Advance model. Then, when I went to change brush heads this past August, out flowed all of this murky, black water filled with black mold!!!! It was just horrific! When I looked on the internet, I found out that many others were having the same problem. It's definately a design problem that Sonicare needs to fix. I cleaned the toothbrush unit up well, and put on the new brush head. After reading the advice of others, I've begun taking the brush head off after each use, rinsing it out, and letting it dry before putting the brush head back on the unit. This has taken care of the black mold problem. I wouldn't be in the least bit surprised if this mold in my toothbrush had a lot to do with my eczema problems that began last spring and then intensified when I was exposed to the high levels of mold in Austin this past summer. I know that you may view my telling you about this experience as just ""too much information,"" so to speak, but I wanted to tell you about this incident because it shows just how bad environmental issues can be in possibly causing our problems with eczema. I'm so happy we have Cure Zone, too. I never would have learned so much about eczema if I hadn't had the opportunity to read all of the posts here. Please keep letting us know how you're doing! Best, Mackenzie P.S. By the way, Momo, I must really thank you. I never made the connection that the mold in my toothbrush may have been at least part of the problem until you started discussing your concerns about mold. The mold in Austin was an obvious eczema suspect, but I never stopped to think about whether the mold my toothbrush had a connection until you got me thinking about it!   AdvertisementOrder this free DVD that includes a testimonial by former State Representative Nancy Caffyn of how she wa...         AdvertisementCancer-proof your body with little known immune boosters! Hi Mackenzie! I am so incredibly happy that I helped you in some form!!! You can't imagine. I feel like I'm always the one needing help and now I helped you with something. Brings me so much joy! Thanks for telling me that. Wow! Can't believe that thing with the toothbrush. Unbelievable! The home inspector came yesterday and he found absolutely no mold growing whatsoever. It was bittersweet for me b/c I was hoping in a way, he would have. I thought if it was mold in my house then that would have taken care of all our problems. Could my eczema be from the airborne mold? THe kind that's just floating in the air? It doesn't seem like that could do this much damage. I've been hearing that we have a very high mold spore count here in NJ due to all the rain this summer. Was it the airborne mold (allergic kind not the toxic kind) could have caused your eczema? Or are you just talking about your allergies in general? I can't help but to itch the eczema. I make funny faces with my face muscles so if I stretch the skin that way I may get relief from the itchiness.   AdvertisementClarkia Tincture 2 oz, 4 oz, 8 oz, and 16 oz         AdvertisementOxygen Detoxification for both small and large intestines. Hi Momo! Airborne mold can definately cause eczema. We breath it into our nasal passages where it sits and gets into our bodies through absorption. Research from the Mayo clinic has shown that 90% of sinus infections actually have a mold/fungus origin. The sinus infections begin from breathing in mold and fungus from the air. Here is what has helped me tremendously: Buy a can of Simply Saline at the drug or grocery store, and use it twice a day. Squirt three times in each nostril and blow it out onto a Kleenex. By doing this both in the morning and in the evening, it helps to rinse out the mold and fungus that we have breathed into our sinuses during the day. It also helps to flush out any cold and viruses that we may have breathed in, which can also make us sick. I used to get bronchitis twice a year, during the spring and late fall. I always suspected that the late fall bronchitis was caused by breathing in the mold that had grown on the falling leaves after it had rained. Ever since I began using Simply Saline last October, though, I haven't been sick even once. By the way, I just ordered an acai fruit chew from QVC yesterday. As it turns out, the acai fruit, which is from a palm tree that grows the Amazon rain forest, is one of the foods highest in antioxidents. I'm thinking that this chew will be a winner for eczema and skin in general. This is because few weeks ago, I accidentally put a hair conditioner made by Ojon on an eczema blister, and I was amazed at how quickly it healed afterward. I read about the Ojon product to try to figure out why the eczema responded so well, but I couldn't find anything on the website that explained it, only that the Ojon conditioner came from a palm tree in South America. One day, someone posted here that they had gotten well from eczema by watermelon. is high in beta carotene. I posted a Wikipedia article on beta carotene, which also said that palm oil contains one of the highest concentrations of beta carotene. That's when I made the connection that it's the beta carotene in both the Ojon product and in the that had worked so well on eczema. From what I've read, the acai fruit, which is also from a palm tree, has one of the highest concentrations of antioxidents; and from its reddish color, I'm sure the antioxident is beta carotene. Watermelon, the Ojon product and the acai fruit all have a reddish hue, which shows high levels of beta carotene. What a find! I'm keeping my fingers crossed that I'll like the acai fruit chew.

I used to get bronchitis once a year. I forget what time of the year it was. Can't you just take a Beta Caroten supplement? That's what I just started taking. So, are you taking the Acai Fruit chew for both the beta caroten and antioxidant? I wonder what it tastes like. I do hope you like the taste! Maybe you can get it in another form if you don't like it.           AdvertisementThe Tesla Shield. Transformational Technology For Mind Body And Soul. Hi! As I understand it, beta carotene is an antioxident. When an article says that a particular fruit or vegetable is high in antioxidents, it can be any number of antioxidents--Vitamin E, Vitamin C, zinc, beta carotene, among others. I'm surmising that the acai fruit is high in beta carotene, an antioxident, because of its reddish hue. I'm really focusing in on beta carotene as a good antioxident for eczema because of my experience with the Ojon product and because another poster got well from eczema by watemelon. Both are high in beta carotene. I'm not sure if taking a supplement is as effective as the natural food. I've read that foods have enzymes that help our bodies process the vitamins and minerals, so I'm not sure where that leaves supplements. I do know that Vitamin D supplements work, though, because I take a wonderful vitamin supplement with 1200 units of Vitamin D. When my doctor tested my blood this past time, he remarked that I had the second highest level of Vitamin D among his patients. So, Vitamin D supplements do work, since I don't get out in the sun much and don't drink milk. The zinc supplement has also helped me tremendously, so zinc supplements work, at least in my book. The online reviews for the acai fruit chew are very positive. For the most part, the people who commented said that the acai fruit chews taste very good. One person said it tasted awful, though. Many posters advised keeping it in the refrigerator because it is very sticky. If the acai fruit chews are high in beta carotene, I'll force it down, no matter what I think of its taste, though--at least to a point. My only concern is whether I'll be allergic to acai because it comes from a tree, and I'm allergic to trees. That's why I can't use tea tree oil for anything--because I'm allergic to the tea tree. I'm really into antioxidents right now, not only because zinc, an antioxident, got me well from eczema, but because I've been amazed at the improved texture of my skin since I've begun eating more foods with beta carotene. The skin on my hands used to be very dry and wrinkled, while my skin elsewhere looked more normal. After taking the zinc and focusing on foods high in beta carotene in particular, the skin on my hands now is very soft. It's also so much smoother and younger looking that it amazes me. Sometimes I can't help feeling it because it's so different. Then, I remind myself not to touch it too much, LOL! The change in the skin texture of my hands might also be because of the Doctor's Defense, which I'm using as a moisturizer now, but I use it so sparingly, that I think the positive change in my skin texture must also be because of the beta carotene and zinc. I hope this helps!

Published on Dec 05, 2016 and last reviewed on Sep 07, 2018   -  2 min read Atopic dermatitis is a chronic disease, which usually manifests for the first time in infancy or childhood. But, it usually improves with age. Atopic dermatitis is an endogenous eczema () characterized by extreme itchiness and recurrent symmetric eczematous dermatitis. The involvement of a site depends on the age of the patients. This chronic eczema is one of the atopic conditions and together with asthma and hay fever, it has a heritable tendency. Certain environmental factors like winter, inhaled allergens and certain food may aggravate this disease in a certain subset of patients. Its clinical course and features vary with age and are easily aggravated by secondary infections. Herpes simplex viral infection can cause a very severe rash called as Kaposi varicelliform eruption in children with atopic eczema. Three distinct patterns of atopic dermatitis have been recognized depending on the patient's age: Atopic dermatitis in babies begins . Lesions are intensively , which soon discharge serous fluids.

Topical steroids - These are used for localized exudative lesions and sometimes in combination with topical or systemic antibiotics to prevent secondary infections if any. Topical macrolactam immunomodulators like Tacrolimus and Pimecrolimus are the latest topical agents for atopic dermatitis. Systemic antibiotics are used in patients with extensive infected lesions. Systemic steroids with the availability of potent topical steroids and systemic corticosteroids have reduced the eczema substantially. Especially, the sedating ones are used regularly to overcome the itching and are of great value in whom sleep is interrupted. Not only can stress aggravate atopic dermatitis, but the severely affected child is also a source of stress for the whole family. Counseling is an important part of the treatment. when the patient is a child will help them lead a stress-free life.

Atopic dermatitis is the inflammatory condition of the skin. The common causes of atopic dermatitis are allergens, hereditary or environmental factors. In many children, food allergens play a role in causing atopic dermatitis. When it is due to hereditary, genetic mutations can affect the skin and make it lose its capacity to retain moisturize. What are the treatment options for Atopic Dermatitis? - Moisturize your skin twice a day. - Apply topical corticosteroid creams. - Apply an anti-itching cream to the affected area. - Take an allergy or anti-itching medication. - Wet wrap therapy. - Phototherapy. - Do not scratch. - Apply bandages to avoid scratching. - Use mild soaps. - Take a warm bath. - Use a humidifier. - Wear loose and cotton garments. Atopic dermatitis looks like small red bumpy, scaly, or swollen with cracked skin, which is often itchy. Clear fluids may come out of the bumps, and these bumps can dry and form a crust. How Long Does It Take for Atopic Dermatitis to Heal? Atopic dermatitis can often last for weeks, months, or even years. It may occur in children younger than 12 months, and may last for their lifetime, or with occasional flare-ups, or improve with age. There is no cure for atopic dermatitis, but self-care measures and proper treatment can relieve itching and further complications. The rashes in atopic dermatitis tend to flare-up or go away, but it will come back again. What Food Should You Avoid When You Have Atopic Dermatitis? The foods you should avoid when you have atopic dermatitis are: - Eggs. - Dairy products. - Citrus fruits. - Wheat or gluten. - Soy. - Tomatoes. - Spices such as cinnamon, cloves, and vanilla. - Nuts. Atopic dermatitis can cause extreme itching and the skin looks very dry. The more you scratch, the more red, swollen, and sore, it will become. Scratching also results in new bumps or lesions. What Are the Triggering Factors of Atopic Dermatitis? The factors that trigger atopic dermatitis are: - Strong soaps and detergents. - Some fabrics, like scratchy materials or wool. - Perfumes, skincare products, and makeup. - Pollen and mold. - Animal dander. - Tobacco smoke. - Anger and stress. - Dry winter air or low humidity. - Long and hot showers or baths. - Dry skin. - Sweating. - Skin infections or dehydrated skin. - Certain hormones. - Sand or dust. - Certain foods like eggs, wheat, dairy products, soy, and nuts. When atopic dermatitis does not respond to local over-the-counter medications, it needs proper treatment with the physician's help. It cannot be cured completely but can be controlled with appropriate treatment. The following are the treatment options for atopic dermatitis: 1. Topical corticosteroid creams and ointments. 2. Tacrolimus and Pimecrolimus ointments. 3. Crisaborole. 4. Dupilumab. 5. Oral antibiotics. 6. Antihistamines. 7. Phototherapy. 8. Systemic corticosteroids. Can Atopic Dermatitis Spread From One Person to Another? Atopic dermatitis is not contagious, meaning, your skin is not infected or unclean. You will not spread the condition if someone touches the affected skin. It can be well treated and managed with various treatment options and medications. The face skin can be rehydrated with emollients like petroleum jelly and topical steroids to reduce inflammation and itching. As scratching due to itching can worsen the condition and give way to new outbreaks, itching should be treated with antihistamines. The natural methods to get rid of atopic dermatitis are: - Application of coconut oil to moisturize the skin and protect from bacteria, sunflower oil to reduce inflammation, and Cardiospermum oil to relieve itching. - Different types of baths, like oatmeal baths, baking soda baths, bleach baths, vinegar baths, and bath-oil baths can also be used. Some children may outgrow atopic dermatitis and gradually improve as they grow, but others may take it to adulthood. Many are better by the age of 3, and others may have occasional troubles.

You wake up with a rash under your boobs that feels like you’ve been singled out to test-drive a new plague. Itchy, red, sore skin rashes are never fun, especially when they’re aroundThere are many explanations for what could be going on, ranging from mild to severe. Here’s a rundown of causes, home-remedies, and when to seek medical attention. Hormonal changes, heat, sweat, and weight gain can all cause rashes to form between your breasts during pregnancy. However, there are also specific pregnancy-related rashes that can occur in other areas including under the breasts, such as . Pruritic urticarial papules and plaques of pregnancy (PUPPP), is also commonly known as polymorphic eruption of pregnancy. It’s a condition that causes small, red bumps and hive-like bumps to form on the skin, generally during your second or third trimester. It usually appears on the abdomen first, but can spread to the thighs, butt, and breasts. The good news is, it usually goes away after you give birth. You should always consult your doctor before using topical or oral medications during pregnancy. Prurigo of pregnancy (also called Atopic Eruption of Pregnancy), is a condition that can occur anytime during pregnancy and essentially represents eczema (atopic dermatitis) that appears or worsens during pregnancy. It can form in typical areas where eczema appears, usually beginning with a few itchy bumps or a scaly red rash that increases. Thought to be caused by pregnancy-related changes to the immune system, prurigo of pregnancy can last for months, even after the baby is born. There’s no specific treatment for prurigo, but symptoms may be : As with PUPPP, always speak with your doctor before taking any oral or topical medication while pregnant. Mastitis is a condition that causes inflammation and infection in breast tissue. It often occurs in women who are breastfeeding (called ), but can also occur in men and women who aren’t breastfeeding. If a breast doesn’t completely empty at feedings, milk ducts can become clogged and infected. Stagnant milk in breasts that haven’t been emptied creates an environment for bacteria to grow. Bacteria can enter your milk ducts through cracks in the skin of your nipples (#blessed), and spread from your skin’s surface or baby’s mouth. Continuing to breastfeed is safe, and can also help clear out your milk ducts of the infection. Antibiotics and pain relievers may also be prescribed to of mastitis. A breast abscess (aka ) is a condition that can occur if mastitis goes untreated. It’s a of infected fluid or pus that can cause the breast to feel swollen, painful, or warm.

People who have immune system illnesses and those taking antibiotics are especially vulnerable. Candida yeasts thrive in the warm, moist realm of the underboob.

The rash generally looks like small red spots or a cluster of pimples and can feel itchy. The best way to treat (and avoid) heat rash is to avoid friction and keep your skin cool and dry. Cold compresses, , , and cold showers are all helpful ways to alleviate symptoms. Speaking of friction, is a skin condition that occurs when the skin becomes irritated by some external cause, such as excessive friction, like when two breasts rub against each other.

Though it usually shows up on the folds of the arms, legs and neck, it can also appear around the breasts. Stress and food allergies can also trigger eczema, though this is not as typical. The best treatment for eczema is to avoid triggers, apply plenty of and , and use and when necessary. Light therapy is also an option. Inverse psoriasis is a less common form of , a disorder related to immune dysfunction. It’s by smooth, sometimes shiny, red lesions in the folds of the body. Inverse psoriasis is more commonly found in those with deep skin folds. topical calcineurin inhibitors like Protopic (off label) All treatments come with possible side effects and shouldn’t be taken without consulting your doctor. is a condition that causes excessive sweating. Sweating is necessary to cool the body, but people with hyperhidrosis sweat even when they don’t need to be cooled down. Excess sweat attracts infection-causing bacteria, and as you know by now, bacteria + moisture + skin folds = possible breast rashes. Though the cause of hyperhidrosis is unknown, it’s thought to be hereditary — thanks Grandma Ethel. Antiperspirants can be used to treat the symptoms of hyperhidrosis, and some are for body folds rather than underarms. Prescription-strength antiperspirants are also available. If the case is severe, doctors may suggest botox injections. Hailey-Hailey disease has nothing to do with Eminem’s daughter or the comet — it’s a , characterized by a chronic, blistering rash. It often shows up on the neck, armpits, skin folds, and genitals. The rash may itch or burn and develop a crusty yellow over-layer. In time, lesions can cause painful, cracked skin.

Though the rash can develop on any part of the body, it can be commonly found on skin: Scabies is highly contagious and can typically take 4 to 8 weeks to fully develop, but people can still spread the disease before exhibiting any symptoms. There are no effective over-the-counter (OTC) medications for treating scabies. A doctor must prescribe medicated creams or lotions to kill the mites in order to alleviate symptoms. It’s crucial to thoroughly decontaminate any bedding, clothing, towels, or fabric an infected person may have used within three days of treatment. sealing items in a plastic bag for at least 72 hours. Scabies mites generally don’t survive more than 2 to 3 days away from human skin. , or urticaria, is an itchy rash of red or skin-colored bumps and welts that can appear almost anywhere on the skin including under breasts.

The cause of atopic dermatitis isn't clear, but it affects your skin's ability to hold moisture. Your skin becomes dry, itchy, and easily irritated. Most people who have atopic dermatitis have a personal or family history of allergies, such as hay fever () or asthma. Atopic dermatitis starts with dry skin that is often very itchy. Scratching causes the dry skin to become red and irritated (inflamed). Infection often occurs. Tiny bumps that look like little blisters may appear and ooze fluid or crust over. These symptoms—dryness, itchiness, scratching, and inflammation—may come and go. Over time, a recurring rash can lead to tough and thickened skin. Mild atopic dermatitis affects a small area of skin and may be itchy once in a while. Moderate and severe atopic dermatitis cover larger areas of skin and are itchy more often. And at times the itch may be intense. People tend to get the rash on certain parts of the body, depending on their age. Common sites for babies include the scalp and face (especially on the cheeks), the front of the knees, and the back of the elbows. In children, common areas include the neck, wrists, legs, ankles, the creases of elbows or knees, and between the buttocks. In adults, the rash often appears in the creases of the elbows or knees and on the nape of the neck. A doctor can usually tell if you have atopic dermatitis by doing a physical exam and asking questions about your past health. Your doctor may advise allergy testing to find the things that trigger the rash. Allergy tests can be done by an allergist (immunologist) or dermatologist. Atopic dermatitis is usually treated with medicines that are put on your skin (topical medicines). Gentle skin care, including using plenty of moisturizer, is also important. Getting medical treatment early may keep your symptoms from getting worse. If the topical medicines don't help, your doctor may prescribe other treatments, such as pills, phototherapy, or injections.

Perioral Dermatitis Might Be What’s Causing Your Red Face Rash Perioral Dermatitis Might Be What’s Causing Your Red Face Rash Discovering anywhere on your body isn’t ideal, but a red rash around your mouth can add self-consciousness to your normal sense of worry. It could be perioral dermatitis, an itchy red that seemingly pops up out of nowhere on the lower part of your face, but it can be hard to pinpoint whether or not that’s what you have. Here’s how to tell if you’re dealing with this particular —plus what you should do if perioral dermatitis does turn out to be your issue. Perioral dermatitis is often mistaken for other skin conditions. You may not have heard of perioral dermatitis before, and that’s understandable. It’s pretty much a nobody compared to more well-known conditions like and . So no one would blame you for assuming you’re dealing with those kinds of conditions. Knowing the symptoms of perioral dermatitis might help you differentiate it: It tends to appear around the mouth and in the folds of skin around your nose, though it can sometimes appear close to your eyes and even near your , according to the (AAD). No matter where it is, perioral dermatitis might start in a pretty localized spot, like the corners of your lips, then spread from there, Cynthia Bailey, M.D., a diplomate of the American Board of Dermatology and president and CEO of , tells SELF. Perioral dermatitis bumps are distinct in size and color: There is usually a rash of small bumps, according to the . These bumps are often red in people with light skin and flesh-colored in people of color, the explains. The rash typically causes , flaky skin, and may also come with itching and even burning. If it helps, here are some specific ways perioral dermatitis is distinct from issues like eczema and acne: Perioral dermatitis looks (and behaves) differently than eczema: While both conditions do result in a rash, can manifest as a dry, itchy rash made up of red or brownish-gray patches; thickened, cracked, scaly skin; or small raised bumps that leak liquid and crust over when you scratch them. Eczema can also show up anywhere on your body (including ), but it’s most likely to be on your hands, feet, ankles, wrists, neck, upper chest, eyelids, and inside the crooks of your elbows and knees, according to the . Perioral dermatitis doesn’t look like acne either: typically occurs when the hair follicles in the skin become clogged with dead skin cells and oil, the explains. While the bumps in your perioral dermatitis rash may be filled with fluid or pus, they typically don’t come to a pale, ready-to-burst head the way often does, , M.D., an assistant clinical professor of dermatology at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, tells SELF. Instead, if the bumps contain any liquid, the fluid is more likely to be evenly spread throughout, the way it is in a blister. Doctors believe corticosteroid creams are one of the most common perioral dermatitis causes. Many people with perioral dermatitis get it when they use a corticosteroid medication on the area for too long, the says. Corticosteroids tamp down on inflammation, so they’re used to treat everything from eczema to (painful little cracks at the corners of your mouth)—basically, anything that’s rooted in inflamed skin. But exposing your skin to them for too long can have repercussions. Whether you’re using an over-the-counter or prescription corticosteroid medication, following the instructions is key. Though corticosteroids are the main culprit here, a wide range of things that irritate your skin can cause perioral dermatitis, , M.D., a New York City–based board-certified dermatologist, tells SELF. That could be your skin-care products, toothpaste, and allergens that upset your skin, the says. Perioral dermatitis treatment often comes down to figuring out what’s irritating your skin. If you think you’re dealing with perioral dermatitis after applying a corticosteroid cream, you should either stop using it immediately or try to get in touch with a doctor (like your dermatologist) first. But which route you take depends on if you’re using an over-the-counter corticosteroid you chose yourself or if you’re using one your doctor prescribed. If it’s the former, you should stop using it right away, see how your symptoms change, and fill in your doctor if you still need help. If your doctor prescribed the cream, consult with them to see if you can stop using it, the says. Given the outbreak, we know it might not be possible to see your doctor IRL, but consider having a phone call or making a tele-health appointment. The rash can get worse when you first stop applying the corticosteroid. Even if it’s causing your perioral dermatitis, it still might be combating unrelated inflammation in the area, so that condition can bounce back with a vengeance for a bit. You’ll probably be tempted to start using the corticosteroid again, but don’t—that will only give you temporary relief, the says, and even that’s not a guarantee. Then, every time you stop using it, you might experience a perioral dermatitis flare-up. If you haven’t been using a corticosteroid cream and are still dealing with perioral dermatitis, check in with a doctor if possible. Every case of perioral dermatitis is different, which is why it’s best to chat with a dermatologist ASAP for help treating it, no matter the cause, Dr. Bailey says. If it’s not diagnosed and treated early, the bumps can become deeper and more stubborn, she says. To deal with perioral dermatitis, a dermatologist may do the following, the says: Examine your rash to determine the correct treatment plan. Prescribe an oral antibiotic such as tetracycline or erythromycin. Figure out if you need to treat any inflammation you were potentially targeting with corticosteroids. Advise you on how to so it can get better. Your skin-care regimen is extremely important in this time—the last thing you want to do is douse your healing skin in harsh chemicals. The specifically recommends that you switch to a mild, fragrance-free cleanser if you’re not using one already, and be extra gentle when you wash your face. You may also need to use gentle, fragrance-free skin-care products. Whatever you do, avoid potentially irritating ingredients, and check out these products that are often great for . Be sure to ask your doctor for recommendations if you’re at all unsure about what you should use. Dealing with a red rash around your mouth is stressful, but unfortunately there isn’t much guidance on how to cure perioral dermatitis fast. That’s because perioral dermatitis doesn’t just go away overnight, even with treatment. Instead, it usually clears out slowly and can take a few weeks up to a few months to completely go away, the says, so you’ll need to incorporate a bit of patience into your treatment plan. You can prevent perioral dermatitis going forward. In most cases, as long as you avoid whatever caused your perioral dermatitis, that red rash around your mouth should be gone for good, according to Dr. Zeichner. If you were using some type of facial corticosteroid cream, see if your doctor has any other suggestions for addressing the skin issues that ail you. If your perioral dermatitis seemed linked to some other kind of cosmetic product (like makeup, cleanser, or sunscreen) or even the toothpaste you were using, now’s the time to experiment with some . Ideally, you can get the results you’re after without a red rash popping up around your mouth to keep you company. 8 Causes of Adult Acne—And How to Actually Treat It The 12 Best Eczema Creams to Soothe Dry, Itchy Skin Korin is a former New Yorker who now lives at the beach.

(ICD-10 L30.2) There are eczemas overlaid by viral infections ( or ), and eczemas resulting from underlying disease (e.g., ). Eczemas originating from ingestion of medications, foods, and chemicals, have not yet been clearly systematized. Other rare eczematous disorders exist in addition to those listed here. Exclusive of infants during at least the first few months may decrease the risk. There is no good evidence that a mother's diet during or breastfeeding affects the risk, nor is there evidence that delayed introduction of certain foods is useful. There is tentative evidence that probiotics in infancy may reduce rates but it is insufficient to recommend its use. Certain military and healthcare personnel who might come into contact with the are still vaccinated against the virus. Those who also have eczema should not receive the smallpox vaccination due to risk of developing , a potentially severe and sometimes fatal complication. There is no known cure for some types of dermatitis, with treatment aiming to control symptoms by reducing inflammation and relieving itching. Contact dermatitis is treated by avoiding what is causing it. Bathing once or more a day is recommended, usually for five to ten minutes in warm water. should be avoided, as they tend to strip the skin of natural oils and lead to excessive dryness. The American Academy of Dermatology suggests using a controlled amount of bleach diluted in a bath to help with atopic dermatitis. There has not been adequate evaluation of changing the diet to reduce eczema. There is some evidence that infants with an established may have a reduction in symptoms if eggs are eliminated from their diets. Benefits have not been shown for other elimination diets, though the studies are small and poorly executed. Establishing that there is a before dietary change could avoid unnecessary lifestyle changes. People can wear clothing designed to manage the itching, scratching and peeling. House dust mite reduction and avoidance measures have been studied in low quality trials and have not shown evidence of improving eczema. Low-quality evidence indicates that moisturizing agents () may reduce eczema severity and lead to fewer flares. In children, oil–based formulations appear to be better, and water–based formulations are not recommended. It is unclear if moisturizers that contain are more or less effective than others. Products that contain dyes, perfumes, or peanuts should not be used. at night may be useful. Some or may reduce irritation in occupational irritant hand dermatitis, a skin disease that can affect people in jobs that regularly come into contact with water, , or other irritants. Some emollients may reduce the number of flares in people with dermatitis. If symptoms are well controlled with moisturizers, steroids may only be required when flares occur. are effective in controlling and suppressing symptoms in most cases. Once daily use is generally enough. For mild-moderate eczema a weak steroid may be used (e.g., ), while in more severe cases a higher-potency steroid (e.g., ) may be used. In severe cases, oral or injectable corticosteroids may be used. While these usually bring about rapid improvements, they have greater side effects. Long term use of topical steroids may result in , , . Their use on delicate skin (face or groin) is therefore typically with caution. They are, however, generally well tolerated. , where the skin turns red upon stopping steroid use, has been reported among adults who use topical steroids at least daily for more than a year. There is little evidence supporting the use of medications for the relief of dermatitis. Sedative antihistamines, such as , may be useful in those who are unable to sleep due to eczema. Second generation antihistamines have minimal evidence of benefit. Of the second generation antihistamines studied, is the only one to show evidence of improvement in itching with minimal side effects. Topical like and may be better in the short term and appear equal to steroids after a year of use. Their use is reasonable in those who do not respond to or are not tolerant of steroids. Treatments are typically recommended for short or fixed periods of time rather than indefinitely. Tacrolimus 0.1% has generally proved more effective than pimecrolimus, and equal in effect to mid-potency topical steroids. There is no link to increased risk of cancer from topical use of 1% pimecrolimus cream. When eczema is severe and does not respond to other forms of treatment, systemic are sometimes used. Immunosuppressants can cause significant side effects and some require regular blood tests. The most commonly used are , , and . is a new medication that improves eczema lesions, especially moderate to severe eczema. Dupilumab, a monoclonal antibody, suppresses inflammation by targeting the . using light has tentative support but the quality of the evidence is not very good. A number of different types of light may be used including and ; in some forms of treatment, light sensitive chemicals such as are also used. Overexposure to ultraviolet light carries its own risks, particularly that of . Limited evidence suggests that may reduce itching in those affected by . There is currently no scientific evidence for the claim that sulfur treatment relieves eczema. It is unclear whether Chinese herbs help or harm. Dietary supplements are commonly used by people with eczema. Neither nor taken orally have been shown to be effective. Both are associated with gastrointestinal upset. are likely to make little to no difference in symptoms. There is insufficient evidence to support the use of zinc, selenium, vitamin D, vitamin E, (vitamin B6), , , , or as dietary supplements. spinal manipulation lacks evidence to support its use for dermatitis. There is little evidence supporting the use of psychological treatments. While dilute bleach baths have been used for infected dermatitis there is little evidence for this practice. Most cases are well managed with topical treatments and ultraviolet light. About 2% of cases are not. In more than 60% of young children, the condition subsides by . Globally dermatitis affected approximately 230 million people as of 2010 (3.5% of the population). Dermatitis is most commonly seen in , with female predominance of eczema presentations occurring during the reproductive period of 15–49 years. In the UK about 20% of children have the condition, while in the United States about 10% are affected. Although little data on the rates of eczema over time exists prior to the 1940s, the rate of eczema has been found to have increased substantially in the latter half of the 20th century, with eczema in school-aged children being found to increase between the late 1940s and 2000. In the there has been rise in the rate of eczema over time. The incidence and lifetime prevalence of eczema in England has been seen to increase in recent times. Dermatitis affected about 10% of U.S. workers in 2010, representing over 15 million workers with dermatitis. Prevalence rates were higher among females than among males, and among those with some college education or a college degree compared to those with a high school diploma or less. Workers employed in healthcare and social assistance industries and life, physical, and social science occupations had the highest rates of reported dermatitis. About 6% of dermatitis cases among U.S. workers were attributed to work by a healthcare professional, indicating that the prevalence rate of work-related dermatitis among workers was at least 0.6%. from ἔκζεμα , from ἐκζέ-ειν , from ἐκ ""out"" + ζέ-ειν ""to boil"" The term ""atopic dermatitis"" was coined in 1933 by Wise and Sulzberger. as a topical treatment for eczema was fashionable in the Victorian and Edwardian eras. The word dermatitis is from the Greek δέρμα ""skin"" and -ῖτις ""inflammation"" and eczema is from : ""eruption"". Some cosmetics are marketed as hypoallergenic to imply that their use is less likely to lead to an allergic reaction than other products. However, the term ""hypoallergenic"" is not regulated, and no research has been done showing that products labeled ""hypoallergenic"" are less problematic than any others. In 1977, courts overruled the U.S. 's regulation of the use of the term hypoallergenic. In 2019, the on released a document about claims made concerning cosmetics, but this was issued as ""guidance"" not a regulation. are under preliminary research to determine their potential as treatments for atopic dermatitis, with only showing evidence of efficacy, as of 2018.

360405f0-b5f7-4542-9fd0-fa1b22ead7db,"Bacteria, a fungal infection, an allergic reaction -- what could be the cause of this rash? See more . Somehow, an itchy, red rash has appeared on your skin and you're racking your brain to figure out how it got there. As you ponder your pruritic predicament, the rash seems to be getting larger. Is your imagination getting the best of you, or could it be something serious? In general, a rash is defined as a change in your skin's color or texture that is different from normal [source: ]. When you spot a rash, you probably wonder where it came from. Although your skin does have natural defenses, things like viruses, fungi and parasites can breach those defenses and cause you to break out in a rash. Other common causes of rashes include reactions to certain medications and exposure to heat [source: ]. A number of factors can influence where and how you get a rash. Your age can be a factor, as aging skin is particularly prone to certain skin rashes, such as shingles, while small children are prone to rashes from chicken pox and roseola [sources: , ]. Similarly, your lifestyle can be a factor. For example, athletes tend to get hot and sweaty, which makes them more prone to conditions like heat rash [source: ]. Some rashes will go away on their own -- poison ivy, for example, should go away within one to three weeks [source: ]. Meanwhile, others can be serious and need the attention of a doctor. How do you know if a rash needs medical attention? If you can't identify the rash or its cause, if you have a fever, if the rash is painful or it just won't go away, then you should visit a physician. If you've examined your rash and you want to gather some more intel before heading off to the doctor, read on to find out about the different types of rashes. So, you've got a red, raised, super itchy rash and you want to figure out what it is. Unless you've been walking barefoot through poison ivy, it's going to take a little research, and probably a physician, to solve the puzzle. But you might be able to narrow down the possibilities by considering a few things. Basically, most rashes fall into one of the following categories: Localized rashes caused by a bacterial or fungal infection Localized rashes that are caused by direct contact with an irritant or an allergen Localized or widespread rashes that are caused by an allergic reaction to some type of medication or a virus To determine your rash type, consider what it looks like and what you've been exposed to such as any new medications, potential irritants or allergens. Then try comparing that information with descriptions of some common rashes, such as: : Small bumps that are either fluid-filled or look like blisters can be a result of heat rash, especially if you've been out in the heat, been sweating, and/or wearing tight clothing. : If you have a bright red rash in moist areas where your skin rubs together (think under your arms, behind your knees, or in other skin folds), you may have intertrigo. : If a rash suddenly appears after you've just started on a new antibiotic, anti-seizure medication or diuretic, you might have a medicine-related rash. This rash starts out as small red splotches that quickly spread to cover large portions of your skin. : Contrary to its name, there are no worms involved here. Instead, this rash is caused by a fungal infection. It looks like an expanding ring, which grows outward. : If you've been swimming in not-so-clean water, you may have swimmer's itch, which is a mild rash of itchy red bumps caused by parasites [sources: , ] While these are fairly common, there are some rashes that are even more so. Keep reading to see what they are and how they are likely to manifest on your skin. There are actually several types of heat-related rashes you can get, one of which causes bumps that sting, and another that doesn't hurt, but does cause fluid-filled bumps. Though is categorized separate from heat rash, it is often caused or at least exacerbated by heat. To avoid heat-related skin conditions, try to keep your skin adequately clean and cool [source: ]. While rashes themselves are not unusual, some rashes are more common than others are, including the following: There are several types of dermatitis, an inflammation of the skin. Atopic dermatitis is a reoccurring condition, so you'll likely know already if you have this type of rash. Your skin will be itchy and inflamed, particularly in folds of skin like the elbows, knees and neck. Contact dermatitis can present as itchy red patches from an irritating source (irritant contact dermatitis) or bumps and blisters from an allergen (allergic contact dermatitis).Poison ivy and poison oak are examples of allergic contact dermatitis [source: ]. With irritant dermatitis if the exposure is strong -- say to a harsh soap or chemical -- you can get a rash immediately [source: ]. If you've ever had the chicken pox, then you could get shingles. Once you get over chicken pox, the virus stays in your body and can become active later in life, resulting in shingles. This rash not only gives you blisters, but it also affects the nerves, causing you pain. You usually recover in three to five weeks, although you may still experience pain after the rash is gone [source: ]. Also known as the Christmas tree rash, pityriasis rosea usually starts in one spot and then sweeps outward, sort of like the aforementioned tree. Unfortunately, scaly, itchy rashes are the only gifts associated with this Christmas tree [source: ]. Even though they may feel like they're hanging on forever, particularly if they're itchy or uncomfortable, all of these rashes tend to be short-lived. But not all rashes are that accommodating, so read on to find out about rashes that hang around or recur. Diaper rash is something every child's parent wants to avoid. A baby's wet diaper is like a bacterial bed and breakfast, inviting all sorts of nasty guests to bother your baby's bottom. Like other rashes, diaper rash can range in severity from minor redness to sores and infections. The best way to avoid diaper rash is by keeping your baby's bottom as dry as possible. If your baby does wind up with an overly rosy rear, change the baby's diapers often, make sure you use a mild detergent to wash the baby's clothes and let the baby go diaper-free whenever possible so his or her bottom can get fresh air. You can also try using a cream on your baby's bottom to help heal and protect the skin. With proper care, the diaper rash should clear up within a few days. If not, give your pediatrician a call [source: ]. It's bad enough to have to deal with a rash when it's a short-term condition like, say a reaction to poison ivy. But some rashes are even more irritating because either they never go away or, if they do, they keep coming back to annoy you. : Eczema is kind of a catchall term for inflammation of the skin, and there are many different types of it. The most severe and long lasting of these is atopic dermatitis. The causes of eczema -- including atopic dermatitis -- are unknown. Eczema is chronic, marked by periods of flare-ups. Although the itchy, red rash associated with atopic dermatitis can appear anywhere on the body, it is often found on the elbows, knees and face [source: ]. Also known as lichen annularis, granuloma annulare is a chronic rash that forms in a ringed pattern of red or yellowish bumps that often appear on the feet, fingers and hands. In some cases, these ringed rashes are itchy [source: ]. : Although it is sometimes associated with Hepatitis C, the cause of this skin disorder is generally unknown. Persons suffering from lichen planus will find shiny purple or reddish-purple flat-topped bumps on their skin. The rash can affect any area of skin, but it is most commonly found on the wrists, ankles, back, neck and lower legs [source: ]. : In general, psoriasis rashes have white or silver scales accompanied by patches of red, dry skin that can be itchy and/or painful. The degree to which this skin disease affects people varies -- some present with only a few rashes, while others have rashes all over their bodies. Like atopic dermatitis, psoriasis is marked by periods of flare-ups and there is no known cure. Persons with psoriasis can also develop psoriatic arthritis [source: ]. Now that you've investigated some of the more common recurring skin rashes, read on to find out some of the causes of these and other rashes. Often confused with acne, rosacea is actually a chronic skin condition that's marked by inflamed skin and red bumps that can be mistaken for pimples. Like atopic dermatitis and psoriasis, rosacea has periods where it flares up. If you notice that your skin looks like it has acne, but doesn't respond to regular acne treatments, and it seems to be on a cycle of flare-ups, check with your doctor to see if you might have rosacea. Although there's no cure, your doctor will be able to help you manage your symptoms [source: ]. If the idea of getting an itchy, red rash doesn't sound appealing, it would seem that the best-case scenario would be to avoid getting a rash at all. However, that's not as easy as it sounds. Even if you have good personal hygiene, which certainly helps to keep your skin healthy, there are still ways that rash-causing agents can latch onto your skin. A rash may be a sign that some bacteria have moved in, either right on your skin or somewhere in your body. Some diseases that are caused by bacteria cause rashes on your skin, like scarlet fever [source: ]. Likewise, bacteria growing on the skin can also cause some skin infections, like intertrigo [source: ]. Typically, fungi love moist, warm areas, so those hot, sweaty places on your skin look like prime real estate to a fungus. Fungal infections can be the guilty party if you're suffering from intertrigo (although bacteria can be a culprit, too) [source: ]. One of the most common fungal skin infections is ringworm, which is also known as ""jock itch"" if you get it in the groin area and ""athlete's foot"" if you get it on your feet [source: ]. Chicken pox, measles and roseola are all examples of rashes caused by a virus [source: ]. In adults, shingles is caused by the varicella-zoster virus, leftover from when you had chicken pox as a kid [source: ]. With so many causes out there, it seems like everyone should be covered with rashes. Fortunately, that's not the case, but in the event that you do contract a rash, read on to find out some of the treatments available. Exanthems are a special class of rashes that can make you feel particularly miserable. They spread across the entire body, covering large patches of skin, and are typically accompanied by fever, headache, aches, and pains. These nasty rashes can be caused by a virus, bacterial infection or drug reaction, among other things. [source: ]. With the number of possible causes, conditions and diseases out there, it seems almost inevitable that you'll one day find yourself with inflamed, unhappy skin. Whether you contract poison oak on a day hike, have a reaction to that new medication you're taking or you pick up ringworm while working at the local cat shelter, there's no need to worry that your skin woes will remain forever. There are many treatment options, even if your rash is chronic: If you have a bacterial skin infection, you may be able to let it heal on its own, or you may need a doctor's attention. Some conditions, like intertrigo, can go away on their own if you practice good hygiene, keep the area dry and avoid tight clothing [source: ]. But if you have a severe bacterial skin infection, you may need an antibiotic cream or other prescription medication [source: ]. Fungal infections are usually treated with antifungal medications. Over-the-counter antifungal creams are available, but if you have a particularly difficult or persistent fungus, you may need prescription oral antifungal medications [source: ]. If you have a rash caused by a virus, the specific virus will determine the treatment. In general, when a virus is the cause, the symptoms of the rash are treated rather than the virus that causes it. For example, your doctor may suggest antihistamines or a topical anti-itch medication to help ease your itching [source: ]. The bottom line is that although the skin does manage to protect itself quite well, there are hosts of potential invaders and irritants that can breach its defenses. If you have a rash, it's best to see your doctor so that he or she can identify the culprit, treat it and return your skin to good health. For more information, follow the links on the next page. Rashes can look fairly gnarly, particularly if you have blisters that are oozing or sores that are weeping. With all that scary-looking skin, you might wonder if rashes are contagious. In truth, it really depends on the type of rash you have. Some rashes that look particularly bad, like severe cases of shingles and intertrigo, aren't contagious at all. But ringworm, which can sometimes just be a small, innocent-looking patch, is very contagious [source: ]. Your physician will be able to tell you if you're contagious.

Rash Causes, Symptoms, Signs, Treatment, and Cure Topic Guide : A rash is a visible skin outbreak. Examples of noninfectious rashes include eczema, psoriasis, contact dermatitis, seborrheic dermatitis, rosacea, hives, and allergic dermatitis. Types of infectious rashes include ringworm, impetigo, scabies, herpes, chickenpox, and shingles. Rashes may be caused by fungi, viruses, bacteria, and parasites. Treatment depends upon the type of rash. Chickenpox (varicella) is a highly contagious infection that typically affects children. Symptoms and signs include an itchy red blistering rash that forms first on the torso and then spreads to the extremities. Treatment may incorporate Tylenol or Advil for fever, IV fluids for dehydration, antibiotics for bacterial skin infections, calamine lotion, cool compresses and baths, and Benadryl, Claritin, or Zyrtec for itch relief. Dermatitis is an inflammation of the skin. Contact dermatitis is a localized rash or irritation of the skin caused by contact with a foreign substance. Coxsackievirus infection is spread from person to person when an infected person does not cover their mouth when coughing or sneezing or touches someone with unwashed hands. Though most cases of coxsackievirus infection are mild, with symptoms including diarrhea and sore throat, the infection may also cause meningitis, encephalitis, chest pain, and myopericarditis. Infection in newborns may be deadly. There is no specific treatment for coxsackievirus, though acetaminophen and ibuprofen may be used to treat the symptoms. Discover the causes, symptoms, treatment, risk factors, and tests for dandruff, also known as seborrhea or seborrheic dermatitis. Several shampoos and home remedies can provide dandruff control for this common skin condition. Eczema is a term frequently used to describe any sort of dermatitis. Causes include genetic inheritance. Common triggers of atopic dermatitis include soaps, detergents, solvents, lotions, sweating, staph bacteria, use of plastic or rubber gloves, or rough wool clothing. Treatment for eczema can be avoidance of irritants, OTC anti-inflammatory creams, prescription steroid and anti-inflammatory creams, and in some cases, antibiotics. Genital herpes a highly infectious disease caused by a virus. Genital herpes is very common and is transmitted from person to person during sexual activity. Signs and symptoms of genital herpes include blisters or ulcers in the genital area. Some individuals have no symptoms. There is no cure for genital herpes, only medication to decrease the frequency of outbreaks. Hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) is a viral illness that is common in children. Symptoms and signs include fever and a blister-like rash on the palms of the hands and soles of the feet and blisters in the mouth. Treatment focuses on alleviating the symptoms of the infection. Hives are a sudden allergic skin reaction. Hives are raised reddish bumps that cause severe itching. Angioedema is similar to hives but the welts are larger and involve a deeper layer in the skin. Allergies, insect stings and bites, stress, exercise, and infections are common causes of hives and angioedema. In mild cases, no treatment is needed. Severe reactions should be treated by a health care professional. Impetigo is a common baterial infection of the skin. The bacteria enter through a cut or other injury to the skin. Symptoms and signs include rash and/or pus-filled blisters. Treatments include oral and/or topical antibiotics. Oral herpes is an infection caused by the herpes simplex virus. The virus causes painful sores on your lips, gums, tongue, roof of your mouth, and inside your cheeks. Psoriasis is a common and chronic skin disorder caused by inflammation that affects 1%-2% of people in the U.S. There are several different types of psoriasis. Clinical types of psoriasis include pustular psoriasis, erythrodermic psoriasis, or guttate psoriasis. Psoriasis is typically found on the knees, elbows, lower back, and scalp. Symptoms and signs include red, raised, scaly areas on the skin that may itch or burn. Treatment may involve topical therapy, phototherapy, and medication. Ringworm (or tinea corporis) is a common fungal infection resulting from dermatophytes. Symptoms and signs include lesions on the trunk, legs, arms, neck, and face. Read about the cause of ringworm, how to get rid of ringworm, and whether ringworm is contagious. Learn about treatments and home remedies for ringworm. Scalp ringworm (tinea capitis) is a very common fungal infection among children throughout the world. Symptoms and signs include hair loss, reddening, crusting, and scaling of the scalp. Treatment typically involves oral antifungal medications and medicated shampoo. Scabies is a skin condition that causes severe itching. Scabies lesions on the skin may look like pimples, and the skin may also be red. Treatment involves washing all clothing and bed linens, vacuuming rugs and furniture, and applying a prescription cream to kill the mites. Seaweed irritation is caused by direct contact with Lyngbya majuscula seaweed when it becomes trapped under bathing suits and other areas where skin to skin contact occurs. Treatment of seaweed irritation includes over-the-counter remedies. Symptoms of seaweed irritation include itching, burning, redness, blisters, and swelling. Consult a doctor if any signs of infection or if any symptoms other than a local reaction (redness or itching) occurs on the skin. Shingles is caused by the same virus that causes chickenpox. Initially, the virus causes chickenpox. The virus remains dormant in the body until the virus is reactivated by a trigger such as stress, fatigue, cancer, radiation treatments, injury, HIV/AIDS, or a weakened immune system. Symptoms include pain in a broad band on one side of the body, fever, chills, headache, itching, and a red, raised rash. Treatment may incorporate pain medication, applying cool compresses, and avoiding skin-to-skin contact with others. Staphylococcus is a type of bacteria that causes infection (often called a ""staph infection""). Staphylococcus can cause infections in almost any organ system in the body. Symptoms of visible staph infections are a redness, swelling, tenderness, pus or crusty covering at the site of infection. Bacterial culture is used to test for staph infection. Treatment may involve surgery and/or antibiotics. Scalp ringworm (tinea capitis) is a very common fungal infection among children throughout the world. Symptoms and signs include hair loss, reddening, crusting, and scaling of the scalp. Treatment typically involves oral antifungal medications and medicated shampoo.

Dermatitis has many causes, including contact with skin irritants (such as the oil that causes poison ivy or poison oak); venous stasis, with edema and vesicle formation near the ankles; habitual scratching, as is found in neurodermatitis; dry skin, as in winter itch; and ultraviolet light, as in photosensitivity reactions.No laboratory testing is usually necessary; diagnosis is made by observation of the skin irritation (usually red, rough plaques) and the location on the body (face, neck and upper trunk).When a source of dermatitis is identifiable (such as in contact dermatitis due to a detergent or topical cosmetic), the best treatment is to avoid the irritating substance and to cleanse the affected area immediately with mild soap and water. Once skin inflammation becomes established, topical corticosteroid ointments or systemic steroids (during extreme exacerbations), topical immunomodulating agents (in patients over 2), weak tar preparations and ultraviolet B light therapy (to increase the thickness of the stratum corneum), and antihistamines may be used, with antibiotics reserved for secondary infections. Dermatologists may prescribe occlusive dressings intermittently to help clear lichenified skin.The patient should avoid known skin irritants. Tepid baths, cool compresses, and astringents sometimes help relieve inflammation and itch. Moisturizing creams or lotions following bathing help to retain skin moisture, but perfumed products should be avoided. Drug therapy is administered and evaluated for desired effects and adverse reactions. The patient is taught to apply topical medications and is informed about their most common side effects. Scratching is discouraged and the fingernails kept short to limit excoriation. The patient should be made aware that drowsiness may occur with antihistamine use and that driving or operating mechanical equipment should be avoided until the extent of this effect is known. Health care professionals should be careful not to show any negative feelings when touching lesions during assessment or treatment but should follow standard precautions. Skin changes alter body image, and the patient will need assistance in accepting and coping with what he or she may view as disfigurement. Children and adolescents may require and benefit from counseling to help them deal with the emotional components of their condition. Dermatitis that is usually seen on the face or exposed skin surfaces and typically results from exposure and sensitization to ultraviolet rays. Adults over age 50 may be affected. SYN: Chronic dermatitis of unknown cause found in patients with a history of allergy. The disease usually begins after the first 2 months of life, and those affected may experience exacerbations and remissions throughout childhood and adulthood. In many cases, there is a family history of allergy or atopy. If both parents have atopic dermatitis, the chances are nearly 80% that their children will have it. Atopic dermatitis is typically found in flexural creases of the body, e.g., the antecubital and popliteal fossae. The skin lesions consist of reddened, cracked, and thickened skin that can become exudative and crusty from scratching. Scarring or secondary infection may occur. Most patients have an elevated level of immunoglobulin E in their serum. The patient should avoid soaps and ointments. Bathing is kept to a minimum, but bath oils may help to prevent drying of the skin. Clothing should be soft textured and should not contain wool. Fingernails should be kept short to decrease damage from scratching. Antihistamines may help reduce itching at night. Heavy exercise should be avoided because it induces perspiration. A nonlipid softening lotion followed by a corticosteroid in a propylene glycol base may effectively treat acute exacerbations; when large areas of the body are involved, oral steroids may be needed. Because of the adverse effects associated with corticosteroids, topical immunosuppressants such as tacrolimus that decrease T-cell activity have been developed. Antistaphylococcal antibiotics may be needed to control secondary infection, introduced when scratching causes microfissures in the skin. A type of phytophotodermatitis with postinflammatory hyperpigmentation at the site of application of perfumes or colognes containing oil of bergamot. SYN: Dermatitis due to contact with allergens or an irritating substance. Allergic contact dermatitis is caused by a T-cell-mediated hypersensitivity reaction to natural or synthetic environmental allergens. These combine with skin proteins, altering the normal autoantigens so that new, foreign antigens are created. Nonallergic contact dermatitis, also known as irritative contact dermatitis, is usually caused by exposure to detergent, soap, or other skin irritant. SYN: SEE: ; SEE: (1) Allergic reaction to topical anestheticSkin changes, which appear 4 to 48 hr after exposure, depending on the degree of sensitivity to the allergen, consist of erythema, local edema, and blisters. The blisters may weep in severe cases. Most patients complain of intense itching. Signs and symptoms of the disease usually last 10 to 14 days. Reexposure to the cause will trigger a relapse.Tepid baths, cool compresses, topical astringents (such as solutions of aluminum acetate), antihistamines, and corticosteroids all provide some relief. Allergic reaction to topical anesthetic Dermatitis of sheep and goats caused by , a genus of poxvirus, and transmitted to humans by direct contact. The lesion on humans is usually solitary and on the hands, arms, or face. This maculopapular area may progress to a pustule up to 3 cm in diameter and may last 3 to 6 weeks. SYN: Generalized dermatitis involving at least half the body surface area. When skin involvement is extensive, the patient may become depressed because of the cosmetic changes.It may be caused by allergic drug reactions (such as vancomycin or penicillins), other allergies, infiltration of the skin by leukemias or lymphomas, atopy, or psoriasis.Symptoms include extensive skin redness, swelling, itching, thickening, scaling, often with loss of hair follicles, and swelling of lymph nodes.The disease is diagnosed by physical assessment of the skin and may be confirmed by biopsy if there is any doubt.When exfoliative dermatitis results from a drug reaction, withholding the offending agent will usually allow the skin to clear within a few weeks. Lymphomatous exfoliative dermatitis is treated with chemotherapy to combat the primary tumor.Patients with widespread dermatitis often need hospitalization to maintain normal body temperature, normal hydration, adequate wound care, and symptomatic relief. SYN: Deliberately self-inflicted irritation or injury to the skin. A chronic dermatitis characterized by erythematous, papular, vesicular, bullous, or pustular lesions with a tendency to grouping and with intense itching and burning. It is associated with allergy to gluten and is often found in patients with celiac disease (gluten-sensitive enteropathy). The lesions develop suddenly and spread peripherally. The disease is variable and erratic, and an attack may be prolonged for weeks or months. Secondary infection may follow trauma to the inflamed areas.The disease is diagnosed by physical assessment of the skin and may be confirmed by biopsy if there is any doubt.Oral provides substantial relief of symptoms in a few days. Sulfapyridine also may be used. Dermatitis affecting the perineum, upper thighs, or intergluteal folds resulting from chronic exposure to urine or stool. A blistering dermatitis that appears on the exposed skin of hikers, florists, gardeners, and those who work outdoors in bright sunlight. It is a phototoxic reaction caused by exposure to light-sensitizing chemicals in some plants (such as parsley, rue, bergamot, or figs). Dermatitis on the scalp and neck, composed of papules interspersed with pustules. The rash ultimately produces scarlike elevations resembling keloids. Dermatitis resulting from irritation or sensitization of the skin by urushiol, the toxic resin of plants of the genus (). There is no absolute immunity. Susceptibility varies greatly, even in the same individual.Those sensitive to poison ivy may also react to contact with other plants, such as the mango rind and cashew oil. These plants contain chemicals that cross-react with the sap present in poison ivy, poison oak, and poison sumac.Some time elapses between skin contact with the poison and first appearance of symptoms, varying from a few hours to several days, depending on the sensitivity of the patient and the condition of the skin. Moderate itching or a burning sensation is soon followed by small blisters; later manifestations vary. Blisters usually rupture and are followed by oozing of serum and subsequent crusting.The disease is diagnosed by physical assessment of the skin and may be confirmed by biopsy if there is any doubt.Some barrier creams have been used to prevent poison ivy dermatitis. They are sprayed on the skin before anticipated contact with the plant.In mild dermatitis, antihistamines and a lotion to relieve itching are usually sufficient. In severe dermatitis, cool, wet dressings or compresses, potassium permanganate baths, and topical corticosteroids are often effective. In some instances, intramuscular or oral corticosteroid therapy is used. If plant leaves are burned and the smoke inhaled, or if plant leaves are ingested, the patient should be directed to an emergency care center. Demulcents, fluids, morphine, and a high-protein, low-fat diet may be prescribed.Prevention is important in those with known sensitivity or in those with no previous contact with or reaction to the plant. Instruction of the patient focuses on helping him or her to recognize the plant, to avoid contact with it, and to wear long-sleeved shirts and long pants in wooded areas. If contact occurs, the patient should wash with soap and water immediately to remove the toxic oil. Contaminated clothing and pets also should be promptly and thoroughly washed because contact with such items may cause poison ivy dermatitis in other members of the household. Dermatitis that is a direct rather than an allergic response. Dermatitis due to radiation exposure. SYN: SEE: ; SEE: ; SEE: Contact dermatitis caused by the toxic resin in poison ivy or oak. An acute or subacute dermatitis of unknown cause, beginning on the scalp and/or face and in skin folds (any area where sebaceous glands are active) and characterized by rounded, irregular, or circinate lesions covered with yellow or brown-gray greasy scales. SYN: SEE: ; SEE: ; SEE: The scalp may be dry with abundant grayish branny scales or oozing and crusted (). The rash may spread to the forehead and postauricular regions. The forehead shows scaly and infiltrated lesions with dark red bases and localized loss of hair. The eyebrows and eyelashes may have dry, dirty white scales. Inflamed skin and scales may be present on the nasolabial folds or the vermilion border of the lips. On the sternal region, the lesions are greasy to the touch. Eruptions may also appear in interscapular, axillary, and genitocrural regions. Cold winter weather may worsen the condition.The disease is diagnosed by physical assessment of the skin and may be confirmed by biopsy if there is any doubt.When the condition is limited to the scalp, frequent shampooing and use of mild keratolytic agents are indicated. Shampoos containing selenium are helpful. Generalized seborrheic dermatitis requires scrupulous skin hygiene, frequent washing and shampooing with selenium sulfide suspension to remove scales, keeping the skin as dry as possible, and using dusting powders. Fluorinated corticosteroids may be applied topically to hairless areas, and systemic cortisone preparations may be required. The differential diagnosis includes psoriasis, which should be ruled out; neurologic conditions should be recognized as possible predisposing factors.The health care provider explains to the patient that the condition has remissions and exacerbations and that hormone imbalances, nutritional status, infection, and emotional stress influence its course. The patient is taught to apply prescribed corticosteroids to the body and face. Fluorinated corticosteroids should be used with caution near the eyelids, on the face, and in the groin. To avoid developing a secondary yeast infection in body creases or folds, the patient is advised to cleanse these areas carefully, to dry gently but thoroughly, and to ensure that the skin is well aerated. He or she is taught to treat seborrheic scalp conditions (dandruff) with proper and frequent shampooing, alternating two or three different types of shampoo to prevent the development of resistance to a particular product. External irritants and excessive heat and perspiration should be avoided. Rubbing and scratching the skin are discouraged because they prolong exacerbations and increase the risk for secondary infection and excoriation, esp. since scaly, pruritic lesions present in skin areas with high bacteria counts. Oral antibiotics (such as tetracycline) may be prescribed (as for acne vulgaris) in low doses over a prolonged period to reduce bacterial colonization. The patient is advised to take tetracycline at least 1 hr before or 2 hr after meals, since the drug is poorly absorbed with food. The patient also is taught about the adverse effects of the drug (photosensitivity, birth defects, nausea, vomiting, and candidal vaginitis) and their management. Adherence to the treatment regimen is necessary to achieve optimal results. Psychological support or counseling is provided as necessary to deal with related body image concerns. Dermatitis of the legs with edema, pigmentation, and sometimes chronic inflammation. It is usually due to impaired return of blood from the legs. Compression stockings help the rash to resolve gradually. SEE: 2. Any inflammation caused by local action of various animal, vegetable, or mineral substances contacting the surface of the skin.

Dermatitis has many causes, including contact with skin irritants (such as the oil that causes poison ivy or poison oak); venous stasis, with edema and vesicle formation near the ankles; habitual scratching, as is found in neurodermatitis; dry skin, as in winter itch; and ultraviolet light, as in photosensitivity reactions.No laboratory testing is usually necessary; diagnosis is made by observation of the skin irritation (usually red, rough plaques) and the location on the body (face, neck and upper trunk).When a source of dermatitis is identifiable (such as in contact dermatitis due to a detergent or topical cosmetic), the best treatment is to avoid the irritating substance and to cleanse the affected area immediately with mild soap and water. Once skin inflammation becomes established, topical corticosteroid ointments or systemic steroids (during extreme exacerbations), topical immunomodulating agents (in patients over 2), weak tar preparations and ultraviolet B light therapy (to increase the thickness of the stratum corneum), and antihistamines may be used, with antibiotics reserved for secondary infections. Dermatologists may prescribe occlusive dressings intermittently to help clear lichenified skin.The patient should avoid known skin irritants. Tepid baths, cool compresses, and astringents sometimes help relieve inflammation and itch. Moisturizing creams or lotions following bathing help to retain skin moisture, but perfumed products should be avoided. Drug therapy is administered and evaluated for desired effects and adverse reactions. The patient is taught to apply topical medications and is informed about their most common side effects. Scratching is discouraged and the fingernails kept short to limit excoriation. The patient should be made aware that drowsiness may occur with antihistamine use and that driving or operating mechanical equipment should be avoided until the extent of this effect is known. Health care professionals should be careful not to show any negative feelings when touching lesions during assessment or treatment but should follow standard precautions. Skin changes alter body image, and the patient will need assistance in accepting and coping with what he or she may view as disfigurement. Children and adolescents may require and benefit from counseling to help them deal with the emotional components of their condition. Dermatitis that is usually seen on the face or exposed skin surfaces and typically results from exposure and sensitization to ultraviolet rays. Adults over age 50 may be affected. SYN: Chronic dermatitis of unknown cause found in patients with a history of allergy. The disease usually begins after the first 2 months of life, and those affected may experience exacerbations and remissions throughout childhood and adulthood. In many cases, there is a family history of allergy or atopy. If both parents have atopic dermatitis, the chances are nearly 80% that their children will have it. Atopic dermatitis is typically found in flexural creases of the body, e.g., the antecubital and popliteal fossae. The skin lesions consist of reddened, cracked, and thickened skin that can become exudative and crusty from scratching. Scarring or secondary infection may occur. Most patients have an elevated level of immunoglobulin E in their serum. The patient should avoid soaps and ointments. Bathing is kept to a minimum, but bath oils may help to prevent drying of the skin. Clothing should be soft textured and should not contain wool. Fingernails should be kept short to decrease damage from scratching. Antihistamines may help reduce itching at night. Heavy exercise should be avoided because it induces perspiration. A nonlipid softening lotion followed by a corticosteroid in a propylene glycol base may effectively treat acute exacerbations; when large areas of the body are involved, oral steroids may be needed. Because of the adverse effects associated with corticosteroids, topical immunosuppressants such as tacrolimus that decrease T-cell activity have been developed. Antistaphylococcal antibiotics may be needed to control secondary infection, introduced when scratching causes microfissures in the skin. A type of phytophotodermatitis with postinflammatory hyperpigmentation at the site of application of perfumes or colognes containing oil of bergamot. SYN: Dermatitis due to contact with allergens or an irritating substance. Allergic contact dermatitis is caused by a T-cell-mediated hypersensitivity reaction to natural or synthetic environmental allergens. These combine with skin proteins, altering the normal autoantigens so that new, foreign antigens are created. Nonallergic contact dermatitis, also known as irritative contact dermatitis, is usually caused by exposure to detergent, soap, or other skin irritant. SYN: SEE: ; SEE: (1) Allergic reaction to topical anestheticSkin changes, which appear 4 to 48 hr after exposure, depending on the degree of sensitivity to the allergen, consist of erythema, local edema, and blisters. The blisters may weep in severe cases. Most patients complain of intense itching. Signs and symptoms of the disease usually last 10 to 14 days. Reexposure to the cause will trigger a relapse.Tepid baths, cool compresses, topical astringents (such as solutions of aluminum acetate), antihistamines, and corticosteroids all provide some relief. Allergic reaction to topical anesthetic Dermatitis of sheep and goats caused by , a genus of poxvirus, and transmitted to humans by direct contact. The lesion on humans is usually solitary and on the hands, arms, or face. This maculopapular area may progress to a pustule up to 3 cm in diameter and may last 3 to 6 weeks. SYN: Generalized dermatitis involving at least half the body surface area. When skin involvement is extensive, the patient may become depressed because of the cosmetic changes.It may be caused by allergic drug reactions (such as vancomycin or penicillins), other allergies, infiltration of the skin by leukemias or lymphomas, atopy, or psoriasis.Symptoms include extensive skin redness, swelling, itching, thickening, scaling, often with loss of hair follicles, and swelling of lymph nodes.The disease is diagnosed by physical assessment of the skin and may be confirmed by biopsy if there is any doubt.When exfoliative dermatitis results from a drug reaction, withholding the offending agent will usually allow the skin to clear within a few weeks. Lymphomatous exfoliative dermatitis is treated with chemotherapy to combat the primary tumor.Patients with widespread dermatitis often need hospitalization to maintain normal body temperature, normal hydration, adequate wound care, and symptomatic relief. SYN: Deliberately self-inflicted irritation or injury to the skin. A chronic dermatitis characterized by erythematous, papular, vesicular, bullous, or pustular lesions with a tendency to grouping and with intense itching and burning. It is associated with allergy to gluten and is often found in patients with celiac disease (gluten-sensitive enteropathy). The lesions develop suddenly and spread peripherally. The disease is variable and erratic, and an attack may be prolonged for weeks or months. Secondary infection may follow trauma to the inflamed areas.The disease is diagnosed by physical assessment of the skin and may be confirmed by biopsy if there is any doubt.Oral dapsone provides substantial relief of symptoms in a few days. Sulfapyridine also may be used. Dermatitis affecting the perineum, upper thighs, or intergluteal folds resulting from chronic exposure to urine or stool. A blistering dermatitis that appears on the exposed skin of hikers, florists, gardeners, and those who work outdoors in bright sunlight. It is a phototoxic reaction caused by exposure to light-sensitizing chemicals in some plants (such as parsley, rue, bergamot, or figs). Dermatitis on the scalp and neck, composed of papules interspersed with pustules. The rash ultimately produces scarlike elevations resembling keloids. Dermatitis resulting from irritation or sensitization of the skin by urushiol, the toxic resin of plants of the genus (). There is no absolute immunity. Susceptibility varies greatly, even in the same individual.Those sensitive to poison ivy may also react to contact with other plants, such as the mango rind and cashew oil. These plants contain chemicals that cross-react with the sap present in poison ivy, poison oak, and poison sumac.Some time elapses between skin contact with the poison and first appearance of symptoms, varying from a few hours to several days, depending on the sensitivity of the patient and the condition of the skin. Moderate itching or a burning sensation is soon followed by small blisters; later manifestations vary. Blisters usually rupture and are followed by oozing of serum and subsequent crusting.The disease is diagnosed by physical assessment of the skin and may be confirmed by biopsy if there is any doubt.Some barrier creams have been used to prevent poison ivy dermatitis. They are sprayed on the skin before anticipated contact with the plant.In mild dermatitis, antihistamines and a lotion to relieve itching are usually sufficient. In severe dermatitis, cool, wet dressings or compresses, potassium permanganate baths, and topical corticosteroids are often effective. In some instances, intramuscular or oral corticosteroid therapy is used. If plant leaves are burned and the smoke inhaled, or if plant leaves are ingested, the patient should be directed to an emergency care center. Demulcents, fluids, morphine, and a high-protein, low-fat diet may be prescribed.Prevention is important in those with known sensitivity or in those with no previous contact with or reaction to the plant. Instruction of the patient focuses on helping him or her to recognize the plant, to avoid contact with it, and to wear long-sleeved shirts and long pants in wooded areas. If contact occurs, the patient should wash with soap and water immediately to remove the toxic oil. Contaminated clothing and pets also should be promptly and thoroughly washed because contact with such items may cause poison ivy dermatitis in other members of the household. Dermatitis that is a direct rather than an allergic response. Dermatitis due to radiation exposure. SYN: SEE: ; SEE: ; SEE: Contact dermatitis caused by the toxic resin in poison ivy or oak. An acute or subacute dermatitis of unknown cause, beginning on the scalp and/or face and in skin folds (any area where sebaceous glands are active) and characterized by rounded, irregular, or circinate lesions covered with yellow or brown-gray greasy scales. SYN: SEE: ; SEE: ; SEE: The scalp may be dry with abundant grayish branny scales or oozing and crusted (). The rash may spread to the forehead and postauricular regions. The forehead shows scaly and infiltrated lesions with dark red bases and localized loss of hair. The eyebrows and eyelashes may have dry, dirty white scales. Inflamed skin and scales may be present on the nasolabial folds or the vermilion border of the lips. On the sternal region, the lesions are greasy to the touch. Eruptions may also appear in interscapular, axillary, and genitocrural regions. Cold winter weather may worsen the condition.The disease is diagnosed by physical assessment of the skin and may be confirmed by biopsy if there is any doubt.When the condition is limited to the scalp, frequent shampooing and use of mild keratolytic agents are indicated. Shampoos containing selenium are helpful. Generalized seborrheic dermatitis requires scrupulous skin hygiene, frequent washing and shampooing with selenium sulfide suspension to remove scales, keeping the skin as dry as possible, and using dusting powders. Fluorinated corticosteroids may be applied topically to hairless areas, and systemic cortisone preparations may be required. The differential diagnosis includes psoriasis, which should be ruled out; neurologic conditions should be recognized as possible predisposing factors.The health care provider explains to the patient that the condition has remissions and exacerbations and that hormone imbalances, nutritional status, infection, and emotional stress influence its course. The patient is taught to apply prescribed corticosteroids to the body and face. Fluorinated corticosteroids should be used with caution near the eyelids, on the face, and in the groin. To avoid developing a secondary yeast infection in body creases or folds, the patient is advised to cleanse these areas carefully, to dry gently but thoroughly, and to ensure that the skin is well aerated. He or she is taught to treat seborrheic scalp conditions (dandruff) with proper and frequent shampooing, alternating two or three different types of shampoo to prevent the development of resistance to a particular product. External irritants and excessive heat and perspiration should be avoided. Rubbing and scratching the skin are discouraged because they prolong exacerbations and increase the risk for secondary infection and excoriation, esp. since scaly, pruritic lesions present in skin areas with high bacteria counts. Oral antibiotics (such as tetracycline) may be prescribed (as for acne vulgaris) in low doses over a prolonged period to reduce bacterial colonization. The patient is advised to take tetracycline at least 1 hr before or 2 hr after meals, since the drug is poorly absorbed with food. The patient also is taught about the adverse effects of the drug (photosensitivity, birth defects, nausea, vomiting, and candidal vaginitis) and their management. Adherence to the treatment regimen is necessary to achieve optimal results. Psychological support or counseling is provided as necessary to deal with related body image concerns. Dermatitis of the legs with edema, pigmentation, and sometimes chronic inflammation. It is usually due to impaired return of blood from the legs. Compression stockings help the rash to resolve gradually. SEE: 2. Any inflammation caused by local action of various animal, vegetable, or mineral substances contacting the surface of the skin.

When Should I Call a Doctor for Contact Dermatitis? If your rash does not improve or continues to spread after a couple of days of self-care, call your health care provider. If the itching is severe and you cannot see your health care provider that day, go to an urgent care center. Medical professionals usually diagnose contact dermatitis from your symptoms and physical examination. Blood tests and X-rays are not helpful. The evaluation of allergic contact dermatitis may require the application of chemicals to the skin for 48-72 hours (patch testing) using special occlusive dressings in an effort to reproduce the eruption. What Are Options for Contact Dermatitis? In most cases, contact dermatitis does not require professional medical treatment. Washing with soap and cool water can remove or inactivate most of the offending substance, if it is done immediately after exposure. If blistering develops, moist compresses applied for one to five minutes many times a day are helpful followed by air drying, perhaps supplemented with a fan. Oral antihistamines such as (Benadryl, Ben-Allergin) can also relieve itching. Do not apply antihistamine lotions to the skin, because you may have an allergic contact dermatitis from the lotion itself. For mild cases that cover a relatively small area, over-the-counter 1% cream may be sufficient. Treatment usually consists of medications to relieve the symptoms until the rash can go away on its own. either oral or topical depending on the severity of the reaction. A topical corticosteroid cream or ointment stronger than hydrocortisone may be prescribed to combat inflammation in a localized area. If the reaction covers a relatively large portion of the skin or is severe, a corticosteroid that is taken as pills or as an injection may be prescribed. If the reaction covers a relatively large portion of the skin or is severe, a corticosteroid that is taken as pills or as an injection may be prescribed. Prescription antihistamines may be given if nonprescription strengths are not adequate. Avoid scratching, which worsens the inflammation. Continue self-care until all symptoms are gone. If you have been treated by your health care provider, complete the recommended treatment. If you are taking oral steroid medication, finish the entire prescription, or the rash may come back. You may be taking medicine for only three to five days, or for as long as four weeks, depending on the severity of your reaction. If you have frequent dermatitis, you may want to see a dermatologist to identify the cause. If you know what causes the dermatitis, avoid that trigger. If you cannot avoid the trigger altogether, take steps to protect your skin from the trigger. Wearing protective clothing such as long sleeves, long pants, and gloves helps protect the skin from allergens and irritants. Protection is especially important at an industrial site, but it is also important when working outdoors where you could come in contact with plants from the family as well as with lawn and garden chemicals, cleaning solvents, and other toxic substances. Take care to avoid poison ivy, poison oak, and poison sumac when enjoying the outdoors. If you do become exposed, wash the area immediately with soap and cool water to prevent a rash from developing. If you have dermatitis often and you do not know what is causing it, you may want to see a skin allergy specialist. You will be asked questions to try to determine what may be causing the reactions. If the questions do not reveal the cause, skin patch tests may be applied to identify the trigger. You can then take steps to avoid the trigger. There is no treatment to ""cure"" the allergy so the allergen must be avoided in order to prevent symptoms. If the irritating substance causing the contact dermatitis is removed and you are not exposed to it again, your rash probably will disappear on its own in less than three weeks. Symptoms may go away sooner with treatment. Although your rash may have resolved, your immune system will always remember the chemical to which you were allergic. So, if you encounter it at some future time your rash is likely to recur. Where Can People Find More Information About Contact Dermatitis?

Rashes are very common in all ages, from infants to seniors, and nearly everyone will have some type of rash at some point in their life.

Contact dermatitis may be further classified as either irritant or allergic. Irritant contact dermatitis develops from exposure to irritants such as bleach, rubbing alcohol, water, and detergents. Other irritants include pesticides, fertilizers, and dust from fabrics. Reactions from severe irritants occur almost immediately after skin contact, while prolonged mild exposure, such as repeated hand washing, may not display a significant irritant contact dermatitis for days. On the other hand, allergic contact dermatitis is caused by an immune response your body produces when your skin comes into contact with a certain substance. Dyes, fragrances, and plant substances are possible sources of allergic contact dermatitis. Other possible causes for this reaction on your face include nickel, formaldehyde, and Balsam of Peru. Unlike irritant contact dermatitis, allergic contact dermatitis can take to develop. This can also make it more challenging to identify allergens that are causing your rashes.

In those cases, it’s important to take a minimalist approach to skin care. To do so, avoid using body washes and laundry detergents with fragrances, and switch to baby wipes for sensitive skin, such as Water Wipes. Be sure to moisturize often with a hypoallergenic cream.

cd94db33-f361-4e72-8dd6-eaa2e15fabcf,"Medically reviewed by — — An itchy, blistering, burning skin rash, dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) is a difficult condition to live with. The rash and itching occur on the elbows, knees, scalp, back, and buttocks. This rash likely indicates gluten intolerance, which may be related to a more serious underlying condition known as . DH is sometimes called Duhring’s disease or gluten rash. People who have this condition need to maintain a strict gluten-free diet. From the sound of the name, many people think this rash is caused by some form of the herpes virus. This isn’t the case, as it has nothing to do with herpes. Dermatitis herpetiformis occurs in people with celiac disease. Celiac disease (also called celiac sprue, gluten intolerance, or gluten-sensitive enteropathy) is an characterized by intolerance to gluten. Gluten is a protein found in wheat, rye, and barley. It’s also sometimes found in oats that have been processed in plants that handle other grains. According to the , 15 to 25 percent of people with celiac disease have DH. Celiac disease can also cause intense , , , and . People with DH typically don’t have any of the intestinal symptoms. However, even if they don’t experience any intestinal symptoms, 80 percent or more of people with DH still have intestinal damage, especially if they eat a diet that’s high in gluten, according to the . The intestinal damage and rash are due to the reaction of gluten proteins with a special kind of antibody called immunoglobulin A (IgA). Your body makes IgA antibodies to attack gluten proteins. When IgA antibodies attack gluten, they damage the parts of the intestines that allow you to absorb vitamins and nutrients. This sensitivity to gluten usually runs in families. The structures formed when IgA attaches to gluten then enter the bloodstream, where they begin to clog small blood vessels, especially those in the skin. White blood cells are attracted to these clogs. The white blood cells release a chemical called “complement” that causes an itchy, blistery rash. Celiac disease can affect anyone, but it tends to be more common in people who have another family member with celiac disease or DH. Although more women than men are diagnosed with celiac disease, men are more likely to develop DH than women, according to the . The rash usually begins in your 20s or 30s, though it can start in childhood. The condition more commonly occurs in people of European descent. It less commonly affects people of African or Asian descent. What are the symptoms of dermatitis herpetiformis? DH is one of the itchiest rashes possible. Common locations of the rash include: The rash is usually the same size and shape on both sides of the body and often comes and goes. Before a full outbreak of the rash, you may feel the skin in a rash-prone area burn or itch. Bumps that look like pimples filled with clear liquid start to form. These are quickly scratched off. The bumps heal within a few days and leave a purple mark that lasts for weeks. But new bumps continue to form as old ones heal. This process can continue for years, or it can go into remission and then return. While these symptoms are commonly associated with dermatitis herpetiformis, they can also be caused by other skin conditions such as , irritant or allergic , , , or . DH is best diagnosed with a . A doctor takes a small sample of skin and examines it under a microscope. Sometimes, a direct immunofluorescence test is done, in which the skin around the rash is stained with a dye that will show the presence of IgA antibody deposits. The skin biopsy can also help determine if the symptoms are caused by another skin condition. Blood tests to check for these antibodies in the blood may also be done. An intestinal biopsy may be performed to confirm the presence of damage due to celiac disease. If the diagnosis is uncertain, or another diagnosis is possible, other tests may be performed. Patch testing is the best way to diagnose allergic contact dermatitis, which is a common cause of symptoms similar to dermatitis herpetiformis. What treatments are available for dermatitis herpetiformis? DH can be treated with an antibiotic called dapsone. Dapsone is a powerful medicine with serious side effects. The dose must be increased slowly over several months before it’s fully effective. Most people see relief from taking dapsone, but side effects may include: Dapsone may also have negative interactions with other medications, such as aminobenzoate potassium, clofazimine, or trimethoprim. Other drugs that may be used include tetracycline, sulfapyridine, and some immunosuppressive drugs. These are less effective than dapsone. The most effective treatment that’s free of side effects is strict adherence to a . This means you should completely avoid food, drink, or medicines containing the following: Although this diet can be difficult to follow, it will have the most beneficial effect on your health if you have celiac disease. Any reduction in gluten intake may help lessen the amount of medication you will need to take. What are the complications of dermatitis herpetiformis? People with untreated DH and celiac disease may have a higher risk of intestinal cancer due to the constant inflammation in the intestines. Vitamin deficiencies and anemia may also be a problem if the intestines aren’t absorbing nutrients properly. Since DH is an autoimmune disease, have found that it’s also associated with various other types of autoimmune diseases. These include: What is the long-term outlook for dermatitis herpetiformis? DH is a lifelong disease. You may go into remission, but any time you’re exposed to gluten, you may have an outbreak of the rash. Without treatment, DH and celiac disease can result in many negative health effects, including vitamin deficiencies, anemia, and gastrointestinal cancer. Treatment with dapsone can control the rash symptoms rather quickly. However, the intestinal damage caused by celiac disease can only be treated by maintaining a strict gluten-free diet. Make sure to discuss any specific dietary considerations with your doctor or nutritionist.

Boldly. Meet your new rash. A rash generally indicates that your skin is inflamed in some way, , M.D., a New York City–based board-certified dermatologist and director of cosmetic and clinical research in dermatology at Mount Sinai Medical Center, tells SELF. Broadly, that means your skin is manifesting an to something your body thinks could harm your health. But there are so many different types of rashes that it can be hard to tell what’s going on with your skin. Dermatologists to the rescue! Here, they offer up several questions that may help you decipher what’s behind your rash—and what to do next. Itching is a of all sorts of rashes, so it’s unlikely that you’ll figure out what’s going on from this symptom alone, Dr. Zeichner says. But some rashes aren’t usually itchy, so this is still a good question to ask yourself. One example is the rash that can come with angioedema. This skin condition is related to the itchy, raised welts you may know as hives, but it starts deeper under the skin, the explains. While hives are known to be maddeningly itchy, angioedema is more likely to cause large, red welts that feel painful or warm, according to the . If you’re stumped because you have “hives” that don’t itch, this could be a potential cause. Even if your rash is itchy, the specifics can help you narrow down what might be causing it. For instance, clusters of tiny, itchy bumps or pimples around hair follicles might indicate a condition known as . If you have an itchy rash that comes and goes in the same area, Dr. Zeichner says your doctor may suspect atopic dermatitis (often simply called ), a common and chronic skin condition that causes itching and inflammation. If your rash has a clear edge, cut-off point, or pattern, the cause is pretty likely something external that is affecting your skin, Misha A. Rosenbach, M.D., associate professor of dermatology at the University of Pennsylvania’s Perelman School of Medicine, tells SELF. That’s as opposed to something internal, like an underlying medical condition, which would be less likely to create a clearly-defined rash. This can happen due to something like , or when something inflames the top layer of your skin, according to the (AAD). Common irritants include nickel, plants like poison ivy, and harsh cleaning agents like bleach. (There’s also allergic contact dermatitis, which is when your immune system loses it in response to something that touches your skin.) One really weird example of this is , or when chemicals in a plant or plant-based substance you touch interact with sunlight and lead to a superficial skin burn, Dr. Rosenbach says. If you do something like squeeze oranges for fresh OJ then spend a day out in the sun, you might notice a painful, streaky rash on your hands that mimics where the juice touched you, possibly along with swelling and blistering. This can help narrow things down quite a bit. “There aren’t that many rashes that give a burning sensation,” Dr. Zeichner says. You’ll usually get a burning feeling if there is a break in your skin, Caroline Robinson, M.D., a dermatologist at Northwestern Medical Group, tells SELF. If your skin is red, inflamed, and burning, first check that you don’t have some sort of cut or actual burn. If it really seems like you have a burning rash, Dr. Zeichner says you could be dealing with something like . Shingles happens due to a varicella-zoster virus infection, according to the . (This virus is also to blame for chicken pox, and it can remain dormant in your system for years.) At first, shingles usually causes unpleasant sensations like pain, burning, numbness, and tingling. After a few days, a rash of blisters bubbles up, typically on the left or right side of the abdomen, but occasionally around one eye or one small portion of the neck or face. Herpes is another potential cause of burning rashes. When herpes shows up around your genitals, it can start as tiny red bumps or white blisters that eventually burst and leak fluid, then scab over, according to the . If it emerges around your mouth, this virus can lead to tiny patches of blisters you may know as cold sores, the explains. Either way, you can experience some serious burning, itching, tingling, pain, and other uncomfortable symptoms. As you may know after trying to , blisters often happen because something is rubbing your skin or otherwise putting too much pressure on your delicate epidermis, according to the . Unfortunately, they also happen because of skin conditions. In fact, blisters can bead up due to dermatological issues, because a long list of conditions may cause this symptom. A blister-filled rash could be due to , irritant or allergic contact dermatitis, shingles, and herpes. This can also happen due to a skin infection such as cellulitis, which occurs when bacteria (often or ) worm their way into your body through a crack in your skin, according to the . In addition to blisters, your skin might be red, swollen, warm, painful, and otherwise sending you signs that something is wrong. In a perfect world, your skin cells will naturally bow out when their job is done, shedding in order to allow new, healthy cells to rise to the surface. (Fun fact, per the : The human body typically sheds 30,000 to 40,000 old skin cells every day.) But sometimes this process doesn’t go as smoothly as it should. “Certain rashes can appear scaly because this natural exfoliating process has been affected,” Dr. Robinson says. This is generally because your old skin cells aren’t shedding properly or your skin is overproducing new cells, she explains. This can happen with , which we’ve discussed above, and also with . This chronic condition can present in a few different ways, but the most common—plaque psoriasis—causes thick, raised, dry, scaly patches to form on the skin, the explains. The answer to this question can help you and your doctor figure out what’s triggering the rash. In some cases, chronic skin conditions like or are to blame, Dr. Zeichner says. But repeated rashes can also be a sign that continued exposure to something external is setting off your skin. For example, if you find that you’ve been getting a rash when you wear one specific necklace, you could be allergic to a metal like . often crops up in response to products like soap, lotion, and makeup, Dr. Robinson says. Ask yourself if you’ve added anything new to your routine, but also keep this tricky fact in mind: You can develop this reaction to certain products . Sometimes it takes many exposures for your body to begin showing signs of irritant or allergic contact dermatitis. If you have a condition like eczema that can cause (or you have sensitive skin in general), you may be more prone to developing rashes in response to what you put on your face and body. If you don’t think you have any underlying skin condition and suspect that products you use are causing your rash, contact dermatitis is probably to blame. You can wind up with a heat rash from being in hotter temperatures, the explains. This happens when your sweat ducts become clogged, so moisture gets caught under your skin. In a mild case of heat rash, you may just experience a swath of superficial, clear blisters on the top of your skin, the says. More involved cases can cause prickly, itchy red bumps, pus-filled sacs, and hard, skin-toned lesions that look a lot like goosebumps. Luckily, heat rash usually goes away after a few days of keeping your skin cool and stay out of the heat, but you should call your doctor if it lasts longer than that or seems to be getting worse, the says. Heat can also exacerbate some skin conditions like . This health issue causes reddened facial skin and sometimes acne-like bumps. “Rosacea is a condition where the skin on the face is extra sensitive to the environment and overly reactive to triggers such as spicy foods, emotional stress, alcohol, and heat,” Dr. Zeichner says. If you have a fever along with your rash, it’s a good idea to get checked out by a medical professional, Dr. Rosenbach says. You could be having a serious allergic reaction to something like a medication, according to the . This combination of symptoms could also indicate an infection like shingles, mononucleosis, or even , according to the . Don’t hesitate to see your doctor for “just” a rash. You know your body best. If any symptom feels concerning enough that you’re tempted to see a doctor, that’s a sign that you probably should seek medical advice. Plus, even if you go through all of the above questions, it can be tough to decode a rash on your own. Luckily, dermatologists are well-versed in rashes.

7e0be152-82e9-4915-9458-dfcb2f2db0d2,"Underarm rashes are typically caused by heat, friction or contact with allergens. Getting rashes under your arms can really be the pits, but while these rashes have a variety of causes, most aren't cause for alarm. An armpit is a dark, moist place that's a perfect breeding ground for bacteria and other microbes. Some of these bacteria produce odor as they grow, which is why many people use deodorant, but sometimes both the microbes and that deodorant can work against you -- the result is a rash. An underarm rash isn't usually the result of poor hygiene -- in fact, a rash may occur as the result of a product you use to stay clean and odor-free. Perfumes, deodorants and drying soaps can all cause an allergic reaction, and even shaving under your arms can cause a rash [source: ]. Rashes come in all shapes and sizes -- some appear as raised patches of blotchy dry skin, others as itchy red bumps or pimples. Some rashes hurt, others itch like crazy, and others may cause no pain or itching at all [source: ]. But given how sensitive your underarm area is, even when a rash is painless, you'll want to get it cleared up as soon as possible. If you spot a breakout, don't be rash -- step back and use the following information to figure out the cause and treat the problem. But don't hesitate to visit your doctor if the problem persists or if the rash is accompanied by other symptoms. Keep reading to learn about the causes of underarm rashes. There are several factors that can cause your underarms to break out in a rash. Three of the most common culprits are heat, friction and contact with allergens. Heat rash occurs when your sweat ducts are blocked and perspiration builds up beneath the skin, causing a bumpy and sometimes painful inflammation. It's not always clear why sweat ducts become blocked, but certain factors can contribute to it, including bacteria, tight-fitting clothing, medications and certain fabrics [source: ]. Friction can also cause skin irritation in the underarms -- this is an area of the body where skin continually rubs against fabric or other skin. Friction, combined with heat and moisture, breaks down the epidermis and can cause inflammation. While this may be uncomfortable enough on its own, it's often complicated when bacteria or fungus colonize among the broken skin and infect it [source: ]. One specific type of infection that may develop in this manner is candidiasis, or a yeast infection [source: ]. Contact dermatitis is a very common cause of skin irritation on the body, including the underarms. Contact dermatitis works just like it sounds -- if something touches your skin that irritates it or causes a reaction, a rash can develop. When this occurs in the underarms, deodorant or antiperspirant is often the culprit. However, if the rash is bumpy or blistering, an allergy may be responsible [source: ]. Keep reading to learn how to treat and prevent underarm rashes. Your underarms are ticklish for a reason: The skin is very sensitive. It's OK to shave your underarms, but be careful -- shaving can cause irritation. Razors can nick or cut the skin, causing inflammation, and deodorant or bacteria can further irritate skin [source: ]. To prevent underarm rashes from developing, it's important to understand what causes them in the first place. One way to avoid heat rash is to simply not go outside in hot, humid weather. If you have to be outside, try not to overexert yourself, and wear loose-fitting clothing made of porous fabric. Also, don't use powders, creams or ointments on your skin -- they can clog pores and interfere with perspiration [source: ]. The preventive measures for friction rashes are the same as for heat rash -- keep your underarms dry and wear light, loose-fitting clothing [source: ]. If you suspect that skin care products or household chemicals are causing your rash, the best way to avoid contact dermatitis is to identify the offending product and discontinue its use. Determining the culprit may require some trial and error, but it's best to start with your deodorant. Other items that may cause underarm rash include laundry detergent, soap, shampoo and lotions. If your symptoms don't improve, or if you're unable to identify what's causing your rash, see your physician -- he or she can test for a specific allergy [source: ]. Once you've succeeded in identifying and eliminating the cause of your underarm rash, it's time to focus your attention on treating its symptoms. Keep reading to learn more. It's fairly simple to avoid a rash or infection caused by underarm shaving. Use shaving cream to ensure a smooth shave, and make slow, short strokes so you won't damage the skin. If you shave at night, wait until morning to apply deodorant to avoid further irritation [source: ]. Many rashes disappear on their own in a few weeks, but a few weeks can seem like an eternity if your rash is itchy or painful. However, there are ways to get immediate relief from an underarm rash. If your rash isn't severe or infected, you probably just need to soothe irritation at the rash site. Calamine lotion is the most common topical treatment for rashes, but you can also apply a hydrocortisone cream or take an antihistamine. Pampering yourself by soaking in an oatmeal bath is a great way to soothe skin and relieve itching, and if your rash is painful, taking ibuprofen or aspirin should ease pain and inflammation. While you have the rash, take extra care to keep your underarms cool and dry by wearing loose-fitting clothing and applying absorbent powder [source: ]. While these home remedies should help relieve your symptoms and clear up your rash, see a doctor if the rash persists or if your symptoms worsen. In cases of severe inflammation, topical steroids may be necessary to ease the outbreak. Should an infection complicate the condition, you'll need an antibiotic or antifungal [source: ]. For more information on underarm rashes, see the links on the next page. While scratching an itchy rash can provide momentary relief, it can also further irritate your skin, which may cause an infection or scarring. Instead of scratching, try placing a damp cloth over the rash -- this will provide some relief and can be repeated as often as necessary [source: ].

How severe is the itching? Does it interfere with everyday life? What at-home treatments have you tried for this issue? What medications, vitamins, and supplements are you taking? Start with a visit to your primary care doctor. If the issue needs targeted attention, they may refer you to a dermatologist or another specialist for evaluation and treatment. The treatment for your itchy eyebrows depends on the underlying cause. If the itching is a result of mild irritation, your doctor may ask you to try different OTC remedies before giving you a prescription. If you have a skin condition that requires more attention, there are a variety of treatments that can help. Antifungals or antibiotics, whether they’re OTC or prescription medications, can be very effective in treating seborrheic dermatitis and dandruff. These medications are often applied topically in cream or even shampoo form. This is sometimes given in combination with a topical steroid cream.

7de2f628-9b5f-4be7-84a3-2812574cb491,"— So you woke up today with a red patch of skin. Great. You know your body is trying to tell you something, but the discoloration isn’t spelling out what the problem is — or how to fix it. Skin redness isn’t always a big deal, and sometimes the problem will go away on its own or with simple at-home measures. Other times it can be a sign of something more serious, like an infection or a chronic skin disease, that calls for medical treatment. But how can you figure out exactly what you’re dealing with? Since redness usually comes along with other symptoms, take note of anything else that’s going on with your skin. A doctor can give you a proper diagnosis and treatment plan. But while you wait, here are 11 common causes of skin redness, what they look and feel like, and how to solve or manage the problem. Skin redness can be caused by a ton of different things. This list isn’t exhaustive, but it does cover some of the most typical reasons your skin might be red. 1. If you have a red, itchy rash, you might have… contact dermatitis A red, itchy rash that forms when your skin comes in direct contact with an irritating substance or an allergen. When the rash is caused by an irritating substance, like a harsh soap or bleach, it’s called irritant contact dermatitis. When it’s caused by an allergen, like nickel in jewelry or poison ivy, it’s called allergic contact dermatitis. Allergic contact dermatitis and irritant contact dermatitis have similar symptoms, including redness and itchiness that could be accompanied by swelling, dryness, burning, sensitivity, or blistering. The symptoms can come on quickly after your skin touches the substance, but allergic contact dermatitis can take up to a few days to show up. Irritant contact dermatitis may appear only after repeated exposure to the irritant (such as washing your hands a bunch of times). Ditching the offending substance should help your skin clear up, though it might take a few weeks. You can speed things along (and ease discomfort) by applying a thick layer of petroleum jelly over the rash, which acts as a barrier and keeps things from getting dry. An over-the-counter (OTC) — or, better yet, prescription-strength! — corticosteroid cream or ointment can also speed healing if the irritant is removed. Oral antihistamines may fight itching, but they won’t help with the rash. 2. If your redness happened after you touched something hot, you might have… a burn Damage to skin tissue caused by exposure to heat, radiation, electrical contact, or chemicals. are relatively easy to treat and will generally heal within a few weeks, but full-thickness burns are more serious because they can affect the nerves and other tissues underneath. Superficial burns are red and might be swollen or painful. As they heal, they might get dry or peel. Partial-thickness burns are more painful and tend to blister. When the blisters pop open, the burns typically look wet or weepy. Full-thickness burns are different: These severe burns cause skin to turn waxy, charred, white or dark brown, and leathery. If a burn has caused nerve damage, it may not be painful. It depends on the cause of the burn and how severe it is. You can treat many superficial and mild partial-thickness burns at home by running your skin under cool water, applying lidocaine or aloe vera gel to the affected area, and wrapping it loosely in gauze. (Never use cotton balls on burns.) Seek medical attention ASAP for burns that cover your face, hands, feet, buttocks, or groin or if you’re not sure how severe your burn is. Same for more serious burns that look charred, white, leathery, brown, or black; burns caused by chemicals or electricity; or burns that cause trouble breathing. 3. If you have redness after spending all day in the sun, you might have… sunburn Damage to skin tissue caused by overexposure to the sun’s harmful UV rays, which results in painful redness. Most people associate sunburns with hot, sunny days, but it’s possible to get one when it’s cool or cloudy too. Mild sunburns tend to be pink or red, tender to the touch, and a little itchy. After a few days, the affected skin will start to peel or flake. More severe sunburns can also leave skin swollen or blistered and potentially give you a headache or nausea. Cool the affected skin by applying cool compresses or taking a cool bath, and ease itching with aloe vera gel or calamine lotion. For more serious pain and swelling, take an OTC pain reliever like ibuprofen or naproxen sodium. Drink plenty of water to help your skin rehydrate, and don’t even think about going back out into the sun until you’re fully healed. 4. If your redness has welts that last less than a day, you might have… hives/urticaria Hives (often called welts) can appear in many areas on the body and last less than 24 hours. They’re very itchy. In a majority of people, the cause is never found and the hives go away within 6 weeks. In some cases a clear inciting factor, such as a medication or a recent viral illness, can be found. Hives are very itchy, red, swollen bumps on the body. They often go away on their own within 24 hours, but new ones can appear in a nearby area. If your hives are the result of a medication, stop the medication and contact your doctor. If you notice any swelling on your face or have trouble breathing, seek immediate medical attention. Otherwise, hives may go away on their own with time and the use of an oral antihistamine, like Zyrtec. But it’s important to see your doctor or dermatologist for appropriate diagnosis and guidance on treatment. 5. If your redness is tender or painful, you might have… an infection A skin infection can be caused by bacteria, virus, fungi, or (in rare cases) parasites. An infection can often develop from open wounds or sores, especially ones that aren’t kept clean. Mild skin infections are red, swollen, and tender or painful. More serious ones might also be blistery or ooze pus. It depends on the . Topical creams and ointments (like an antibiotic or antifungal cream) as well as cool compresses can help speed the healing process and ease the pain or tenderness. But you should have your doctor look at the infection to determine the best treatment. It’s best not to try to treat this on your own. OTC topical antibiotics can cause allergic contact dermatitis. 6. If your redness comes with a big red welt, you might have… an insect bite or sting Bees, ticks, ants, fleas, flies, mosquitoes, wasps, and more can all bite or sting — and leave a big, red welt. These bites or stings can be annoying and uncomfortable, but they’re rarely dangerous. You might see the insect biting or stinging you, or you might not notice until later. Either way, it’ll usually cause a red rash that’s swollen, painful, or itchy. Often these can look like red, juicy bumps. They can resemble hives in some cases or blisters in others. Some bites or stings might also cause numbness or pain in nearby muscles. In rare cases, people who are allergic might experience a severe reaction like trouble breathing or even anaphylaxis — a life-threatening reaction that has a variety of symptoms, such as skin rash, nausea, vomiting, difficulty breathing, and shock. Mild bites and stings . Remove the stinger if it’s still there, wash the area with a mild soap and warm water, and apply an ice pack to keep the swelling down. If you’re still uncomfortable, try OTC hydrocortisone, an oral antihistamine, or an OTC pain reliever like ibuprofen. If your reaction is severe — such as if you start to have trouble breathing — call 911 immediately. 7. If your redness looks like lots of little prickly pimples, you might have… heat rash Heat rash can happen when you get super sweaty but your blocked pores keep the sweat trapped under your skin. It often happens in hot, humid weather. Heat rash is marked by lots of red, pimple-like bumps — especially on your neck, shoulders, chest, and back. They might feel itchy or prickly. Heat rash will usually clear up on its own in 3 or 4 days. In the meantime, the best way to deal is by keeping your skin cool and sweat-free. Hang out somewhere with air conditioning or a fan and wear loose, comfortable clothes. Apply cool compresses if you’re itchy, but steer clear of ointments or baby powder. They can make the rash worse by blocking your pores even more. 8. If you look like you’re blushing, Santa Claus-style, you might have… rosacea A skin disease marked by facial redness that looks like blushing or flushing. Experts don’t know what causes rosacea, but it seems to be hereditary and might have to do with the immune system. Rosacea usually causes a red rash around the nose, cheeks, or chin. The affected skin might be thickened or swollen, have lots of visible blood vessels, and be prone to acne-like breakouts. There’s no cure for rosacea, but you can take steps to manage your symptoms. Try to figure out what and steer clear as much as possible. And try to minimize your sun exposure by wearing sunscreen every day, avoiding midday sun, and wearing a broad-rimmed hat. 9. If your redness looks like thick, red, scaly patches, you might have… plaque psoriasis Psoriasis is an immune system condition that causes skin cells to grow and build up too quickly. It’s marked by thick, red plaques that are sometimes itchy and, in plaque psoriasis, have thick, silvery scales. The patches can show up anywhere, but they’re especially common on the elbows, knees, scalp, lower back, and face. Psoriasis patches tend to be thick and red with silvery scales and are often itchy or uncomfortable. Some people with psoriasis also have swelling or achiness in their joints. Often, specific triggers can cause symptoms to flare up. There’s no cure for psoriasis, but there are ways to keep the inflammation and rough patches in check. Depending on the severity of your psoriasis, your doctor might recommend topical ointments or creams, oral medications, or injections. Light therapy, which uses UV light to kill overactive cells, is another option. 10. If your redness is a round, bumpy, ring-like rash, you might have… ringworm A common skin infection marked by a . Despite the name, there’s no actual worm involved — it’s caused by a fungus. Ringworm rashes tend to be red and round, with a raised, wavy border and clearing in the middle. They can be very itchy or scaly and can form anywhere on the body, although they can look different depending on the area affected. Start by seeing your doctor. They may prescribe an antifungal cream, ointment, gel, or spray to fight the infection. You’ll also need to take steps to stamp out the infection at home: washing your bedding and clothes daily, drying your skin thoroughly after bathing, and wearing loose clothing. 11. If your redness is all over the place and accompanied by a fever, you might have… scarlet fever A bacterial infection that causes a bright red rash over most of your body. Scarlet fever can happen at any age, but kids ages 5 to 15 are most likely to be affected. It’s caused by the same bacteria as strep throat. Scarlet fever rashes look a lot like dry sunburn that spreads all over the body. They can cause your face to look flushed and make your tongue look red and bumpy. The rash is usually accompanied by a high fever and a very sore throat. If you think you or your child has scarlet fever, call a doctor. You’ll need an exam to confirm the diagnosis and antibiotics to treat the infection.

Fucibet cream is prescribed to patients in the UK who are suffering from or other infected and inflammatory skin conditions, to provide relief and prevent the condition from getting worse. You can buy treatment such as Fucibet cream online, after completing a quick, free online consultation with one of our medical team and you can choose to have it delivered to you as soon as the very next day. While there is no one-cure for irritating skin problems like dermatitis, our trained GPs and pharmacists will ensure you get the appropriate medication when you need it most. 2 Not suitable Not suitable Fucibet cream is an that is used when both inflammation and infection are present. It contains two active ingredients: fusidic acid and betamethasone. Fucibet works by using a dual mode of action; fusidic acid fights the infection whilst betamethasone relieves the inflammation and is applied topically. With its dual mechanism of action, Fucibet cream can also be used for other inflammatory skin conditions where an infection is also present. The ingredient fusidic acid is an antibiotic medicine. It is used to treat bacterial infections. It does this by stopping the production of new proteins within the bacteria. These proteins are essential to the bacteria, allowing them to multiply. Without these proteins, the infection is unable to increase or spread. Fusidic acid doesn’t actively kill the bacteria itself. Once their ability to multiply has been halted, they will eventually die off or be killed by the body’s natural immune response. When eczema or dermatitis has become infected, creams with fusidic acid often provide effective treatment. The other active ingredient, betamethasone, belongs to a group of medicines called topical corticosteroids. These are effective treatments for reducing the skin inflammation associated with eczema or dermatitis. Our body’s immune system can sometimes release chemicals and substances that can irritate the skin, causing the blood vessels to dilate (widen). This widening can result in the affected area(s) becoming red, painful, itchy or swollen. Betamethasone works by penetrating inside the skin cells, reducing the release of these inflammatory-causing substances. This will, in turn, decreases the associated redness, swelling and itching – relieving the discomfort. Fucibet cream is primarily used to treat eczema and dermatitis where a bacterial infection is present. The two active ingredients work well together for treating this form of eczema. The fusidic acid actively treats the infection, while the strong corticosteroid action of the betamethasone effectively reduces the associated inflammation and swelling. An experienced GP or pharmacist, such as the ones who work at The Independent Pharmacy, will be able to advise whether Fucibet cream is the right treatment for you. Fucibet cream is manufactured by Leo Laboratories Limited and is classified as a prescription-only-medicine (POM). You can read more about  here. Fucibet cream should not be used on areas of the skin that are infected by anything other than dermatitis. This includes impetigo, , nappy rash, , or viral infections, such as herpes (/). When skin is affected by eczema or dermatitis, it becomes much more vulnerable to infection. These infections are most often caused by staphylococcus bacteria. Symptoms of infected eczema include skin that weep pus or looks golden and crusty. Eczema usually occurs in patches on the face, back of the knees, wrists, hands and feet, but can also appear on the eyelids, neck, nipples, scalp, and even lips. If left untreated, it is likely to spread and get worse. You can take steps to prevent infection by treating any eczema as quickly as possible. Keep the skin moisturised with emollients, and use steroid creams to manage flare-ups. Avoid any irritants, and try to resist itching the affected area. Scratching may cause the dry skin to split, leaving the body open to infection. Psoriasis is another condition that results in dry, scaly skin. It most often occurs on the hands, feet, elbows, knees and scalp. It is thought to occur when the immune system targets healthy skin cells. Psoriasis can flare up due to stress, injury, a reaction to some medicines, hormonal changes, smoking or excessive drinking. Areas of skin affected by psoriasis are vulnerable to infection, as is the case with eczema. If an infection is present, you will likely be prescribed a combination treatment such as Fucibet. is fairly similar to Fucibet Cream, however, the steroid used in Fucibet Cream (betamethasone) is much more powerful. Fucidin H Cream contains fusidic acid and is sometimes used in instances where the skin has become infected. You can also from The Independent Pharmacy following a short online consultation. Fucibet cream should only be used to treat infected skin conditions caused by bacteria. It should NOT used to treat spots, boils, cysts, impetigo, fungal infections like athlete’s foot, or viral infections like cold sores. Primarily, its use is to relieve conditions like infected outbreaks of eczema or dermatitis (not perioral), and germ infections. Fucibet (being a topical antibiotic and corticosteroid combination) is not usually recommended for wounds and burns unless they have become infected. Fucibet shouldn’t be used during pregnancy unless absolutely necessary - it would need to be prescribed by your GP. As for breastfeeding, the effects are thought to be negligible – since the fusidic acid and betamethasone are only topically applied to a limited area of skin. Non-prescription alternatives for eczema can include: Fucibet Patient Information Leaflet: *Prescription medicines are supplied subject to a medical consultation at the discretion of a doctor. Adults should apply Fucibet to the affected areas twice daily. For use in children or those under the age of 18 years, we recommend they see a doctor. Fucibet cream is for external use on the skin only. When you first remove the cap, check that the seal is intact. Open the tube using the spike on the cap. You should rub a thin layer gently onto the affected skin. The unit of measurement for creams and ointments applied to the body is the Finger Tip Unit (FTU). One FTU is the amount of cream from the edge of the nail to the first crease of the finger. A good indication to go on for how much cream you will need is if the size of the affected area is equal to about 2 adult hands this will require 1 FTU. Wash your hands thoroughly before using this medicine, and unless you are using the cream to treat your hands, wash after application as well. Fucibet cream normally starts to produce an improvement in symptoms within a couple of days. Fucibet cream can be used for up to two weeks, however, if no improvement is seen after seven days you should discontinue use and see your doctor. Using the cream for longer than 2 weeks increases the chance that bacteria will become resistant to it and it will be ineffective in the future. Leave Fucibet cream to soak in for 30 minutes before applying other moisturisers or creams to ensure it is fully absorbed and not diluted. The tube and its contents should be discarded after 3 months of opening. Do not throw medicines away in the household rubbish. They should be taken to any pharmacy free of charge where they will be disposed of responsibly. Not everyone will experience side effects when they use Fucibet cream, however, if you do they can include: Rash, itchy or inflamed skin at the site of application Excessive hair growth, also known as ‘hypertrichosis’ If you are concerned about these effects, or if the product affects you in any other way, stop using it and talk to your doctor or pharmacist.

Start Assessment What does Fucibet cream contain and what is it used for? Fucibet cream contains fusidic acid 2% and betamethasone 0.1%. Fusidic acid is an antibiotic that helps to kill bacteria that cause infections and betamethasone is a steroid that helps to reduce redness, itching and inflammation. Fucibet cream is used for cases where the skin is inflamed but there is also an infection present. This is usually in cases of infected eczema. Can I use other Eczema treatments with Fucibet cream? You can combine Fucibet cream with your normal emollient eczema treatments to keep your skin hydrated and prevent further irritation from drying and cracking. Fucibet should not be used with any other steroid or antibiotic creams as it may cause irritation to your skin and produce side effects. Why can I only buy two tubes of Fucibet online at one time? Fucibet is a prescription-strength treatment for infected eczema. For that reason, to ensure the safety of our patients and the legal operating of our pharmacy, we only supply a maximum of two tubes of treatment at one time. Fucibet treatment is normally not used for more than 7-10 days, therefore two tubes should be more than sufficient for complete treatment of a large area.  Yes – we understand that sometimes you will want your treatment as soon as possible.

Fast delivery- We offer same day dispatch before 4pm and fast delivery to your address of choice with Royal Mail. Great prices- we are able to offer very competitive prices and we guarantee to beat any other Online Doctor service. A wealth of information - we provide all the information you could need on Betnovate tablets and other eczema treatments, in easy to digest formats, at a time that suits you. It is not recommended to use Fucibet while pregnant. This is because animal studies have shown that the active corticosteroid (betamethasone) can cause harm to unborn babies. Discuss with your doctor whether your personal benefits of Fucibet outweigh these risks. Fucibet can be used by mothers who are breastfeeding, as long as the cream is not applied directly to the breast. Fucibet is well tolerated – there is no known interaction between Fucibet and other medication. If you should experience any undesired effects when taking this medication with another, please tell us and we would be happy to report it for you. You should not use Fucibet cream with any other creams that contain fusidic acid or other steroids such as betamethasone, hydrocortisone or clobetasone. If you suffer from rosacea (a condition causing redness of the face and cheeks) For skin infections that are not associated with outbreaks of eczema After treatment with Fucibet, the infection should have cleared and the eczema started to get better or calmed down completely. To stop eczema outbreaks from recurring it is important to moisturise the skin regularly. Cosmetic moisturisers may have perfumes or colours added to them that can irritate the skin or encourage eczema. Most medical moisturisers (emollients) tend to be colour- and scent-free. Emollients such as Dermol, Doublebase, Diprobase and Balneum all form a thin layer on the surface of the skin and prevent moisture loss. They are available as ointments, creams, lotions and bath additives. Ointments tend to last longer but can be more 'greasy'. Creams are absorbed easily but don’t tend to moisturise as well as ointments. Lotions are great for hairy skin or for larger surface areas. For further information on the different types of emollients available and when best to use them, visit our dedicated section on Eczema Treatments. Can Fucibet cream be used to treat other ailments? Fucibet cream is sometimes prescribed for those who are suffering from painful blisters, particularly if they appear on the feet. The cream is occasionally prescribed for patients who have boils, as the anti-inflammatory ingredients in Fucibet cream are excellent for reducing painful swelling or irritation. The same goes for particularly bad insect bites, such as bee or wasp stings. Fucibet cream is a common treatment for acne rosacea sufferers, particularly for those who have larger pimples or cysts that are sore and irritated, as it provides temporary anti-inflammatory relief. An infection of the deeper layers of skin and underlying tissue, cellulitis is usually treated with antibiotics, but doctors may also prescribe Fucibet cream as a way of managing the condition, since it is an antibiotic topical treatment. Fucibet cream is not recommended for the treatment of hemorrhoids or piles, since it shouldn’t be used around or near the genital area. Likewise, it should also not be used for the treatment of thrush. If you think you have thrush, you would be better off with a specialist thrush treatment such as . Fucibet should not be used to treat bacterial skin infections such as impetigo. A bactericidal ointment such as  is a more appropriate treatment for impetigo. Due to its anti-inflammatory properties, Fucibet might be prescribed to relieve scabies symptoms, but your doctor is much more likely to recommend an insecticide cream like  to kill the mites that cause it.  Are there any links between eczema and other conditions? There are various health conditions that have also been found to be related to eczema, or to leave you more at risk. Eczema also goes by the name ‘atopic dermatitis’ and frequently occurs alongside hay fever. Therefore, eczema can provide an early clue that someone is at risk for developing other allergies in the future – including asthma. Eczema causes scaly patches of skin, which can sometimes be confused with ringworm. The distinction is that eczema patches aren't round or ring-like in appearance, and have a tendency to weep and itch, especially if the area is repeatedly scratched. Vitiligo is another form of skin disorder characterized by an absence of pigment in certain areas of the skin. Not all eczema sufferers get vitiligo, but if they do, it often shows up in areas where eczema was particularly bad. As for psoriasis, there is a clear link between the skin condition and a form of inflammatory arthritis called psoriatic arthritis.This happens because psoriasis is an autoimmune disease, so the body's immune system can mistakenly attack healthy tissue, including the joints as well as the skin. Zinc deficiency is thought to be a common nutritional deficiency among eczema sufferers, particularly children. Vitamin A and D deficiencies can also cause zinc deficiency, since they aid the absorption of the mineral. Other common causes of eczema include allergies, digestive disorders, immune deficiencies and nutritional deficiencies, particularly B vitamins. Eczema often starts early in life, when the patient is a baby or toddler, primarily affecting the arms, neck, back and legs and appearing as irritated red patches of skin. Usually, the causes are linked to family history – the condition is not contagious, and will not pass on to other children from your baby. Fucibet is generally not prescribed for children under 5 years old, as the ingredients are very strong. At the Independent Pharmacy we don’t treat anyone under 18 – children need to be seen face-to-face by a doctor. Fucibet is also not suitable for women who are pregnant. Fucibet is not strictly designed as a cream to reduce scarring – it is an antibiotic treatment for infected eczema and associated conditions. Indirectly it will help to reduce scarring, as the relief it provides will reduce the impulse to itch.  Tattoos can sometimes become infected, also known as ‘chemical dermatitis’. If your tattoo is swollen, weeping or infected, your doctor may prescribe Fucibet cream as an antibiotic remedy to kill the bacterial infection. Always get your tattoo seen by a doctor if you are experiencing intense itching or it appears to be infected, and try not to itch, or you risk scarring.  Fucibet cream should not be used for athlete’s foot – this is a fungal infection and Fucibet cream is designed to treat bacterial infections only. Fucibet cream is unlikely to effectively treat athlete's foot,  or  would be more effective. Does Fucibet cream help with insect and mosquito bites? Fucibet cream could be prescribed to treat an insect bite, were it to get infected and start weeping. It would likely be prescribed along with an antihistamine. Fucibet cream is NOT designed to treat spots and warts, unless there is some kind of bacterial infection present. Cold sores are caused by a virus – specifically herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1). Fucibet cream would not be recommended for cold sores because it treats bacterial – not viral – infections. As with athlete’s foot, ringworm is another type of fungal infection, for which you would not be prescribed Fucibet cream, since it is anti-bacterial – not anti-fungal. An appropriate treatment for ringowrm would be . Fucibet is not designed to reduce scarring – it is an antibiotic treatment for infected eczema and similar conditions. However, it can indirectly help to reduce scarring after infected skin condition by reducing the impulse to itch and helping the condition to clear quickly.

Some autoimmune diseases, such as and , may attack the skin and cause changes in skin color. These reactions can range from red rashes and blisters to skin lightening or darkening. Allergic reactions to foods, plants, or irritants can also result in discolored skin patches in various areas of the body. These changes may appear as rashes or raised bumps that itch or burn.

However, the red background of the skin may not me manifested in cases of dark skin. The medical term “” describes which are flat, small, discolored spots on the skin surface and which are small, raised bumps. It can be itchy sometimes, and it can last from 2 days to 3 weeks depending on the cause and severity. Generally when papules are not manifested, macular rashes don’t need a treatment but if it persists for longer than 2 weeks, then you should see a doctor. Underlying medical problem like measles and syphilis are common causes of this type of rash. Weaken immune system is another one. Maculopapular rash in children is mostly caused by viral or bacterial infections. In adults, drugs and allergies are most common causes.  Other medical terms for maculopapular rash may include morbilliform eruption or exanthematous eruption also known as exanthema. How maculopapular rash looks like? What are signs and symptoms? Because of the present skin inflammation, maculopapular rash appears to be reddened or erythematous. Macules are flat blemishes or discolorations with about 1 cm in diameter. If they exceed 1 cm they are called . Papules are elevated lesions measuring less than 1 cm in diameter. In some cases papules can exceed 1 cm in diameter, and then they are called which are palpable lesions elevated on skin surface or which are larger and more firm papules with a significant vertical dimension. When these two are manifested together at the same time they identified maculopapular rash as a smooth skin rash or redness covered with elevated bumps. In some cases (depending on causes) maculopapular rash can be manifested with: which are described as papules containing purulent fluid, which are papules containing clear serous fluid, which are larger type of vesicles (>1 cm in diameter) or described as a wheal or hive. The papules can be warm and itchy and may change their color from red to other colors depending on the severity and nature of the disease but also on the duration of the same.

Different types of maculopapular rash Numerous causes may lead to maculopapular rash. In general, the most common causes are: Different viral (mostly) and bacterial infections may cause maculopapular rash. Some of them are: Rickettsia rickettssi (Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever) Rubeola (Measles) infection and maculopapular rash Measles or Rubeola is a highly contagious viral infection caused by the measles virus (Morbilli virus). Initial signs and symptoms typically include fever, often greater than 40 °C, cough, runny nose, and inflamed eyes. A rash (telltale) is the hallmark of the disease. Koplik’s spots which are small white spots inside the mouth are typical sign of this disease and usually begin 2 or 3 days after symptoms begin. Maculopapular rash cause by measles is the common in children. It usually starts appearing on the hairline and behind the ears spreading through the trunk and extremities typically 3-5 days after the start of symptoms. Symptoms typically develop 10–12 days after exposure to an infected person and last about 7–10 days. If the rash becomes desquamated and brownish, then it is starting to fade away. Usually the rule is that the order on which it appeared follows the order how it fades away. The Koplik’s spots commonly disappear after the onset of rash. Rubella (German measles) infection and maculopapular rash Rubella, or so called German measles or three-day measles is viral infection caused by the rubella virus. A rash may start about 2 weeks after exposure and last for 3 days. Maculopapular rash caused by Rubella is spreading on the body from face downwards. Skin rash is not as bright as in the case of Rubeola and is sometimes itchy. Swollen lymph nodes are also often and may last for a few weeks. Fever, sore throat, and fatigue, joint pain may also occur. Roseola (Exanthema Subitum) and maculopapular rash Roseola occurs in children who are less than 3 years old and is caused by two human herpesviruses, HHV-6 and HHV-7, which are sometimes defined to collectively as Roseolovirus. The maculopapular rash in the case of Roseola is scattered even though the face often stays unaffected. Rash usually appears after the fever disappears. Parvovirus B19 (Erythema Infectiosum or 5 Disease) Erythema infectiosum also called fifth disease is commonly a benign condition in children at 3-12 years of ages which is characterized by a typical slapped-cheek look and lacy exanthem. It is caused by the infection of human parvovirus (PV) B19, which is an erythrovirus. Maculopapular rash appears bright-red that makes children to look like they were slapped on the face. This is caused by fever that occurs before the appearance of the rash. Occasionally parvovirus rash may spread over the the nose or around the mouth. Some children may also develop a red and lacy on the upper arms, torso, and legs. The maculopapular rash typically lasts a couple of days and may be itch. Rarely, it can last for several weeks. Patients are usually no longer contagious once the rash has appeared. Chikungunya viral infection and maculopapular rash Chikungunya is a viral disease transmitted by mosquitoes infected by Chikungunya virus. The virus is spread between people by two mosquito’s species: . It causes fever and severe joint pain. Maculopapular rash is also one among other manifestations. The maculopapular rash commonly appears after the itchiness and redness of the skin. It spreads from the trunk to the face and limbs. Rash occurs in 40-50% of cases, generally two to five days after onset of symptoms. In some cases petechiae may also be noted. Another infectious disease spread by mosquitoes is dengue. It is caused by dengue virus and is manifested with high fever, rash and joint pain. A rash occurs in 50–80% of cases with beginning symptoms called flushed skin, or later, after 4–7 as a measles-like rash. A rash is sometimes described as “islands of white in a sea of red” has also been observed. Infectious mononucleosis is an infection caused by the Epstein–Barr virus (EBV). In very rare cases rash can be manifested, usually occuring on the arms or trunk, which can be macular (morbilliform) or papular. Ampicillin and amoxicillin use are not recommended during acute Epstein–Barr virus infection since it has been shown that in many cases diffuse rash has been developed. Syphilis is a sexually transmitted disease caused by the bacterium . In secondary syphilis a diffuse rash most commonly occurs, and is usually localized on the palms of the hands and soles of the feet, but it can spread throughout the body. The maculopapular rashes can be very serious in cases with Syphilis as they may rupture and form ulcerative blisters which can be very painful. Syphillis rashes may form broad, flat, whitish, wart-like lesions known as on mucous membrane. The type 1 HIV infection usually causes maculopapular rashes. This is the reason why maculopapular rash is also known as HIV rash. In such patients maculopapular rash is present as one of the earliest signs of the virus. It is a primary form of HIV infection that occurs at different parts of the body particularly on the face, trunk, and hand palms. In the mouth and genitals, maculopapular rash poses as ulcers. It lasts about 2-3 weeks. Zika, is an contagious condition caused by the Zika virus. It is manifested with fever, red eyes, headache, joint pain and a maculopapular rash. Zika disease is possibly best-known due to its possibility to pass from mother to child during pregnancy causing microcephaly and other brain defects in newborns. Zika rash can be red and raised and often itchy and uncomfortable. The rash often begins on the face and spreads. Zika rash will disappear once the virus is healed, so there should be no worries about long-term effects. Ebola is a viral hemorrhagic fever caused by ebolaviruses. In about 50% of cases cases, maculopapular rash may be developed on the skin manifested as a flat red area covered with small bumps, usually 5-7 days after symptoms begin. A maculopapular type of rash that begins immediately after exposure to allergens (allergies to food and insect bite or sting) may be also caused. This typically happens after minutes to few hours after exposure to the allergen. In some cases a maculopapular rash may break out before hives do. A person with maculopaular rash caused by allergy may also experience increased heart rate and breathing problems. Systemic and rheumatologic diseases as a cause of Different systemic or rheumatologic diseases may lead to maculopapular rash. Most common causes are: Acute graft-versus-host disease (stem cell or bone marrow transplant) Kawasaki disease (mucocutaneous lymph node syndrome) and Maculopapular rash has been also described as a condition known as graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) that can be developed after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (bone marrow transplant) which can be seen within 1 week or several weeks after the transplantation. In the case of GVHD, the maculopapular rash may progress into a several condition similar to toxic epidermal necrolysis. This type of maculopapular rash can be induced as a result of intaken large doses of niacin or no-flush niacin of 2000 – 2500 mg used for the management of low HDL cholesterol. Maculopapular rash may be also a symptom of a condition known as Sea bather’s eruption that most usually affects swimmers in some Atlantic locales including: Florida, Caribbean, and Long Island. It is provoked due to hypersensitivity to stings from the larvae of the sea anemone or the thimble jellyfish . The rash appears where the bathing suit contacts the ski and is usually stinging and pruritic. This type of rash can also be caused due to acute arsenic poisoning, appearing 2 weeks after exposition. Drugs such as antibiotics, anticonvulsants, allopurinol may induce maculopapular rash as one of their adverse reactions. One study reviewed 50,000 patients with drug skin eruptions and in 91% cases drug eruptions presented as maculopapular rash. Increased risk was observed with factors such as immunosuppression, in elderly and female gender. Maculopapular rash is categorized as a type IV or delayed cell-mediated reaction that is caused by body’s hypersensitivity of a drug or its metabolite. For maculopapular rash it is suspected to be induced after new drug administration within 4-12 days. It may be confirmed after drug discontinuation as it will disappear after some time. It will reappear once the medicine that cause adverse reaction is readministered. Penicillin (amoxicillin, ampicillin) induced maculopapular rash Most antibiotics are known to cause rash as a side effect. However, it looks like that penicillin antibiotics such as ampicillin and especially amoxicillin causes a rash more often than others. Penicillin occurs to be most common drugs that a lot of patients are sensitive to. About 10 % of people report allergic reactions to penicillin. It is expected that incidence is much higher. Amoxicillin is known to cause 2 types of allergic skin manifestations: Hives and Maculopapular rash. Hives are raised, itchy, white or red bumps on the skin that appear after 1-2 doses of the drug, they may be allergic to penicillin. On the other hand, smaller and paler patches commonly accompanied with the red patches on the skin are the signs of amoxicillin induced maculopapular rash. It often develops among 3-10 days after beginning the therapy with amoxicillin. Girls are usually more sensitive than boys in a developing a rash after taking amoxicillin. Also, children who have mononucleosis and then take antibiotics may be more likely to get the rash. While hives are most usually caused by allergies, it can’t be concluded for sure what causes maculopapular rash to develop. If your child gets a maculopapular rash without signs of hives or other symptoms, it doesn’t necessarily be that they are allergic to amoxicillin. They are simply more sensitive to amoxicillin without having a true allergy. If you notice your child get allergic reaction after taking amoxicillin, you should call your doctor immediately, as the allergic reaction could get worsen. Never give another dose to your of this medication without talking to you doctor firs. Call emergency if your child is having difficulty breathing or shows signs of swelling after amoxicillin or any other drug use. Anticonvulsant drug (barbiturates, carbamazepine) induced maculopapular rash Different anticonvulsant (antiepileptic) drugs including carbamazepine, phenytoin, fosphenytoin, phenobarbital, lamotrigine and valproic acid may cause skin rashes as side effects. Some racial groups have been shown to be especially prone to cutaneous side effects after anticonvulsants use. For example Han Chinese and different South-east Asians populations who have a particular HLA-B allele are considerably more likely to develop severe allergic skin reactions such as Stevens Johnson syndrome or toxic epidermal necrolysis after anticonvulsants use. Laboratory genetic testing for the particular genes before anticonvulsant use may be useful in identifying patients at risk. Allopurinol (Zyloprim, Aloprim) induced maculopapular rash Allopurinol (Zyloprim, Aloprim) is drug used to prevent attacks of gout and kidney stones and also treats different complications of cancer chemotherapy. Allopurinol rashes can vary from a mild skin irritation to a severe allergic reaction. Milder form of rashes may be manifested with: redness, itching or small bumps on a small surface of the body. Severe rashes may produce a wide-spread skin rash characterized with peeling, hives, fever and joint pains. If you develop a skin rash during allopurinol treatment you should stop taking the drug immediately and then go and see your physician. Following guideline diagnostic diagram may be helpful to determine the real cause of maculopapular rash. It also guides health professionals how to proceed and what to do in order to give the patient appropriate treatment. If maculopapular rash is present, the first and most important question is to answer whether patient has a fever or not. If the answer is yes, it should be determined if the patient is ill or not. In that case patient possibly has erythema multiforme, Kawasaki disease, rubeola, dengue, Rocky Mountain spotted fever or ehrlichiosis. If the patient doesn’t appear ill, then Coxsackie virus, scarlet fever, erythema infectiosum, gonorrhoea, varicella, drug-induced rash, Epstein-Barr virus, Roseola infantum, Mycoplasma infection, secondary syphilis, or viral infection should be considred If the patient does not have a fever, it should be determined if the rash is localized or generalized. If it is localized on the exact part of the body, the maculopapular rash may be caused by contact dermatitis, scabies, insect bite or papular acrodermatitis. If generalized, it should be considered if it is acute or chronic. If it is chronic, the patient may have: pityriasis, molluscum contagiosum, pityriasis lichenoides, lichen nitidus or papular urticaria. If it is acute, the patient may have erythema infectiosum, contact dermatitis, erythema multiforme, pityriasis rosea, scabies, roseola, drug-induced rash, guttate psoriasis, insect bite, rubella, Mycoplasma infection, secondary syphilis, or other viral infections. Except physical examination, laboratory tests such as: complete blood count test, culture test of pustules, syphilis tests and cerebrospinal fluid tests should be performed. In general, examination of the lung, ENT, genitals, joints and nerves should be also conducted. Maculopapular rash may be mistakenly called macule, papule, patch, nodule, plaque, vesicle, or pustule. Confusion and intense headache may indicate gonococcemia. Inflammation of the joints indicates meningococcemia. Breathing problems may be related pharyngitis or anaphylaxis. Purulent urethral drainage may also be linked with maculopapular rash on private parts of the body. The proper management of maculopapular rash depends on the disease, the severity of the disease and also the age of the patient. There are number different methods that can be used for symptomatic relief of maculopapular rash. Intravenous fluids and oral rehydration for maculopapular rash Mild cases of Dengue fever should be treated with intravenous fluids and oral rehydration. However, severe cases require blood transfusions. Pateients infected with the Epstein-Barr Virus are also suggested to take rest and as well as increase their fluid intake. Painkillers such as NSAIDs (ibuprofen, diclofenac, naproxen, etc) can be used for pain prelief associated with rash especially in the case of EBV (Epstein-Barr Virus) as the cause of the maculopapular rash. In the case of Chikungunya virus induced maculopapular rash and positive serologic tests to this virus, chloroquine can be prescribed. This anti-inflammatory which helps palliates the disease and its symptoms. These 2 radiations-type treatments may be the last resort for most severe cases of Marburg hemorrhagic fever caused maculopapular rash. “What is the uvula and its function?
