d50164b0-f9af-4cfa-b831-b2867b10fe78,"Children with asthma having fewer attacks amid the coronavirus pandemic, study says Bronchial asthma is a common medical problem among children. Typically, asthma bouts occur during the middle of winter, while some smaller peaks happen in spring. During the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic,  an international team of researchers has found that children with asthma experienced fewer upper respiratory tract infections, emergency visits, fever episodes, asthma attacks, and hospital admissions compared with the previous year. The team also revealed that 66 percent of children with asthma showed improved asthma control, while in 33 percent, the improvement exceeded the minimally clinically important difference. Study: Childhood asthma outcomes during the COVID-19 pandemic: Findings from the PeARL multi-national cohort. Image Credit: Ann / Shutterstock In the study, published as preprint on the serverthe researchers aimed to assess the impact of COVID-19, caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), on childhood asthma outcomes. To arrive at the study's findings, the team used the PeARL multi-national cohort, which included children with asthma and non-asthmatic controls recruited during the pandemic. The results were compared with available data from the previous year. The study participants ranged between 4 and 18 years old and who were diagnosed with asthma. The participants were also being monitored in one of the participating asthma clinics. Meanwhile, the non-asthmatic controls were children of the same age, who were being monitored for a non-respiratory condition. The researchers collected data that include the frequency of acute events, like asthma attacks, fever, emergency visits, upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs), lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs), and hospital admissions, during and before the pandemic. The study included more than 1,054 children with asthma and 505 control participants across 25 pediatric departments from 15 countries. In terms of outcomes of acute events, children with asthma were not at increased risk of LRTS, fever episodes, hospitalizations, and emergency room visits during the pandemic. However, these children were found to be at risk of URTI compared to the control group during the pandemic. Could Vitamin D be an effective adjuvant to help mitigate the COVID-19 pandemic? Experts assess the impact of COVID-19 on pediatric patients with special needs New UK-derived SARS-CoV-2 variant does not affect neutralizing antibodies efficiency, study says The team also compared the frequency of each acute event during the pandemic compared to the previous year. They found that asthmatic children had fewer URTIs, fever episodes, emergency visits, asthma attacks, hospitalization due to asthma, and hospital admissions during the pandemic, compared with the preceding year. Further, the team said no differences were observed in the frequency or LRTIs before and during the pandemic. However, the coronavirus pandemic seems not to affect the frequency of emergency visits to hospital admissions in the control group. Also, there was a decrease in URTIs and fever episodes frequency, and an increased risk of LRTIs during the pandemic. In terms of asthma control during the pandemic, the team revealed that 90.2 participants reported improved or unchanged asthma control during the pandemic, while 65.9 percent experienced an improvement. There are many reasons why children with asthma had improved disease control, fewer asthma attacks, fewer hospitalizations, and improved pulmonary function during the pandemic. During the pandemic, children were not allowed to attend school, and they resorted to online learning. As a result, they did not leave their houses and, therefore, were not exposed to outdoor allergens, air pollution, and viral infections. The team also revealed the improved and increased treatment compliance during the pandemic. However, even with the protective effect of the pandemic on asthmatic children, they may also be exposed to indoor allergens and pollutants, which may precipitate worse asthma control in some children. In a nutshell, the researchers found improved health and asthma activity during the pandemic, which has been tied to the decreased exposure to asthma triggers and enhanced treatment adherence. The study also showed that during the pandemic, children with mild to moderate atopic asthma did not experience an increase in the frequency of cute episodes that could represent COVID-19 infection. ""The decreased frequency of acute episodes does not support the notion that childhood asthma may be a risk factor for COVID-19. Furthermore, the potential for improving childhood asthma outcomes through environmental control becomes apparent,"" the authors wrote in the paper. publishes preliminary scientific reports that are not peer-reviewed and, therefore, should not be regarded as conclusive, guide clinical practice/health-related behavior, or treated as established information.

f958b44e-4a31-4e3e-9739-f5f2c272bfe5,"Asthma and COVID-19 Risk: Good, Bad, or Indifferent? — CDC says condition increases risk of severe outcomes; emerging evidence suggests otherwise by , Associate Editor, MedPage Today People with asthma are for severe COVID-19 outcomes, although evidence is emerging that may point in the opposite direction. Under normal circumstances, viral infections are a big driver of flares in asthma patients. But research indicates asthma patients with COVID-19 do not appear to have a higher rate of hospitalization or mortality compared with other COVID-19 patients, Linda Rogers, MD, of Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City, told . ""As we look at data coming out of areas strongly affected by the pandemic, one very striking thing is the lack of high rates of patients with asthma having severe effects"" of COVID-19, Rogers said. For example, she pointed to data from Wuhan, China, indicating that 5% of people in China have asthma yet it was seen in fewer than 1% of patients hospitalized for COVID-19. Rogers also cited mortality statistics from the , in which ""asthma is not even in the top 10"" comorbidities, even though 8%-10% of New York's population has asthma. Rogers noted chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) comes in after hypertension, diabetes, as well as other types of cardiovascular disease, dementia, and renal disease. This does not necessarily mean asthma is protective, as other factors could explain these lower rates, she added. Patients with asthma may behave differently than patients with other chronic diseases, though Rogers said that seems unlikely, or it could be an artifact of how the data were collected. But if these can be ruled out, it does at least raise the question of whether asthma or its treatment is ""protective,"" she said. One reason that may be the case: The presence of type 2 inflammation in asthma or allergies, which is associated with lower expression of ACE2, thought to be the entry receptor for SARS-CoV-2 in host cells. ""That would be a plausible mechanism by which asthma would not be a high-risk condition, and could be a potential link to what we're observing in the epidemiological data,"" Rogers said. Indeed, she cited evidence pointing to this hypothesis. A study in the showed ""respiratory allergy and controlled allergen exposures are each associated with ,"" and that ACE2 expression was ""lowest in individuals with both high levels of allergic sensitization and asthma."" She also pointed to a commentary in the suggesting , such as corticosteroids, may play a role. Up to 75% of asthma patients in China use inhaled steroids, which ""suppress coronavirus replication and cytokine production"" in cultured cells. ""The possibility that inhaled corticosteroids might prevent (at least partly) the development of symptomatic infection or severe presentations of COVID-19 cannot be ignored,"" the authors wrote. Rogers said steroids may also be associated with lower ACE2 levels, but ""many patients are concerned about the effect of inhaled steroids. There are still a lot of unknowns."" During the COVID-19 outbreak, she advised clinicians to encourage patients with asthma to maintain their asthma control to avoid a flare-up that causes them to be hospitalized. For more severe patients, Rogers said some anti-interleukin-5 agents for asthma are approved for self-injection at home -- i.e., benralizumab (Fasenra) and mepolizumab (Nucala). Anti-IgE therapy for asthma control (omalizumab, Xolair) is not approved for home use, although it comes in a . But following a discussion with a provider, ""if clinically appropriate, home use may be considered"" for patients who are stable, within the setting of COVID-19, Rogers said. is an associate editor, who covers infectious diseases for MedPage Today.

d183bbe8-c194-446a-a411-e8cd0dc626cd,"Asthma inhalers being trialed for treatment of COVID-19 Researchers from Queensland University of Technology and Oxford University are working in collaboration to begin human clinical trials of inhaled corticosteroids, commonly used for asthma patients, on patients with COVID-19. The researchers believe that this could be useful for patients with the novel coronavirus infection. Asthma inhaler. Image Credit: New Africa / Shutterstock The novel coronavirus or severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has infected over 11.79 million people around the world and killed over 543,000 individuals to date. The virus has led to severe respiratory complications and hospitalization in some individuals. These individuals have needed intensive care and ventilation, and the outcome of these patients is usually poor. As of now, there are no definitive medications to treat and cure the infection, and there are no effective vaccines to prevent viral infection. Researchers around the world are in search of drugs that could help reduce the severity of complications of COVID-19. There are currently 21 candidate vaccines in clinical evaluation and 139 candidate vaccines at the preclinical evaluation stage. COVID-19 is known to cause severe respiratory illness in some individuals. Studies have shown that some corticosteroids, , could reduce the inflammation of the respiratory tract in these patients and benefit them by alleviating the symptoms of severe disease. Researchers in this new trial are studying if the steroid inhalers used for reducing the exacerbations of asthma could be useful for patients with early COVID-19 and reduce their risk of severe disease. Lead researcher on this team Dan Nicolau, an associate professor at QUT, explained that the asthmatics and those with chronic lung disease and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) were on regular inhaler therapy with corticosteroids, were found to have a lesser risk of severe illness in the early phase of the pandemic. He said that this was paradoxical because those with long term lung disease were initially considered to be at a higher risk of a respiratory viral infection such as SARS-CoV-2. He said in his statement, “This seemed paradoxical because COVID-19 affects the lungs – and these patients have lung problems – so they should be more at risk of severe disease from the virus.” Nicolau said, “One explanation for the low numbers was that something these people were doing regularly was protecting them and that, logically, was that they routinely used inhalers for their chronic lung problems.” “Ideally, it may be that the corticosteroid therapy would be given to anyone with a new, dry cough, and while they are awaiting their COVID test results,” he added. Higher consumption of meat linked with increased wheezing in children High levels of steroids put asthma patients at greater risk of serious side-effects ACAAI releases guidance related to risk of allergic reactions to Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine He explained that based on their speculation, the earlier a corticosteroid inhaler is started for those with , the lesser their risk of getting severely ill. This speculation, he said, was based on the mathematical modeling by the research team. The clinical trial has been registered under the name of . It has begun recruiting patients at the Churchill Hospital in Oxford, England. The study is being led by Associate Professor Nicolau, who is also a mathematician, physician, and Australian Research Council Future Fellow. As per the trial details, the researchers have plans to recruit a total of 478 participants in the study. Some of the patients would be administered the corticosteroid (Budesonide) containing inhaler while others would be prescribed a placebo inhaler. Budesonide is widely used for control of symptoms of asthma and prevent its exacerbations. The trial participants would be those with new-onset symptoms of COVID-19. The researchers wrote that the trial aims to “Evaluate the effect of inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) therapy compared to standard care in participants with early CoVID-19 illness in reducing COVID related emergency department presentations or hospital admissions”. Both male and female patients over the age of 18 years would be included in the trial. The trial endpoints that would be recorded for each of the participants would be the need for hospitalization within 28 days of inclusion into the trial. Participants would be evaluated and followed up at baseline and then on days 7, 14, and 28. If successful, Budesonide inhaler therapy could be a low cost and readily available therapy for early COVID-19 patients. It would reduce their risk of getting severe respiratory complications, Nicolau said. Panic buying and hoarding the inhalers could be a problem in some countries, but in Australia, this should not be a problem. Nicolau said, “There wouldn’t be the kind of panic buying you see with consumer goods, because there are checks in place... There is a lot of stock around, and, as above, checks and balances on the dispensation of the inhalers would come into play to stop any [panic buying].” Nicolau added that it would be September before any conclusive results could be obtained from the trial and the inhalers proven. Before that, it is important to wait for concrete evidence, he warned.

ab3f64cb-6300-4de8-9c3a-86ececcae0cf,"Asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are both health conditions involving the respiratory system and can lead to difficulty breathing. There is some overlap between the two conditions and it is estimated that approximately 40% of patients with COPD also suffer from asthma. However, there are some distinct differences between the two conditions, in their pathophysiology, presentation of symptoms and the optimal management plans. The key differences to aid in diagnosis and treatment decisions are outlined below. Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the airways that leads recurrent episodes of symptoms such as wheezing, breathlessness, chest tightness and coughing, which commonly occur at night or in the early morning.  These flare up periods are associated with triggers that cause obstruction of the airways, which is usually reversible. most commonly occurs during childhood, in individuals that have a history of dry cough in the night, although it can present at any age. COPD is a disease characterized by the progressive obstruction of the airways that leads to a reduction in airflow and respiratory function. These changes are not completely reversible and inhaled noxious particle or gases, such as cigarette smoke, are associated as risk factors for the condition. Diagnosis of COPD usually occurs in older adults with a history of smoking or chronic exposure to other inhaled irritants. Both asthma and COPD are chronic inflammatory diseases of the small airways involving mucus and bronchoconstriction that limit the airflow. However, the differences between the two conditions are important and affect the way we manage them. Researchers use urine test to identify and verify a patient's type of asthma Study discusses steep drop off from asthma-related ED visits during spring 2020 COVID-19 Prescribing treatments according to genetic differences could benefit children with asthma The reversibility of the damage to the airways is a major difference between asthma and COPD. The airways obstruction in asthma is largely reversible in patients with asthma, whereas the obstruction in COPD is considered to be irreversible or less reversible. The difference in reversibility is highlighted in the results from lung function tests, such as spirometry. Both show a reduction in airflow, but assessing the effect of bronchodilator administration can help to differentiate between the conditions. Asthma exhibits greater reversibility and results tend to improve with administration of bronchodilators, whereas COPD shows less improvement with bronchodilator medication. The classification of severity of asthma and COPD also differs. The severity of asthma is based on the lung function and frequency and severity of symptoms; the severity of COPD is based primarily on the function of the lungs. As the pathology and cause of inflammation are distinct in asthma and COPD, the treatment plan will differ accordingly. While the aim of treatment in asthma is to suppress the chronic inflammation, the main aim in COPD is to reduce symptoms. There is significant evidence to support the use on anti-inflammatory drugs in patients with asthma to improve symptoms. This is thought to have an effect on the airways by slowing the remodeling that may occur in some patients. The management of COPD is faced with greater challenges and, at this point in time, there are no medications available that modify the progression of the disease. Instead, managing certain risk factors is thought to be of benefit, such as stopping smoking. Inhaled corticosteroids may help to decrease the frequency of exacerbation in patients with COPD and improve quality of life. http://erj.ersjournals.com/content/21/39_suppl/30s http://www.pharmaceutical-journal.com/learning/learning-article/knowing-the-differences-between-copd-and-asthma-is-vital-to-good-practice/11085597.article http://www.goldcopd.org/uploads/users/files/AsthmaCOPDOverlap.pdf http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3488995/ Last Updated: Aug 23, 2018 Yolanda graduated with a Bachelor of Pharmacy at the University of South Australia and has experience working in both Australia and Italy.

2fec9977-bf0e-4772-878f-27f022f94a8b,"COVID-19 Poses a Higher Risk for People with Asthma: What You Can Do — by Maria Gifford Experts say people with asthma don’t face a higher risk of contracting COVID-19, but they do face a higher risk of serious illness if they contract with the virus. Experts recommend people with asthma consult with their doctor about their medications. People with asthma are also advised to reduce stress and take extra precautions around their home. All data and statistics are based on publicly available data at the time of publication. Some information may be out of date. Visit our and follow our for the most recent information on the COVID-19 pandemic. But people with preexisting respiratory illnesses such as asthma are at particularly high risk of having serious consequences that could arise from a coronavirus infection. Observing pandemic prevention advice such as social distancing and frequent handwashing can help people with asthma avoid contracting COVID-19, just like everyone else. And there are additional steps you can take to protect your health if you have asthma. There’s no clear evidence that people with asthma are at higher risk of contracting COVID-19, according to the American College of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology (ACAAI). The , however, says, “People with moderate to severe asthma may be at higher risk of getting very sick from COVID-19.” “We know that the number one cause of asthma attacks are viral illnesses, so it makes sense that COVID-19, which is a viral illness that causes respiratory disease, could be worse for people who have asthma,” , a pediatric emergency medicine and emergency medical physician at UPMC Children’s Hospital of Pittsburgh, told Healthline. “Patients with underlying conditions that specifically involve their lungs, like asthma, COPD, and chronic bronchitis, seem to be more at risk to develop pneumonias and the dreaded acute respiratory syndrome associated with COVID-19,” said , a trauma surgeon and vice chief of staff at St. Mary’s Medical Center in Long Beach, California. “Logic would dictate that anyone with lung disease at baseline potentially has much less reserve to deal with a process that limits the ability to get oxygen from air into the bloodstream, which is exactly what our lungs do,” said , a Baltimore-based internal medicine physician with national primary care network MDVIP. “For instance, a person with 100 percent lung function may drop to 70 percent with COVID-19, which is still enough lung function to not threaten that person,” Malinow said. “An asthmatic under poor control, who starts with 70 percent lung function for instance, and is then impacted and trying to function with 40 percent lung function, is going to be struggling a lot more.” The ACAAI emphasizes that there is no evidence that asthma medications used to prevent symptoms, such as inhaled steroids, oral steroids, montelukast, and biologics, increase your risk of contracting COVID-19. However, a recent published in the Endocrine Society’s Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism warns that individuals taking a class of steroid hormones called glucocorticoids for conditions such as asthma, allergies, and arthritis may be unable to mount a normal stress response and are at high risk if they contract the coronavirus. “People with asthma who have an inhibited immune defense, or who have been admitted to a hospital because of asthma within the last 12 months, could be at particular risk of becoming very ill from a coronavirus infection,” , co-founder of Practio, a travel vaccination and infectious disease advice specialist service, told Healthline. But people with asthma are far from helpless in lowering their risk of infection or developing serious COVID-19 complications. First and foremost is to continue to take their maintenance, or preventive, asthma inhaler daily as prescribed. “This will help decrease their risk of an asthma attack triggered by any respiratory virus, including coronavirus,” Nilsen said. Be sure to have an ample supply of asthma medication on hand, including both maintenance and rescue inhalers. Albuterol inhalers have been in short supply in some parts of the country, according to the ACAAI, in part because they also are used by hospitals to treat COVID-19 patients. “Talk to your doctor, insurance company, and pharmacist about creating an emergency supply of prescription medications such as inhalers in case you are quarantined or need to stay home for an extended period of time,” said , a pediatrician at Einstein Pediatrics of Vienna, Virginia. People with asthma should also use telehealth to maintain routine contact and appointments with their allergist, the ACAAI advised. Stress also can inhibit your immune system and people with asthma may be particularly stressed knowing that their risk of COVID-19 complications is elevated. “It is well known that anxiety can bring on asthma attacks, or make them worse once you’ve already started,” Heilbron told Healthline. “Patients often also know their asthma triggers. Being aware of those can help them manage or even avoid attacks.” Beyond using the coping mechanisms many people with asthma have already developed to reduce stress, such as exercise, healthy eating, and meditation, Heilbron advised eliminating COVID-19 related stressors whenever possible, “which means stepping away from their phones and their televisions and their computer screens for extended periods of time.” In a time of imposed physical isolation, it’s also important to reach out to your support network of family, friends, and community groups whether by phone or online, said , a family physician at Centura Health in Longmont, Colorado. Sheltering in place and self-quarantining at home can pose particular challenges for people with asthma, said , RN, PhD, CPN, AE-C, an assistant professor of nursing and asthma educator at Binghamton University Nursing in New York. “Staying indoors may increase exposure to certain asthma triggers,” Quaranta told Healthline. “If possible, a room in your home should be maintained as trigger-free as possible. Depending on your triggers, keep all pets out of your room. Try to maintain a dust-free environment. If possible, have someone other than the person with asthma clean with a HEPA-filtered vacuum and dust frequently. Maintain low humidity to reduce mold and dust mites.” As pollen counts rise in spring, windows also should be kept closed to reduce exposure, said Quaranta, who also advised avoiding any type of smoke. “Also, be careful with household cleaners trying to keep your home sterile, as the fumes may irritate your lungs,” Dawson said. People with asthma who’ve been diagnosed with COVID-19 or suspect they have the illness and are using an inhaler at home need to do so in a location that minimizes exposure to other family members, since the coronavirus spreads via exhaled droplets of water. “Choose a location for your treatment where air is not recirculated into the home — places like a porch or patio, or in a garage — areas where surfaces can be cleaned more easily or may not need cleaning,” the ACAAI advised. Lastly, be vigilant about any respiratory symptoms you experience — don’t brush them off as “just” allergies or asthma. “Anyone with asthma or another chronic condition should take early note of any symptoms such as shortness of breath, a new or worsening cough, a fever, or severe body aches and reach out to a care provider at the early onset of symptoms,” , chief medical officer at the national telehealth company Zipnosis, told Healthline. — by Maria Gifford Vitamin D May Help Ease Children’s Asthma Caused by Air Pollution Researchers say African-American children and urban children who are indoors a lot are the ones most affected.

00e77ef6-4cd9-46bc-bdf0-af267aad80ee,"by If you, like the Skeptical Cardiologist, suffer from asthma you may be wondering if you are at a higher risk of contracting COVID-19 or developing more severe respiratory complications from the disease once infected. There are 25 million asthma sufferers in the United States, about 8% of the population, and many of us are using as primary treatment a combination of inhaled beta-agonists (for immediate relief) and inhaled corticosteroids (ICS, for long-term conditioning of the lung). How are these treatments influencing our risks during the COVID-19 pandemic? A published online in suggested that there is a lower prevalence of asthma in patients with COVID-19. However, the sum of evidence from this commentary and elsewhere is insufficient to say asthma is protective. When there is an absence of evidence, as we saw with as a risk factor and as a treatment, the tendency of journalists is to obtain a quote from a physician who has treated patients with COVID-19 to buttress a particular argument. Quotes which say something like ""we don't know"" or ""there is not enough evidence right now"" are highly unlikely to be published, whereas anecdotal speculation is always intriguing (but often misleading.). The published this quote on the topic: ""We're not seeing a lot of patients with asthma,"" said Dr. Bushra Mina, a pulmonary and critical care physician at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City, which has treated more than 800 COVID cases. The more common risk factors, he added, are ""morbid obesity, diabetes and chronic heart disease."" A major problem in sorting out asthma as an independent risk factor is that many papers are lumping all ""chronic respiratory diseases"" together, which puts asthma in a bucket with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and interstitial lung disease like pulmonary fibrosis. There are striking differences in the demographics and prognosis of these diseases. For example, patients with COPD are older and much more likely to have smoked cigarettes, two factors clearly associated with COVID-19 risk. In addition, asthma in older adults is highly associated with obesity, a well-recognized independent risk factor for COVID-19 complications. The American Academy of Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology (AAAAI) states: ""Among adults aged 60 and over, there was a significant trend of: 7.0% among normal weight adults; 9.1% among overweight adults; 11.6% among adults with obesity."" In addition, almost no data are available on asthma stratified by severity and treatment. The severe asthma patient who requires oral corticosteroids is markedly different from the mild asthmatic whose only treatment is intermittent inhaled beta-agonists. These data, like the data on hypertension, should be taken with a grain of salt. But at a minimum, we can say there is no signal that asthma by itself increases the risk of COVID-19 infection. The authors of the commentary in that implied asthma (and chronic respiratory disease) was protective against COVID-19 infection also concluded that ""the possibility that inhaled corticosteroids might prevent (at least partly) the development of symptomatic infection or severe presentation of COVID-19 cannot be ignored."" They cited some very preliminary data to support this contention, writing that ""in in-vitro models, inhaled corticosteroids alone or in combination with bronchodilators have been shown to suppress coronavirus replication and cytokine production. Low-quality evidence also exists from a case series in Japan, in which improvement was seen in three patients with COVID-19 requiring oxygen, but not ventilatory support."" Note that the authors of the commentary seem to have heavy ties to companies that stand to profit from sales of ICS. Personally, I have always worried that my use of ICS put me at a higher risk of respiratory infections because corticosteroids are potent immunosuppressives, potentially lowering my immune response to bacterial, viral, or fungal infections. A 2019 meta-analysis in found a 24% higher rate of upper respiratory tract infection in patients using ICS. Due to these concerns, when the pandemic began I purposely cut back on my fluticasone/salmeterol (Advair) usage. Fortunately, my asthma has been very mild since I started taking 3 years ago. Since then, dupilumab has been approved for treatment of asthma. By the way, dupilumab is a targeted biologic therapy that inhibits signaling of interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13) -- two key proteins that may play a central role in type 2 inflammation that underlies atopic dermatitis and several other allergic diseases -- but we have no idea if it increases or decreases COVID-19 risks or complications. Does ICS usage increase or lower our risk of COVID-19 outcomes? This figure from a of the topic in the shows where in the process ICS could influence COVID-19, either increasing or decreasing risk of 1) initial infection, 2) progression to pneumonia, or 3) progression to acute respiratory distress syndrome and death once pneumonia is established. There are theoretical arguments to suggest the use of ICS could either improve or worsen all three stages. The review of 59 publications on COVID-19 concluded: ""Following examination of the full texts including translations of those in Chinese, no publications were identified as having data on prior ICS use in patients with SARS, MERS or COVID-19 infection. No data were available for either a qualitative or narrative answer to the review question."" The bottom line right now is that we don't know if ICS use is an important risk factor in COVID-19 outcomes. The recommendations from the CDC, and all pulmonary/asthma societies, at this point is to stick to your current asthma action plan. If that includes taking an ICS, keep on taking it at current levels. In fact, the AAAAI and other major asthma or pulmonary organizations emphasize that patients because experiencing an exacerbation event and the need for hospitalization, in those who become poorly controlled, could actually increase patient exposure and the risk of infection. I've gone back to taking my ICS at pre-pandemic levels and I don't consider that my asthma puts me at any higher risk during the pandemic. , is a private practice noninvasive cardiologist and medical director of echocardiography at St. Luke's Hospital in St. Louis.

Does Asthma Increase Your Risk for Severe Coronavirus Symptoms? How to prepare for and deal with an asthma attack in the world of COVID-19. There is still a lot left to learn about the —not to mention about asthma and the coronavirus. One source of confusion for patients has been whether or not having asthma is a risk factor for more serious symptoms of COVID-19, if they do develop the infection. We don’t have a ton of research looking at patients with asthma and this particular new coronavirus. But experts tell us that those with asthma need to be aware that this virus, like other viral illnesses, may cause a flare in their asthma symptoms. And it’s very likely that those with asthma—especially severe or uncontrolled asthma—are more likely to develop severe COVID-19 symptoms if infected. Here’s what those with asthma need to know about their health risks right now and how to stay as safe and healthy as possible. Having COVID-19 may trigger asthma symptoms and asthma attacks. Asthma is a chronic condition in which your airways narrow, produce mucus, and swell with inflammation, the . While some people may notice some level of symptoms all the time, many people with asthma also suffer attacks in which their symptoms become much, much worse. During an asthma attack, you might cough a lot, wheeze, experience chest discomfort, and generally have trouble breathing. If the symptoms of an asthma attack don’t get better after using rescue medication (an inhaler) then you might need emergency medical care. And here’s the key: Asthma attacks like these are usually triggered by something else that causes inflammation, J. Allen Meadows, M.D., president of the American College of Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology, tells SELF. Essentially, the immune system overreacts to the trigger, leading to the excessive inflammation that causes the airways to narrow. Common asthma triggers include things like allergens, exercise, and illnesses like . So it makes sense that the coronavirus might also be a trigger for asthma. That alone makes the coronavirus an especially scary thought for those with asthma. But experts tell us that the overreactivity that’s characteristic of asthma may also lead to more severe symptoms of the infection, which can include asthma-like symptoms such as coughing, shortness of breath, and . Does having asthma make you high risk for COVID-19 complications? Because our understanding of the virus is still developing, there isn’t a ton of research about whether or not asthma is associated with worse outcomes from COVID-19, the illness caused by the coronavirus. In a published in recently, researchers looked at 140 patients infected with the novel coronavirus in Wuhan, China. They identified several underlying illnesses in many of the patients, including eosinopenia and lymphopenia (types of ). But asthma wasn’t one of those conditions, suggesting that having asthma doesn’t make it more likely that you’ll become infected. But what if you do become infected? So far, the data is limited but suggests that asthma isn’t a major risk factor for hospitalization. A recent published in looked at 201 patients in Wuhan with confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia. Of those, 66 patients had other comorbid chronic illnesses, including five with chronic lung illnesses. An even larger demographic of over 1,000 patients in the makes no mention of asthma or chronic lung diseases as potentially worrying underlying conditions. In a in The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice, the authors note that “there are relatively few data at this time to demonstrate a specific increased risk for COVID-19 from asthma, or an increased disease pathology in patients with asthma infected with [the new coronavirus].” However, they continue, this association could evolve. Ultimately, the authors recommend that those with asthma prioritize getting and keeping their asthma under control right now to help prevent a flare associated with the coronavirus. But even with limited research, experts tell us that asthma should be considered a high-risk condition based on what we know about it and how viral illnesses generally affect those with asthma. And, according to the (CDC), those with moderate to severe asthma may still be at a higher risk for developing severe COVID-19 symptoms if they do get infected. “You can think of the COVID-19 disease process as a major insult to the respiratory status,” Enid Rose Neptune, M.D., pulmonologist and associate professor of medicine at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, tells SELF. Most people who don’t have an underlying condition like asthma have a “tremendous amount of respiratory reserve,” she says, meaning their lungs can handle more stress. So even if they develop a serious condition like severe pneumonia or anaphylaxis, they are more likely to recover than those with chronic respiratory conditions. But “any disorder that reduces your respiratory or ventilatory reserve [including asthma] would make you at higher risk of having an adverse outcome if you happen to develop [a COVID-19] infection,” Dr. Neptune says. However, asthma can present in many, many different ways. It can be mild, moderate, or severe. It can be well controlled or uncontrolled. Someone can have many triggers or only a few, very specific triggers. Whether or not everyone with asthma—regardless of the individual’s specific symptoms—would have an equally increased risk for severe COVID-19 symptoms remains to be seen. So far, the biggest worry is for those who have severe or uncontrolled asthma, Dr. Meadows says. “People with mild asthma are at some risk, but certainly those with severe asthma are at a higher risk,” he says. “These people can land in the E.R. with a common cold.” Additionally, those who have frequent flare-ups or frequently need to increase their medication usage should be considered high-risk as well, Dr. Neptune says, which are signs that their asthma may not be well controlled. Unfortunately, if you have severe asthma you should consider yourself to be very high-risk for severe COVID-19 symptoms—even if it’s well-controlled. “We see asthmatics in our clinics that are on the correct medications, who know how to manage their disorder well, they monitor themselves very closely, they understand what their triggers are,” Dr. Neptune says. “In those cases one would like to assume they are protected from the worst outcomes with this pandemic, but unfortunately those are still people who are at higher risk of having adverse outcomes, being much more symptomatic, and needing more support in the event they have an infection.” We need to also pay attention to racial disparities in asthma. Additionally, we know that there is a distinct racial disparity when it comes to asthma prevalence and complications. People of color—particularly black people—have higher rates of prevalence, emergency department admission, and deaths related to asthma than white people, according to . This, unfortunately, mirrors the racial disparity we are beginning to see in for those infected with COVID-19. The disparities seen in asthma outcomes and COVID-19 outcomes “are very much in alignment,” Dr. Neptune says. “If you have an underlying respiratory or cardiorespiratory disorder and you're not getting optimal treatment, you're clearly going to have a much greater likelihood of becoming much more symptomatic and much more impaired if you develop a COVID-19 infection.” Although we don’t know the exact mechanisms underlying these differences, they likely stem from similar systemic issues. Asthma’s disproportionate burden on black and Puerto Rican individuals is , and it can be attributed to a variety of factors—from barriers to accessing care, to a lack of asthma education and management programs in certain communities, to socioeconomic and behavioral causes. Environmental injustice , one that may also lead to racial disparities in COVID-19 outcomes. Minority groups are more likely to live in areas with increased pollution than non-Hispanic whites are, and that pollution can , leading to higher rates of asthma and other health conditions. A (currently in preprint) conducted by researchers at Harvard University T.H. Chan School of Public Health found higher death rates from the new coronavirus in areas with higher levels of pollution. While this just shows a statistically significant link (not a cause-and-effect relationship), it underscores how certain communities are being disproportionately impacted by this virus. Ultimately, the goal for those with asthma is to be able to control their symptoms as much as possible at home without having to go to urgent care or the E.R. for treatment, Dr. Meadows explains. Avoiding this would help keep you safe from any illnesses you might be exposed to in the hospital and help reduce the burden on our health care system so it can continue to focus on treating the coronavirus pandemic. Some people do rely on the E.R. for their asthma care and those in minority groups are more likely to do so, . So this could be a significant factor in addressing the racial disparities in COVID-19 outcomes. Here’s how our experts suggest keeping yourself safe and healthy right now: We know that those with more severe asthma—even if it’s controlled—are most likely to have serious issues. But we don’t have enough information to tease out for sure whether or not those with mild symptoms are also at a higher risk right now, so even if your asthma is mild or well-controlled, Dr. Neptune recommends recognizing and “cloaking” yourself in your high-risk status. That will help reinforce the need for you to take other precautions, including sticking to social distancing guidelines and absolutely getting medical input if you develop any of the hallmark symptoms of COVID-19. If you’ve been diagnosed with asthma, you hopefully already have a in place. But if you don’t or you’re finding that your usual plan isn’t working as well as it used to, now is absolutely the time to check in with your doctor or asthma specialist—many of whom are taking telemedicine visits right now—to get on track. Continue taking your usual medications—including steroids. There has been some discussion about whether or not some steroid medications that are used to help control asthma symptoms are still safe to take. The issue stems from that corticosteroid medications, which work by dampening the immune system’s inflammatory response to infection, may make it harder for the body to fight a COVID-19 infection. But Dr. Meadows says the most important thing right now is to make sure your asthma stays controlled, even if that’s through the use of steroid medications. So keep taking your usual medications. And if you have any questions about specific medications, talk to your doctor about whether or not it’s okay for you to keep taking them. Consider getting a three-month supply of medications. If you can, Dr. Neptune recommends getting a three-month supply of your asthma medications rather than just getting them one month at a time. You may need to work with your doctor, pharmacist, or insurance company to get that sorted out, but it will be worth it to avoid the need to run out to pick up your prescription. It will also help you avoid the effects of a potential medication shortage that some areas of the country are already experiencing, she says. There is some worry that using nebulizers, devices that deliver medication as a vapor or mist that you can inhale, can actually . When you exhale what’s in your lungs, Dr. Neptune says, that raises the possibility of spreading droplets containing the virus. So if you think you may have COVID-19 or you’ve tested positive, consider using an inhaler instead if possible, she advises. But that doesn’t mean you can’t use a nebulizer if you really need it, Dr. Meadows says. It just means that you have to be careful to limit the number of people around you when you use these devices. Ideally, you should go out on a patio or into your garage to use them, he says. Like many health care providers right now, allergists, asthma specialists, and primary care providers are beginning to offer telemedicine visits. In addition to making sure your asthma is under control, these visits allow doctors to evaluate patients who may be experiencing a worsening of their symptoms before they , Dr. Meadows says, thus relieving some of the burden on the health care system and keeping those with asthma away from a potential exposure to the coronavirus. “If asthma is well controlled, everything will be better for everyone personally and societally,” he says. Also, if you haven’t checked in with your asthma specialist or primary care doctor recently, now is the time to do so, Dr. Neptune says. “They very likely have specific recommendations for what you’re supposed to do if you have a flare-up or in the event that you experience a new symptom,” she explains, recommending that everyone with asthma check in now even if they’re asymptomatic so they know exactly what to do if that changes. If you do experience a flare, it may be tempting to assume you know what’s going on and just deal with it on your own like you would any other flare-up. But you won’t necessarily be able to tell if it’s due to the coronavirus or another trigger, Dr. Neptune says. So it’s very important to check in with your doctor rather than trying to just wait it out and treat yourself. “The flare-up can be very similar to what you experience with [other triggers, especially viruses], but in this case you’re not going to manage that yourself,” she says. “If you’re developing a flare-up and you have underlying asthma in the COVID-19 universe we’re all living in now, you need to alert your health care provider and get information about testing for the virus and what you need to do in terms of next steps.” Here's How to Manage Asthma If You Usually Rely on the E.R. for Care What Needs to Happen to Fix Race-Based Asthma Health Disparities?

Few kids have been found to have the illness. So it's hard for experts to yet know how COVID-19 might affect kids with ongoing health problems. But asthma and COVID-19 both affect the lungs, and the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 is new. So far, kids with asthma aren't getting COVID-19 more often than people who don't have asthma. And kids with mild asthma don't seem to get sicker from COVID-19 than people without asthma. Experts are still learning if people with moderate to severe asthma might be more likely to get more serious symptoms if they are infected. To be safe and avoid infection, follow the advice from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and other health experts. Be sure to: Keep 6 feet apart from people you don't live with (called physical or ). Wear a when out and not able to distance from others. Should I Take My Child to Planned Health Care Visits? Talk to your health care provider. Many doctor's offices are scheduling in-person visits. Some appointments may be video visits (). If your child has an in-person visit, talk to the office about how they are keeping kids and families safe. The medical staff will be wearing masks. You and your child should wear them also. Reassure your child that these are safe and there's no reason to be scared. If your child is having an asthma flare-up that doesn't get better with treatment, get care as you would have done before the coronavirus pandemic. Hospitals and health care facilities are taking steps to protect patients and families. This may include separating sick and well people, wearing masks, and doing temperature checks. It is safe to get care if your child needs it. Yes. Keep giving all regular unless the care team tells you to stop. Keep about 30 days' worth of medicine (including for inhalers and nebulizers, if needed) and other needed supplies on hand.

If is a trigger for your child, check air quality before going outside (for instance, for exercise at a safe distance from others). If pollen will be high, stick with inside activities that day. It's still a good idea for your child to get daily physical activity. Besides helping your child to keep fit, it can ease , which sometimes can cause an asthma flare-up. First, call the health care team. They know your child's health history. The doctor will ask how your child is doing and if they've been around someone with known or suspected coronavirus. Your doctor's office will tell you what to do next and whether you need an in-person visit. Experts suggest using inhalers for someone who is sick instead of when possible during the COVID-19 crisis. That's because nebulizers create a mist. If someone has the coronavirus and uses a nebulizer, the mist could carry the virus to others. If your child uses a , talk to your care team about whether your child should switch to an inhaler. If your child can't use an inhaler, try not to have others in the room when using the nebulizer. Open a window or do the nebulizer on a porch for better air circulation. If you need to help your child use the nebulizer, stay behind them (not in front) during the treatment.

Few kids have been found to have the illness. So it's hard for experts to yet know how COVID-19 might affect kids with ongoing health problems. But asthma and COVID-19 both affect the lungs, and the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 is new. So far, kids with asthma aren't getting COVID-19 more often than people who don't have asthma. And kids with mild asthma don't seem to get sicker from COVID-19 than people without asthma. Experts are still learning if people with moderate to severe asthma might be more likely to get more serious symptoms if they are infected. To be safe and avoid infection, follow the advice from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and other health experts. Be sure to: Keep 6 feet apart from people you don't live with (called physical or ). Wear a when out and not able to distance from others. Should I Take My Child to Planned Health Care Visits?

If your child has an in-person visit, talk to the office about how they are keeping kids and families safe. The medical staff will be wearing masks. You and your child should wear them also. Reassure your child that these are safe and there's no reason to be scared. If your child is having an asthma flare-up that doesn't get better with treatment, get care as you would have done before the coronavirus pandemic. Hospitals and health care facilities are taking steps to protect patients and families. This may include separating sick and well people, wearing masks, and doing temperature checks. It is safe to get care if your child needs it. Yes. Keep giving all regular unless the care team tells you to stop. Keep about 30 days' worth of medicine (including for inhalers and nebulizers, if needed) and other needed supplies on hand. Work with your and pharmacy or drugstore to order refills well before they run out. Make a schedule and stick to it. This is especially helpful for remembering to take daily medicines. Help your child follow their . Keep giving to help avoid flare-ups. If you aren't sure which they are, call your doctor's office. If your child uses an asthma , be sure they're comfortable using it. Get a refresher from the care team, if needed. Help your child avoid . Keep giving allergy medicines, if your child takes them. If is a trigger for your child, check air quality before going outside (for instance, for exercise at a safe distance from others). If pollen will be high, stick with inside activities that day. It's still a good idea for your child to get daily physical activity. Besides helping your child to keep fit, it can ease , which sometimes can cause an asthma flare-up. First, call the health care team. They know your child's health history. The doctor will ask how your child is doing and if they've been around someone with known or suspected coronavirus. Your doctor's office will tell you what to do next and whether you need an in-person visit. Experts suggest using inhalers for someone who is sick instead of when possible during the COVID-19 crisis. That's because nebulizers create a mist. If someone has the coronavirus and uses a nebulizer, the mist could carry the virus to others. If your child uses a , talk to your care team about whether your child should switch to an inhaler. If your child can't use an inhaler, try not to have others in the room when using the nebulizer.

Promote respiratory health through better prevention, detection, treatment, and education efforts. Asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)are significant public health burdens. Specific methods of detection, intervention, and treatment exist that may reduce this burden and promote health. Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the airways characterized by episodes of reversible breathing problems due to airway narrowing and obstruction. These episodes can range in severity from mild to life threatening. Symptoms of asthma include wheezing, coughing, chest tightness, and shortness of breath. Daily preventive treatment can prevent symptoms and attacks and enable individuals who have asthma to lead active lives. COPD is a preventable and treatable disease characterized by airflow limitation that is not fully reversible. The airflow limitation is usually progressive and associated with an abnormal inflammatory response of the lungs to noxious particles or gases (typically from exposure to cigarette smoke).Treatment can lessen symptoms and improve quality of life for those with COPD. Several additional respiratory conditions and respiratory hazards, including infectious agents and occupational and environmental exposures, are covered in other areas of Healthy People 2020. Examples include tuberculosis, lung cancer, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), pneumonia, occupational lung disease, and smoking. Sleep Health is now a separate topic area of Healthy People 2020. Currently more than 25 million peoplein the United States have asthma. Approximately 14.8 million adults have been diagnosed with COPD, and approximately 12 million people have not yet been diagnosed. The burden of respiratory diseases affects individuals and their families, schools, workplaces, neighborhoods, cities, and states. Because of the cost to the health care system, the burden of respiratory diseases also falls on society; it is paid for with tax dollars, higher health insurance rates, and lost productivity. Annual health care expenditures for asthma alone are estimated at $20.7 billion. The prevalence of asthma has increased since 1980. However, deaths from asthma have decreased since the mid-1990s. The causes of asthma are an active area of research and involve both genetic and environmental factors. Risk factors for asthma currently being investigated include: Health Communication and Health Information Technology Asthma affects people of every race, sex, and age. However, significant disparities in asthma morbidity and mortality exist, particularly for low-income and minority populations. Populations with higher rates of asthma include: While there is currently no cure for asthma, there are diagnoses and treatment guidelines that are aimed at ensuring that all people with asthma live full and active lives. COPD is the 4th leading cause of death in the United States. In 2014, approximately 142,000 individuals died from COPD, and almost as many died from lung cancer (approximately 155,500) in the same year. In nearly 8 out of 10 cases, COPD is caused by exposure to cigarette smoke. Other environmental exposures (such as those in the workplace) may also cause COPD. Genetic factors strongly influence the development of the disease. For example, not all smokers develop COPD. Quitting smoking may slow the progression of the disease. Women and men are affected equally, yet more women than men have died of COPD since 2000. There are other important respiratory diseases not included in this topic area, including idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, sarcoidosis, respiratory distress syndromes, and upper airway conditions such as rhinitis and chronic sinusitis. In some cases, effective preventive interventions do not exist. In others, nationally representative trend data for disease prevalence and/or incidence, causative exposures, and other preventable risk factors are not available for tracking of measurable goals. It is hoped that, as preventive interventions and surveillance for respiratory hazards and diseases continue to improve, future versions of Healthy People will include measurable goals for at least some of these additional respiratory hazards and diseases. Other emerging issues in the Respiratory Diseases topic area include: Assessing the impact of climate change (temperature extremes, the increased geographic span of allergens, and air quality) on asthma causation and exacerbations Increasing importance of indoor air quality as a cause of work-related respiratory symptoms and asthma in a service economy Increasing use of nanotechnology and resulting exposures to engineered nanoparticles Increasing exposures to respiratory hazards such as isocyanates used in “green” building materials Applying knowledge about gene-environment interactions and epigenetics to respiratory disease prevention Using knowledge about primary causes of asthma (determination of distinct asthma phenotypes) in developing effective prevention strategies, such as weight control and allergen avoidance Developing novel treatments to alter the progression of disease severity and, ultimately, to prevent asthma onset Using personalized medicine (tailoring treatment to a patient’s specific phenotype, genetics, and history) Identifying new respiratory hazards, as has been done during the last decade for diacetyl and other butter-flavoring chemicals; nylon, rayon, and polypropylene flock; and World Trade Center dust Improving COPD awareness and clinical case-finding in the population at large, and in the health care delivery system at the state and local levels Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Management of Asthma NHLBI - Learn more about Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease Global Strategy for the Diagnosis, Management, and Prevention of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease: GOLD Executive Summary Moorman JE, Akinbami LJ, Bailey CM, Zahran HS, King ME, Johnson CA, et al.

Here are some common questions and ways to help keep children with asthma healthy during the pandemic. ​ Does having asthma put my child at higher risk of getting sick from COVID-19? There is still a lot we don't know yet about COVID-19. What we are seeing is that people with chronic health conditions appear to have higher risk of more severe illness if they get COVID-19. It is not clear whether this is the case for asthma.​ How important is it that my child's asthma is well controlled during this COVID-19 pandemic? It is always important to have well controlled asthma. In the current COVID-19 pandemic it is especially important. We want to prevent children from needing emergency department care when possible. Having uncontrolled asthma is a risk factor for asthma attacks, so control is the goal. However, if your child is having an asthma emergency, don't delay seeking immediate medical care. Hospitals and urgent care clinics are still open and taking extra steps to keep patients and health care workers safe. ​ How do I know if my child's asthma is well-controlled? If you're not sure your child's asthma is well controlled, call your pediatrician or other asthma care provider. Well controlled asthma usually means your child is: waking up during the night from coughing no more than once per month (or no more than 2 nighttime awakenings for children 12 years and older) needing 2 or less rescue treatments per week (this does not include pre-treating before exercise) having no more than 1 course of oral steroids such as prednisone in the last 12 months able to fully participate in regular activity without breathing limitations ​ This would be a good time to review your child's asthma control and management plan with your doctor. Many providers can check on your child's asthma and make changes to or medications by telephone or telemedicine visits. Your pediatrician and other asthma providers want to know about your child's asthma concerns, so don't be shy about contacting them! What if my child has an asthma attack during the pandemic? For children with asthma, we recommend that parents and other caregivers make sure to have an asthma action plan. An asthma action plan will tell you what to do every day for asthma care and what to do if your child has asthma symptoms. It is important to manage asthma attacks in the same way as usual during the pandemic. Don't worry about using oral steroids, for example, if that is part of your child's action plan. This will not increase COVID-19 risks and illness. Make sure you tell your child's doctor about any questions concerns you have about your child's asthma medicine or action plan. When should I seek emergency care for my child with asthma? if your child is having symptoms that include: can't catch their breath, speak in full sentences (if developmentally appropriate), or walk because of breathing difficulties movement of the muscles in between the ribs, abdomen (sometimes called belly breathing) and/or in the neck turning a bluish or grayish color around their mouth or fingernails, making grunting noises, head bobbing, not responding to albuterol treatments Your child's emergency action plan can provide more details about when to seek immediate or emergency care.​ Some children may not require emergency care, but need a change in treatment plan or closer monitoring. Call your pediatriciain or asthma care provider if your child is having any of the following symptoms: symptoms not responding to albuterol (but otherwise not in distress) needing albuterol treatments more frequently than every 4 hours (but otherwise not in distress) not getting better after 2-3 days of increasing albuterol With COVID-19, what is the best form of asthma medication to give--an inhaler or nebulizer treatment? Another important part of asthma care and control is knowing how to best take asthma medications. Now is a great time for anyone with asthma to review how to make sure they are using their medications correctly.​ Using a nebulizer for albuterol treatments may increase the amount of virus in the air if the person has COVID-19. This could potentially spread the virus to others more easily, since the virus may stay in air droplets for up to several hours. It's important for people with asthma to talk with their health care providers about what delivery method is best for them. Shortages of albuterol inhalers have been reported in some areas, and some insurances have not covered spacers. Best practices are probably going to be different based on location and a person's individual needs. Ask your pediatrician or asthma care provider what they recommend for your child. How can I help prevent my child from having an asthma attacks during the pandemic? Help your child follow their asthma management plan and take their as prescribed. Know when to step up care and when to call your pediatrician or asthma care provider. In addition, there are other steps you can take: People with asthma should avoid asthma triggers such as tobacco smoke. If a parent or caregiver , it is important to do it outside. Smoking in another room does not prevent the smoke from traveling. The 1-800-QUITNOW is a free nationwide number that helps people stop smoking. Many states provide free supplies such as nicotine replacement patches. Now is a great time to try quitting! Try to reduce exposure to known allergy , which can also aggravate asthma. For example, if a child with asthma is allergic to tree pollen, you might want to keep windows closed to reduce exposure. Cleaning is important to help reduce allergens, along with COVID-19 germs, but can be tricky for parents of children with asthma. If your child is sensitive to certain cleaning products, using them when your child is not in the room, turn on a fan, open a window, or try switching to less irritating products. Stress can be another trigger for asthma, and these are certainly stressful times. Take time to relax as a family, and use tips to help your child cope and build . Taking a walk (still staying physically distanced) and keeping active can help to reduce stress. ​ What other precautions can families take who have children with asthma during the COVID-19 pandemic? People with asthma should take extra care of their overall health. This includes physical distancing from people outside their households, isolating from people with symptoms, and avoiding asthma triggers. It's a good idea for people with asthma to make sure they have asthma medicines at home and to call for refills when the inhaler is getting close to empty. Many pharmacies will deliver medicine through the mail at no extra charge.​ Having a plan and communicating with your asthma provider can give you more information--and less reason to panic--during these stressful times. We can all agree that preparation beats panic every time when it comes to keeping loved ones safe and healthy!​ COVID-19: Information for Families of Children and Youth with Special Health Care Needs ​ (American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology)​​ Sylvia Owusu-Ansah, MD, MPH, FAAP, is a member of the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) Section on Emergency Medicine.

Few kids have been found to have the illness. So it's hard for experts to yet know how COVID-19 might affect kids with ongoing health problems. But asthma and COVID-19 both affect the lungs, and the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 is new. So far, kids with asthma aren't getting COVID-19 more often than people who don't have asthma. And kids with mild asthma don't seem to get sicker from COVID-19 than people without asthma. Experts are still learning if people with moderate to severe asthma might be more likely to get more serious symptoms if they are infected. To be safe and avoid infection, follow the advice from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and other health experts.

Few kids have been found to have the illness. So it's hard for experts to yet know how COVID-19 might affect kids with ongoing health problems. But asthma and COVID-19 both affect the lungs, and the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 is new. So far, kids with asthma aren't getting COVID-19 more often than people who don't have asthma. And kids with mild asthma don't seem to get sicker from COVID-19 than people without asthma. Experts are still learning if people with moderate to severe asthma might be more likely to get more serious symptoms if they are infected. To be safe and avoid infection, follow the advice from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and other health experts. Be sure to: Keep 6 feet apart from people you don't live with (called physical or ). Wear a when out and not able to distance from others. Should I Take My Child to Planned Health Care Visits? Talk to your health care provider. Many doctor's offices are scheduling in-person visits. Some appointments may be video visits (). If your child has an in-person visit, talk to the office about how they are keeping kids and families safe. The medical staff will be wearing masks. You and your child should wear them also. Reassure your child that these are safe and there's no reason to be scared. If your child is having an asthma flare-up that doesn't get better with treatment, get care as you would have done before the coronavirus pandemic. Hospitals and health care facilities are taking steps to protect patients and families. This may include separating sick and well people, wearing masks, and doing temperature checks. It is safe to get care if your child needs it. Yes. Keep giving all regular unless the care team tells you to stop.

First, call the health care team. They know your child's health history. The doctor will ask how your child is doing and if they've been around someone with known or suspected coronavirus. Your doctor's office will tell you what to do next and whether you need an in-person visit. Experts suggest using inhalers for someone who is sick instead of when possible during the COVID-19 crisis. That's because nebulizers create a mist. If someone has the coronavirus and uses a nebulizer, the mist could carry the virus to others. If your child uses a , talk to your care team about whether your child should switch to an inhaler. If your child can't use an inhaler, try not to have others in the room when using the nebulizer.

To help adults and children who have symptoms find out if they are at risk, allergists will conduct the 16th annual Nationwide Asthma Screening Program, expanding the program this year to include screening for nasal allergies. The American College of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology (ACAAI) offers more than 200 free asthma and nasal allergy screenings through the public service campaign which is supported by Teva Respiratory. The screenings help those experiencing nasal allergy and asthma-related symptoms such as coughing, wheezing, itchy eyes, shortness of breath and runny nose.

""The screening is quick, painless and free and now checks for three conditions that could affect your quality of life."" Allergists screen participants for:•Breathing difficulties that might be asthma•Nasal allergies, often called hay fever or allergic rhinitis•Exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (EIB), breathing problems that occur during or after exercise For those already diagnosed with any of the conditions, the screening provides the chance to ensure their condition is under control. ""Allergies and asthma are serious diseases and misdiagnosis and inappropriate treatment can have serious health consequences,"" said Dr. Winder. ""Board-certified allergists are the best-trained health professionals to perform allergy testing and treat allergic diseases effectively so that people with asthma, allergies or EIB can have a healthy lifestyle.""

5ebd3ba2-4128-49ca-8dd3-a8321129f52b,"Researchers explain why people with asthma have hard time dealing with respiratory viruses People with asthma often have a hard time dealing with respiratory viruses such as the flu or the common cold, and researchers have struggled to explain why. In a new study that compared people with and without asthma, the answer is becoming clearer. The researchers found no difference in the key immune response to viruses in the lungs and breathing passages. The work, at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, suggests that a fundamental antiviral defense mechanism is intact in asthma. This means that another aspect of the immune system must explain the difficulty people with asthma have when they encounter respiratory viruses. The study appears Sept. 9 in the . Among researchers who study asthma, there is debate over why patients with this common breathing disorder might have more trouble dealing with airway viruses than people without asthma. The debate has centered on the role of proteins called interferons, which are released by cells lining the airways and are so named because they ""interfere"" with an invading virus. ""One school of thought says there is a defect in interferon production - that patients with asthma don't produce enough interferon,"" said senior author Michael J. Holtzman, MD, the Selma and Herman Seldin Professor of Medicine. ""But we couldn't find any significant differences between the two groups. In fact, we were struck by how similar they were."" Holtzman and his colleagues looked at two common airway viruses - influenza A and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) - and the interferon response they triggered in airway cells sampled from 11 patients with mild to severe asthma and seven control participants without asthma. Though the study's sample size was small, the researchers performed an elaborate analysis that took into consideration the downstream events triggered by interferon release. ""Even though we showed both groups made similar amounts of interferon, we recognized that there might be a difference in effectiveness, a difference in how well it triggered downstream events necessary to fighting the virus,"" Holtzman said. Highly sensitive wearable sensor shows promise for cardiorespiratory monitoring Kruppel-like factor 2 may be a major determinant of acute respiratory distress syndrome in COVID-19 patients Study: Initial COVID-19 severity is not linked to later poor respiratory problems To find out whether the same amount of interferon might be less effective in patients with asthma, the investigators compared the genes activated by interferon in both groups of patients. ""The products of these genes are very effective in their antiviral action,"" Holtzman said. ""But on the other side, the virus has a lot of ways of getting around them. So it's a battlefield. Who will win out? The interferon-stimulated genes or the viral genes?"" Holtzman and his colleagues showed that even in this downstream activation of genes, asthma patients and those without the condition were remarkably similar. They also measured similar amounts of virus living in the cells at various points of time during the study, indicating that the battles against the viruses progressed similarly in both groups. ""Whatever is causing asthmatics and non-asthmatics to experience differences in how well they recover from these respiratory infections - why patients with asthma are more likely to end up in the hospital, for example - this interferon mechanism is not the deciding factor based on what we've seen so far,"" Holtzman said. Given the complexity of the immune system, there are many other possible culprits to investigate. Holtzman and his colleagues are continuing to research these possibilities in similar studies with larger sample sizes and in studies looking at different aspects of the immune system. One likely possibility that the group has proposed is that viruses have a special means to induce inflammatory airway disease, and the susceptibility to this process may be an essential feature of asthma and related lung diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

Nationally recognized expert in this area, explains and demonstrates how asthma sounds different than EILO/VCD.   Diesel Exhaust Can Predispose Unborn Babies to Asthma How Does Predisposition of Asthma Transfer from Mother to Child? What is Asthma and How Is it Diagnosed and Treated? Asthma is a condition where the lungs have restricted air flow because the airways are squeezing down.  It's different than exercise-induced laryngeal obstruction (EILO), which is up here. The throat is partially closing and it really restricts the air flow. People with asthma describe the experience as some chest tightness, some cough, some frustration. There's not exactly a distinct episode that changes on a second to second basis. Albuterol is the most commonly used agent on a minute to minute basis to deal with acute symptoms. If you take your inhaler properly with a spacer, it'll tend to work if exercise is the trigger for asthma. You see somebody who's suffering, who's embarrassed, who's breathing noisy. You see them stopping after a minute and 45 seconds, just unable to keep up with everybody else. We treat EILO with different breathing techniques. Our speech and language pathologists can teach different ways of breathing so that patients can keep their throat open when they're going as hard as they want.

Bronchial global health problem with increasing prevalence in many countries. House dust mite sensitization is present in up to 50 percent of patients with asthma, and exposure to HDM allergen has been related to asthma severity. The HDM SLIT tablet is a potential novel treatment option for HDM allergy-related asthma. In this study by J. Christian Virchow, M.D., of the University of Rostock, Germany, and coauthors, 834 adults with HDM allergy-related asthma not well controlled by ICS or combination products, and with HDM allergy-related rhinitis, were randomly assigned to once-daily treatment with placebo (n = 277) or HDM SLIT tablet (different dosage groups, n = 275 or n = 282) in addition to ICS and the short-acting beta2-agonist salbutamol. was assessed during the last 6 months of the trial when ICS was reduced by 50 percent for 3 months and then completely withdrawn for 3 months.

The researchers found that either dosage of the HDM SLIT tablet significantly reduced the risk of a moderate or severe asthma exacerbation compared with placebo. Compared with placebo, there was also an increase in allergen-specific immunoglobulin G4 (lgG4; an antibody). However, there was no significant difference for change in the asthma control questionnaire or asthma quality-of-life questionnaire for either dose. There were no reports of severe systemic allergic reactions. ""To our knowledge, this is the first controlled trial to show that adult patients with HDM allergy-related asthma who were not well controlled taking ICS can achieve an improvement in asthma control as measured by time to first asthma exacerbation with a sublingual tablet formulation of HDM allergen immunotherapy,"" the authors write.

This has made people with asthma wonder if they are more prone to severe complications of COVID-19. Read this article to know more. How to Prevent Asthmatic Attacks Over the Pandemic? What Happens When an Asthma Patient Experiences COVID-19 Symptoms? COVID-19 has been the scariest thing ever in this whole year of 2020. It has been proven to be more contagious, and positive cases are increasing day by day all over the world. It has been transmitted through the nasopharyngeal secretions of affected individuals, and it is a primary disease of the respiratory system in human beings. However, it also affects the gastrointestinal and nervous system, though the accurate pathophysiology has not been established yet. Also, it has proven that the primary target of COVID-19 is people with a low immune system. They are termed as the immunocompromised group of people. These immunocompromised people fall particularly into two age groups: The youngest human beings who are children less than 14 years. They still do not have a well established immune system. The other group is the elderly, who are 55, 60, and above. They have deteriorating immune systems. But, specific individuals who are not in these age groups have a low immune system due to the presence of severe diseases like HIV, cancer, etc. Asthma is not a life-threatening disease, but it is an easy situation in which infection can occur easily. This pandemic has made even healthy individuals fear for their health. But, people with other comorbid conditions, especially when it is a respiratory condition, could be even fatal. is one of the most common respiratory conditions, which causes dyspnea in the affected person. It causes difficulty in respiration. Asthma is usually caused due to several reasons. It might be transferred through families that fall under the genetic cause of the disease. It most commonly occurs due to an allergic trigger. It causes the immune system to start a hypersensitivity reaction. The allergic triggers might be dust, pollen grains, seasonal changes, mites, pets, and chemicals. When a hypersensitivity reaction is started, immune cells are released, and it someway causes the smooth muscle aided severe bronchoconstriction of the respiratory system. This will lead to symptoms like cough, wheezing, chest retractions, etc. The episodes of asthma are referred to as asthma attacks. Asthma attacks in any individual might be acute or even chronic, depending upon the occurrence. Immediate medical care and attention are often needed. However, in people who have recurrent episodes of asthma, patients are provided with handy inhalers to take puffs adequately as prophylaxis and for acute treatment of asthma under uncertain conditions. The medicines that are used in the treatment of asthma are short-acting and long-acting bronchodilators like Salbutamol, Salmeterol, corticosteroids also can be used in acutely severe cases. Nebulizers and intravenous Theophylline can also be used. In the case of co-infections, intravenous, and oral antibiotics can be given. Any comorbid health condition increases the risk of getting infected by a . As said earlier, if the comorbid condition is related to the respiratory system, the risk is actually doubled. There are no proven studies or research that state and proves that asthma increases the risk of infection. However, practicing doctors in this COVID-19 crisis suggest that a history of asthma in patients increases the risk of getting a severe form of the infection. Asthma is already a disease that limits respiration, and it can also aid in the development of co-infections. So, an asthmatic patient who gets acute or chronic attacks of asthma, when they come in contact with the coronavirus due to any reasons, can develop a co-infection with the virus. During the infected phase, if the patient gets an asthma attack, as we know, coronavirus already makes breathing a difficult task, asthma attack adds to the severity of the condition. So, the affected individual will experience severe difficulty in breathing, which might aggravate the disease. The established hypersensitivity reaction by the immune system might also interfere with the immune-mediated responses during the coronavirus infection. All the above factors might be a severe risk factor in an asthmatic patient during coronavirus infection. How to Prevent Asthmatic Attacks Over the Pandemic? Since everything about asthma and COVID-19 infection is still uncertain and not proven in any studies, the only easy and vital activity that a person with asthma history can do is prevent asthmatic attacks. Asthmatic attacks can be prevented by avoiding asthma triggers, reducing the amount of dust in the living area, limiting travel to dusty environments, when necessary a travel person should compulsorily wear masks. Regular intake of prophylactic asthmatic medicines like inhalers and most important medicines should be carried handily to prevent acute attacks of asthma. Avoiding or skipping a controller or prophylactic medication will lead to a situation called asthmatic exacerbation. Asthmatic exacerbation needs emergency medical care at the hospital, where the risk of being exposed to coronavirus is quite high. The regular practice of washing hands with soap is very mandatory and the most basic one. People with asthma, who work in office environments where washing hands often is not possible should carry a pocket hand sanitizer and disinfect their hands at regular intervals. Contact surfaces at the homes of asthmatics should also be regularly cleaned. Above all, smoking is a risk factor to both asthmas as well as COVID-19. Thus it is essential to quit smoking during this pandemic, especially asthmatics. There are a few common symptoms in both COVID 19 and asthma. The common symptoms are cough, difficulty breathing, and fever. However, a patient who has recurrent asthma attacks can recognize the difference between an asthmatic attack and any other common flu-like symptoms easily. The main symptom that distinguishes asthma from COVID-19 is wheezing. Wheezing does not occur more commonly in coronavirus infection. Because COVID-19 presents commonly with flu-like symptoms that are sore throat, cough, fever, , fatigue, it might also present digestive symptoms like diarrhea that are not usually significant with asthmatic attacks. What Happens When an Asthma Patient Experiences COVID-19 Symptoms? When an asthmatic patient experiences COVID-19 like symptoms, the first step the patient has to do is self-isolate himself or herself from the rest of the family members. Next, if the person should consult with a doctor regularly, or if the person has a family doctor who knows the patient’s history thoroughly well, the patient can contact the doctor and explain the symptoms experienced by the patient and seek medical advice and follow accordingly. If the symptoms feel more like an asthma attack, short-acting bronchodilators like inhalers can be taken, and corticosteroids can also be tried if the doctor advises so. If there is acute asthma exacerbation like symptoms along with flu-like symptoms, immediate treatment or management at the hospital might be needed. Something even more important than that is the patient or the family members accompanying the patient to the hospital is responsible for providing an adequate history of the person’s comorbid conditions, especially the history of asthma, and the treatment history must be informed to the hospital. Thus, this is how patients with a history of acute or chronic asthma can prevent, protect, and manage themselves during this coronavirus pandemic.

10858ade-9704-44f5-bcda-f81a80ed74ee,"Asthma is a chronic respiratory disease involving inflammation and narrowing of the airways that is one of the major non-communicable diseases worldwide. There are more than 300 million individuals that currently suffer from the disease and the prevalence continues to grow with each year, particularly in low and middle-income countries. Individuals of any age can suffer from asthma, but symptoms of the disease are most common in children. The prevalence of asthma varies widely in different regions of the world due to distinct genetic, environmental and occupational risk factors. However, this disparity appears to be closing as the prevalence in high-income countries is reaching a plateau whereas the prevalence in low and middle-income countries continues to rise. Worldwide, it is estimated that approximately 334 million people currently suffer from asthma, and 250,000 deaths are attributed to the disease each year. The prevalence of the disease is continuing to grow, and the overall prevalence is estimated to increase by 100 million by 2025. Some individuals are predisposed to developing asthma with a strong family history of the disease. Exposure to inhaled substances and particles that provoke an irritation or allergic reaction in the airways is a significant risk factor for the disease. Irritants may include dust, pollen, mould, smoke, chemical or pollution. Other triggers that can promote the presentation of asthma symptoms include cold air, anger, fear and physical exercise. Additionally, some medications such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and beta blockers can trigger symptoms. Asthma has a comparably low mortality rate when contrasted with other chronic diseases. Most deaths associated with asthma occur in low and lower-middle income countries. Poor control of asthma has been linked to inadequate access to medication used in the management of the condition.

Patient education to increase knowledge about the triggers for asthma so that they can be avoided is the first step to reducing the disease burden. Medications used to relieve symptoms or control inflammation and prevent exacerbation both have a role to play in managing asthma and improving overall outcomes of the disease. In the United Kingdom, there are 5.4 million people that currently rely on treatment to manage symptoms of asthma, with 1 in 12 adults affected and 1 in 11 children. This places the UK among countries with the highest rates of prevalence of asthma in Europe. In 2014, there were 1216 deaths in the United Kingdom associated with asthma. Each year, it is estimated that the NHS spends approximately 1 billion pounds for the treatment and care of patients with the disease. The prevalence of asthma in the United States is on the rise with 1 in 12 adults, approximately 25 million individuals countrywide, affected by the condition in 2009 (in comparison to 1 in 14 in 2001). Of those, more than half had an asthma attack in the previous year and the disease proved to be fatal for 185 children and 3262 adults in the year 2007. Financial burden of asthma in the US is estimated to be approximately $3,300 per patient with asthma per year, including all medical expenses, absences from work or school and early fatalities. https://www.globalasthmareport.org/burden/burden.php https://www.asthma.org.uk/about/media/facts-and-statistics/ https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2764772/ https://www.aaaai.org/about-the-aaaai/newsroom/asthma-statistics.aspx https://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs307/en/ Last Updated: Feb 26, 2019 Yolanda graduated with a Bachelor of Pharmacy at the University of South Australia and has experience working in both Australia and Italy.

622b2ec9-f553-43e4-a207-8ec8db0860b3,"Asthma and allergies are both very common health conditions that affect approximately 10% and 15% of the population in the United States respectively. Additionally, it is estimated that 70% of individuals with asthma also suffer from allergies, suggesting that there may be a link in the pathology of the two conditions. Allergic asthma is a type of asthma that is provoked by exposure to certain allergens, such as pollen, dust, mould and animals. There are several similarities in the way asthma and allergies should be treated. Image Copyright: bubutu, Image ID: 332159408 via Shutterstock There appears to be a genetic relationship between allergies and the development of asthma, as a familial susceptibility is evident. If one or both parents suffer from allergies, there is an increased risk that any children will suffer from allergies. Stemming from this, individuals with allergies are more likely to develop asthma than the general population. For this reason, it is worthwhile to be aware of family history of both allergies and asthma, to help in the diagnosis and management of both of these conditions. ACAAI releases guidance related to risk of allergic reactions to Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine Children with asthma having fewer attacks amid the coronavirus pandemic, study says Study discusses steep drop off from asthma-related ED visits during spring 2020 COVID-19 Allergic asthma is a type of asthma that involves asthma symptoms that are induced by the presence of allergens, commonly referred to as triggers. These allergens cause the immune system to respond by releasing immunoglobulin E (IgE) to the area, which leads to inflammation and swelling in the lungs. The airways can become narrower as a result and make it difficult for the individual to breathe normally. There are several triggers that are known to provoke an allergic reaction and worsen symptoms of asthma in affected individuals. These include: Pollen: the airborne particles that come from trees, grasses and weeds outside Dust mites: the feces and body parts of the tiny dust mites found in fabric-based items (e.g. mattresses, pillows, carpets, clothes, stuffed toys) Mould: the airborne spores produced by moulds found inside or outside where moisture is present Pets: the urine, feces, saliva, hair or dander of pets Cockroaches: the feces, saliva and body parts of the insects It is important that people that suffer from allergic asthma are aware of these triggers, particularly any that they have noted have an effect on their symptoms. There are several beneficial management techniques that can offer a benefit for individuals suffering from asthma or allergies or both. In particular, it is important to identify and limit exposure to triggers that are linked to worsening of symptoms for individuals with allergic asthma. There are also some similarities in the symptomatic treatment, as both conditions are marked by inflammation that needs to be controlled to relieve symptoms. For example, montelukast is a medication that is used to control the immune system response during an allergic reaction. This can be taken daily to reduce the occurrence of symptoms of both allergies and asthma. Immunotherapy is an alternative option to reduce the associated inflammation and response to triggers. This is a more complex process, involving regular injections over an extended time period with a small concentration of allergens to increase tolerance and reduce symptoms. http://www.aaaai.org/about-the-aaaai/newsroom/asthma-statistics.aspx http://www.healthline.com/health/allergies/allergy-induced-asthma#1 Last Updated: Aug 23, 2018 Yolanda graduated with a Bachelor of Pharmacy at the University of South Australia and has experience working in both Australia and Italy.

Children with asthma may have airways that are chronically inflamed (swollen). Therefore, the airways are sensitive to things that make asthma worse. Things that make asthma worse are often called asthma triggers. These asthma triggers, either singly or together, cause symptoms in children with asthma. Identifying and controlling or treating things that make asthma worse are essential to good asthma management. Examples of irritants include smoke, aerosol sprays, strong odors, dust and air pollution. Examples allergens include pollens, mold spores, animal dander from feathered or furry animals, dust mites and cockroaches. The things that make asthma worse often vary from child to child. Controlling and/or treating multiple things that make asthma worse are often needed. Avoidance of just one is often not enough.

0ffb53de-e29b-449f-9c0c-52846844f503,"Monitoring the signs and symptoms of asthma on a regular basis will help keep the condition under control. A few tools available for effective monitoring of asthma are discussed below. Health care providers normally draw an action plan for asthma patients. The action plan outlines what to look out for during physical activity, what can be classified as controlled and uncontrolled asthma, and how to handle any sudden asthma attacks. Such a plan is very useful for people with asthma to make decisions regarding treatments based on the kind of symptoms experienced. Based on the severity of asthma in different patients, doctors may recommend use of a self-monitoring device called the peak flow meter. This device helps monitor the change in asthma-related signs and symptoms during the day or over a period of time. A peak flow meter is a hand-held device that estimates the peak expiratory flow rate. This flow rate is a measure of how fast one can exhale air from your lungs, after a deep inhalation, which demonstrates how well air is moving through the airways. If asthma-related bronchoconstriction is present, peak flow levels will be low. Peak flow measurements at regular intervals help in estimating the level of control of asthma. Usually, 3 peak flow measurements are made and the best reading is recorded. Measurements can be done before and after reliever drug inhalation. Measurements are recorded once or twice every day to monitor changes in peak flow during the day or over a period of time. A decrease in peak flow measurement over time may indicate worsening of asthma and an increase in peak flow measurement may show increased control of asthma or a response to controller medications inhaled. Based on the results of peak flow measurements, patients can go back and refer to their asthma action plan and take appropriate action. Health care providers review peak flow measurements at regular intervals and make adjustments to the asthma action plan. COVID-19 pandemic drives asthma patients to use telemedicine ACAAI releases guidance related to risk of allergic reactions to Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine Wildfire smoke more harmful than other types of air pollution for people with asthma Keeping a diary to note down asthma-related details or progress is helpful to keep track of: Use of different medications, their timings and frequency The allergens or activities that trigger asthma from time to time. Such a systematic record can be very crucial in asthma management and help doctors adjust treatment plans over time. Some of the signs that indicate asthma may be getting worse are as follows: Symptoms occur mostly at night, affecting quality of sleep. Asthma starts interfering with normal day-to-day activities Increased use of quick-relief inhaler; more than twice a week Any of the above signs would mean that the patient needs to see their doctor, who will take stock of the situation and adjust medications and treatment plans to control asthma. Ongoing monitoring of children with asthma is crucial. Thiswill need a careful review of the impact of asthma on the child's day to day activities, such as play or sports. Face-to-face follow-up and standardized questionnaires such as the Asthma Control Questionnaire helps track asthma symptoms and has been found to be effective in the case of children. Parents should keep track of symptoms and notify the child’s physician in case of changes in mood or behavior post administering medications. https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health-pro/resources/lung/naci/discover/asthma-control.htm http://www.asthma.ca/adults/control/howToMonitor.php Last Updated: Feb 26, 2019 Susha has a Bachelor of Science (B.Sc.) degree in Chemistry and Master of Science (M.Sc) degree in Biochemistry from the University of Calicut, India.

Here’s How to Manage Asthma If You Usually Rely on the E.R. for Care Here’s How to Manage Asthma If You Usually Rely on the E.R. for Care Chronic conditions don’t stop for a global health crisis. If you have but don’t have reliable medical treatment, trying to manage asthma during the pandemic can be especially worrying, particularly if you normally go to the emergency room when dealing with a flare-up of like intense . You might worry that you now have nowhere to turn since many are nearly buckling from the influx of coronavirus patients. You may also be scared that going to the emergency room for an asthma attack could increase your risk of getting COVID-19 (the coronavirus disease), especially if you’ve heard that having asthma can make you more vulnerable to severe COVID-19 complications. All of these worries are more than understandable, and experts want you to know that even with the current state of things, you shouldn’t hesitate to seek care for an asthma emergency. Keep reading to learn more about how having asthma might influence your chances of getting the (and severe complications), plus how to manage your asthma if you’d normally go to the emergency room when you need help. Far too many people have to rely on emergency care for their asthma. Asthma is often manageable if you have access to the right medications and use them as your doctor advises, according to the (CDC). There are two types of medications that can help here: daily long-term control medications that mitigate the impact of the disease (so you have fewer and milder asthma attacks), and quick-relief “rescue” medicines used to control an asthma attack. But tons of people aren’t able to afford those medications or the insurance that would help cover them. In a five-year survey covering 19 states and Washington, D.C., the found that 48.9% of people with asthma aged 18 to 64 with no insurance or with insurance that only covered part of the year said that they faced cost barriers in managing their asthma. (The study results represented five-year averages.) That included being unable to afford medications or to see a specialist or primary care physician. This interplay helps explain why asthma disproportionately affects , who can have a harder time accessing this kind of care because of various deeply embedded systemic inequities, and why we’re starting to see that COVID-19 is disproportionately impacting black people as well. In the survey, the percentages of adults with asthma who had partial or no insurance ranged from 3.3% in Washington, D.C., to 22.2% in Texas. But even 13.3% of people in that age range insurance for the whole year faced cost barriers that got in the way of managing their asthma. In short, way too many people are having trouble getting preventive asthma care, which can make emergency care necessary. “These are not like regular checkup appointments. Usually, these are acute episodes that trigger someone to go to the E.R.,” Melody Goodman, Ph.D., associate professor of biostatistics at NYU School of Public Global Health, whose research examines the ways social risk factors lead to disparities in health care in urban areas, tells SELF. Under the 1986 Emergency Medical Treatment & Labor Act (EMTALA), any hospital that participates in Medicare and has an emergency room must stabilize patients deemed to have an emergency medical condition, regardless of whether the patient can afford it. Fears of high costs can lead people with asthma to hold off from seeking emergency care until the situation is truly dire. Asthma symptoms like , wheezing, and happen when something triggers the airways in your lungs to become inflamed. This prompts them to constrict, swell up, and produce extra mucus, according to the (NHLBI). All sorts of things can kickstart this scary chain reaction, including viral respiratory illnesses like the cold and flu. Researchers are still gathering data on COVID-19, and right now it’s unclear exactly how it affects people with asthma specifically. But experts think it makes sense that the coronavirus could trigger asthma symptoms the way other viral respiratory illnesses do. And the advises that people with moderate to severe asthma may be more at risk of experiencing severe symptoms from COVID-19. Some of the symptoms of an asthma attack and COVID-19 are similar, notably and . “But with viral infections, you also often get other symptoms, like a fever and aches and pains, and sometimes gastrointestinal problems like diarrhea, which don’t come with asthma,” R. Sharon Chinthrajah, M.D., a clinical associate professor at Stanford University and director of the Clinical Translational Research Unit at the university’s Sean N. Parker Center for Allergy & Asthma Research, tells SELF. You can read more about the potential relationship between asthma and COVID-19 here. While we wait for experts to uncover more information in that realm, it’s a good idea to learn how to handle your asthma while many with the COVID-19 crisis. First, see if you can get a prescription for asthma medication. The most effective way for people with asthma to avoid the is by managing the condition with medication so it doesn’t escalate to emergency status. Experts are even recommending stocking up on a three-month supply if you can. Even if it’s hard for you to get affordable asthma medication in normal times, it may be somewhat more accessible during the pandemic. “Health care professionals are doing their best right now to help make essential medications more accessible so we can keep people out of the E.R.,” Dr. Chinthrajah says. As Dr. Chinthrajah points out, in early April, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to help make this in-demand medication easier for people to get. So the first thing you need is a prescription for asthma medication. You may be able to get one online. The telemedicine service has waived its fees for people who need prescriptions in hard-hit COVID-19 areas like California, Connecticut, New York, Pennsylvania, and Washington State. Alternatively, “if you have a relationship with a physician, most physicians will give you prescriptions over the phone right now,” Lauren Cohn, M.D., associate professor of pulmonary medicine at Yale School of Medicine and co-director of the Yale Center for Asthma and Airway Diseases, tells SELF. So if you’ve been to a —even if it was years ago—call them and see if they can help, or even a different kind of doctor you’ve seen recently. If you don’t have a primary care doctor, try contacting the safety net hospital where you’ve received emergency care for your asthma, Dr. Chinthrajah says. Goodman also recommends contacting other resources like but points out that many of these have had to close because of the pandemic. You could also try calling a local pharmacy. Dr. Cohn explains that many pharmacists are more likely to refill a past prescription for asthma medication during the pandemic, or at least coordinate with a doctor’s office to make it happen. “Everything is very different right now,” she says. See if there are any ways to make your medication cheaper. Once you have a prescription, Dr. Chinthrajah recommends looking up assistance programs that help the uninsured and underinsured. The Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America lists examples , including toll-free numbers to call. “I know it’s hard, and you might spend hours on the phone, but it is worth it,” she says. “You can also compare drug prices on sites like and —those are just two examples. Often there are coupons that can make the drugs cheaper.” Another website to try is the online pharmacy , which tries to sell medication at close-to-wholesale prices and, as a result, doesn’t accept insurance. Many hospitals also offer ways to get subsidized medications through their pharmacies, Dr. Cohn says. Once you have the medication (hopefully at a manageable price), the advises that you take it exactly as prescribed. That includes not substituting long-term medication for rescue medication, or vice versa. If you don’t have an asthma action plan, create one. Since you’ll be talking to a health care professional about your medications, it’s also a great time to discuss an asthma action plan. As the explains, an asthma action plan is typically divided into three sections depending on how bad your asthma is flaring with instructions on what to do in each scenario, like how much of which medication you should take. on how to create an asthma action plan. Dr. Chinthrajah adds that it’s also important to monitor your asthma especially closely right now so you can tell if your symptoms are getting worse. “We need patients to become their own asthma detectives,” she says. For example, if you know that it normally takes you a couple of minutes to get your breath back after walking up the stairs and are noticing that it’s taking longer to recover than usual, your asthma symptoms may be getting worse, in which case you should follow your action plan. Try to be really diligent about reducing your risk of getting COVID-19. All of the above means it’s extra important to avoid contracting COVID-19 if you have asthma (or any other condition that may increase your risk of more serious COVID-19 issues). The recommends whenever possible, from other people if you do have to go out, with soap and water regularly for at least 20 seconds, and frequently. You should also wear a if you have to leave your home and will be in places where it’s hard to maintain that six-foot distance. With all of that said, the main way to avoid contracting COVID-19—staying at home—is a lot easier said than done for many people. “I don't want to tell people, ‘just stay home,’” Goodman says. “I completely understand the need to earn a paycheck and the fact that the government benefits are not coming fast enough.” This can especially be a problem for people using emergency care to manage asthma or other conditions because of a lack of insurance. An unfortunate and frankly unconscionable truth of this country is that being uninsured is often closely linked with having a lower income. If you need to physically go to work right now to be able to afford basic necessities in order to live, staying home isn’t really an option. Beyond that, one in three uninsured people works in the service industry, according to , which employees in health care and social assistance, utilities, transportation, warehouses, and food preparation. Many of these jobs have been deemed during the pandemic and can’t be done from home, which might put you on the front lines of this crisis. Black people are also , , and , all of which contribute to the extra asthma and COVID-19 burdens we’re seeing. No matter if you’re able to shelter in place or if you can’t stay home because you work an essential job or need the money (or both), Goodman recommends doing your best to eliminate common asthma . These include dust mites, cockroaches and their droppings, pet dander, and mold, the says. Staying inside if you can also keeps you away from , another very common trigger. Additionally, when it comes time to clean your space, have someone in your household who doesn’t have asthma handle that task if possible. This can help protect you from asthma triggers in multiple ways; not only will you not be doing things like dusting that stir up allergens like dust mites, but you also won’t be as up close and personal with cleaning products that might irritate your respiratory system. If you do have to clean, for doing it with as little airway irritation as possible. for other changes you can make at home to better control your asthma, too. Still go to the E.R. if you’re having an asthma attack. As much as going to the emergency room right now is a scary prospect, if you are having an asthma attack and can’t breathe, it’s essential that you do go. “If your asthma is flaring and you don't have what you need and you're short of breath, you need to go to the emergency room,” Dr. Cohn emphasizes. And , although the coronavirus is front of mind, health care staff at emergency rooms are making it a priority to figure out how to treat patients with without COVID-19 while keeping everyone as safe as possible. You can and should still go to the E.R. for a non-coronavirus emergency that’s possibly life-threatening. If you didn’t have enough resources to manage your asthma before COVID-19 hit, coming up with a plan now will unfortunately take persistence. But many health care professionals are trying to help. And Goodman hopes that in the long term, the pandemic will make more people recognize that the U.S. health care system has let down financially vulnerable people with chronic diseases. “Hopefully, as a society, we start thinking about the health of everyone in this country,” she says—particularly those who are most vulnerable.

7a322db4-1317-4dff-bf2e-1f57f680c8c2,"The precise cause of asthma isn’t entirely clear. However, there are a number of environmental and inherited factors that are thought to be involved in causing the condition. Additionally, there are also triggers for asthma that are known to induce or worsen symptoms of asthma in individuals who are known to suffer from the condition. The triggers for asthma are allergens and can differ for each individual with asthma. Although the exact cause is not known, the following risk factors are associated with an increased likelihood of developing the condition: Personal medical history of bronchiolitis, eczema, or allergies (e.g., hayfever) Premature birth, particularly if a ventilator was required to assist breathing following birth Exposure to second-hand cigarette smoke (particularly for children) There are some other health conditions that may be linked to asthma, such as eczema and allergies (e.g., hayfever). Individuals with one of these conditions are more likely to be affected by another one and the pathology and cause of the conditions may also be associated. There is also a genetic link to asthma, as individuals with parents who have asthma are more likely to be affected by the condition. However, genetics does not appear to be the sole cause, as individuals with no family history of asthma are often diagnosed with the condition, and environmental factors also play a role. Wildfire smoke more harmful than other types of air pollution for people with asthma Higher consumption of meat linked with increased wheezing in children Study discusses steep drop off from asthma-related ED visits during spring 2020 COVID-19 The incidence of individuals diagnosed with asthma appears to be on the rise, which brings us to the question why people are more likely to have asthma today and what is causing it. There are several possible explanations, such as the changes in lifestyle that have occurred in recent decades, particularly in terms of housing, diet, and hygiene standards. The hygiene hypothesis is a theory based on the stark changes in the hygiene and sanitation standard adopted in modern Western lifestyle. The high levels of sanitation are proposed to have resulted in a dramatic decline in exposure to organisms and infections in early childhood. This may have an effect on the development of the immune system and result in an increased risk for asthma. Additionally, the levels of air pollution have risen in many areas in recent times, which may cause increased exposure to irritants and risk of acquiring asthma. Triggers for asthma that can worsen the condition include: Indoor allergens such as dust mites, mold, and pet dander Outdoor allergens such as pollen from grass and trees Air pollutant and irritants (e.g., smoke or fumes) Medications (e.g., beta blockers or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS)) Medical conditions (e.g. gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) It is important for people who have been diagnosed with asthma to avoid or reduce exposure to these triggers where possible. This should help to reduce the severity of their symptoms and improve their quality of life. http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/asthma/basics/causes/con-20026992 http://www.aafa.org/page/asthma-triggers-causes.aspx https://www.asthma.org.uk/advice/understanding-asthma/causes/ http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Asthma/Pages/Causes.aspx https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/asthma/causes Last Updated: Feb 26, 2019 Yolanda graduated with a Bachelor of Pharmacy at the University of South Australia and has experience working in both Australia and Italy.

00f593e3-f723-4557-ab63-fb25c075057e,"Asthma is a condition that affects the bronchial tubes or the airways.  In normal breathing, air travels through the nose or mouth to the windpipe or trachea and from there to the airways and lungs, and then finally back. In people with asthma, breathing is not always that easy, as they have inflamed airways which produce thick mucus. Inflamed airways are highly sensitive to smoke, dust and other allergens, which can cause muscles around the airways to tighten up, further narrowing the airways and making breathing harder. When an asthma flare-up or an asthma attack happens, people often find it very hard to breathe in and breathe out. An asthma attack can last for a few minutes to several hours, if not attended to promptly. Between attacks, breathing can be totally normal in asthma patients, though some may have shortness of breath or a cough. There are some early warning signs of an asthma attack which help prepare for or prevent an upcoming episode of asthma. These signs include: Some people also experience scratchy or sore throat and itchy or watery eyes. A drop in the peak flow number can also mean that asthma is getting worse. If you notice any of these symptoms, refer back to your asthma action plan and take appropriate measures before the actual warning signs of an asthma attack occur. Although the warning signs of an asthma flare-up can vary in different people, there are some basic warning signs that people can look out for. They include the following steps: Breathing becomes harder and slightly faster than normal breathing. Gradually, breathing difficulty makes it difficult to speak a complete sentence without pauses. Slowly, wheezing and a cough develops, followed by a feeling of chest tightness, which becomes severe as time passes. Rapid increase in pulse occurs next, followed by profuse sweating. ACAAI releases guidance related to risk of allergic reactions to Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine Study elucidates mechanisms behind protective farm effect on childhood asthma Prescribing treatments according to genetic differences could benefit children with asthma Emergency asthma signs indicate that the attack is severe and needs immediate medical intervention. Breathing becomes so difficult that it interferes with normal talking and walking Fingers and lips begin to turn blue due to oxygen deprivation These signs indicate a serious medical emergency and should not be overlooked. If you or your child experience any of these symptoms, call your emergency medical service provider immediately. Mild asthma attacks are common among asthma patients. In such cases, the airways open up in a few minutes post treatment and the patient just needs to rest and relax. However, recognition of these symptoms is crucial in order to prevent severe asthma episodes and to control asthma effectively. Severe asthma attacks usually last longer and need immediate medical attention. This is where the asthma action plan outlined by your doctor is helpful in managing astham. Look out for the steps to be followed for the kind of symptoms experienced. In the case lf a drop in your peak flow number, the patient should refer to their action plan and adjust medication based on the plan outlined. If it is not clear, they should talk to thier physician right away. Whenever there are any of the signs or symptoms of worsening asthma, the plan should be followed carefully as it can be a life-saver. https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/patientinstructions/000062.htm http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/asthma-attack/basics/symptoms/con-20034148 Last Updated: Feb 26, 2019 Susha has a Bachelor of Science (B.Sc.) degree in Chemistry and Master of Science (M.Sc) degree in Biochemistry from the University of Calicut, India.

What is Asthma and How Is it Diagnosed and Treated? Whether it's hiking, cycling, or another activity, Laura Armijo exercises every day. In her 40s, she had to add something new to her workout: an inhaler. To her surprise, she had developed as an adult. ""Sometimes that persistent cough is a sign of asthma."" Laura is one of more than 17 million adults with asthma, one of the most common chronic respiratory diseases in the U.S. and doctors believe many more have this condition but don't realize it. According to a new survey by National Jewish Health, most people know that wheezing and shortness of breath are symptoms of asthma. But barely half know that trouble sleeping is a sign of adult-onset asthma and only slightly more know that chest pain and persistent cough are symptoms. ""A lot of people are running around with asthma and don't know it."" says that 1 in every 200 adults are newly diagnosed with asthma every year and while children with this disease might have more common symptoms, adults who develop asthma typically have some of the less recognized symptoms. ""It's probably more than half the time that they don't have the traditional symptoms; they don't have all of the symptoms so it's not as straightforward.

It is a growing health problem in the United States, with approximately 25 million people affected. In the past 20 years, the number of children with asthma has increased markedly, and it is now the leading serious chronic illness in children. Unfortunately, approximately 75% of children with asthma continue to have chronic problems in adulthood. The total deaths annually from asthma have increased by over 100% since 1979 in the United States. Asthma is a disease of the airways characterized by airway inflammation and hyperreactivity (increased responsiveness to a wide variety of triggers). Hyperreactivity leads to airway obstruction due to acute onset of muscle spasm in the smooth muscle of the tracheobronchial tree, thereby leading to a narrowed lumen. In addition to muscle spasm, there is swelling of the mucosa, which leads to edema. Although asthma can result from infections (especially viral) and inhaled irritants, it often is the result of an allergic response. An allergen (antigen) is introduced to the body, and sensitizing antibodies such as immunoglobulin E (IgE) are formed. IgE antibodies bind to tissue mast cells and basophils in the mucosa of the bronchioles, lung tissue, and nasopharynx. An antigen-antibody reaction releases primary mediator substances such as histamine, slow-reacting substance of anaphylaxis (SRS-A), and others. These mediators cause contraction of the smooth muscle and tissue edema. In addition, goblet cells secrete a thick mucus into the airways that causes obstruction. Intrinsic asthma results from all other causes except allergies, such as infections (especially viral), inhaled irritants, and other causes or etiologies. The parasympathetic nervous system becomes stimulated, which increases bronchomotor tone, resulting in bronchoconstriction. In asthma, the total lung capacity (TLC), functional residual capacity (FRC), and residual volume (RV) increase, but the hallmark of airway obstruction is a reduction in ratio of the forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) to the forced vital capacity (FVC). Complications include pneumonia, atelectasis, respiratory failure with hypoxemia, and status asthmaticus (severe and refractory asthma). The classification for asthma is described in . Less than twice a week: Cough, wheeze, chest tightness, difficulty breathing Brief flare-ups with varying intensity; no symptoms between flare-ups Lung function tests: FEV1 ≥ 80% normal values; peak flow < 20% variability a.m. to a.m. or a.m. to p.m., day to day Three to six times a week: Cough, wheeze, chest tightness, difficulty breathing Lung function tests: FEV1 ≥ 80% normal values; peak flow < 20%–30% variability a.m. to a.m. or a.m. to p.m., day to day Daily: Cough, wheeze, chest tightness, difficulty breathing Lung function tests: FEV1 > 60% but < 80% normal values; peak flow > 30% variability a.m. to a.m. or a.m. to p.m., day to day Continual: Cough, wheeze, chest tightness, difficulty breathing Lung function tests: FEV1 ≤ 60% normal values; peak flow > 30% variability a.m. to a.m. or a.m. to p.m., day to day The main triggers for asthma are allergies, viral infections, autonomic nervous system imbalances that can cause an increase in parasympathetic stimulation, medications, psychological factors, and exercise. Of asthmatic conditions in patients under 30 years old, 70% are caused by allergies. Three major indoor allergens are dust mites, cockroaches, and cats. In older patients, the cause is almost always nonallergic types of irritants, such as smog. Heredity plays a part in about one-third of the cases. The genetic contributions to the development of asthma have been estimated at between 30% and 50% for various asthma phenotypes and up to 70% for overall IgE levels in plasma. Familial factors thus far appear to be autosomal dominant. There are at least 11 candidate genes that contribute to asthma susceptibility. These include , , , , , , , , , , and . Although the incidence of asthma is estimated at 5% to 10% in the general population, children have a higher incidence of 12%. Children make up one-third of the people with asthma; in the United States, 7 million children are affected, and trends suggest an increasing incidence of asthma in children under the age of 6 years. Asthma is diagnosed more frequently in males under 14 years and over 45 years of age and in females between the ages of 15 and 45. Black/African American children have higher morbidity and mortality rates than white children. Most experts agree that environmental factors play a more important role in asthma etiology than do genetic factors. Approximately 80% to 85% of childhood asthma episodes are associated with a prior exposure to a virus. Asthma prevalence varies widely across many nations, with a range from 1% to over 30% in children. Approximately 300 million people globally have asthma, and the prevalence increases by 50% every 10 years. Prevalence is high in developed countries in North America, Europe, and Australia and is increasing in developing countries as they become more industrialized. Examples include increases in South Africa, Eastern Europe, and the Baltic States. The greatest increases are seen in children. The more urbanization and affluence in a nation, the higher the prevalence. Because patients (especially children) with asthma have a history of allergies, obtain a thorough description of the response to allergens or other irritants. The patient may describe a sudden onset of symptoms after exposure, with a sense of suffocation. Symptoms include dyspnea, wheezing, and a cough (either dry or productive) and also chest tightness, restlessness, anxiety, and a prolonged expiratory phase. Ask if the patient has experienced a recent viral infection. Determine the speed of onset of symptoms, the number of asthma attacks in the past year, and the number of emergency department visits and hospitalizations from asthma in the past year. Children with an impending asthma attack may have been vomiting because of the tendency to swallow coughed up mucus rather than expectorating it. The most common symptoms are , , , and . The patient with an acute attack of asthma appears ill, with shortness of breath so severe that he or she can hardly speak. In acute airway obstruction, patients use their accessory muscles for breathing and are often profoundly diaphoretic. Some patients have an increased anteroposterior thoracic diameter. Children with asthma often prefer standing or sitting leaning forward to ease breathing. As airway obstruction becomes more serious, children may develop sternocleidomastoid contractions that indicate an increased expiratory effort, supraclavicular contractions that indicate an increased expiratory effort, and nasal flaring. If the patient has marked color changes such as pallor or cyanosis or becomes confused, restless, or lethargic, respiratory failure may be on the horizon. Percussion of the lungs usually produces hyperresonance, and palpation may reveal vocal fremitus. Auscultation reveals high-pitched inspiratory and expiratory wheezes, but with a major airway obstruction, breath sounds may be diminished. As the obstruction improves, breath sounds may actually worsen as they can be auscultated throughout the lung fields. During the most severe attacks of asthma, wheezing may be absent because of severe reduction of airflow, or its absence. Usually, the patient also has a prolonged expiratory phase of respiration. A rapid heart rate, mild systolic hypertension, and a paradoxic pulse may also be present. The emergency situation and an unfamiliar environment can aggravate the symptoms of the disease, especially if this is the patient's first experience with the condition. If the patient is a child and the parent is anxious, the child's level of anxiety increases and the attack may worsen. FVC: Maximum volume of air that can be forcefully expired after a maximal lung inspiration FEV1: Volume of air expired in 1 second from the beginning of the FVC maneuverAirway obstruction decreases flow rates; hospitalization is recommended if FVC is less than 1 L; FEV1/FVC should be 80% normally, but in asthma, it decreases to as low as 25% Forced expiratory flow (FEF): Maximal flow rate attained during the middle (25%–75%) of FVC maneuver RV: Volume of air remaining in lungs at end of a maximal expirationIncreased RV indicates obstruction; may remain increased for up to 3 weeks after the attack FRC: Volume of air remaining in lungs at end of a resting tidal volume Chest x-ray, high-resolution computed tomography (for chronic symptoms), skin testing, pulse oximetry, arterial blood gases, ECG, serum IgE. Peak expiratory flow rates (maximal flow rate attained during the FVC maneuver; decreased from baseline during periods of obstruction) may be used at home daily for patients who require daily medications. Ineffective airway clearance related to obstruction from narrowed lumen and thick mucus as evidenced by shortness of breath, wheezing, and/or chest tightness Respiratory status: Gas exchange; Respiratory status: Ventilation; Symptom control behavior; Treatment behavior: Illness or injury; Comfort level Airway management; Anxiety reduction; Oxygen therapy; Airway suctioning; Airway insertion and stabilization; Cough enhancement; Mechanical ventilation; Positioning; Respiratory monitoring For all but the most seriously ill patients, the primary goal is to prevent symptoms and reduce adverse events when acute episodes occur. Airway obstruction is generally managed with quick relief medications such as short-acting bronchodilators, systemic corticosteroids, and ipratropium (Atrovent). During severe exacerbations, patients may require IV fluid replacement. Unless contraindicated by a cardiac problem, 3,000 to 4,000 mL/day of fluid is usually administered intravenously, which helps loosen secretions and facilitates expectoration of the secretions. Low-flow oxygen therapy based on arterial blood gas results is often administered to treat hypoxemia. For the patient with increasing airway obstruction, endotracheal intubation and perhaps mechanical ventilation may be needed to maintain adequate airway and breathing. Close follow-up is needed when patients are discharged from the hospital because airway hyperactivity usually persists for 4 to 6 weeks after the event. To prevent symptoms, long-term control medications such as inhaled corticosteroids, inhaled cromolyn, long-acting bronchodilators, theophylline, leukotriene modifiers, and anti-IgE antibodies are used. Inhaled beta-adrenergic agonists by metered-dose inhaler (MDI); albuterol sulfate, pirbuterol acetate, levalbuterolReversal of airflow obstruction; relieve reversible bronchospasm by relaxing bronchial smooth muscles; used to treat bronchospasm in acute asthmatic episodes; used to prevent bronchospasm associated with exercise-induced asthma or nocturnal asthma Methylprednisolone IV; prednisone PO; inhaled corticosteroids (ciclesonide, beclomethasone, fluticasone, budesonide, mometasone)Decrease inflammatory response; ideal dose is not defined well, but desired outcome is to speed recovery and limit symptoms Montelukast 10 mg PO daily; zafirlukast 20 mg PO dailyInhibits leukotrienes, fatty acids that mediate inflammation, from binding to airway smooth muscle cells; prevents rather than reduces symptoms; used for long-term prevention Xanthines, such as theophylline, have been used successfully in treating chronic severe steroid-dependent asthmatics. Cromolyn sodium decreases bronchospasm, but it is not effective for acute bronchospasms and is used as a preventive measure. Maintenance of airway, breathing, and circulation is the primary consideration during an acute attack. Patients should be on bedrest to minimize their oxygen consumption and to decrease the work of breathing. Note that patients usually assume a position to ease breathing; some patients breathe more easily while sitting in an upright position: Do not impose bedrest on a patient who can breathe only in another position. Ask questions that can be answered by nodding or a brief one-word answer so the patient can conserve energy for breathing. If the patient is a child, allow the parents to stay with the child during acute attacks. Have the parents identify a security item that reassures the child, such as a special blanket or toy, and keep the item with the child at all times. Reinforce coping strategies to the parents, and allow them to express any feelings of guilt and helplessness. For strategies to prevent future attacks, discuss triggers that can induce asthma attacks and ways to avoid them. If the attack is triggered by an allergen, explore with the patient or family the source and discuss possible strategies for eliminating it. Cold air and exercise may increase symptoms. Aspirin and NSAIDs can cause sudden, severe airway obstruction. Outline the signs and symptoms that require immediate attention. Instruct the patient to notify the physician should she or he develop a respiratory infection that could trigger an attack. Instruct patients regarding their medications, particularly MDIs, and the indications for use. It is important that the patient uses the bronchodilator MDIs first and then uses the steroid inhalers. Explain to patients on steroid inhalers the need to rinse their mouths out after using them to avoid getting thrush. George, M., Abboud, S., Pantalon, M., Sommers, M.S., Mao, J., & Rand, C. (2016). Changes in clinical conversations when providers are informed of asthma patients' beliefs about medication use and integrative medical therapies. (1), 70–78. The purpose of this study was to explore whether asthma patients' personal beliefs about inhaled corticosteroid use and integrative medical therapies are discussed at routine primary care visits for asthma. The authors used a qualitative analysis of transcripts from 33 recorded primary care visits. Four themes emerged from the analysis when providers were aware of patients' beliefs: negative beliefs about corticosteroid use, integrative medical therapy use for asthma, decision making, and health lifestyles. When providers did not have this knowledge about their patients, two themes arose: asthma self-management and healthy lifestyles. The authors concluded that when providers understood patient beliefs, they could initiate conversations that were meaningful to their asthma patients about their self-management. Respiratory status: Patency of airway, auscultation of the lungs, presence or absence of adventitious breath sounds, respiratory rate and depth Response to medications, oxygen therapy, hydration, bedrest Presence of complications: Respiratory failure, pneumonia To prevent asthma attacks, teach patients the triggers that can precipitate an attack. In rare instances, asthma can lead to respiratory failure if patients are not treated immediately or are unresponsive to treatment (status asthmaticus). Explain that any dyspnea unrelieved by medications and accompanied by wheezing and accessory muscle use needs prompt attention from a healthcare provider. Encourage patients to identify and avoid things that make their asthma worse and to keep track of their symptoms. The National Institutes of Health provides excellent information for patient and families about asthma: . Teach the patient and family the correct use of medications, including the dosage, route, action, and side effects. Provide instructions about the proper use of MDIs. Note that many patients use complementary and alternative medications (CAM) for asthma or do not use their prescribed dose of medication. Assess the patient's use of CAM therapy and discuss with him or her the long-term consequences. is a sample topic from the . To view other topics, please or .

Because patients (especially children) with asthma have a history of allergies, obtain a thorough description of the response to allergens or other irritants. The patient may describe a sudden onset of symptoms after exposure, with a sense of suffocation. Symptoms include dyspnea, wheezing, and a cough (either dry or productive) and also chest tightness, restlessness, anxiety, and a prolonged expiratory phase. Ask if the patient has experienced a recent viral infection. Determine the speed of onset of symptoms, the number of asthma attacks in the past year, and the number of emergency department visits and hospitalizations from asthma in the past year. Children with an impending asthma attack may have been vomiting because of the tendency to swallow coughed up mucus rather than expectorating it. The most common symptoms are , , , and . The patient with an acute attack of asthma appears ill, with shortness of breath so severe that he or she can hardly speak. In acute airway obstruction, patients use their accessory muscles for breathing and are often profoundly diaphoretic. Some patients have an increased anteroposterior thoracic diameter. Children with asthma often prefer standing or sitting leaning forward to ease breathing. As airway obstruction becomes more serious, children may develop sternocleidomastoid contractions that indicate an increased expiratory effort, supraclavicular contractions that indicate an increased expiratory effort, and nasal flaring. If the patient has marked color changes such as pallor or cyanosis or becomes confused, restless, or lethargic, respiratory failure may be on the horizon. Percussion of the lungs usually produces hyperresonance, and palpation may reveal vocal fremitus. Auscultation reveals high-pitched inspiratory and expiratory wheezes, but with a major airway obstruction, breath sounds may be diminished. As the obstruction improves, breath sounds may actually worsen as they can be auscultated throughout the lung fields. During the most severe attacks of asthma, wheezing may be absent because of severe reduction of airflow, or its absence. Usually, the patient also has a prolonged expiratory phase of respiration. A rapid heart rate, mild systolic hypertension, and a paradoxic pulse may also be present. The emergency situation and an unfamiliar environment can aggravate the symptoms of the disease, especially if this is the patient's first experience with the condition. If the patient is a child and the parent is anxious, the child's level of anxiety increases and the attack may worsen. FVC: Maximum volume of air that can be forcefully expired after a maximal lung FEV1: Volume of air expired in 1 second from the beginning of the FVC maneuverAirway obstruction decreases flow rates; hospitalization is recommended if FVC is less than 1 L; FEV1/FVC should be 80% normally, but in asthma, it decreases to as low as 25% Forced expiratory flow (FEF): Maximal flow rate attained during the middle (25%–75%) of FVC maneuver RV: Volume of air remaining in lungs at end of a maximal expirationIncreased RV indicates obstruction; may remain increased for up to 3 weeks after the attack FRC: Volume of air remaining in lungs at end of a resting tidal volume Chest x-ray, high-resolution computed tomography (for chronic symptoms), skin testing, pulse oximetry, arterial blood gases, ECG, serum IgE. Peak expiratory flow rates (maximal flow rate attained during the FVC maneuver; decreased from baseline during periods of obstruction) may be used at home daily for patients who require daily medications.

Airway obstruction is generally managed with quick relief medications such as short-acting bronchodilators, systemic corticosteroids, and ipratropium (Atrovent). During severe exacerbations, patients may require IV fluid replacement. Unless contraindicated by a cardiac problem, 3,000 to 4,000 mL/day of fluid is usually administered intravenously, which helps loosen secretions and facilitates expectoration of the secretions. Low-flow oxygen therapy based on arterial blood gas results is often administered to treat hypoxemia. For the patient with increasing airway obstruction, endotracheal intubation and perhaps mechanical ventilation may be needed to maintain adequate airway and breathing. Close follow-up is needed when patients are discharged from the hospital because airway hyperactivity usually persists for 4 to 6 weeks after the event. To prevent symptoms, long-term control medications such as inhaled corticosteroids, inhaled cromolyn, long-acting bronchodilators, theophylline, leukotriene modifiers, and anti-IgE antibodies are used. Inhaled beta-adrenergic agonists by metered-dose inhaler (MDI); albuterol sulfate, pirbuterol acetate, levalbuterolReversal of airflow obstruction; relieve reversible bronchospasm by relaxing bronchial smooth muscles; used to treat bronchospasm in acute asthmatic episodes; used to prevent bronchospasm associated with exercise-induced asthma or nocturnal asthma Methylprednisolone IV; prednisone PO; inhaled corticosteroids (ciclesonide, beclomethasone, fluticasone, budesonide, mometasone)Decrease inflammatory response; ideal dose is not defined well, but desired outcome is to speed recovery and limit symptoms Montelukast 10 mg PO daily; zafirlukast 20 mg PO dailyInhibits leukotrienes, fatty acids that mediate inflammation, from binding to airway smooth muscle cells; prevents rather than reduces symptoms; used for long-term prevention Xanthines, such as theophylline, have been used successfully in treating chronic severe steroid-dependent asthmatics. Cromolyn sodium decreases bronchospasm, but it is not effective for acute bronchospasms and is used as a preventive measure. Maintenance of airway, breathing, and circulation is the primary consideration during an acute attack. Patients should be on bedrest to minimize their oxygen consumption and to decrease the work of breathing. Note that patients usually assume a position to ease breathing; some patients breathe more easily while sitting in an upright position: Do not impose bedrest on a patient who can breathe only in another position. Ask questions that can be answered by nodding or a brief one-word answer so the patient can conserve energy for breathing. If the patient is a child, allow the parents to stay with the child during acute attacks. Have the parents identify a security item that reassures the child, such as a special blanket or toy, and keep the item with the child at all times. Reinforce coping strategies to the parents, and allow them to express any feelings of guilt and helplessness. For strategies to prevent future attacks, discuss triggers that can induce asthma attacks and ways to avoid them. If the attack is triggered by an allergen, explore with the patient or family the source and discuss possible strategies for eliminating it. Cold air and exercise may increase symptoms. Aspirin and NSAIDs can cause sudden, severe airway obstruction. Outline the signs and symptoms that require immediate attention. Instruct the patient to notify the physician should she or he develop a respiratory infection that could trigger an attack. Instruct patients regarding their medications, particularly MDIs, and the indications for use. It is important that the patient uses the bronchodilator MDIs first and then uses the steroid inhalers. Explain to patients on steroid inhalers the need to rinse their mouths out after using them to avoid getting thrush. George, M., Abboud, S., Pantalon, M., Sommers, M.S., Mao, J., & Rand, C. (2016). Changes in clinical conversations when providers are informed of asthma patients' beliefs about medication use and integrative medical therapies. (1), 70–78. The purpose of this study was to explore whether asthma patients' personal beliefs about inhaled corticosteroid use and integrative medical therapies are discussed at routine primary care visits for asthma. The authors used a qualitative analysis of transcripts from 33 recorded primary care visits. Four themes emerged from the analysis when providers were aware of patients' beliefs: negative beliefs about corticosteroid use, integrative medical therapy use for asthma, decision making, and health lifestyles. When providers did not have this knowledge about their patients, two themes arose: asthma self-management and healthy lifestyles. The authors concluded that when providers understood patient beliefs, they could initiate conversations that were meaningful to their asthma patients about their self-management. Respiratory status: Patency of airway, auscultation of the lungs, presence or absence of adventitious breath sounds, respiratory rate and depth Response to medications, oxygen therapy, hydration, bedrest Presence of complications: Respiratory failure, pneumonia To prevent asthma attacks, teach patients the triggers that can precipitate an attack. In rare instances, asthma can lead to respiratory failure if patients are not treated immediately or are unresponsive to treatment (status asthmaticus). Explain that any dyspnea unrelieved by medications and accompanied by wheezing and accessory muscle use needs prompt attention from a healthcare provider. Encourage patients to identify and avoid things that make their asthma worse and to keep track of their symptoms. The National Institutes of Health provides excellent information for patient and families about asthma: . Teach the patient and family the correct use of medications, including the dosage, route, action, and side effects. Provide instructions about the proper use of MDIs. Note that many patients use complementary and alternative medications (CAM) for asthma or do not use their prescribed dose of medication.

It is a growing health problem in the United States, with approximately 25 million people affected. In the past 20 years, the number of children with asthma has increased markedly, and it is now the leading serious chronic illness in children. Unfortunately, approximately 75% of children with asthma continue to have chronic problems in adulthood. The total deaths annually from asthma have increased by over 100% since 1979 in the United States. Asthma is a disease of the airways characterized by airway inflammation and hyperreactivity (increased responsiveness to a wide variety of triggers). Hyperreactivity leads to airway obstruction due to acute onset of muscle spasm in the smooth muscle of the tracheobronchial tree, thereby leading to a narrowed lumen. In addition to muscle spasm, there is swelling of the mucosa, which leads to edema. Although asthma can result from infections (especially viral) and inhaled irritants, it often is the result of an allergic response. An allergen (antigen) is introduced to the body, and sensitizing antibodies such as immunoglobulin E (IgE) are formed. IgE antibodies bind to tissue mast cells and basophils in the mucosa of the bronchioles, lung tissue, and nasopharynx. An antigen-antibody reaction releases primary mediator substances such as histamine, slow-reacting substance of anaphylaxis (SRS-A), and others. These mediators cause contraction of the smooth muscle and tissue edema. In addition, goblet cells secrete a thick mucus into the airways that causes obstruction. Intrinsic asthma results from all other causes except allergies, such as infections (especially viral), inhaled irritants, and other causes or etiologies. The parasympathetic nervous system becomes stimulated, which increases bronchomotor tone, resulting in bronchoconstriction. In asthma, the total lung capacity (TLC), functional residual capacity (FRC), and residual volume (RV) increase, but the hallmark of airway obstruction is a reduction in ratio of the forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) to the forced vital capacity (FVC). Complications include pneumonia, atelectasis, respiratory failure with hypoxemia, and status asthmaticus (severe and refractory asthma). The classification for asthma is described in . Less than twice a week: Cough, wheeze, chest tightness, difficulty breathing Brief flare-ups with varying intensity; no symptoms between flare-ups Lung function tests: FEV1 ≥ 80% normal values; peak flow < 20% variability a.m. to a.m. or a.m. to p.m., day to day Three to six times a week: Cough, wheeze, chest tightness, difficulty breathing Lung function tests: FEV1 ≥ 80% normal values; peak flow < 20%–30% variability a.m. to a.m. or a.m. to p.m., day to day Daily: Cough, wheeze, chest tightness, difficulty breathing Lung function tests: FEV1 > 60% but < 80% normal values; peak flow > 30% variability a.m. to a.m. or a.m. to p.m., day to day Continual: Cough, wheeze, chest tightness, difficulty breathing Lung function tests: FEV1 ≤ 60% normal values; peak flow > 30% variability a.m. to a.m. or a.m. to p.m., day to day The main triggers for asthma are allergies, viral infections, autonomic nervous system imbalances that can cause an increase in parasympathetic stimulation, medications, psychological factors, and exercise. Of asthmatic conditions in patients under 30 years old, 70% are caused by allergies. Three major indoor allergens are dust mites, cockroaches, and cats. In older patients, the cause is almost always nonallergic types of irritants, such as smog. Heredity plays a part in about one-third of the cases. The genetic contributions to the development of asthma have been estimated at between 30% and 50% for various asthma phenotypes and up to 70% for overall IgE levels in plasma. Familial factors thus far appear to be autosomal dominant. There are at least 11 candidate genes that contribute to asthma susceptibility. These include , , , , , , , , , , and . Although the incidence of asthma is estimated at 5% to 10% in the general population, children have a higher incidence of 12%. Children make up one-third of the people with asthma; in the United States, 7 million children are affected, and trends suggest an increasing incidence of asthma in children under the age of 6 years. Asthma is diagnosed more frequently in males under 14 years and over 45 years of age and in females between the ages of 15 and 45. Black/African American children have higher morbidity and mortality rates than white children. Most experts agree that environmental factors play a more important role in asthma etiology than do genetic factors. Approximately 80% to 85% of childhood asthma episodes are associated with a prior exposure to a virus. Asthma prevalence varies widely across many nations, with a range from 1% to over 30% in children. Approximately 300 million people globally have asthma, and the prevalence increases by 50% every 10 years. Prevalence is high in developed countries in North America, Europe, and Australia and is increasing in developing countries as they become more industrialized. Examples include increases in South Africa, Eastern Europe, and the Baltic States. The greatest increases are seen in children. The more urbanization and affluence in a nation, the higher the prevalence.

Examples include increases in South Africa, Eastern Europe, and the Baltic States. The greatest increases are seen in children. The more urbanization and affluence in a nation, the higher the prevalence. Because patients (especially children) with asthma have a history of allergies, obtain a thorough description of the response to allergens or other irritants. The patient may describe a sudden onset of symptoms after exposure, with a sense of suffocation. Symptoms include dyspnea, wheezing, and a cough (either dry or productive) and also chest tightness, restlessness, anxiety, and a prolonged expiratory phase. Ask if the patient has experienced a recent viral infection. Determine the speed of onset of symptoms, the number of asthma attacks in the past year, and the number of emergency department visits and hospitalizations from asthma in the past year. Children with an impending asthma attack may have been vomiting because of the tendency to swallow coughed up mucus rather than expectorating it. The most common symptoms are , , , and . The patient with an acute attack of asthma appears ill, with shortness of breath so severe that he or she can hardly speak. In acute airway obstruction, patients use their accessory muscles for breathing and are often profoundly diaphoretic. Some patients have an increased anteroposterior thoracic diameter. Children with asthma often prefer standing or sitting leaning forward to ease breathing. As airway obstruction becomes more serious, children may develop sternocleidomastoid contractions that indicate an increased expiratory effort, supraclavicular contractions that indicate an increased expiratory effort, and nasal flaring. If the patient has marked color changes such as pallor or cyanosis or becomes confused, restless, or lethargic, respiratory failure may be on the horizon. Percussion of the lungs usually produces hyperresonance, and palpation may reveal vocal fremitus. Auscultation reveals high-pitched inspiratory and expiratory wheezes, but with a major airway obstruction, breath sounds may be diminished. As the obstruction improves, breath sounds may actually worsen as they can be auscultated throughout the lung fields. During the most severe attacks of asthma, wheezing may be absent because of severe reduction of airflow, or its absence. Usually, the patient also has a prolonged expiratory phase of respiration. A rapid heart rate, mild systolic hypertension, and a paradoxic pulse may also be present. The emergency situation and an unfamiliar environment can aggravate the symptoms of the disease, especially if this is the patient's first experience with the condition. If the patient is a child and the parent is anxious, the child's level of anxiety increases and the attack may worsen. FVC: Maximum volume of air that can be forcefully expired after a maximal lung inspiration FEV1: Volume of air expired in 1 second from the beginning of the FVC maneuverAirway obstruction decreases flow rates; hospitalization is recommended if FVC is less than 1 L; FEV1/FVC should be 80% normally, but in asthma, it decreases to as low as 25% Forced expiratory flow (FEF): Maximal flow rate attained during the middle (25%–75%) of FVC maneuver RV: Volume of air remaining in lungs at end of a maximal expirationIncreased RV indicates obstruction; may remain increased for up to 3 weeks after the attack FRC: Volume of air remaining in lungs at end of a resting tidal volume Chest x-ray, high-resolution computed tomography (for chronic symptoms), skin testing, pulse oximetry, arterial blood gases, ECG, serum IgE. Peak expiratory flow rates (maximal flow rate attained during the FVC maneuver; decreased from baseline during periods of obstruction) may be used at home daily for patients who require daily medications.

Airway obstruction is generally managed with quick relief medications such as short-acting bronchodilators, systemic corticosteroids, and ipratropium (Atrovent). During severe exacerbations, patients may require IV fluid replacement. Unless contraindicated by a cardiac problem, 3,000 to 4,000 mL/day of fluid is usually administered intravenously, which helps loosen secretions and facilitates expectoration of the secretions. Low-flow oxygen therapy based on arterial blood gas results is often administered to treat hypoxemia. For the patient with increasing airway obstruction, endotracheal intubation and perhaps mechanical ventilation may be needed to maintain adequate airway and breathing. Close follow-up is needed when patients are discharged from the hospital because airway hyperactivity usually persists for 4 to 6 weeks after the event. To prevent symptoms, long-term control medications such as inhaled corticosteroids, inhaled cromolyn, long-acting bronchodilators, theophylline, leukotriene modifiers, and anti-IgE antibodies are used. Inhaled beta-adrenergic agonists by metered-dose inhaler (MDI); albuterol sulfate, pirbuterol acetate, levalbuterolReversal of airflow obstruction; relieve reversible bronchospasm by relaxing bronchial smooth muscles; used to treat bronchospasm in acute asthmatic episodes; used to prevent bronchospasm associated with exercise-induced asthma or nocturnal asthma Methylprednisolone IV; prednisone PO; inhaled corticosteroids (ciclesonide, beclomethasone, fluticasone, budesonide, mometasone)Decrease inflammatory response; ideal dose is not defined well, but desired outcome is to speed recovery and limit symptoms Montelukast 10 mg PO daily; zafirlukast 20 mg PO dailyInhibits leukotrienes, fatty acids that mediate inflammation, from binding to airway smooth muscle cells; prevents rather than reduces symptoms; used for long-term prevention Xanthines, such as theophylline, have been used successfully in treating chronic severe steroid-dependent asthmatics. Cromolyn sodium decreases bronchospasm, but it is not effective for acute bronchospasms and is used as a preventive measure. Maintenance of airway, breathing, and circulation is the primary consideration during an acute attack. Patients should be on bedrest to minimize their oxygen consumption and to decrease the work of breathing. Note that patients usually assume a position to ease breathing; some patients breathe more easily while sitting in an upright position: Do not impose bedrest on a patient who can breathe only in another position. Ask questions that can be answered by nodding or a brief one-word answer so the patient can conserve energy for breathing. If the patient is a child, allow the parents to stay with the child during acute attacks. Have the parents identify a security item that reassures the child, such as a special blanket or toy, and keep the item with the child at all times. Reinforce coping strategies to the parents, and allow them to express any feelings of guilt and helplessness. For strategies to prevent future attacks, discuss triggers that can induce asthma attacks and ways to avoid them. If the attack is triggered by an allergen, explore with the patient or family the source and discuss possible strategies for eliminating it. Cold air and exercise may increase symptoms. Aspirin and NSAIDs can cause sudden, severe airway obstruction. Outline the signs and symptoms that require immediate attention. Instruct the patient to notify the physician should she or he develop a respiratory infection that could trigger an attack. Instruct patients regarding their medications, particularly MDIs, and the indications for use. It is important that the patient uses the bronchodilator MDIs first and then uses the steroid inhalers. Explain to patients on steroid inhalers the need to rinse their mouths out after using them to avoid getting thrush. George, M., Abboud, S., Pantalon, M., Sommers, M.S., Mao, J., & Rand, C. (2016). Changes in clinical conversations when providers are informed of asthma patients' beliefs about medication use and integrative medical therapies. (1), 70–78. The purpose of this study was to explore whether asthma patients' personal beliefs about inhaled corticosteroid use and integrative medical therapies are discussed at routine primary care visits for asthma. The authors used a qualitative analysis of transcripts from 33 recorded primary care visits. Four themes emerged from the analysis when providers were aware of patients' beliefs: negative beliefs about corticosteroid use, integrative medical therapy use for asthma, decision making, and health lifestyles. When providers did not have this knowledge about their patients, two themes arose: asthma self-management and healthy lifestyles. The authors concluded that when providers understood patient beliefs, they could initiate conversations that were meaningful to their asthma patients about their self-management. Respiratory status: Patency of airway, auscultation of the lungs, presence or absence of adventitious breath sounds, respiratory rate and depth Response to medications, oxygen therapy, hydration, bedrest Presence of complications: Respiratory failure, pneumonia To prevent asthma attacks, teach patients the triggers that can precipitate an attack. In rare instances, asthma can lead to respiratory failure if patients are not treated immediately or are unresponsive to treatment (status asthmaticus). Explain that any dyspnea unrelieved by medications and accompanied by wheezing and accessory muscle use needs prompt attention from a healthcare provider. Encourage patients to identify and avoid things that make their asthma worse and to keep track of their symptoms. The National Institutes of Health provides excellent information for patient and families about asthma: . Teach the patient and family the correct use of medications, including the dosage, route, action, and side effects. Provide instructions about the proper use of MDIs. Note that many patients use complementary and alternative medications (CAM) for asthma or do not use their prescribed dose of medication.

6ee706ca-a86e-4318-97b4-522a5516e13d,"Type your tag names separated by a space and hit enter Bronchitis and Asthma With CC or Major CC Asthma is classified as an intermittent, reversible, obstructive disease of the lungs. It is a growing health problem in the United States, with approximately 25 million people affected. In the past 20 years, the number of children with asthma has increased markedly, and it is now the leading serious chronic illness in children. Unfortunately, approximately 75% of children with asthma continue to have chronic problems in adulthood. The total deaths annually from asthma have increased by over 100% since 1979 in the United States. Asthma is a disease of the airways characterized by airway inflammation and hyperreactivity (increased responsiveness to a wide variety of triggers). Hyperreactivity leads to airway obstruction due to acute onset of muscle spasm in the smooth muscle of the tracheobronchial tree, thereby leading to a narrowed lumen. In addition to muscle spasm, there is swelling of the mucosa, which leads to edema. Although asthma can result from infections (especially viral) and inhaled irritants, it often is the result of an allergic response. An allergen (antigen) is introduced to the body, and sensitizing antibodies such as immunoglobulin E (IgE) are formed. IgE antibodies bind to tissue mast cells and basophils in the mucosa of the bronchioles, lung tissue, and nasopharynx. An antigen-antibody reaction releases primary mediator substances such as histamine, slow-reacting substance of anaphylaxis (SRS-A), and others. These mediators cause contraction of the smooth muscle and tissue edema. In addition, goblet cells secrete a thick mucus into the airways that causes obstruction. Intrinsic asthma results from all other causes except allergies, such as infections (especially viral), inhaled irritants, and other causes or etiologies. The parasympathetic nervous system becomes stimulated, which increases bronchomotor tone, resulting in bronchoconstriction. In asthma, the total lung capacity (TLC), functional residual capacity (FRC), and residual volume (RV) increase, but the hallmark of airway obstruction is a reduction in ratio of the forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) to the forced vital capacity (FVC). Complications include pneumonia, atelectasis, respiratory failure with hypoxemia, and status asthmaticus (severe and refractory asthma). The classification for asthma is described in . Less than twice a week: Cough, wheeze, chest tightness, difficulty breathing Brief flare-ups with varying intensity; no symptoms between flare-ups Lung function tests: FEV1 ≥ 80% normal values; peak flow < 20% variability a.m. to a.m. or a.m. to p.m., day to day Three to six times a week: Cough, wheeze, chest tightness, difficulty breathing Lung function tests: FEV1 ≥ 80% normal values; peak flow < 20%–30% variability a.m. to a.m. or a.m. to p.m., day to day Daily: Cough, wheeze, chest tightness, difficulty breathing Lung function tests: FEV1 > 60% but < 80% normal values; peak flow > 30% variability a.m. to a.m. or a.m. to p.m., day to day Continual: Cough, wheeze, chest tightness, difficulty breathing Lung function tests: FEV1 ≤ 60% normal values; peak flow > 30% variability a.m. to a.m. or a.m. to p.m., day to day The main triggers for asthma are allergies, viral infections, autonomic nervous system imbalances that can cause an increase in parasympathetic stimulation, medications, psychological factors, and exercise. Of asthmatic conditions in patients under 30 years old, 70% are caused by allergies. Three major indoor allergens are dust mites, cockroaches, and cats. In older patients, the cause is almost always nonallergic types of irritants, such as smog. Heredity plays a part in about one-third of the cases. The genetic contributions to the development of asthma have been estimated at between 30% and 50% for various asthma phenotypes and up to 70% for overall IgE levels in plasma. Familial factors thus far appear to be autosomal dominant. There are at least 11 candidate genes that contribute to asthma susceptibility. These include , , , , , , , , , , and . Although the incidence of asthma is estimated at 5% to 10% in the general population, children have a higher incidence of 12%. Children make up one-third of the people with asthma; in the United States, 7 million children are affected, and trends suggest an increasing incidence of asthma in children under the age of 6 years. Asthma is diagnosed more frequently in males under 14 years and over 45 years of age and in females between the ages of 15 and 45. Black/African American children have higher morbidity and mortality rates than white children. Most experts agree that environmental factors play a more important role in asthma etiology than do genetic factors. Approximately 80% to 85% of childhood asthma episodes are associated with a prior exposure to a virus. Asthma prevalence varies widely across many nations, with a range from 1% to over 30% in children. Approximately 300 million people globally have asthma, and the prevalence increases by 50% every 10 years. Prevalence is high in developed countries in North America, Europe, and Australia and is increasing in developing countries as they become more industrialized. Examples include increases in South Africa, Eastern Europe, and the Baltic States. The greatest increases are seen in children.

Daniel Graham, tight end for the Denver Broncos, teamed up with National Jewish Health to help children in the Denver Public Schools better control their asthma and miss fewer days of school. Mr. Graham offers the following tips for kids to help properly manage their exercise-induced asthma. . One of the most important things you can do to prevent exercise-induced asthma is to take your bronchodilator medication prior to exercising. If you're going to go out and play sports make sure you've taken your bronchodilator medication 10-15 minutes before you start. Also, be sure to maintain your schedule of daily asthma medications that your doctor prescribes. . Teachers and coaches should be informed if you have exercise-induced asthma. Let them know you are able to participate in activities, but that you may have to take your bronchodilator medication beforehand. . Stretching and a proper warm up before exercise, playing sports or vigorous activity will usually help you avoid asthma symptoms. . It's easy to get out of your routine once the summer starts and forget to take your asthma medications. Remember that it's very important to stick with them and stay on schedule. With effective management you can perform and excel in a variety of sports. . Ask your doctor for a written asthma action plan. The plan should include what medicine to use to treat asthma symptoms and changes in peak flow zones, what medication to use as a pretreatment before exercise, emergency telephone numbers and a list of things that make your asthma worse This information was provided by Daniel Graham, tight end for the Denver Broncos and an asthma sufferer (April 2010). , a pediatric pulmonary specialist at National Jewish Health, offers parents advice for the back-to-school season when respiratory viruses reappear. Children with asthma may have fewer symptoms during the summer, so it's important to make sure asthma control medications are properly adjusted for the school year.

It is a growing health problem in the United States, with approximately 25 million people affected. In the past 20 years, the number of children with asthma has increased markedly, and it is now the leading serious chronic illness in children. Unfortunately, approximately 75% of children with asthma continue to have chronic problems in adulthood. The total deaths annually from asthma have increased by over 100% since 1979 in the United States. Asthma is a disease of the airways characterized by airway inflammation and hyperreactivity (increased responsiveness to a wide variety of triggers). Hyperreactivity leads to airway obstruction due to acute onset of muscle spasm in the smooth muscle of the tracheobronchial tree, thereby leading to a narrowed lumen. In addition to muscle spasm, there is swelling of the mucosa, which leads to edema. Although asthma can result from infections (especially viral) and inhaled irritants, it often is the result of an allergic response. An allergen (antigen) is introduced to the body, and sensitizing antibodies such as immunoglobulin E (IgE) are formed. IgE antibodies bind to tissue mast cells and basophils in the mucosa of the bronchioles, lung tissue, and nasopharynx. An antigen-antibody reaction releases mediator substances such as histamine, slow-reacting substance of anaphylaxis (SRS-A), and others. These mediators cause contraction of the smooth muscle and tissue edema. In addition, goblet cells secrete a thick mucus into the airways that causes obstruction. Intrinsic asthma results from all other causes except allergies, such as infections (especially viral), inhaled irritants, and other causes or etiologies. The parasympathetic nervous system becomes stimulated, which increases bronchomotor tone, resulting in bronchoconstriction. In asthma, the total lung capacity (TLC), functional residual capacity (FRC), and residual volume (RV) increase, but the hallmark of airway obstruction is a reduction in ratio of the forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) to the forced vital capacity (FVC). Complications include pneumonia, atelectasis, respiratory failure with hypoxemia, and status asthmaticus (severe and refractory asthma). The classification for asthma is described in . Less than twice a week: Cough, wheeze, chest tightness, difficulty breathing Brief flare-ups with varying intensity; no symptoms between flare-ups Lung function tests: FEV1 ≥ 80% normal values; peak flow < 20% variability a.m. to a.m. or a.m. to p.m., day to day Three to six times a week: Cough, wheeze, chest tightness, difficulty breathing Lung function tests: FEV1 ≥ 80% normal values; peak flow < 20%–30% variability a.m. to a.m. or a.m. to p.m., day to day Daily: Cough, wheeze, chest tightness, difficulty breathing Lung function tests: FEV1 > 60% but < 80% normal values; peak flow > 30% variability a.m. to a.m. or a.m. to p.m., day to day Continual: Cough, wheeze, chest tightness, difficulty breathing Lung function tests: FEV1 ≤ 60% normal values; peak flow > 30% variability a.m. to a.m. or a.m. to p.m., day to day The main triggers for asthma are allergies, viral infections, autonomic nervous system imbalances that can cause an increase in parasympathetic stimulation, medications, psychological factors, and exercise. Of asthmatic conditions in patients under 30 years old, 70% are caused by allergies. Three major indoor allergens are dust mites, cockroaches, and cats. In older patients, the cause is almost always nonallergic types of irritants, such as smog. Heredity plays a part in about one-third of the cases. The genetic contributions to the development of asthma have been estimated at between 30% and 50% for various asthma phenotypes and up to 70% for overall IgE levels in plasma. Familial factors thus far appear to be autosomal dominant. There are at least 11 candidate genes that contribute to asthma susceptibility. These include , , , , , , , , , , and . Although the incidence of asthma is estimated at 5% to 10% in the general population, children have a higher incidence of 12%. Children make up one-third of the people with asthma; in the United States, 7 million children are affected, and trends suggest an increasing incidence of asthma in children under the age of 6 years. Asthma is diagnosed more frequently in males under 14 years and over 45 years of age and in females between the ages of 15 and 45. Black/African American children have higher morbidity and mortality rates than white children. Most experts agree that environmental factors play a more important role in asthma etiology than do genetic factors. Approximately 80% to 85% of childhood asthma episodes are associated with a prior exposure to a virus. Asthma prevalence varies widely across many nations, with a range from 1% to over 30% in children. Approximately 300 million people globally have asthma, and the prevalence increases by 50% every 10 years. Prevalence is high in developed countries in North America, Europe, and Australia and is increasing in developing countries as they become more industrialized. Examples include increases in South Africa, Eastern Europe, and the Baltic States. The greatest increases are seen in children. The more urbanization and affluence in a nation, the higher the prevalence. Because patients (especially children) with asthma have a history of allergies, obtain a thorough description of the response to allergens or other irritants. The patient may describe a sudden onset of symptoms after exposure, with a sense of suffocation. Symptoms include dyspnea, wheezing, and a cough (either dry or productive) and also chest tightness, restlessness, anxiety, and a prolonged expiratory phase. Ask if the patient has experienced a recent viral infection. Determine the speed of onset of symptoms, the number of asthma attacks in the past year, and the number of emergency department visits and hospitalizations from asthma in the past year. Children with an impending asthma attack may have been vomiting because of the tendency to swallow coughed up mucus rather than expectorating it. The most common symptoms are , , , and . The patient with an acute attack of asthma appears ill, with shortness of breath so severe that he or she can hardly speak. In acute airway obstruction, patients use their accessory muscles for breathing and are often profoundly diaphoretic. Some patients have an increased anteroposterior thoracic diameter. Children with asthma often prefer standing or sitting leaning forward to ease breathing. As airway obstruction becomes more serious, children may develop sternocleidomastoid contractions that indicate an increased expiratory effort, supraclavicular contractions that indicate an increased expiratory effort, and nasal flaring. If the patient has marked color changes such as pallor or cyanosis or becomes confused, restless, or lethargic, respiratory failure may be on the horizon. Percussion of the lungs usually produces hyperresonance, and palpation may reveal vocal fremitus. Auscultation reveals high-pitched inspiratory and expiratory wheezes, but with a major airway obstruction, breath sounds may be diminished. As the obstruction improves, breath sounds may actually worsen as they can be auscultated throughout the lung fields. During the most severe attacks of asthma, wheezing may be absent because of severe reduction of airflow, or its absence. Usually, the patient also has a prolonged expiratory phase of respiration. A rapid heart rate, mild systolic hypertension, and a paradoxic pulse may also be present. The emergency situation and an unfamiliar environment can aggravate the symptoms of the disease, especially if this is the patient's first experience with the condition. If the patient is a child and the parent is anxious, the child's level of anxiety increases and the attack may worsen. FVC: Maximum volume of air that can be forcefully expired after a maximal lung inspiration FEV1: Volume of air expired in 1 second from the beginning of the FVC maneuverAirway obstruction decreases flow rates; hospitalization is recommended if FVC is less than 1 L; FEV1/FVC should be 80% normally, but in asthma, it decreases to as low as 25% Forced expiratory flow (FEF): Maximal flow rate attained during the middle (25%–75%) of FVC maneuver RV: Volume of air remaining in lungs at end of a maximal expirationIncreased RV indicates obstruction; may remain increased for up to 3 weeks after the attack FRC: Volume of air remaining in lungs at end of a resting tidal volume Chest x-ray, high-resolution computed tomography (for chronic symptoms), skin testing, pulse oximetry, arterial blood gases, ECG, serum IgE. Peak expiratory flow rates (maximal flow rate attained during the FVC maneuver; decreased from baseline during periods of obstruction) may be used at home daily for patients who require daily medications. Ineffective airway clearance related to obstruction from narrowed lumen and thick mucus as evidenced by shortness of breath, wheezing, and/or chest tightness Respiratory status: Gas exchange; Respiratory status: Ventilation; Symptom control behavior; Treatment behavior: Illness or injury; Comfort level Airway management; Anxiety reduction; Oxygen therapy; Airway suctioning; Airway insertion and stabilization; Cough enhancement; Mechanical ventilation; Positioning; Respiratory monitoring For all but the most seriously ill patients, the goal is to prevent symptoms and reduce adverse events when acute episodes occur. Airway obstruction is generally managed with quick relief medications such as short-acting bronchodilators, systemic corticosteroids, and ipratropium (Atrovent). During severe exacerbations, patients may require IV fluid replacement. Unless contraindicated by a cardiac problem, 3,000 to 4,000 mL/day of fluid is usually administered intravenously, which helps loosen secretions and facilitates expectoration of the secretions. Low-flow oxygen therapy based on arterial blood gas results is often administered to treat hypoxemia. For the patient with increasing airway obstruction, endotracheal intubation and perhaps mechanical ventilation may be needed to maintain adequate airway and breathing. Close follow-up is needed when patients are discharged from the hospital because airway hyperactivity usually persists for 4 to 6 weeks after the event. To prevent symptoms, long-term control medications such as inhaled corticosteroids, inhaled cromolyn, long-acting bronchodilators, theophylline, leukotriene modifiers, and anti-IgE antibodies are used. Inhaled beta-adrenergic agonists by metered-dose inhaler (MDI); albuterol sulfate, pirbuterol acetate, levalbuterolReversal of airflow obstruction; relieve reversible bronchospasm by relaxing bronchial smooth muscles; used to treat bronchospasm in acute asthmatic episodes; used to prevent bronchospasm associated with exercise-induced asthma or nocturnal asthma Methylprednisolone IV; prednisone PO; inhaled corticosteroids (ciclesonide, beclomethasone, fluticasone, budesonide, mometasone)Decrease inflammatory response; ideal dose is not defined well, but desired outcome is to speed recovery and limit symptoms Montelukast 10 mg PO daily; zafirlukast 20 mg PO dailyInhibits leukotrienes, fatty acids that mediate inflammation, from binding to airway smooth muscle cells; prevents rather than reduces symptoms; used for long-term prevention Xanthines, such as theophylline, have been used successfully in treating chronic severe steroid-dependent asthmatics. Cromolyn sodium decreases bronchospasm, but it is not effective for acute bronchospasms and is used as a preventive measure. Maintenance of airway, breathing, and circulation is the consideration during an acute attack. Patients should be on bedrest to minimize their oxygen consumption and to decrease the work of breathing. Note that patients usually assume a position to ease breathing; some patients breathe more easily while sitting in an upright position: Do not impose bedrest on a patient who can breathe only in another position. Ask questions that can be answered by nodding or a brief one-word answer so the patient can conserve energy for breathing. If the patient is a child, allow the parents to stay with the child during acute attacks. Have the parents identify a security item that reassures the child, such as a special blanket or toy, and keep the item with the child at all times. Reinforce coping strategies to the parents, and allow them to express any feelings of guilt and helplessness. For strategies to prevent future attacks, discuss triggers that can induce asthma attacks and ways to avoid them. If the attack is triggered by an allergen, explore with the patient or family the source and discuss possible strategies for eliminating it. Cold air and exercise may increase symptoms. Aspirin and NSAIDs can cause sudden, severe airway obstruction. Outline the signs and symptoms that require immediate attention. Instruct the patient to notify the physician should she or he develop a respiratory infection that could trigger an attack. Instruct patients regarding their medications, particularly MDIs, and the indications for use. It is important that the patient uses the bronchodilator MDIs first and then uses the steroid inhalers. Explain to patients on steroid inhalers the need to rinse their mouths out after using them to avoid getting thrush. George, M., Abboud, S., Pantalon, M., Sommers, M.S., Mao, J., & Rand, C. (2016). Changes in clinical conversations when providers are informed of asthma patients' beliefs about medication use and integrative medical therapies. (1), 70–78. The purpose of this study was to explore whether asthma patients' personal beliefs about inhaled corticosteroid use and integrative medical therapies are discussed at routine care visits for asthma. The authors used a qualitative analysis of transcripts from 33 recorded care visits. Four themes emerged from the analysis when providers were aware of patients' beliefs: negative beliefs about corticosteroid use, integrative medical therapy use for asthma, decision making, and health lifestyles. When providers did not have this knowledge about their patients, two themes arose: asthma self-management and healthy lifestyles. The authors concluded that when providers understood patient beliefs, they could initiate conversations that were meaningful to their asthma patients about their self-management. Respiratory status: Patency of airway, auscultation of the lungs, presence or absence of adventitious breath sounds, respiratory rate and depth Response to medications, oxygen therapy, hydration, bedrest Presence of complications: Respiratory failure, pneumonia To prevent asthma attacks, teach patients the triggers that can precipitate an attack. In rare instances, asthma can lead to respiratory failure if patients are not treated immediately or are unresponsive to treatment (status asthmaticus). Explain that any dyspnea unrelieved by medications and accompanied by wheezing and accessory muscle use needs prompt attention from a healthcare provider. Encourage patients to identify and avoid things that make their asthma worse and to keep track of their symptoms. The National Institutes of Health provides excellent information for patient and families about asthma: . Teach the patient and family the correct use of medications, including the dosage, route, action, and side effects. Provide instructions about the proper use of MDIs. Note that many patients use complementary and alternative medications (CAM) for asthma or do not use their prescribed dose of medication. Assess the patient's use of CAM therapy and discuss with him or her the long-term consequences. is a sample topic from the . To view other topics, please or .

What is the September Epidemic? , allergy and immunology expert with National Jewish Health for Kids explains the increase in asthma exacerbations every September when children return to school, and how this results in more hospital visits and more ER visits.   Diesel Exhaust Can Predispose Unborn Babies to Asthma How Does Predisposition of Asthma Transfer from Mother to Child? What is Asthma and How Is it Diagnosed and Treated? 25% of all children’s hospitalizations happen in September. The is when we see an increase in asthma exacerbations in the fall when children return to school, resulting in more hospital visits and more ER visits. This may be because children are acquiring more viruses and the kids are passing it on to one and another. At this time of year it’s really important that students make sure they’re taking their daily medication. And parents may be busy taking care of back-to-school shopping lists, but it’s really important to add that daily medication and filling it every school year. September is also when the weather may get a little cold. We know that cold is a major trigger of asthma, so it’s really important that kids consistently pretreat if they have a trigger of exercise before exposure to cold such as during recess or during PE would be an important way of preventing exacerbations. Checking peak flow is a good way to monitor asthma control. Having your children check it daily gives you a good gauge of where they are when they're well and especially checking it during illness helps parents understand if their children’s asthma is not adequately controlled. An asthma action plan is something we provide to schools to give them a strategy for dealing with the asthma and that guidance for schools is important to bridge the gap between the school and the parent regarding asthma care.

93c82dc5-2718-45a7-a451-6c3fbbc4bf2c,"Gene expression networks flag potential therapeutic targets for SARS-CoV-2 An international team of researchers from Canada, Australia, the Netherlands, and the United States has identified dozens of genes that could contribute to the pathology of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and serve as potential therapeutic targets. The genes are co-expressed with two proteins that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) uses to gain host cell entry. Many of these genes could potentially be targeted with drugs that are already available. Molecule of SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus main protease, 3D illustration. Image Credit: Kateryna Kon / Shutterstock Using bioinformatics databases, Ana Hernandez Cordero (University of British Columbia) and colleagues studied the biology of the genes. They identified drug-gene interactions that could be explored to help fast-track the development of COVID-19 therapeutics. The team says the study shows how computational in silico approaches can help to quickly identify potential drugs that could be repurposed as COVID-19 treatments. “Given the exponential spread of COVID-19 across the globe and the unprecedented rise in deaths, such rapidity is necessary for our ongoing fight against the pandemic,” write the authors. A pre-print version of the paper is available on the server , while the article undergoes peer review. Correlation level and annotation of -correlated genes. Each bar represents a single gene (all with druggability scores Tier 1-3 12), and the Pearson correlation coefficient (r) between the gene and TMPRSS2 within the module is shown on the y-axis. Colors of bars represent combined biological information: green (group A1) represents genes related to human diseases based Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) and ClinVar databases; orange (group A2) are genes associated with human diseases, which also have phenotypic information on knockdown or knockout mouse models based on Mouse Genome Informatics (MGI) database; purple (group A3) represents genes associated with human diseases and with genetic variants associated to lung function traits 14; pink (group A4) represents genes associated with human disease, with phenotypic information on knockdown or knockout mouse, and genetic variants associated with lung function. Speeding up the identification of potential drug targets Blood group associated with cardiovascular events in COVID-19 patients Concern develops over Brazilian SARS-CoV-2 variant Study identifies features of potent SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies Since SARS-CoV-2 first infected people in Wuhan, China, late last year, it has quickly spread across the globe infecting millions and killing hundreds of thousands. Researchers worldwide have been racing to develop effective therapies, particularly for severe disease. However, it may take months or years and billions of dollars of investment to develop treatments and a vaccine, which may ultimately fail to be effective. “Bioinformatic approaches, however, are able to rapidly identify relevant gene-drug interactions that may contribute to the understanding of the mechanisms of viral infection and reduce the time to finding potential drug targets and existing drugs that could be repurposed for this indication,” write Cordero and colleagues. For SARs-CoV-2 to gain viral entry, its must bind angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and undergo subsequent priming by transmembrane protease, serine 2 (TMPRSS2). Given that the availability of these proteins is a rate-limiting step in the infection process, a detailed understanding of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 biology could help to identify potential therapeutic targets. Now, using the 1,038 lung tissue samples, Cordero, and colleagues have performed a gene expression network analysis to identify and investigate the co-expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2. The ACE2 and TMPRSS2 gene networks that were built contained genes that could contribute to the pathophysiology of COVID-19. Twelve ACE-2 correlated genes were already known to interact with existing drugs. One example was DPP4, which encodes the dipeptidyl-peptidase 4. This protein plays a key role in glucose and insulin metabolism and is associated with diabetes, which is now a well-known risk factor for severe disease and mortality in COVID-19. DPP-4 is also the receptor used by Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) coronavirus to gain host cell entry, and researchers have studied its interaction with dozens of existing compounds. “Because of the similarities between MERS and SARS-Cov-2, this is an interesting potential target, particularly for patients with diabetes,” said Cordero and colleagues. Another ACE2-correlated gene that could be an exciting target was IL13RA2, which encodes the alpha-2 subunit of interleukin-13 (IL-13) receptor. The IL-13 is a well-known effector of the airway remodeling process in asthma and is also involved in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. “Both the IL-13 258 and DPP-4 pathways could be intriguing possibilities for novel COVID-19 therapeutics,” writes the team.   The researchers found that 53 of the TMPRSS2-correlated genes were already known to interact with existing drugs. One example was CD55, which codes for an inhibitor of complement activation. The complement system can trigger a hyperinflammatory state in response to viral infection, and CD55 inhibits the formation of complement component 3 (C3). Researchers have shown that mice deficient in C3 have lower levels of inflammatory cytokines in their lungs and less respiratory dysfunction. “Thus, it is possible that preventing the formation of C3 via CD55 could be beneficial in COVID-19,” say the authors. Again, compounds that are known to specifically target CD55 already exist, they add. Fast-tracking the development of COVID-19 therapeutics Cordero and colleagues say that dozens of genes co-expressing ACE2 and TMPRSS2 have plausible associations with the pathophysiology of COVID-19, and many of them could potentially be targeted with existing drugs, thereby helping to “fast-track the development of COVID-19 therapeutics.” Furthermore, “computational in silico approaches can lead to the rapid identification of potential drugs, which could be repurposed as treatments against COVID-19,” they conclude.   publishes preliminary scientific reports that are not peer-reviewed and, therefore, should not be regarded as conclusive, guide clinical practice/health-related behavior, or treated as established information.

946937df-10b8-4108-be91-6c822b9df74e,"Diagnosis of asthma generally includes three stages: To start with, the doctor will analyze the patient’s specific symptoms and general health, with an emphasis on past episodes of similar symptoms. Doctors usually ask about exposure to allergens linked to asthma and any other health issues. The answers to these questions will help the doctor decide if the symptoms are caused by asthma or some other condition. Specific questions will be related to the following: The nature and frequency of symptoms such as wheezing, chest tightness and shortness of breath Chances of exposure to allergens in dust or chemical fumes Family history of asthma or any allergies in blood relatives During physical examination, doctors examine the patient’s breathing pattern while looking for allergy- or asthma-related signs such as wheezing, swollen nasal passages, runny nose and allergic skin reactions such as eczema. One of the key symptoms of asthma is high-pitched whistling sounds while breathing out – called wheezing. Doctors usually carry out a physical examination using the following steps: Check the nose, throat and upper airways of the patient Listen to patient’s breathing with the help of a stethoscope Examine the skin for allergic rashes, eczema or hives. Doctors may also check if the patient’s lungs are working properly using a spirometer. After taking a deep breath, the patient breaths out into a tube connected to the spirometer. The device shows the quantity of air breathed out and the speed at which air was breathed out in a given time period. The results indicate any inflammation of airways or tightened up muscles around the airways. The spirometer is also used to measure breathing patterns after inhalation of irritants such as methacholine, which can narrow down the airways. This is called the bronchoprovocation test and measures the sensitivity of airways. Researchers use urine test to identify and verify a patient's type of asthma High levels of steroids put asthma patients at greater risk of serious side-effects COVID-19 pandemic drives asthma patients to use telemedicine The tests are repeated after medication to track any improvement. If the results show an improvement, and the patient has a history of asthma symptoms, the diagnosis will most likely be asthma. Based on the patient’s symptoms and medical history, doctors may order other diagnostic tests to help confirm asthma. Allergy testing, usually a skin patch test to determine what kind of allergens trigger a reaction in the patient A chest X ray or an ECG (echocardiogram) to help determine if a foreign object may be the cause of the symptoms. Tests to check for other conditions such as vocal cord dysfunction, reflux disease, or sleep apnea, which cause symptoms similar to that of asthma It is more difficult to diagnose asthma in young children. Most asthmatic children develop the first symptoms before they turn 5. In children, it’s hard to differentiate symptoms of asthma from that of other conditions. This is because children usually have narrow airways which grow as the child grows. Young children usually have wheezing as a result of a cold or respiratory infection. This may or may not be a symptom of asthma in the future. However, a child with frequent wheezing associated with respiratory infections may have asthma if the child shows signs of allergies such as skin rashes, the child is sensitive to airborne allergens such as pollens or the child’s parents have asthma. Since a lung function test will be difficult to perform in young children, doctors usually rely on the child's signs and symptoms, medical history and physical examination in order to make a diagnosis.

The aim of an asthma action plan is to enable patients and caregivers to recognize early and take the appropriate steps to improve control of the condition and minimize complications. Image Copyright: Lopolo, Image ID: 249852262 via Shutterstock An asthma action plan is a written, step-by-step guide to enable patients to maintain control of their asthma symptoms. It is usually made by the patient and health professional together and outlines what to do when: The plan will usually list any triggers, remind patient when to take which medication and stipulate how bystanders can help if an attack occurs. or the image to view an Asthma Action Plan from Asthma Action Plan from the US National Institutes of Health (PDF) Researchers use urine test to identify and verify a patient's type of asthma Wildfire smoke more harmful than other types of air pollution for people with asthma COVID-19 pandemic drives asthma patients to use telemedicine Research has supported the benefits that a written asthma plan can offer when individuals are managing asthma in the home environment. It helps to: Establish clear guidelines on when and how to act in response to certain changes and symptoms related to the condition. Monitor changes and understand when the condition is well-controlled o pharmacological treatment alterations are needed. Provide patients with the knowledge of when to act and seek emergency medical aid. An asthma action plan assists in the communication between the healthcare practitioner and the patient, allowing relevant information to be clearly presented in a written and easy-to-follow format. It doesn’t take long to discuss and write up the action plan but the benefits of the plan are clear. In fact, individuals that have an action plan are four times less likely to require hospitalization to manage severe symptoms. The everyday section of the action plan should detail the regular medications and management techniques that should be employed to prevent symptoms as asthma. This often includes the avoidance of asthma triggers, in addition to preventative medication to reduce inflammation of the airways. Reliever medication is also indicated when symptoms worsen for a short period of time. Flare-ups of asthma symptoms are most likely to occur when individuals have been exposed to triggers of asthma or have recently been ill with a cold or influenza. These periods are marked by increased use of reliever medication or a reduction in peak expiratory flow (PEF) values at home, and should be considered as a warning sign to initiate treatment to prevent an attack. The plan will differ according to the needs of each individual, but often involves a “step up” approach in medications or a short course of corticosteroids to manage inflammation An asthma plan plays an essential role to guide decision-making when in an emergency situation such as an asthma attack. It is marked by the significant worsening of symptoms such as difficulty breathing, chest tightness and wheezing. The plan should be easily accessible for other members of the family to refer to and help in the management of the attack. In most cases, reliever medication should be administered, and an ambulance should be called if no improvement occurs. It is important that the asthma action plan is reviewed and updated regularly, at least annually, to ensure the plan is suitable for the individual case. Additionally, the action plan can only be utilized if the patient has it on hand when it is needed. If should be located in a place at home that allows people to see it and refer to it quickly when needed. It can also be useful to make several copies to be kept in other areas, such as in the car, at school and the sporting club. https://www.asthma.org.uk/advice/manage-your-asthma/action-plan/ https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/files/docs/public/lung/asthma_actplan.pdf http://www.asthma.ca/adults/control/pdf/AsthmaActionPlan_ENG.pdf http://www.asthma.ca/adults/control/actionPlan.php Last Updated: Aug 23, 2018 Yolanda graduated with a Bachelor of Pharmacy at the University of South Australia and has experience working in both Australia and Italy.

It is spread by small droplets from coughs and sneezes and from touching infected surfaces. As of posting date, we know that at least 80 percent of people who are infected with the virus will have anywhere from no symptoms to mild to moderate flu-like symptoms, including a fever and cough. The remaining 20 percent may develop more severe cases of coronavirus may develop pneumonia or severe acute respiratory syndrome. Coronavirus can affect the upper respiratory system (nose, sinuses and throat) with flu-like symptoms, the lower respiratory system (airways and lungs) by causing cough with or without mucous and difficulty breathing. When COVID-19 is severe it can bring on pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Common symptoms of respiratory infections in the nose, sinuses and throat include nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat, sneezing, achy muscles and headache. Coronavirus upper respiratory infection symptoms also may include cough, diarrhea, fever, shortness of breath, loss of smell and /or taste and tiredness. Common symptoms of COVID-19 respiratory infections in the airways and lungs may include severe cough that produces mucous, shortness of breath, chest tightness and wheezing when you exhale. If COVID-19 goes deep into the lungs, it can cause pneumonia. Pneumonia is a concern for older people because they have reduced lung capacity, require longer recover time and have age-weakened immune systems. Pneumonia that is caused by coronavirus may be more severe, affect many parts of the lungs, and cause shock, organ damage, abnormal blood clotting, acute respiratory distress syndrome and deteriorating health. When healthy lungs inhale, the lungs and their 480 million tiny air sacs (alveoli) fill with oxygen. These little air sacs get rid of carbon dioxide when you exhale and pass oxygen into the blood vessels. Pneumonia causes the air sacs to become infected and inflamed. This causes fluid and inflammatory cells to build up in the lungs and prevents oxygen from getting through, causing severe breathing difficulties and lack of oxygen in the blood. Severe cases of COVID-19-related pneumonia are treated in the hospital. Risk Factors for Developing Pneumonia from COVID-19 Symptoms of Severe Pneumonia Caused by Coronavirus COVID-19 Pneumonia & Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is life threatening. It is an injury to the lungs caused by infection or trauma. ARDS causes fluid to leak into the lungs. This makes is extreme difficult to breathe and causes a significant lack of oxygen getting into the bloodstream. The lack of oxygen harms the brain, organs and body tissues. Most people who develop ARDS are already inpatients in the hospital. Treatment includes oxygen therapy to ensure the blood and body have enough oxygen to function properly. This may include being placed on a mechanical ventilator to deliver oxygen support. Pain control and sedation are often used to prevent agitation and shortness of breath. Fluids are managed to prevent build up in the lungs. In extreme circumstances, an extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) machine may be used to oxygenate the blood outside the body while the body fights the infection and repairs itself. Post critical illness syndrome (PCIS) frequently follows critical illness from COVID-19. This can result in weakness, anxiety, post traumatic distress syndrome and chronic shortness of breath. Pulmonary rehabilitation is used as part of a treatment plan for PCIS to help ARDS patients recover strength.

7dae6916-fdd7-479b-b4d6-d1c38ae604c9,"Asthma is a respiratory condition in which the lung passages become hyper-responsive to different types of stimuli. As a result, the smooth muscle in the wall of the bronchial passages contracts, along with swelling of the mucus membrane lining the airways. This is accompanied by excessive mucus production. All these lead to airway narrowing, resulting in symptoms like breathlessness, wheezing while breathing, coughing and a feeling of tightness in the chest. The severity of these symptoms varies from patient to patient and from day to day. Unlike chronic lung disease where the lung is permanently damaged, asthma is chiefly characterized by its reversibility. No matter how dangerously severe the symptoms are, in all cases, prompt and effective treatment can open the airways again normal breathing can resume. Child holding asthma inhaler in hands. Image Credit: OnlyZoia / Shutterstock Asthma occurs in different patterns. Different types of asthma are classified by their temporal pattern, or the time when attacks occur and the following forms have been identified: In some people episodes of asthma occur between  intervening symptom-free  periods. In most cases, the asthmatic symptoms resolve spontaneously. The symptom-free periods are usually quite long. In such patients viral infections of the respiratory tract such as those which cause the common cold are a common trigger of asthma symptoms. This is especially true in small children between 2-5 years of age who may get 8-12 viral colds and coughs a year. In other cases, strenuous exercise or physical activity, exposure to cold air, or certain environmental agents have been found to act as asthma triggers. has been observed in response to the seasonal release of allergens such as pollens that occur in the environment. Mold spores are another common cause of seasonal asthma. It is important to understand how your local climate and air allergen level vary from season to season to determine whether you have this type of asthma is, and to prevent it by appropriate measures. Higher consumption of meat linked with increased wheezing in children Children with asthma having fewer attacks amid the coronavirus pandemic, study says COVID-19 pandemic drives asthma patients to use telemedicine Everyone with allergies do not necessarily develop asthma, neither do all asthmatics have allergies. However, allergies do intensify asthma in some cases. Thus, exposure to cold or dry air, dust, pet hair or pollen may set off an acute attack of asthma. In addition, there is another type of allergic asthma in which the asthma triggers are not related to season, but may be due to a hyper-reaction of the airway mucosa to things that are not typically allergenic. These include viruses, air pollutants or irritants like tobacco smoke or paint fumes, heavy exercise, certain chemicals in food or drugs, and changes in the weather. This term is used when a bout of exercise is followed by narrowing of the airways. It may be found in up to 80% of people with asthma. However, not all cases of EIB are found in asthma patients. It is thought to be caused by the dehydration and/or heating up that occurs with strenuous physical activity in a dry climate. In children with asthma it is often the first symptom to develop. Certain irritants which are encountered during the course of various sport activities include chlorine in swimming pools, air pollutants while jogging, running or cycling, cold dry air during winter sports, and strong smells due to chemicals or perfumes in a gym environment. The transient and treatable nature of EIB, means that patients with this condition should not be prevented from physical activity at any level whatsoever, provided it is properly managed. Exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (EIB). Image Credit: Lopolo / Shutterstock In this form the symptoms are caused or worsened by chemical irritants or dust in the air. Pre-existing asthma can also become worse with such exposure. Clues to the nature of a patient’s asthma may include the time of earliest symptoms coinciding with a change of workplace or job, an improvement in symptoms upon leaving the workplace, and the occurrence of breathing difficulty due to workplace chemicals. There are over 250 occupational asthma triggers or promoters. As always, pre-existing asthma also increases the risk of this condition, as does smoking and the presence of allergies in the individual or the family. Some high-risk occupations include bakers, manufacturers of drugs and detergents, those who measure grain, metal workers and laboratory workers, plastic workers and woodworkers. Also called persistent asthma, this condition is defined by daily symptoms or those which recur several times a week. The intensity of symptoms may be quite variable, but there are no long periods without symptoms. Acute exacerbations may supervene at any time upon the chronic course of the disease. These may be traced in some cases to seasonal increase in air allergens or viral pathogens that provoke airway inflammation. Chronic asthma must be correctly identified in a patient to ensure proper intervention strategies. Most cases of asthma begin in childhood, but in some patients, the first symptoms appear only in adult life. The causes may be many. Some people were just not exposed to potential triggers for their asthma until they became adults. For example, they are exposed to a house pet when their room-mate brings one home, or they begin to work in an environment containing chemical fumes, that triggers their latent hypersensitivity. It could even be a viral infection that sets off an asthmatic reaction for the first time in adulthood. Acaai.org. (2019). Types of asthma. . Uichildrens.org.

Anticoagulation in COVID Pro Con Debate with Drs Todd Bull and Eric Schmidt “We’re going be stronger”: A Frontline Physician’s View of COVID-19 You are being given this TestFact because your sample was tested using the National Jewish Health COVID-19 IgG Detection by ELISA Antibody Test. This TestFact contains information to help you understand the risks and benefits of using this test for diagnosing prior infection with the virus that causes COVID-19. After reading this TestFact, if you have questions or would like to discuss the information provided, please talk with your health care provider. COVID-19 is caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. This virus, which can cause mild to severe respiratory illness, has spread globally, including to the United States. There is limited information available to fully describe the different types of clinical illness associated with COVID-19. This illness likely spreads to others when a person shows signs or symptoms of being sick (e.g., fever, coughing, difficulty breathing, etc.) or in the few days leading up to symptoms. What is the COVID-19 IgG Detection by ELISA Antibody test? The test is designed to detect antibodies (also known as immunoglobulins) against the virus that causes COVID-19. Antibodies are proteins produced by the immune system in response to an infection and are specific to that particular infection. They are found in the liquid part of blood specimens which is called serum or plasma, depending on the presence of clotting factors. Today your sample will be tested for immunoglobulin G (IgG). This test detects IgG antibodies that develop in most patients within seven to 10 days after symptoms of COVID-19 begin. IgG antibodies remain in the blood after an infection has passed. These antibodies indicate that you may have had COVID-19 in the recent past and have developed antibodies that may protect you from future infection. It is unknown at this point how much protection antibodies might provide against another infection with SARS-CoV-2. your health care provider believes you may have been exposed to the virus that causes COVID-19 based on your current or previous signs and symptoms (e.g., fever, cough, difficulty breathing); you live in or have recently traveled to a place where transmission of COVID-19 is known to occur; you have been in close contact with an individual suspected of or confirmed to have COVID-19; or Testing of the sample may help find out if you may have antibodies to COVID-19. What are the known and potential risks and benefits of the test? Possible discomfort, bruising, infection or other complications that can happen during sample collection. Serious complications are very rare. Possible incorrect test result (see below for more information). The results, along with other information, can help your health care provider make informed recommendations about your care. The results of this test may help limit the spread of COVID-19 to your family and others in your community. What does it mean if I have a positive test result? If you have a positive test result (antibodies are detected), you may have been infected with the virus that causes COVID-19 at some point in the past. There is still a chance that the antibodies indicate past infection due to other coronaviruses. These other coronaviruses cause the common cold. There is also a small chance that a positive result is incorrect (false positive). The presence of IgG suggests that the infection happened weeks to months in the past. It also suggests that you may no longer be infectious. IgG indicates that you may have some immunity to the virus, though you may not. How much it might protect you from getting sick with COVID-19 in the future is unknown.  Your health care provider will work with you to determine how best to care for you based on the test results along with other factors of your medical history, including any previous symptoms, possible exposure to COVID-19 and the location of places you have recently traveled.  What does it mean if I have a negative test result? A negative test result means that the antibodies to the virus that causes COVID-19 were not found in your sample. Some health conditions might make it difficult for your body to produce antibodies to an infection. However, it is possible for this test to give a negative result that is incorrect (false negative) in some people. A negative result may occur if you are tested early in your illness and your body hasn’t had time to produce antibodies to infection. This means that you could possibly still have COVID-19 even though the test is negative. If this is the case, your health care provider will consider the test result together with all other aspects of your medical history (such as symptoms, possible exposures and geographical location of places you have recently traveled) in deciding how to care for you. It is important that you work with your health care provider to help you understand the next steps you should take. No. This test is not yet approved or cleared by the United States FDA. When there are no FDA-approved or cleared tests available, and other criteria are met, the FDA can make tests available under an emergency access mechanism called an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA). The EUA for this test is supported by the Secretary of Health and Human Service’s (HHS’s) declaration that circumstances exist to justify the emergency use of in vitro diagnostics for the detection and/or diagnosis of the virus that causes COVID-19. This EUA will remain in effect (meaning this test can be used) for the duration of the COVID-19 declaration, justifying emergency use of in vitro diagnostic tests (IVDs), unless it is terminated or revoked by FDA (after which the test may no longer be used). National Jewish Health researchers and clinicians developed and validated this test and submitted it for emergency use authorization from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

It is spread via small droplets from the nose and mouth, and from touching infected surfaces. As of posting date, we know that at least 80 percent of people who are infected with the virus can have no symptoms, mild symptoms or moderate symptoms, including a fever and cough. The remaining 20 percent may develop more severe cases of coronavirus. The COVID-19 infection causes a high level of inflammation that triggers an extra strong immune response. This response is more than what is needed for this virus and causes hyper inflammation and blood clots. The blood clots can lead to stroke and heart attacks even in young and healthy people. COVID -19 contributes to irregular heartbeats, inflammation of the heart (and the lining of the heart), reduced blood flow to the heart, stroke, blood clotting and cardiac death. Some COVID-19 survivors, who were otherwise healthy, have developed blood vessel injuries, blood clots, arrhythmia, heart failure, myocarditis, strokes and heart attacks even without having severe disease or being hospitalized due to the coronavirus.

f5c87919-0e0f-4da6-85f3-3a2a5bdbd1f4,"Animal data supports efficacy of baricitinib vs SARS-COV-2 The high burden of disease caused by the COVID-19 pandemic has led to much research on effective ways to mitigate the health, social, and economic impact of the spread of the infection. A recent study published on the preprint server in September 2020 reports on the characteristics of the drug baricitinib when used as monotherapy to treat severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). SARS-Cov-2 infection in rhesus macaques results in an accumulation of inflammatory macrophages and neutrophils in the lower airway. These airway macrophages produce high amounts of inflammatory cytokines and neutrophil-attracting chemokines and show upregulated Type I interferon signaling. Neutrophil NETs and the inflammation induced by SARSCoV-2 infection both contribute to lung pathology. (b) Baricitinib treatment reduced the levels of macrophages producing inflammatory cytokines and neutrophil-attracting chemokines, decreased the infiltration of neutrophils into the lung and reduced T cell activation. The Netosis activity of neutrophils was also reduced. In treated animals, the antiviral interferon response was maintained, viral replication was not impacted, and lung pathology was mild. Severe COVID-19 is associated with high fever, non-productive cough, and pneumonia, with X-rays or CT scans of the chest showing bilateral opacities and evidence of lung inflammation. The infiltration of neutrophils and other inflammatory cells into the lung tissue is a characteristic of progressive disease in this syndrome, with immunocompromised individuals, as well as those with other chronic illnesses, being at higher risk for severe and critical disease. The hyperactive immune response underlying progressive COVID-19 involves both innate and adaptive immunity. Pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines such as  IFNγ, TNFα, IP-10, G-CSF, IL-2, IL-6 IL-8, IL-9, IL-10, and IL-17 are observed to be at high levels, which has promoted the use of Janus Kinase inhibitors. These drugs inhibit cytokine release via these pathways and may thus reduce the odds of a and subsequent multi-organ damage. The current study by researchers at Emory University, Oregon Health & Science University, a Jolla Institute For Allergy & Immunology and Case Western Reserve University uses the non-human primate (NHP) rhesus monkey model to study the role of the selective oral Janus kinase inhibitor baricitinib because they have established that this animal model recapitulates mild to moderate infection with SARS-CoV-2. It is already in use for patients with moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis. Its potential for use in COVID-19 was suggested by machine learning algorithms using in vitro data that indicated the possibility that baricitinib might also suppress the endocytosis of this virus via clathrin-mediated pathways. If this is true, the dual action of baricitinib in reducing the intensity of the inflammatory response and in preventing viral entry into the host cell and viral replication might be beneficial. The current study, therefore, used a longitudinal approach to test tissue responses to baricitinib, using both bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and lung tissue samples. They found that it was well-tolerated and achieved therapeutic concentrations in both plasma and in tissue. However, it did not arrest viral replication in infected rhesus monkeys. The infected monkeys did show lower severity of lung disease and inflammation and lower levels of cytokines and chemokines involved in the inflammatory pathway. The chief findings of the investigators included the dampening of the genes associated with inflammation and neutrophil activation in BAL of infected monkeys. Bulk RNA-Seq profiling of cells obtained from the BAL five days before virus inoculation, two days after inoculation, four days after infection, and 2 days after initiating baricitinib. They found that differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were strongly upregulated two days after infection in both treated and untreated animals. Two days after treatment, however, there was an abrupt drop in DEGs, which was quite the opposite of the robust increase in expression that persisted in the untreated group. In the treated group, the gene expression at 2 and 4 days from infection was found to show that dampening started at an earlier time point. Many of the downregulated genes encoded enzymes involved in degradation and bactericidal processes, within neutrophil granules, or genes that are expressed at high levels on non-lymphocyte white cells, genes that encode matrix-degrading enzymes during the passage of neutrophils out of the blood vessel, and the alarmin S100A12. The difference was striking: these genes were expressed at high levels in BAL of untreated animals but at much lower levels following baricitinib treatment. In fact, in the latter group, the levels closely resembled that at baseline. Extract of medicinal plant Artemisia annua interferes with replication of SARS-CoV-2 in vitro Vitamin D supplementation found to reduce COVID-19-related mortality, says study Glycyrrhizin in licorice root neutralizes SARS-CoV-2 in vitro by inhibiting the main protease Mpro Thus, neutrophil recruitment and activity in the lower airway resulting from acute infection with the virus is dampened by baricitinib. This is more significant in that many of these genes are highly expressed in myeloid blood cells in severely ill COVID-19 patients. Baricitinib also rapidly suppressed inflammatory mediators in the TNFα signaling and IL6 signaling pathways, including factors that induce neutrophil chemotaxis and recruitment of both neutrophils and macrophages. Inflammatory and immune-regulatory cytokines also undergo suppression. These changes are also reflected in the rheumatoid arthritis pathway, as expected from a drug that was developed to reduce signaling in the Janus kinase pathway. In fact, it downregulates the IL-6/JAK/STAT3 signaling pathway of inflammation, as shown above. Baricitinib does not affect the genes involved in Type I interferon signaling pathways, and interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), part of the innate antiviral immune response. These genes continued to be at an elevated expression in both treated and untreated groups. Baricitinib almost completely inhibits the expression of inflammatory cytokines such as TNFa, IL10, IFNb, and IL6, and of neutrophil chemotactic factors in the lung macrophages of the infected monkeys, within just 48 hours of treatment. These cytokines are thought to be part of the disease process in COVID-19. Again, ISG expression was left mainly unchanged even as baricitinib reduces airway inflammation and neutrophil infiltration robustly. Baricitinib Inhibits Neutrophil Accumulation and NETosis Baricitinib also produces low levels of neutrophils and consequent NETosis in the BAL. NETs (neutrophil extracellular traps) are also thought to be important in the pathogenesis of inflammation and microvascular thrombosis in these patients. In untreated animals, neutrophils are rapidly recruited at four days from infection, while viremia is at its peak. This high level of neutrophil infiltration was sustained even at later time points of infection but was not observed following baricitinib treatment. Baricitinib also reduced T cell activation in the monkeys following infection. Whereas proliferating memory CD8+ were found to increase markedly and rapidly at 7 and 10 days after infection, all treated animals showed a significant decrease by 4 days from infection. Baricitinib did not impair the ability of animals to respond by peripheral T cell activation to specific SARS-CoV-2 and other non-antigen stimulation (PMA/ionomycin). The researchers found that baricitinib reduced lung pathology, inflammatory markers and cytokines, and levels of systemic inflammation in monkeys. All of these are associated with severe COVID-19 disease in humans. At the same time, it did not reduce type 1 IFN responses. This was validated by observing reduced neutrophil infiltration into the lungs and deficient levels of T cell activation in peripheral blood and in the BAL after treatment. They also found that NETosis was increased in animals after SARS-CoV-2 infection, but reduced after treatment with baricitinib. At the cellular level, single-cell RNA seq methods showed a steep decline in immune activation markers and neutrophil recruitment and macrophage trafficking profiles, in the treatment group. The findings that high levels of inflammatory cytokines in the lung are linked to severe or critical COVID-19 reflects very recent studies and indicates the clinical potential for baricitinib in dampening the hyperactive immune response that is commonly seen in moderate to severe COVID-19. In fact, it could be superior to drug inhibitors that target specific cytokines, like the IL-6R inhibitor tocilizumab, since it suppresses multiple inflammatory cytokines to prevent a cytokine storm effectively. Baricitinib also achieved satisfactory levels in lung and central nervous system tissue, without any signs of toxicity. However, it did not suppress viral replication in infected animals. On the other hand, the researchers also found that its downstream immune system suppressive effects did not limit adaptive T cell and Type 1 IFN innate immune responses to the virus. Ongoing trials looking into the effects of baricitinib in infected humans include the Adaptive COVID-19 Treatment Trial (ACTT-2) and the COV-BARRIER trial. The first is studying baricitinib alongside remdesivir, the second baricitinib monotherapy. A small clinical trial that used baricitinib in 20 severe COVID-19 patients indicated that it inhibited immune dysregulation by lowering the plasma levels of IL6, IL1b, and TNFa, leading to a faster recovery. The authors of the current study sum up, “Our data provides rationale for baricitinib treatment in COVID-19 to be given in a window where blocking immune inflammation would prevent the formation of a cytokine storm without interfering in the initial responses necessary for preventing viral dissemination and persistence.” publishes preliminary scientific reports that are not peer-reviewed and, therefore, should not be regarded as conclusive, guide clinical practice/health-related behavior, or treated as established information.

Coping with stress can make you, your loved ones and the community stronger. Fears, anxiety and depression about health, work, finances and school Using unhealthy coping mechanisms such as alcohol, tobacco or other drugs Sometimes the way you think about things can make all of the difference. Your attitude can help offset many difficult situations. When you know there are times when you have given all that you can to a situation, it allows you to expend energy where it can be more effective. Continually watching news updates on the pandemic can add to your stress. Pick once or twice a day to take in COVID-19 news, including what’s on social media. It’s helpful to share feelings and check on others. Use phone, face chat, email and other digital media to reach out when you need to talk and to check on others. Make relaxation part of your daily routine. Try deep breathing, muscle relaxation and meditation. Try these . A fit body can more easily fight stress. Daily physical activity not only helps your body but it helps calm your mind. Staying on track with healthy eating habits is a great way to manage stress. Sleep is important for your body to recover from stressful events, as well as to heal from illness. Call a friend, family member or your doctor if you are struggling with stress, anxiety or depression. You don’t have to go through this alone.

You can be exposed by droplets from an infected person’s coughs and sneezes and by touching a surface that an infected person has contaminated. Most people will recover within one to two weeks. More severe cases can take six weeks or more to recover. While most patients recover, some may have lung scarring as well as other health conditions as part of post-intensive care syndrome that may include weakness, loss of muscle mass, stress, anxiety and memory changes that can often go unnoticed. If these conditions are recognized, there are management approaches that may help to improve these conditions as well as provide help for the patient’s and family’s quality of life.  Mild Disease – 80% and more will have mild COVID-19 disease Symptoms: Upper respiratory tract infection, fever, cough and other mild symptoms such as headache or conjunctivitis. You may or may not have mild pneumonia. Most people will feel like they have a mild cold or other viral infection – tired and under the weather. Recovery will include home care for symptoms, rest and isolation away from others. You are fever free without using fever-reducing medicine for 24 hours. Seven full days have passed since your symptoms appeared Moderate to Severe Disease – 14% or less will have severe COVID-19 disease Symptoms: Severe disease can cause pneumonia. About 50% will have shortness of breath and low oxygen levels due to shortness of breath. Most patients will have a fever, feel very tired and have a dry cough. To recover you will be in the hospital for a few days. Hospital care may include oxygen. You may have chest pain and exercise intolerance if you have inflammation on your heart. Full recovery may take about a month or more and the WHO recommends home isolation for at least two weeks after symptoms are gone. Critical Disease – 5% or less will have critical illness related to COVID-19 disease requiring ICU care Symptoms: Severe COVID-19 and pneumonia can lead to critical illness, including acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), cardiac disease, organ dysfunction and shock. Mechanical ventilator support or other advanced therapies such as extracorporeal oxygenation (heart/lung) machines may be required to keep organs working while the body fights the virus.

91d34ff2-28a4-4978-b7fc-1d0a3c66bd28,"Lipid storm in severe COVID-19 linked to high COX/LOX pathway activity A potentially valuable new study discusses the role of lipids in the hyper-inflammatory phenomena that take place within the lungs of patients with severe or critical COVID-19. Involving a large variety of specialized lipids with biological activity, this process includes the generation and release of pro and anti-inflammatory lipids. The study appeared as a preprint on the server in December 2020. Study: Lipid storm within the lungs of severe COVID-19 patients: Extensive levels of cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase-derived inflammatory metabolites. Image Credit: Kateryna Kon / Shutterstock In the large majority of cases, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection is mild or even asymptomatic. However, in a significant percentage, the disease manifests as bilateral pneumonia with exaggerated inflammation, progressive respiratory compromise, and the onset of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which may make it necessary to put the patient on mechanical ventilation. The autopsy findings in such patients show lungs with diffuse damage to the alveoli, small and medium vessel thrombosis, pulmonary embolism with the infiltration of inflammatory cells, and a dysregulated systemic inflammatory scenario called a . This is due to the release of a cascade of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, IL-7 granulocyte-colony stimulating factor, and is an important player in the lethal nature of the illness. The researchers from Canada and Morocco sought to draw attention to the other immunological effector molecules, such as bioactive lipids, that participate in this prolonged state of inflammation. Eicosanoids and their metabolites are lipids known to promote the recruitment and activation of immune cells and platelets. Conversely, specialized pro-resolving mediators (SPMs) are lipids, mostly docosanoids, that reduce inflammation and enhance tissue recovery. The current study aims to measure the levels of these specialized lipid mediators in the lung. The researchers used bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from 33 patients with COVID-19-linked illness who were on mechanical ventilation and from 25 controls. Earlier, the levels of various circulating cytokines have been extensively assessed. Thus, the current analysis focused on bioactive lipids in the lung fluid to discover a possible """" in severe COVID-19. The first assay was for cyclo-oxygenase (COX) pathway metabolites. In healthy people, the only COX compounds found were PGD2, and 12-HHTrE, derived from the enzyme thromboxane synthase. The former was eight times more common. PGD2 is a molecule that enhances the recruitment and activation of eosinophils, basophils, and other cells of the innate lymphoid series, its activity being mediated through the DP2 receptor. In patients with COVID-19, there was a marked increase in COX metabolites across the board, probably due to the hike in the COX inducer, IL-1β. Of the 33 patients, 27 had measurable levels of PGD2 and 6-keto-PGF1α (derived from PGI2), and all showed the presence of PGE2, PGF2α, thromboxane B2 (TXB2), derived from TXA2, and 12-HHTrE. The most significant increase was in TXB2, followed by smaller increases in PGE2 and 12-HHTrE. Several of these are associated with bronchoconstriction and with the recruitment and activation of inflammatory cells and of platelets, fitting in with the observed picture in COVID-19.   PGE2 is anti-inflammatory, acting via the EP2 and EP4 receptors to increase cAMP levels in the cells. It thus inhibits the activity of white cells involved in innate immunity. PGE2 and PGI2 may have beneficial effects on the lungs by reducing leukocyte activation and enhancing microvascular dilation, respectively. Levels of cyclooxygenase-derived metabolites in the BAL fluids of healthy and severe COVID-19 patients. BALs were obtained and processed as described in Methods. A) Results are from the BALs from 25 healthy subjects and 33 severe COVID-19 patients. P values were obtained by performing a Mann-Whitney test: **** = p < 0.0001. B-E) Correlation tests were performed with COVID-19 patients by using the non-parametric Spearman’s rank. P<0.05 was the threshold of significance. The linear regression is represented with a solid line and the best-fit lines of 95% confidence are represented with dotted lines. ARDS is also associated with leukotriene (LT) activity, these being very powerful bioactive lipids. The study examined the levels of LTs formed via the 5- and 15-lipooxygenase pathways and found that they were not detectable in healthy individuals. The exception was LTB4, found in about 15%. In COVID-19 patients, however, both LTB4 and its metabolite were increased to levels similar to those in the BAL of patients with ARDS. The ratio of these compounds favored omega-oxidation of LTB4. Both TXB2 and LTB4 were strongly correlated. Glycyrrhizin in licorice root neutralizes SARS-CoV-2 in vitro by inhibiting the main protease Mpro Study reveals possible SARS-CoV-2 escape mutant that may re-infect immune individuals Could Ivermectin be an effective antiviral against SARS-CoV-2? Again, the association between the COX pathway and LT synthesis may also indicate the role played by the latter in causing inflammatory lung damage in severe COVID-19. Though LTB4 is linked to antiviral defense, the omega-oxidation products of LTB4 are also increased, similar to the situation observed in cystic fibrosis and in severe burns, suggestive of poorly controlled infection. Most patients with severe COVID-19 also had higher cysteinyl-LTs, LTE4 and EXE4, with the latter being higher in many cases. These are metabolites of the 5- and 15-lipooxygenase (LOX) pathways, respectively. The researchers also found a correlation between LTB4 and EXE4 levels, as with the levels of most of the bioactive lipids measured here. EXE4 levels in blood and BALF was positively correlated with blood eosinophil counts. They next turned their attention to other fatty acid metabolites processed via the 12- and 15-LOX pathways. They found a significant but smaller increase in 12- and 15-HETE, suggesting increased AA metabolism as well as increased activity of the 15-LOX pathway in severe COVID-19. These were correlated with TXB2 levels. They also found evidence of increased non-enzymatic oxidation of AA and LA, indicating a burst of oxidative activity in these patients' lungs. They postulate that severe COVID-19 patients have increased arachidonic acid (AA) production and metabolism. In support, they cite their findings of markedly higher precursor molecules, namely, linoleic acid (LA), AA, docosapentaenoic acid n-3 (DPAn-3), and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), in the BALF of these patients, but without a corresponding change in eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) levels. This suggests that multiple phospholipases A2 contribute to this lipidomic profile. All the fatty acids were inversely related to the liver enzymes AST and ALT and positively to the ratio of platelets to lymphocytes. However, parameters such as blood counts, AST and ALT, or CRP, showed poor correlation with any of these metabolites. These samples also contain inflammation resolving molecules, SPMs, like 14- and 17-HDHA, at increased levels. While undetectable in all healthy individuals, multiple SPMs were found in the severe COVID-19 patients, with LXA4 being at the highest level. This signifies that both the 5- and 15-LOX pathways are involved in severe COVID-19. The levels of the SMPs correlated with each other but not with the level of DHA. This suggests that the rise in D-series pro-resolving molecules is due primarily to high 15-LOX activity, and not merely the greater availability of DHA. LXA4 levels correlated well with other compounds from the 5- and 15-LOX pathways since it is a product of these pathways, and also with TXB4 and other prostaglandin molecules. The study also shows the co-existence of prostaglandins, leukotrienes and SPMs in a situation of acute lung inflammation. They may mediate the enhancement of host defenses to limit the infection. The levels of SPMs are probably proportional to the activity of biosynthetic enzymes rather than those in the LOX pathway, acting on EPA and DHA, both of which are omega-3 fatty acids. Most of the lipids found in the current study showed a high degree of correlation. The rise in the levels of the bioactive lipids did not correlate with the levels of fatty acids in the blood, suggesting the greater role played by the activation of enzymes such as COX and LOX in this process. There are many drugs directed at inhibition of the prostaglandin pathway, such as the corticosteroid dexamethasone. This drug reduces symptom severity and mortality in severe COVID-19, reduces COX-2 expression by inhibiting the production of prostaglandins and also, perhaps, TXA2. Some suggest that it also increases the production of SPMs, limiting the infection. Further study is required. Aspirin, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), is also a COX inhibitor and has been suggested to reduce COVID-19 severity and adverse outcomes. The 5-LOX inhibitor Zileuton could also play a role in reducing LT production since it is already approved for the treatment of asthma and has a good safety profile. The drug Ramotraban, which inhibits both DP2/TP pathways, could be a good choice for testing in this disease. Another candidate is the phosphodiesterase 4 inhibitor Roflumilast, which might increase cAMP levels, thus inhibiting AA release and thereby reducing the output of both prostaglandins and leukotrienes. Adenosine and PGE2 are known for their anti-inflammatory effects mediated via their inhibition of many white cell functions associated with inflammation. Of course, the action of phosphodiesterase inhibitors reduces PGE2 levels, but the residual PGE2 is amplified in its anti-inflammatory activity. The authors conclude, ""Our data unmask that in addition to the recognized cytokine storm previously documented, lung fluids of SARS-CoV-2-infected patients indicate that a lipid storm also occurs. The rich library of governmental health agencies-approved lipid modulators might provide beneficial and usually low-cost add-ons to the current therapeutic arsenal utilized to diminish the severity of COVID-19 and possibly additional coronavirus-mediated infections."" publishes preliminary scientific reports that are not peer-reviewed and, therefore, should not be regarded as conclusive, guide clinical practice/health-related behavior, or treated as established information.

26c446a0-cb14-4927-b6ad-debb17730c83,"It is not news that eating a balanced diet helps to maintain our overall health. But for asthma patients, the benefits are even more pronounced. Different dietary patterns have positive or negative effects on the risk of developing asthma, control of symptoms and exacerbations, and lung function deterioration. Chronic inflammation of the airways is characteristic of asthma. High saturated fat and low fiber intake have been associated with increased airway inflammation (neutrophilic and eosinophilic). Conversely, fruit and vegetables (good sources of fiber and antioxidants) appear to lower airway inflammation. The Western diet generally contains large amounts of refined grains, red meat, processed and fast foods, sugar, and dairy products. This diet is pro-inflammatory due to a lack antioxidants (which increase susceptibility to oxidative stress) and high levels of saturated fats (which stimulate the innate immune system). Some forms of asthma also prolong activation of the immune system. Ongoing systemic inflammation leads to enhanced inflammation of the airways, an increased rate of exacerbations and worsening lung function. Higher consumption of meat linked with increased wheezing in children Children with asthma having fewer attacks amid the coronavirus pandemic, study says Study discusses steep drop off from asthma-related ED visits during spring 2020 COVID-19 In contrast, the typical Mediterranean diet (consisting of large amounts of fruit, vegetables, wholegrains and seafood) contains many anti-inflammatory nutrients, including unsaturated fatty acids and antioxidants. Antioxidants, such as vitamins A, C and E, reduce the lung inflammation that results from cellular damage by free radicals. Sources: fruit and vegetables. Vitamin D reduces the risk of patients developing more severe asthma. Sources: milk, eggs, fish, and sunshine. Omega-3 fatty acids may help to reduce asthma symptoms. Sources: cold-water fish, nuts, seeds Saturated fat leads to increased immune-activated airway inflammation. Sources: fast food, dairy products Sulfites (preservatives) and sodium can trigger asthma symptoms. Sources: wine, dried fruit, pickles, shrimp, and salt The bacteria in the gut ferment fiber, which produces metabolites, such as short-chain fatty acids. These molecules can modify the immune response, which has downstream effects on airway inflammation and sensitivity in animals with allergic airways disease. Diets rich in fiber can modify the composition of microbial species in the colon and create an environment that is more protective against allergic airway responses. A high-fat diet also alters the balance of gut microbiota. In contrast, however, it increases the number of invasive bacteria, reduces the levels of protective bacteria and short-chain fatty acids, and subsequently increases the risk of inflammation. The effects of these changes on asthmatic immune responses is not known. Food allergies are a much greater risk in asthma sufferers. When the immune system detects a food allergen, it releases histamine, which causes the symptoms of an allergic reaction. It can also trigger asthma-like symptoms, such as wheezing, coughing and breathing difficulties, and may lead to a life-threatening asthma attack. Therefore it is important that asthma patients avoid any foods to which they are allergic. The asthmatic population has higher rates of obesity. can lead to poorer disease outcomes, such as decreased control, and increased exacerbations and medication use. Therefore, eating a healthy diet may be beneficial for asthma patients not only by the direct effects of particular food groups, but also by helping with weight loss. There is a growing awareness around the effects of diet on the development and control of asthma. Understanding how different foods can affect their symptoms can help asthma patients make beneficial choices to improve their health. A higher intake of fruit and vegetables appears to have the most positive dietary impact on the development and control of asthma. A multidisciplinary approach that includes a healthy diet and physical activity is a promising strategy for disease management, as well as prevention. Guilleminault L, et al.

Anticoagulation in COVID Pro Con Debate with Drs Todd Bull and Eric Schmidt “We’re going be stronger”: A Frontline Physician’s View of COVID-19 Reviewed by: Infection Prevention Specialist, Rosine Angbanzan, MPH The COVID-19 virus is a new coronavirus that has not been previously identified. It was first discovered in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. What are the symptoms and complications that the COVID-19 virus can cause? Common symptoms often reported by patients with COVID-19 include mild to severe respiratory illness with fever, cough, and difficulty breathing. Washing your hands frequently with an alcohol-based hand rub or with soap and water, and drying hands thoroughly using paper towels or a warm air dryer. These do not kill the virus: Using UV lamps; spraying your body with alcohol or chlorine. How long does it take for the COVID-19 virus to make you sick? It takes between 2 and 10 days before people who are infected become sick and develop a fever. Can packages mailed from China give me the COVID-19 virus? No. People receiving packages from China are not at risk of contracting the COVID-19 virus because it does not survive long on objects, such as letters or packages. Can my house pet get the COVID-19 virus and give it to me? Currently, there is no evidence that pets such as dogs or cats can be infected with the COVID-19 virus. Always wash your hands with soap and water after contact with pets to prevent your pet from passing common bacteria such as E.coli and Salmonella to you. I had the pneumonia vaccine, does it protect me against the COVID-19 virus? No. Currently there is no vaccine for the COVID-19 virus. Does using a nasal rinse or mouth wash protect me against the COVID-19 virus? No. Using nasal rinses regularly helps manage allergy symptoms and help you recover more quickly from the common cold. There is no evidence that mouthwash protects you from the COVID-19 virus. Does eating garlic help protect me from the COVID-19 virus? Garlic does have some antimicrobial properties, but there is no evidence that eating garlic can protect you from the COVID-19 virus. Does sesame seed oil on my skin block the COVID-19 virus? No. What age groups are most susceptible to the COVID-19 virus? People with medical conditions including asthma, diabetes, and heart disease, and older people are more vulnerable to the COVID-19 virus and the related COVID-19 disease, but anyone of any age can be infected. Protect yourself by using good hand and respiratory hygiene. Can antibiotics prevent and treat the the COVID-19 virus? No, antibiotics are only an effective treatment for bacterial infections. Some patients who are hospitalized for COVID-19, may receive antibiotics for possible bacterial co-infection. What can I do to prevent getting sick from the COVID-19 virus? Wash your hands often with soap and water or alcohol-based hand sanitizer Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth, especially with unwashed hands Avoid close contact with people who are showing symptoms of illness Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces Cover your cough or sneezes with a tissue or cough into your elbow COVID-19 (Coronavirus) Patient Education Materials Learn more about COVID-19 and how it affects specific health conditions in these printable patient education materials. 1400 Jackson Street Denver, Colorado 80206 303.398.1355 877.225.5654 ©2020 National Jewish Health  ",113,asthma and covid,-1.8695851564407349,72

Although the actual cause of asthma is not known, many studies have shown that several factors can lead to the development of asthma. These factors include a person's genetics, development and growth of the lungs and immune system, various infections and exposures in the environment. It is widely accepted that asthma is a disease that can be inherited. However, the gene or genes that are involved are not clearly identified. It is believed that the genes linked to asthma involve the lungs and the immune system. It is well known that the atopic diseases - atopic dermatitis, allergic rhinitis and asthma - are commonly found in one form or another within families. The early months and years of a child's life are critical times during which a baby can develop or become susceptible to developing asthma. The abnormal development and growth of the lungs can increase a person's risk for developing asthma. Premature babies born with lungs not fully developed are more susceptible to colds and other respiratory infections. In some cases, an infection can cause inflammation and injure lung tissue. If the baby is exposed to secondhand smoke at this time, more damage to the lungs may occur and change how the lungs function. Many studies have shown that children and adults with asthma have an immune system that responds differently from those who do not have asthma. Many of these people with asthma are allergic and will react to things that do not cause problems in others. Their immune system overreacts when they come in contact with everyday substances such as , , or . In some cases, the immune system may overreact to other substances, such as a virus or bacteria, and increase the risk of asthma. There are many non-allergic or non-immunologic exposures in the environment that can increase the chance of developing asthma. Exposure to irritants on a long-term basis, such as secondhand smoke in the home, is a major risk factor for developing asthma. Other exposures like this are indoor chemicals and air pollution. Some studies suggest that certain infections or allergy exposure during the first years of life may also affect the development of asthma. More research is being done to better understand the role of genetics, infections, exposures, and the immune system in the development of asthma and other allergic disorders. This information may help to prevent the development of these problems in the future.

A perspective on potential antibody-dependent enhancement of SARS-CoV-2 A perspective on potential antibody-dependent enhancement of SARS-CoV-2   ,   &     , –() Antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of disease is a general concern for the development of vaccines and antibody therapies because the mechanisms that underlie antibody protection against any virus have a theoretical potential to amplify the infection or trigger harmful immunopathology. This possibility requires careful consideration at this critical point in the pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Here we review observations relevant to the risks of ADE of disease, and their potential implications for SARS-CoV-2 infection. At present, there are no known clinical findings, immunological assays or biomarkers that can differentiate any severe viral infection from immune-enhanced disease, whether by measuring antibodies, T cells or intrinsic host responses. In vitro systems and animal models do not predict the risk of ADE of disease, in part because protective and potentially detrimental antibody-mediated mechanisms are the same and designing animal models depends on understanding how antiviral host responses may become harmful in humans. The implications of our lack of knowledge are twofold. First, comprehensive studies are urgently needed to define clinical correlates of protective immunity against SARS-CoV-2. Second, because ADE of disease cannot be reliably predicted after either vaccination or treatment with antibodies—regardless of what virus is the causative agent—it will be essential to depend on careful analysis of safety in humans as immune interventions for COVID-19 move forward. The benefit of passive antibodies in ameliorating infectious diseases was recognized during the 1918 influenza pandemic. Since then, hyperimmune globulin has been widely used as pre- and post-exposure prophylaxis for hepatitis A, hepatitis B, chickenpox, rabies and other indications for decades without evidence of ADE of disease (see Box for definition of terms). The detection of antibodies has also been a reliable marker of the effectiveness of the many licensed human vaccines. The antiviral activity of antibodies is now known to be mediated by the inhibition of entry of infectious viral particles into host cells (neutralization) and by the effector functions of antibodies as they recruit other components of the immune response. Neutralizing antibodies are directed against viral entry proteins that bind to cell surface receptors, either by targeting viral proteins that are required for fusion or by inhibiting fusion after attachment (Fig. ). Antibodies can cross-neutralize related viruses when the entry proteins of the viruses share epitopes—the part of a protein to which the antibody attaches. Antibodies also eliminate viruses through effector functions triggered by simultaneous binding of the antigen-binding fragment (Fab) regions of immunoglobulin G (IgG) to viral proteins on the surfaces of viruses or infected cells, and of the fragment crystallizable (Fc) portion of the antibody to Fc gamma receptors (FcγRs) that are expressed by immune cells (Fig. ). Antibodies that mediate FcγR- and complement-dependent effector functions may or may not have neutralizing activity, can recognize other viral proteins that are not involved in host-cell entry and can be protective in vivo independent of any Fab-mediated viral inhibition. Recent advances in FcR biology have identified four activating FcγRs (FcγRI, FcγRIIa, FcγRIIc and FcγRIIIa) and one inhibitory FcγR (FcγRIIb) that have various Fc ligand specificities and cell-signalling motifs. The neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) has been described to support antibody recycling and B and T cell immunity through dendritic cell endocytosis of immune complexes. Natural killer cells recognize IgG–viral protein complexes on infected cells via FcγRs to mediate antibody-dependent cytotoxicity, and myeloid cells use these interactions to clear opsonized virions and virus-infected cells by antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis (Fig. ). The complement pathway is also activated by Fc binding to the complement component C1q, resulting in the opsonization of viruses or infected cells and the recruitment of myeloid cells. Antibody effector functions also contribute to antiviral T-cell-mediated immunity in vivo. Notably, new knowledge about Fc effector functions has led to improved passive-antibody therapies through Fc modifications that reduce or enhance interactions with FcγRs, lengthen the half-life of the antibody and potentially enhance antigen presentation to T cells, providing what is termed a vaccinal effect. Although their importance for protection is indisputable, the concern about ADE of disease arises from the possibility that antibodies present at the time of infection may increase the severity of an illness. The enhancement of disease by antibody-dependent mechanisms has been described clinically in children given formalin-inactivated respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) or measles vaccines in the 1960s, and in dengue haemorrhagic fever due to secondary infection with a heterologous dengue serotype. For example, antibodies may enable viral entry into FcγR-bearing cells, bypassing specific receptor-mediated entry; this is typically followed by degradation of the virus, but could amplify infection if progeny virions can be produced. Although cytokine release triggered by interactions between the virus, antibody and FcγR is also highly beneficial—owing to direct antiviral effects and the recruitment of immune cells—tissue damage initiated by viral infection may be exacerbated. While recognizing that other mechanisms of immune enhancement may occur, the purpose of this Perspective is to review clinical experiences, in vitro analyses and animal models relevant to understanding the potential risks of antibody-dependent mechanisms and their implications for the development of the vaccines and antibodies that will be essential to stop the COVID-19 pandemic. Our objective is to evaluate the hypothesis that antibody-mediated enhancement is a consequence of low-affinity antibodies that bind to viral entry proteins but have limited or no neutralizing activity; antibodies that were elicited by infection with or vaccination against a closely related serotype, termed ‘cross-reactive’ antibodies; or suboptimal titres of otherwise potently neutralizing antibodies. We assess whether there are experimental approaches that are capable of reliably predicting ADE of disease in humans and conclude that this is not the case. Enhancement of disease severity in an infected person or animal when an antibody against a pathogen—whether acquired by an earlier infection, vaccination or passive transfer—worsens its virulence by a mechanism that is shown to be antibody-dependent. Enhancement of disease severity in an infected person or animal that had been vaccinated against the pathogen compared to unvaccinated controls. This results from deleterious T cell responses or ADE of disease and is usually difficult to link to one or the other. Neither ADE of disease nor vaccine enhancement of disease have established, objective clinical signs or biomarkers that can be used to distinguish these events from severe disease caused by the pathogen. Carefully controlled human studies of sufficient size enable the detection of an increased frequency of severe cases in cohorts given passive antibodies or vaccines compared to the control group, and atypical manifestations of infection can be identified should they occur. Mechanisms of antibody-mediated protection and the potential for ADE of infection The essential benefits of antibodies are mediated by several well-defined mechanisms that also have the potential for ADE of infection. Protection as well as ADE of infection can be observed in various assays of virus–cell interactions. An observation of ADE of infection in vitro does not predict ADE of disease in humans or animals. Antibodies block viruses by interfering with their binding to receptors on host cells or inhibiting changes in the viral protein needed for entry. Antibodies bind viruses to cells of the immune system via Fcγ receptors on the cell surface and internalization of viruses typically results in their degradation. Instead of protection, ADE of infection may occur if antibody binding improves the capacity of the viral protein to enable entry of the virus into its target cell, or if the virus has the capacity to evade destruction and produce more viruses after Fcγ receptor-mediated entry. Antibodies that bind viruses and Fcγ receptors on cells of the immune system trigger the release of cytokines that inhibit viral spread and recruit other immune cells to eliminate infected cells. Although a part of the normal protective immune response, this can result in ADE of disease if excessive. Antibodies binding to virus or viral proteins on host cells may activate the complement cascade, a series of plasma proteins that together have a role in protective immunity through multiple mechanisms. Formation of large complexes of antibodies and viral proteins (antigens) can lead to immune complex deposition that activates complement. When excessive, antibody-dependent activation of complement may result in tissue damage and potential ADE of disease. Antibody-mediated mechanisms in the development of memory immunity: Antibodies bound to viruses or viral proteins can be taken up Fcγ receptors into immune system cells that process the antigens for activation and expansion of B cells and T cells. These mechanisms, which are critical for the establishment of memory immunity against future encounters with the virus, balance the potential risk of amplification of infection after viral uptake by some immune system cells. The use of ADE to denote enhanced severity of disease must be rigorously differentiated from ADE of infection—that is, from the binding, uptake and replication of the virus, cytokine release or other activities of antibodies detected in vitro. The first principle is that an antibody-dependent effect in vitro does not represent or predict ADE of disease without proof of a role for the antibody in the pathogenesis of a more severe clinical outcome. A second principle is that animal models for the evaluation of human polyclonal antibodies or monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) should be judged with caution because FcRs that are engaged by IgGs are species-specific, as is complement activation. Antibodies can have very different properties in animals that are not predictive of those in the human host, because the effector functions of antibodies are altered by species-specific interactions between the antibody and immune cells. Animals may also develop antibodies against a therapeutic antibody that limit its effectiveness, or cause immunopathology. In addition, the pathogenesis of a model virus strain in animals does not fully reflect human infection because most viruses are highly species-specific. These differences may falsely support either protective or immunopathological effects of vaccines and antibodies. A third principle is that the nature of the antibody response depends on the form of the viral protein that is recognized by the immune system, thus determining what epitopes are presented. Protective and non-protective antibodies can be elicited to different forms of the same protein. A fourth principle is that mechanisms of pathogenesis in the human host differ substantially among viruses, or even between strains of a particular virus. Therefore, findings regarding the effects of passive antibodies or vaccine-induced immunity on outcomes cannot be extrapolated with confidence from one viral pathogen to another. As background for considering the risks of ADE of disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, it is important to closely examine clinical circumstances relevant to the hypothesis that antibodies predispose to ADE of disease by amplifying infection or through damaging inflammatory responses. We focus on the clinical experiences with RSV, influenza and dengue to demonstrate the complexities of predicting from in vitro assays or animal models whether passively transferred or vaccine-induced antibodies will cause ADE of disease, and of differentiating ADE from a severe illness that is unrelated to pre-existing antibodies. In a study of RSV in children under the age of 2 years, there were more cases requiring hospitalization for RSV-related bronchiolitis or pneumonia—especially in those aged between 6 and 11 months—in children who were immunized with a formalin-inactivated (FI)-RSV vaccine (10/101) than in children who were not immunized with FI-RSV (control cases; 2/173). This was also observed in a second study (18/23 hospitalizations of immunized children, with two deaths, compared with 1/21 control cases) and in two smaller studies. This condition has been termed vaccine-associated enhanced respiratory disease. Later studies showed that the ratio of fusion protein (F) binding antibodies to neutralizing antibodies was higher in the sera of 36 vaccinated compared to 24 naturally infected children, suggesting that non-neutralizing antibodies to an abnormal F-protein conformation may have been a predisposing factor. Complement activation, detected by the presence of C4d in the lungs of the two fatal cases, suggested that antibody–F protein immune complexes led to more severe disease. However, C4d deposition can result from the lectin-binding pathway as well as from the classical pathway, and C4 can be produced by epithelial cells and activated by tissue proteases. Whether harmful RSV-specific T cells were induced was not determined: although lymphocyte transformation frequencies were higher, this early method did not differentiate antigen-specific responses from secondary cytokine stimulation or from CD4 and CD8 T cell responses, although CD4 T cell proliferation is more likely. Importantly, the FI-RSV clinical experience did not establish that vaccine-enhanced disease was antibody-dependent. Subsequently, in animal studies, the production of low-avidity antibodies due to insufficient Toll-like-receptor signalling and lack of antibody maturation, and the formation of immune complexes have been implicated. However, a definitive antibody-mediated mechanism of enhancement has not been documented, and models have also identified Th2-skewing of the T cell response and lung eosinophilia with challenge after FI-RSV, raising the possibility that T cells contribute to vaccine-induced enhancement of RSV disease. Experience with RSV also includes more than 20 years of successful prophylaxis of high-risk infants with palivizumab, a mAb directed against pre- and post-fusion F protein. Importantly, this experience challenges a role for low neutralizing-antibody titres in the ADE of lung disease, because RSV morbidity does not increase as titres decrease. Further, if suboptimal neutralization were a factor, the failure of suptavumab—caused by F protein drift in RSV B strains—would be associated with ADE of disease; however, infections in such cases were not more severe. Clinical trials of an RSV mAb that has an extended half-life have shown a reduction in hospitalizations of around 80%, again supporting the concept that such treatments provide protection without a secondary risk from declining titres. mAbs against RSV have been consistently safe, even as the neutralizing capacity diminishes after administration. Influenza is instructive when considering the hypothesis that cross-reactive antibodies predispose to ADE of disease, because almost all humans contain antibodies that are not fully protective against antigenically drifted strains that emerge year after year. Instead, pre-existing immunity typically provides some protection against a second viral strain of the same subtype. Antibodies against neuraminidase and against the stem or head regions of haemagglutinin also correlate with protection. When an H1N1 strain with a haemagglutinin shift emerged in the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, some epidemiological studies linked a greater incidence of medically treated illness to previous vaccination against influenza, whereas others did not. One report correlated cross-reactive, low-avidity and poorly neutralizing antibodies with risk in middle-aged people—the demographic with a higher prevalence of severe 2009 H1N1. Immunopathology and C4d were reported in the lungs of six fatal cases in this age group, indicating that antibody-dependent complement activation through immune-complex formation may have been a contributing factor. However, as noted above, other mechanisms lead to C4d deposition, and lung T lymphocytosis attributed to T cell epitopes shared by 2009 H1N1 and earlier H1N1 strains was also observed, raising the possibility that T cells played a part. Another study correlated pre-existing antibodies that mediated infected cell lysis by complement activation with protection against H1N1 in children. In a porcine model, enhanced pulmonary disease was observed after vaccination with an inactivated influenza H1N2 strain followed by heterologous H1N1 challenge. The animals had non-neutralizing antibodies that bound haemagglutinin in the stem region, but did not block the binding of haemagglutinin to its cell receptor and accelerated fusion in vitro by a Fab-dependent mechanism (Fig. ). Lung pathology was also observed in mice treated with a mAb that induced a conformational change in haemagglutinin that facilitated fusion. Such a mechanism was postulated to have potential clinical relevance when the infecting influenza virus has undergone antigenic shift and the infection boosts non-neutralizing haemagglutinin-stem-binding antibodies without a neutralizing antibody response. The likelihood of these circumstances occurring is unclear. Further, human influenza vaccines are not known to elicit immunodominant antibodies with this property. Importantly, as noted above, stem antibodies correlate both with resistance to infection and to severe disease in humans, indicating that this interesting mechanism is not predictive of disease causation for stem-specific antibodies. In addition, mAbs can be screened to avoid fusion-enhancing properties, and fusion is not intrinsically accelerated by low titres of neutralizing antibodies. Notably, infants benefit from immunization from six months of age, despite their limited capacity to produce affinity-matured, high-avidity antibodies. Overall, widespread annual surveillance of influenza does not reveal ADE of disease, even though cross-reactive strains and vaccine mismatches are common. There are four viral serotypes of dengue that circulate in endemic areas. Although severe dengue haemorrhagic fever and shock syndrome occurs during primary infection, possible ADE of disease has been associated with poorly neutralizing cross-reactive antibodies against a heterologous dengue serotype. Taking into account the difficulty of classification due to the overlapping signs of severe infection and ADE of disease, clinical experience indicates that ADE of disease does occur, but is rare in endemic areas (36/6,684 participants; around 0.5%) and is correlated with a narrow range of low pre-existing antibody titres (1:21–1:80). In the same study, high antibody titres were found to be protective. The challenge of predicting how to avoid such a rare immune-enhancing situation against the background of protection conferred by dengue neutralizing antibodies implies that it will be equally difficult for SARS-CoV-2. When considering conditions that may result in ADE of disease, it is important to emphasize that dengue differs from other viruses because it targets monocytes, macrophages and dendritic cells and can produce progeny virus in these cells, which abundantly express both viral entry receptors and FcγRs. ADE of infection can be demonstrated in vitro with FcγR-expressing cells—typically with cross-reactive antibodies that have low or no neutralizing activity, have low affinity, or target non-protective epitopes, or if a narrow range of antibody and infectious virus concentrations is tested. The mechanism of ADE of disease associated with dengue therefore depends on three factors: the circulation of multiple strains of a virus that have variable antigenicity, a virus that is capable of replication in FcγR-expressing myeloid cells and sequential infection of the same person with these different viral serotypes. Despite these pre-disposing conditions and the fact that dengue is an increasingly common infectious disease, severe dengue disease is rare. The role of pre-existing immunity has also been a concern for the quadrivalent live attenuated dengue vaccine (Dengvaxia), because higher hospitalization rates were observed among vaccine recipients who were initially seronegative—especially children aged between two and eight years. Other explanations for this outcome include poor efficacy against serotypes 1–3, or the failure to induce cell-mediated immunity because T cells primarily recognize non-structural proteins that are not present in the chimeric vaccine. Importantly, the cause of death in 14 fatal cases of dengue could not be determined by the WHO (World Health Organization) Global Advisory Committee on Vaccine Safety, because a failure of vaccine protection could not be distinguished from immune enhancement by clinical or laboratory criteria. This experience underscores how difficult it is to predict the potential for vaccine-induced antibodies or a therapeutic antibody to enhance the severity of disease, because other mechanisms of pathogenesis that result in severe disease are potentially involved—even for the well-studied case of dengue. In other assessments of the risks and benefits of cross-reactive antibodies, infection with Zika—which, as with dengue, is a flavivirus—was less common in individuals who had previously been infected with dengue. In addition, the presence of cross-reactive antibodies has been associated with improved efficacy, as measured by the responses to a yellow fever vaccine in recipients who had received a Japanese encephalitis vaccine, and by association of the effectiveness of Dengvaxia with seropositivity for dengue at the time of immunization. In summary, these clinical experiences with RSV, influenza and dengue provide strong evidence that the circumstances that are proposed to lead to ADE of disease—including low affinity or cross-reactive antibodies with limited or no neutralizing activity or suboptimal titres—are very rarely implicated as the cause of severe viral infection in the human host. Furthermore, clinical signs, immunological assays or biomarkers that can differentiate severe viral infection from a viral infection enhanced by an immune mechanism have not been established. Assessing the risk of ADE of disease with SARS-CoV-2 Given the complexities described above, it is sobering to take on the challenge of predicting ADE of disease caused by SARS-CoV-2. Here we consider whether clinical circumstances point to a role for antibodies with poor or no neutralizing activity in severe COVID-19, incorporating relevant experience from disease caused by the common human coronaviruses, as well as by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Infection by SARS-CoV-2 is initiated by the binding of its fusion protein, the spike (S) protein, to the entry receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Other receptors for SARS-CoV-2, such as CD147, have also been reported. ACE2 is expressed on alveolar type II pneumocytes, airway epithelial cells, nasal tract goblet cells and ciliated cells, as well as on intestinal and other non-respiratory tract cells, as assessed by RNA expression. On most such cells, ACE2 seems to be expressed at low levels; however, it can be upregulated by interferons, which could theoretically promote infection if the virus overcomes interferon-induced barriers. FcγRIIa and FcγRIIIa were detected in alveolar, bronchial and nasal-cavity epithelial cells by single-cell RNA sequencing, but both fractions of positive cells and levels of expression per cell were considerably lower than for resident myeloid and natural killer cells. The moderate prevalence of both ACE2 and FcγRs results in poor co-occurrence, although this might be underestimated because of the dropout effect in single-cell transcriptomics. Co-expression of ACE2 and FcγRs therefore seems to be limited, which would mitigate against antibody-enhanced disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 via the dual-receptor mechanism proposed in dengue infection. When considering potential detrimental effects of antibodies, the presence or absence of cross-reactive antibodies against other human coronavirus (HCoV) strains has not been linked to whether SARS-CoV-2 infection is more severe, mild or asymptomatic, although antibodies that recognized the SARS-CoV-2 S2 subunit were detected in 12 out of 95 uninfected individuals. In two reports, 30–50% of SARS-CoV-2 seronegative or unexposed individuals had CD4 T cells that recognized the SARS-CoV-2 S protein. Previous infection with HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43 betacoronaviruses, or HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E alphacoronaviruses, is not known to predispose to more severe infection with the related virus from the same lineage. Conversely, the endemic nature of coronavirus infections indicates that infection in the presence of low levels of antibodies is common, providing a theoretical opportunity for ADE of disease—although these illnesses are mild—and suggesting that cross-protection may be transient. It is of interest that neither low neutralizing-antibody titres nor heterologous virus challenge were associated with enhanced disease in human studies of HCoV-229E. Although HCoV-NL63 also uses the ACE2 entry receptor, the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of HCoV-NL63 is structurally very different from that of SARS-CoV-2, which would limit antibody cross-reactivity. Antibodies to the S proteins of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2—and, to a much lesser extent, MERS-CoV—can cross-react, and both high-potency neutralizing antibodies that also mediate antibody-dependent cytotoxicity and antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis, as well as non-neutralizing antibodies, can be elicited against conserved S epitopes. However, the limited spread of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV means that it is not feasible to assess whether there is any ADE of disease due to SARS-CoV-2 attributable to cross-reactive antibodies. A finding that pre-existing antibodies for other coronaviruses correlate with the low incidence of symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection in children would support protection rather than a risk of disease enhancement. To answer this question, the broad application of serological assays that quantify antibodies to virus-specific and cross-reactive epitopes of human coronaviruses in relation to the outcomes of natural infection and of vaccine and antibody trials is required. The administration of passive antibodies could also reveal whether antibodies predispose to ADE of disease. In small studies, patients infected with SARS or MERS received polyclonal antibodies without apparent worsening of their illness, and from a meta-analysis it was concluded that early treatment with plasma from patients that had recovered from SARS-CoV infection correlated with a better outcome. In 10 patients with severe COVID-19 that were given plasma with neutralizing titres greater than 1:640 (200 ml) at a median of 16.5 days after disease onset, viraemia was no longer detected and clinical parameters improved within 3 days. Similar findings were reported for 5 severely ill patients treated with plasma with neutralizing titres greater than 1:40; however, another study found no difference in outcome between 52 treated and 51 untreated patients. The evidence that COVID-19 does not worsen after treatment with plasma from convalescent patients has been substantially reinforced by a study of 20,000 patients who were severely ill with the disease, showing an adverse event incidence of 1–3%. If further substantiated, these findings will markedly diminish the concern that clinically relevant amplification of infection, release of immunopathogenic cytokines or immune-complex deposition in the presence of a high viral load is mediated by SARS-CoV-2 antibody-dependent mechanisms. High-dose intravenous polyclonal IgG (IVIg)—which is used to treat systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), idiopathic thrombocytopenia and Kawasaki syndrome—is thought to exert its beneficial effects through the activation of FcγR inhibitory signalling. Because severe COVID-19 could reflect immune dysregulation, a benefit and/or lack of adverse effects in patients receiving plasma from convalescent individuals might reflect the suppression of inflammation induced by IgG, rather than supporting the conclusion that passive antibodies do not trigger ADE of disease through Fab- or Fc-dependent mechanisms. However, the dose of IgG administered to patients with SLE (2 g per kg over 5 days) is much higher than the dose received from convalescent plasma, based on the expected IgG concentrations in plasma (around 500–800 mg per 100 ml) and the amount of convalescent plasma received (200 ml). Assuming a concentration of 1,600 mg per 200 ml, the IgG levels after receiving convalescent plasma (1.6 g per 80 kg) would be approximately 100-fold less than after receiving IVIg (160 g per 80 kg). It is therefore unlikely that the immunomodulatory effects of polyclonal non-antigen-specific IgG dampened possible manifestations of enhanced illness. Clinically, infections with SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are often biphasic, with more severe respiratory symptoms developing after a week or more and, in some patients, in association with the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines. This pattern has led to the hypothesis that an emerging immune response—including low-avidity, poorly neutralizing antibodies—could exacerbate the disease. However, reports that relate antibody titres to disease progression involve relatively few patients, and are confounded by the higher levels of antigen seen in severe infections that are predicted to drive a stronger immune response or a heightened innate inflammatory response. One report of three cases of fatal SARS-CoV infection reported that high neutralizing anti-S antibodies and a prominent CD163 monocyte/macrophage pulmonary infiltrate of cells were associated with reduced expression of TGF-β and CD206, which are proposed to be markers of macrophages with beneficial functions. However, quantitative analysis of these changes and evidence of an antibody-mediated pathology that is dependent on these cells were not reported. A recent meta-analysis found no relationship between the kinetics of antibody responses to SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2 and clinical outcomes. At present, there is no evidence that ADE of disease is a factor in the severity of COVID-19. Instead, lung pathology is characterized by diffuse alveolar damage, pneumocyte desquamation, hyaline membranes, neutrophil or macrophage alveolar infiltrates and viral infection of epithelial cells and type II pneumocytes. Further, if instances of ADE of disease occur at all, the experience with dengue suggests that this or other types of immune enhancement will be rare and will occur under highly specific conditions. The aetiology of the inflammatory, Kawasaki-like syndrome that has been associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection in children is unknown, but has not been associated with antibody responses so far. In summary, current clinical experience is insufficient to implicate a role for ADE of disease, or immune enhancement by any other mechanism, in the severity of COVID-19 (Table ). Prospective studies that relate the kinetics and burden of infection and the host response—including the magnitude, antigen-specificity and molecular mechanisms of action of antibodies, antibody classes and T cell subpopulations—to clinical outcomes are needed to define the characteristics of a beneficial compared with a failed or a potentially detrimental host response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Although it will probably continue to be difficult to prove that ADE of disease is occurring, or to predict when it might occur, it should be possible to identify correlates of protection that can inform immune-based approaches to the COVID-19 pandemic. In vitro studies of the effects of antibodies on viral infection have been used extensively to seek correlates or predictors of ADE of disease (Table ). These efforts are complicated by the fact that the same antibody mechanisms that are often proposed to result in ADE of infection are responsible for protection from viral disease in vivo. Although infection was most often blocked by anti-S antibodies, several reports have shown antibody-dependent uptake of SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV S-pseudoviruses that was mediated by binding of the Fab component to the virus and the Fc component to FcγR on the target cell (Fig. ) using in vitro methods. Importantly, viral uptake did not result in productive infection. An antibody that binds the S protein and mimics receptor-mediated entry to facilitate viral uptake has been described for MERS-CoV, but not for SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2. Although SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 do not infect myeloid cells, the productive infection of macrophages by MERS-CoV has been reported, albeit at low levels. It is notable that higher production of immune-cell-attracting chemokines was observed in myeloid cells infected by MERS-CoV but not in cells exposed to SARS-CoV, suggesting that productive infection has a greater effect on this response. The biology of the interactions of coronaviruses with cells expressing FcγRs is therefore very different from the targeting of FcγR-expressing myeloid cells by the dengue viruses. Conversely, in vitro methods can reliably define the properties of mAbs or of vaccine-induced antibodies—including their epitope specificity, binding affinity and avidity, and maturation as well as any potential to enhance fusion, together with their capacities for neutralization and antiviral Fc-dependent effector functions (Fig. ). Several mouse, rat and other small-animal models of SARS-CoV infection have used passive-antibody administration or immunization to investigate whether pre-existing antibodies protect against or enhance disease. Although vaccine enhancement of disease in these models could occur through other mechanisms, such studies can directly assess the protective or enhancing properties of passive antibodies (Table ). In the ferret model of SARS-CoV infection, a human mAb was found to protect the animals from infection; however, modified vaccinia Ankara expressing S protein (MVA-S) was not protective and liver inflammation was noted in this model. Pre- and post-exposure administration of a mAb against MERS-CoV protected mice from challenge, as assessed by lung viral load, lung pathology and weight loss. Three mAbs against SARS-CoV, given at a high dose before challenge, protected young and old mice against lung viral spread and inflammation, but had no effect when given after infection. Low doses were less protective, but no ADE of disease was observed. A caveat is that human mAbs were tested in the context of mouse FcγRs; however, this can be addressed using human FcgR transgenic animals. Both previous infection and passive transfer of mouse neutralizing antibodies partially protected 4–6-week-old mice against secondary infection with SARS-CoV, and no ADE of disease was observed despite low neutralizing titres. In another mouse study, passive transfer of SARS-CoV-immune serum was found to mediate protection by Fc-dependent monocyte effector function through antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis; however, natural killer cells, antibody-dependent cytotoxicity or complement-antibody complexes did not contribute to protection. In a mouse model of vaccination, which used SARS-CoV in which the E protein had been deleted as a live attenuated vaccine, induction of antibodies and T cell immunity and protection against lethal viral challenge was observed in mice from three age groups. By contrast, enhanced disease was observed in mice that were immunized with formalin- or ultraviolet-inactivated SARS-CoV. Whereas younger mice were protected, older mice developed pulmonary pathology with an eosinophil infiltrate; this suggests a detrimental Th2 response related to age, rather than ADE of disease. In some models, cellular immunopathology might be linked to Th17-mediated activation of eosinophils. In another report, mice given formalin- or ultraviolet-inactivated SARS-CoV or other vaccine formulations developed neutralizing antibodies and were protected from challenge, but also developed eosinophilic pulmonary infiltrates. This type of immunopathology has not been reported in fatal human coronavirus infections. Small-animal studies of SARS-CoV-2 infection are being reported rapidly. Neutralizing antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 were induced by immunizing rats with the RBD of the S protein and adjuvant. In vitro evaluation of the potential for enhanced uptake of SARS-CoV-2 using HEK293T cells expressing rat FcγRI in the presence or absence of ACE2 expression showed neutralization but no enhancement of viral entry. Mice that were given an mRNA vaccine expressing pre-fusion SARS-CoV-2 S protein developed neutralizing antibodies and S-protein-specific CD8 T cell responses that were protective against lung infection without evidence of immunopathology, and neutralizing mAbs against the RBD of the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 reduced lung infection and cytokine release. Passive transfer of a neutralizing antibody protected Syrian hamsters against high-dose SARS-CoV-2, as demonstrated by maintained weight and low lung viral titres. Similarly, hamsters immunized with recombinant SARS-CoV S protein trimer developed neutralizing antibodies and were protected against challenge. Whereas serum from vaccinated hamsters mediated FcγRIIb-dependent enhancement of SARS-CoV entry into B cell lines, virus replication was abortive in vitro and viral load and lung pathology were not increased in vaccinated animals. These data underscore that enhancement of viral entry into cells in vitro does not predict negative consequences in vivo, further highlighting the important gap between in vitro findings and the causes of ADE of disease in vivo. Unlike SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, feline infectious peritonitis virus is an alphacoronavirus that, as with dengue, has tropism for macrophages. Infection with this virus has been shown to be enhanced by pre-existing antibodies, especially those against the same strain. In non-human primates (NHPs), infection with SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2 results in viral spread to multiple tissues, including lungs. Rhesus macaques that were administered a high inoculum of SARS-CoV-2 by nasal, tracheal, ocular and oral routes had increased temperatures and respiratory rates for 1 day, and reduced appetite and dehydration for 9–16 days. Macaques that were euthanized at 3 days and 21 days had multifocal lung lesions, with alveolar septal thickening due to oedema and fibrin, small to moderate numbers of macrophages, a few neutrophils, minimal type II pneumocyte hyperplasia and some perivascular lymphocyte cuffing. SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins were detected in a few type I and type II pneumocytes, and alveolar macrophages and virions were found in type I pneumocytes. Although these foci of lung pathology have some similarities to those observed in human infection, NHPs develop minimal or no signs of respiratory or systemic betacoronavirus disease. After the outbreaks of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV disease, NHPs were used in the evaluation of several vaccine and antibody interventions (Supplementary Table ). In one study, FI-SARS-CoV reduced viraemia and protected against lung pathology in rhesus macaques, whereas in another study macaques given FI-SARS-CoV developed macrophage and lymphocytic infiltrates and alveolar oedema with fibrin deposition after challenge, indicating the difficulties of establishing consistent NHP models. Synthetic peptide vaccines have also been prepared using sera from convalescent patients to define immunodominant epitopes of SARS-CoV S protein. The vaccines were found to reduce pathology after SARS-CoV challenge unless the S protein of the vaccine included amino acids 597−603, suggesting an epitope-specific basis for the induction of lung pathology. However, these peptide constructs would not be expected to fully mimic antibody or T cell responses that would be elicited to the intact S protein. Two studies have reported the immunization of rhesus macaques with MVA expressing SARS-CoV S protein or an MVA control. In the first report, three out of four immunized macaques had no detectable shedding or enhanced lung infection 7 days after challenge. In the second report, immunization elicited polyclonal anti-S antibodies with neutralizing activity and reduced infection in three out of eight macaques after challenge. However, although the challenge inoculum was the same as in the first study, areas of diffuse alveolar damage were detected in six out of eight vaccinated macaques compared with one out of eight control animals euthanized at 7 days, as well as at 35 days. Immunization with MVA-S was associated with an accumulation of monocytes and macrophages, and with the detection of activated alveolar macrophages that produced pro-inflammatory MCP-1 and IL-8, which were were not observed in control animals. In a second cohort that was given polyclonal IgG from vaccinated macaques or control animals, loss of TGF-β and increased IL-6 production by activated pulmonary macrophages was observed in macaques that were pre-treated with anti-S IgG, and lung pathology was described as skewed towards immunopathological inflammation. However, it was not stated whether the histopathology was focal or widespread in the lungs, and immunopathology was not associated with impaired respiratory function in macaques evaluated for 21 days (passive anti-S) or for 35 days (MVA-S). Although differences in macrophage markers were associated with changes in the lungs, a causal relationship between anti-S antibodies and an antibody-dependent macrophage-mediated mechanism of more severe pathological changes was not explored, and whether MVA-S might have generated non-neutralizing antibodies that enhanced lung pathology was not assessed. It will therefore be important to define the epitope specificity and serum neutralization activity in these animal models, and potential T cell mechanisms will need to be excluded before enhanced immunopathology can be attributed to antibody mechanisms. The second study reporting immunization of rhesus macaques with MVA-S also described in vitro experiments using sera from patients who had recovered from SARS-CoV infection. However, only one out of eight sera samples elicited enhanced cytokine production by human macrophages in vitro. Because IL-8 production by macrophages treated with one of the serum samples was lower in the presence of FcγR-blocking antibody (no control serum), it was concluded that blocking FcγRs might be necessary to reduce lung damage caused by SARS-CoV. However, the finding was not confirmed with sera from other severe cases of SARS, and is subject to the caveat that in vitro studies cannot be taken as evidence of ADE of disease. In contrast to the immunopathology observed after immunization with MVA-S, other studies of SARS-CoV have suggested a protective effect of vaccine-induced antibodies. Using a purified SARS-CoV-infected cell lysate as a vaccine, cynomolgus macaques were protected from challenge, and low neutralizing antibody titres were not associated with ADE of disease. Further, African green monkeys with pre-existing antibody and/or T cells after primary SARS-CoV infection were protected from homologous re-challenge as assessed by lung virus titres, although the pulmonary inflammatory response was not different from that of primary infection. In additional studies, rhesus macaques immunized with a chimpanzee adenovirus (ChAdOx1 MERS) expressing MERS-CoV S protein, a recombinant S-RBD protein or a synthetic MERS-CoV S DNA vaccine, had decreased infection and no enhanced lung pathology upon challenge. The potential for immune enhancement of SARS-CoV-2 infection by antibody-dependent or other mechanisms has been assessed by infection and re-challenge of rhesus macaques. Out of two rhesus macaques that were re-challenged 28 days after initial infection—when neutralizing antibody titres were low (1:8–1:16)—neither exhibited viral shedding and one had no lung pathology. Immunity to SARS-CoV-2 in nine rhesus macaques—including the presence of neutralizing antibodies, antibody-mediated effector functions and antiviral CD4 and CD8 T cells—was associated with protection upon re-challenge at 35 days. When vaccines were tested, rhesus macaques immunized with purified β-propriolactone-inactivated SARS-CoV-2 in alum showed complete or partial protection against high-inoculum SARS-CoV-2 challenge, and histopathological analyses of lungs and other organs at 29 days showed no evidence of ADE of disease compared with control macaques. A large study involving 35 rhesus macaques, which were given prototype DNA vaccines expressing either full-length SARS-CoV-2 S protein or components of this protein, found that protection was correlated with the presence of neutralizing antibodies—and, notably, with Fc-dependent antibody effector functions—and there were no adverse outcomes after challenge. In studies of neutralizing mAbs (Supplementary Table ), viral titres and lung pathology after nasal challenge were reduced in rhesus macaques that were administered a mAb directed against a proteolytic cleavage site in the SARS-CoV S protein that is required for host-cell entry. Macaques given mAbs against MERS-CoV showed less pulmonary involvement and no worsening of disease with challenge. The prophylactic administration of mAbs against MERS-CoV to marmosets one day before challenge was associated with reduced lung pathology compared with the administration of control mAbs; mAbs were found to be protective when administered 2–12 h after challenge but not when given 1 day after challenge. These animal studies of coronavirus infections parallel the observation that the passive transfer of mAbs against RSV that have selected properties can be protective, whereas a particular vaccine formulation (FI-RSV) that is directed to the same viral protein can enhance disease. In summary, in most animal models—including NHPs—vaccination or the administration of passive mAbs have demonstrated protection against challenge with SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2, although reports on SARS-CoV-2 are limited. However, studies of an FI-SARS-CoV vaccine, one of two studies of an MVA vaccine expressing SARS-CoV S protein, and vaccination with one S-derived peptide showed enhanced lung pathology in NHPs. Thus, there are limited data to indicate that immune responses that include antibodies (and probably also T cells) induced by some vaccine formulations may be associated with more extensive lung pathology compared with infection alone, whereas the transfer of mAbs with specific properties have, so far, provided protection in animals (Supplementary Table  ). Overall, the lack of a link between clinical measures of disease severity in NHPs and the experimental conditions associated with exacerbated lung pathology is a limitation to their utility in predicting the risks of ADE associated with passive-antibody or vaccine interventions in humans. So far, the models do not emulate the severe respiratory disease observed in COVID-19. Evaluation of T cell responses will also be needed to draw conclusions regarding mechanisms if immunopathology is observed. For example, a strong T cell response has been described as ameliorating ADE of disease in a dengue model and animal studies have suggested an aberrant T cell response to FI-RSV vaccination. Quantitative assessments of the extent of lung involvement, and histopathological scoring of the characteristics and severity of lesions using validated markers of infected cells, patterns of cell-subtype infection and quantification of infiltrating immune cells will be also be necessary before these models can be used to better understand either protective immunity or immune enhancement—whether mediated by antibodies, T cells, intrinsic responses or a combination of factors. A critical point is that the identification of correlates of protection in humans will be necessary to understand how studies in small- and large-animal models can be designed to support or question the benefits of particular immune interventions for SARS-CoV-2 infection. It is clear that after many years, and considerable attention, the understanding of ADE of disease after either vaccination or administration of antiviral antibodies is insufficient to confidently predict that a given immune intervention for a viral infection will have negative outcomes in humans. Despite the importance that such information would have in the COVID-19 pandemic, in vitro assays do not predict ADE of disease. Most animal models of vaccines and antibody interventions show protection, whereas those that suggest potential ADE of disease are not definitive and the precise mechanisms have not been defined. Although ADE is a concern, it is also clear that antibodies are a fundamentally important component of protective immunity to all of the pathogens discussed here, and that their protective effects depend both on the binding of viral proteins by their Fab fragments and on the effector functions conferred by their Fc fragments. Even when vaccine formulations such as formalin inactivation have shown disease enhancement, neutralizing antibodies with optimized properties have been protective. Further, the potential mechanisms of ADE of disease are probably virus-specific and, importantly, clinical markers do not differentiate severe infection from immune enhancement. Additional mechanism-focused studies are needed to determine whether small-animal and NHP models of virus infection, including for SARS-CoV-2, can predict the probable benefits or risks of vaccines or passive-antibody interventions in humans. Optimizing these models must be informed by understanding the correlates of protection against SARS-CoV-2 in natural human infection and as vaccines and antibodies are evaluated in humans. Such mechanistic and in vivo studies across viral pathogens are essential so that we are better prepared to face future pandemics. In the meantime, it will be necessary to directly test safety and define correlates of protection conferred by vaccines and antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 and other viral pathogens in human clinical trials.

Correspondence to or . The authors of this manuscript are employees of, or have other affiliations with, Vir Biotechnology. Vir had to choose how to proceed with mAbs to treat or prevent COVID-19 disease in the light of the evidence surrounding the possibility of ADE as detailed in this review. This review reflects the result of the team of authors carefully reviewing the literature to assess these choices and is provided as a service to the community. Vir has elected to test human mAbs with Fc activity preserved or enhanced, based on the lack of consistent evidence for ADE of disease noted above and evidence that the protective activities and potency of antibodies often involves antibody effector functions. We could have elected to take forward mAbs engineered to lack effector function, and so our antibody-related clinical programmes for SARS-CoV-2 could have moved forward regardless of the outcome of our review.

You have not had a fever for at least 72 hours (that’s three full days of no fever without taking any fever reducing medicine) Other symptoms, such as cough or shortness of breath, have improved At least seven days have passed since your symptoms first appeared Monitor your symptoms and stay in touch with your doctor if you feel worse. Wear a facemask if you have to be around others to protect them from your cough and sneeze droplets. Do not share dishes, drinking glasses or cups, eating utensils, towels or other bedding with people in your home. Wash these items thoroughly after each use. Clean and disinfect surfaces including sinks, microwave, refrigerator, toilets, shower, bath, etc., after you use them. Wear a facemask and gloves if you need to be around family members and pets. Use a humidifier or take a hot shower for sore throat and cough. Take acetaminophen, ibuprofen or naproxen to reduce fever and relieve aches and pains.

Asthma is the most common pediatric lung disease. It affects about one in ten children. This means asthma effects children in school. Children with asthma have swollen (inflammation), sensitive airways that lead to episodes of trouble breathing. Although there is no known cure for asthma, it can be controlled. When asthma is under good control, the inflammation and obstruction in the airways will be decreased. Because children spend most of their day at school, it is important that school personnel understand asthma and asthma management in school. This handout introduces asthma management concepts and gives school personnel detailed information about this student's asthma management program.  This is often called a school asthma action plan. Managing asthma will make it possible for the child to participate in school to the level of their ability. are the things that make asthma worse right away or slowly over time. Every child with asthma has different asthma triggers. Things that make asthma worse should be avoided or controlled in the school environment. Things that can make asthma worse include: irritants (e.g., smoke and fumes), allergens (e.g., furry animals, grasses and trees), exercise, infections and emotions. Although emotions may make asthma symptoms worse, they do not cause asthma. Many children with asthma may use a metered-dose-inhaler before exercise to prevent asthma symptoms during exercise at school. are indicators that a child's asthma may be getting worse. Monitoring asthma signs and symptoms is helpful in managing asthma at school. Signs and symptoms are things that children feel or that you may notice when asthma is getting worse. Common symptoms to watch for include: coughing, shortness of breath, chest tightness and/or wheezing. In addition to watching for asthma symptoms, some children with asthma may monitor their breathing at school by using a peak flow meter. A peak flow meter measures the flow of air in a forced exhalation. Peak flow monitoring can help identify the start of an asthma episode, often before the child is having symptoms. divide the peak flow meter into the colors of a traffic light and can help children and school personnel make decisions about asthma management. are divided into two groups: long-term control and quick-relief medications. Some quick-relief medications (e.g., Proventil, Ventolin, ProAir) work quickly to relax the muscles around the airways. These are used to treat asthma symptoms.  They may also be used as a pre-treatment before exercise. Long-term control medications are used daily to maintain control of asthma and prevent asthma symptoms. Long-term control medications may be inhaled (e.g., Flovent, Pulmicort, QVar, Advair, DuleraSymbicort, or oral (e.g., Singulair). Children often use these at home.  Most children use a combination of long-term control and quick-relief medications to manage their asthma. Spacers or holding chambers are devices that attach to the inhaler to increase the amount of medication that is delivered to the child's airways. Many children may use these.

If your resting heart rate is higher than normal, you may have a fever. Monitoring your heart rate can help you detect symptoms of coronavirus early. Checking your pulse can help you understand how well your heart is working, how your body is responding to an adverse event, like getting sick, and can help determine your fitness level. Your pulse is measured by how many times your heart beats in one minute and can be easily measured on your own. Your lowest pulse is your resting heart rate. A lower resting heart rate indicates a stronger heart muscle or higher level of fitness. Having a lower resting heart rate can help prevent cardiac events like a heart attack. A higher resting heart rate may indicate a problem with your heart or a lower fitness level. Having a higher resting heart rate can lead to illnesses like cardiovascular disease.   Children 1 to 10 years old: 60-140 beats per minute People 10 years of age and older: 60-100 beats per minute The best time to check for your resting heart rate is right after you wake up in the morning. Do not take your pulse within two hours of exercise, stressful activity or drinking caffeine as your pulse may be higher and will not give you an accurate resting heartrate. Many smart phones and watches can check your pulse for you automatically. If you do not have a device, you can check your pulse by hand. Find a watch, clock, or timer on your phone set to count down the seconds in a minute. Wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds and dry well. Turn one hand over so that your palm is facing upward. Place the tips of the index finger and middle finger of the other hand at the crease of the wrist below the base of the thumb. Press down lightly with your index and middle finger until you feel blood pulsing under your fingers. You may need to move your fingers around slightly until you feel your pulse. When you’re ready, begin counting the number of times you feel your pulse beat under your fingers for 30-seconds. Multiply the number of beats you counted in 30-seconds times two. Find a watch, clock, or timer on your phone set to count down the seconds in a minute. Wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds and dry well.

He shares insights from the patients he has seen in the hospital. : If you would ever call the doctor and say, ""I don't feel right, I think I need to be checked out,"" that's when you should go in. Right? For some, that's going to be a little different from person to person. It's going to be a little different based on your underlying disease. But whatever that threshold is, is the same. If you feel short of breath and you don't usually don't feel short of breath, that might be the time to call in. : If you look through the media, you hear these cases here and there of people who are just suddenly found dead at home with this disease. My guess is these are people that were feeling bad and waited, and waited, and waited. What we've seen in the hospital is that patients will go from looking not great to really bad very quickly. And so, I think that you don't want to go, ""I had a fever today, I need to go in."" But if you start to feel short of breath or fatigued more so than you did the day before, that would be a good time to check in with the physician, because that fatigue might just be the viral making your muscles ache and just making you feel worn down, but it also could be a sign of my lungs are getting worse, and I'm getting less oxygen, and I really need to be checked out.

Hear his reminder and warning to not only protect your health but the health of your loved ones. National Jewish Health is located in Denver and is the nation’s leading respiratory hospital. What I'd tell youth and teens is that just because you're young doesn't mean you're not going to get this. Does not mean you're not going to end up on a ventilator for two weeks with this. Does not mean that you can't die for this. The rates might be lower, but it can happen to you. And that would be my message to them. Not only that, teens have parents, they have grandparents, many of them live with those parents and grandparents, and they are more susceptible to this. So even if you catch this and you don't get that sick from it, your loved ones can. And we've seen plenty of those people already die in our ICUs across this country, and we don't want to see that happening over and over again.​ COVID-19 (Coronavirus) Patient Education Materials Learn more about COVID-19 and how it affects specific health conditions in these printable patient education materials. 1400 Jackson Street Denver, Colorado 80206 303.398.1355 877.225.5654 ©2020 National Jewish Health  ",113,asthma and covid,-2.3767707347869873,83

6af8d253-ce73-439a-8a5a-d57708cf19d8,"Supported self-management helps people with asthma control illness, say researchers People with asthma should be given tailored support to help them manage their condition, experts say. Helping people with asthma take control of their own illness reduces symptoms, improves quality of life, reduces emergency use of health services and even prevents deaths, research has shown. Supported self-management has been recommended in asthma guidelines for the past three decades, but implementation is patchy. Clinicians and healthcare organisations should prioritise making sure that every person with asthma has access to support to help them c, researchers say. A team led by the Asthma UK Centre for Applied Research at the University of Edinburgh, Queen Mary's University of London and University of Manchester reviewed results from 270 studies that evaluated the success of supported self-management. People of all ages and from a range of socioeconomic and cultural backgrounds benefit from tailored support to help control their own symptoms, the review found. Asthma is a common condition, affecting 334 million people worldwide. In the UK, asthma accounts for more than six million GP consultations and 100,000 hospital admissions each year, costing an estimated £1 billion annually. Supported self-management helps people recognise early signs that their asthma is worsening and to take action accordingly. Each patient is offered a personalised action plan with details of what medicines to take and advice on when to seek help if symptoms are getting worse. Patients have regular check ups to review their progress and their action plan is updated as needed. Studies have shown that the approach saves lives, yet a 2014 review of asthma deaths suggested more than three-quarters of patients did not have an action plan to help them manage their condition. Study elucidates mechanisms behind protective farm effect on childhood asthma Higher consumption of meat linked with increased wheezing in children Wildfire smoke more harmful than other types of air pollution for people with asthma The study, published in the journal , was funded by the National Institute for Health Research Health Services and Delivery Research Programme. Professor Hilary Pinnock, of the Asthma UK Centre for Applied Research at the University of Edinburgh, said: ""Evidence is compelling that supported self-management for asthma works. The challenge is in making sure it is implemented across the health service, so that every person with asthma has access to a personal action plan and knows what to do if their condition is worsening. ""Supported self-management is being promoted across all long-term conditions and asthma has the best evidence base, so it should be an exemplar. We hope our review will be alert those commissioning or delivering services for people with asthma to the importance of ensuring that supported self-management for asthma is implemented now."" Dr Samantha Walker, Director of Research and Policy at Asthma UK, said: ""It is well known that self-management is essential in helping people with asthma achieve good asthma control; whilst self-management can be complex, this research shows that it can significantly improve quality of life and reduce the rates of hospital admissions and visits to A&E. ""Two out of three asthma deaths are preventable with good basic care, and this research shows the difference supported self-management can make. We must take a bold new approach and take advantage of digital health solutions that could transform the way asthma care is delivered and support self-management.

Patients with cancer have lowered immune systems due to treatment or to the cancer itself, so contracting COVID-19 or other illnesses can be dangerous. It is more important than ever before for those with and without cancer to minimize the risk of contracting or spreading illnesses because of the coronavirus. During this time, the way your cancer is treated or monitored may differ. How you treat or monitor side effects of treatment and the signs of getting sick may change too. A few important questions to ask your provider about coronavirus are: Does treatment of this cancer put me at higher risk of contracting COVID-19? Why or why not? Is it safe to start or continue treatment at this time? How long is it safe to delay treatment? Will the treatment center need to reschedule my appointment? If so, what are my options? What precautions do I need to take when I come in for treatment or check-ups? Is it safe to visit with family members and/or friends, or should I be isolated? You and your provider should create a plan for how to monitor and treat your cancer during this time. Chemotherapy or immunotherapy infusions, radiation therapy or scans will still need you to come into the hospital or your clinic’s office site. If you had a cancer screening scheduled during this time, you may be urged to postpone your screening. However, your provider will help you decide what the best plan is at this time.  While cancer patients are more susceptible to COVID-19 and other illnesses due to their immunocompromised status, there are steps that everyone can take to lower the chances of catching or spreading the coronavirus. Wash hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20-seconds. Practice social distancing. This is especially important for those with lowered immune systems including cancer patients. Limit or avoid person-to-person-contact and avoid those who look or feel ill. For cancer patients isolating at home with family members, it is important that those individuals follow the same coronavirus prevention guidelines, frequent hand washing, social distancing, limiting contact, avoiding sick contacts. If anyone in the household has symptoms of a viral infection, they should self-isolate. Cancer patients who feel ill and have or may have been exposed to COVID-19 should contact their health care provider for guidance before going to a hospital or urgent care.   This information has been reviewed and approved by  and ​ (March 2020) COVID-19 (Coronavirus) Patient Education Materials Learn more about COVID-19 and how it affects specific health conditions in these printable patient education materials. 1400 Jackson Street Denver, Colorado 80206 303.398.1355 877.225.5654 ©2020 National Jewish Health  ",113,asthma and covid,-2.5372698307037354,89

This virus has never been seen before. The medical term for “new” is “novel.” The World Health Organization (WHO) named this virus the 2019-nCov, (n for novel) but it is also referred to as SARS-CoV-2, 2019 Novel Coronavirus, the 2019 Coronavirus and the Wuhan Coronavirus. COVID-19 is the infectious disease caused by COVID-19 virus The COVID-19 virus started in a group of people who had pneumonia who had been associated with a seafood and live animal market in Wuhan, China. The disease spread to family members, health care staff and others in China and now has spread to other countries. It is not known exactly , but it is believed that the extremely large human population (Wuhan has about 11 million people), dense pig and duck farms and live animal markets are contributing factors. It is likely that this virus is in bats, transmitted to an intermediate animal host, possibly the small animal known as a pangolin. The pangolin may have contact with bat excrement and become infected with the virus. If the infected pangolin is captured by a human, the human could have become infected with the virus and then passed it to other people. When a virus is transmitted from animals to humans it is called cross-species transmission or spillover. Spillover is  common. More than two-thirds of human viruses are zoonotic, meaning they are caused by bacteria, viruses or parasites that spread from animals to humans. Some examples of other diseases that spread in the same manner are West Nile virus, Rocky Mountain spotted fever and the MERS and SARS coronaviruses. Most are treatable. Droplets from coughs and sneezes spread the COVID-19 virus. You also can be exposed to the virus by touching a surface or object that has been contaminated from the virus. (the disease caused by the COVID-19 virus) are similar to those of a cold and the flu: Aches and pains, cough, diarrhea, fever, headache, nasal congestion, runny nose, shortness of breath, sore throat and tiredness. These symptoms can show within two to 14 days of being exposed to the virus. If you have a severe case, you may develop these symptoms after a few days: significant shortness of breath, low oxygen levels, abnormal blood tests, kidney failure, liver failure, pneumonia and hospitalization. If you have a fever and cough or shortness of breath within 14 days of traveling from a country with an outbreak or you’ve been in contact with someone who has traveled to an infected area, call your doctor to get tested for COVID-19. looks at secretions from the nose, throat, blood or body fluids.

The coronavirus pandemic can cause concern and stress about your ability to stay healthy because you are at a higher risk of contracting COVID-19. However, there are ways to help minimize your risk of contracting the virus and stay on top of your well-being as a COPD patient. There are no definite symptoms that distinguish coronavirus symptoms and the symptoms that accompany a COPD flare-up. You should contact your doctor for evaluation if you experience an increase in any of the following: There are important guidelines to minimize the risk of contracting COVID-19 that should be followed whether you are a COPD patient or not. Frequently wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. Avoid people who are ill or think they may be ill. Practice social distancing – stay six feet or more away from others. Follow recommendations from your city and state for staying at home. Stay home if you are sick or think you may be sick. Disinfect surfaces around you frequently with disinfecting wipes or similar product. Voluntarily self-quarantine for 14 days if you are exposed to someone with coronavirus. Avoid any unnecessary travel, even short distances. On top of these general guidelines, COPD patients should: Maintain your regular medications and treatment, as prescribed by your physician. Check that oxygen deliveries will continue as normal (if you are already on oxygen). Stock up on necessary medications and supplies such as food and prescriptions. Create or review your COPD Action Plan with your physician. Make a plan with your family member(s) and/or caregiver(s) for how to continue your care should you or they get sick. Family members and/or caregivers of COPD patients also should take extra precautions to minimize the risk of contracting COVID-19, like strictly following recommendations from the Centers for Disease Control (CDC). If you are a COPD patient and believe you have symptoms of coronavirus, call your physician. Your physician will help you determine if you should be tested or admitted for treatment and will help you navigate that process. You also should immediately stay away from others (self-isolate), especially if you have been to an area where infections have been high in the last month. Questions you should ask your doctor if you believe you have COVID-19 or test positive for the virus include: Are there over-the-counter medications I can take to reduce symptoms?

Anticoagulation in COVID Pro Con Debate with Drs Todd Bull and Eric Schmidt “We’re going be stronger”: A Frontline Physician’s View of COVID-19 As the nation’s leading respiratory hospital, we are committed to helping businesses keep their employees safe. Our Advanced Diagnostic Laboratories have developed COVID-19 tests that identify people who actively have COVID-19 or who have built antibodies to the SARS-CoV-2 virus. We also help businesses who need help developing a return-to-work pandemic strategy that meets regulatory and public health standards and, most importantly, keeps everyone safe. Visit Return-to-Work Services for more information.   We know how important it is to identify if an employee has COVID-19 or has the antibodies. Test results are available within 24-48 hours of order processing.   All of our COVID-19 tests are approved or have a pending application for emergency use authorization (EUA) from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).   Molecular RT-PCR Test (swab test) – confirms active cases of COVID-19 The molecular diagnostic test is the most widely used diagnostic test to determine active disease for COVID-19.  A nasal swab is used to collect a sample. It detects genetic material from the SARS-CoV-2 virus. A positive molecular test indicates that a person has SARS-CoV-2 viral particles in the airways and has COVID-19 disease. A person with a positive molecular test should be considered infectious to other people and should self-isolate.   Antibody Tests (blood draw test) – helps to determine when it is safe to return to work IgM is the first antibody produced by the immune system. A positive IgM test indicates that a person has been infected and has begun to mount have an immune response to the virus. IgM antibodies disappear soon after the virus has been cleared from the body. A person with a positive IgM test may still have an active infection and should self-isolate. In most patients, IgG antibodies develop 7 to 10 days after symptoms of COVID-19 begin. The results of this test may indicate that a person has had COVID-19 in the recent past and has developed antibodies that may offer protection from future infection. Antibodies can provide protection against re-infection, although strength of the protection and how long the protection may last varies by disease. People with antibodies may have a level of protection against SARS-CoV-2 re-infection, although researchers are still determining the level of protection.     COVID-19 (Coronavirus) Patient Education Materials Learn more about COVID-19 and how it affects specific health conditions in these printable patient education materials. 1400 Jackson Street Denver, Colorado 80206 303.398.1355 877.225.5654 ©2020 National Jewish Health  ",113,asthma and covid,-2.728363513946533,93

He is a National Jewish Health pulmonologist and critical care physician who is on the front lines in intensive care units in Denver. Social distancing is vitally important for many reasons. Number one, this is a highly contagious virus. For every person who gets it, we believe around three people will catch it from them. So if three people catch it from them, and I can start to pull those people away, I can slow down the rate of transmission. All right? So that's number one. Number two, if I do that, it takes longer for the virus to get through the community. If the virus is spreading at a rate that looks like this, and this is our capacity for a hospital to take care of it, once we cross this, everything falls apart. Right? And that's what we're close to seeing in New York, and that's what we've seen in Italy. That's what we saw in Central China. Right? We know if we can flatten the curve ... There's another web search term. If we can flatten that curve instead of having a spike that looks like this and getting everybody sick at once, if we can get that spike to go like this and flatten it over a period of time, we can keep it ... While we might strain our resources, we might keep that below that threshold where everything falls apart. If we can keep it below that threshold where everything falls apart, we can continue to provide everybody good care, we can give time for resources and manufacturing to catch up to our needs as a country.

This year, getting ready to return to school entails more than shopping for school clothes and supplies. Schools are preparing safe learning environments during COVID-19 and contingency plans if learning is moved online and families are helping their students prepare for what could be a nontraditional year. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has provided to schools on how to protect the health and safety of students, teachers and staff. The recommendations stress the importance of communication, virus prevention practices, plans for virus transmissions and following advice from local public health departments. School will look different this year; how can parents help their students be ready? Parents can helps students by setting realistic expectations. Explain what the school has communicated about wearing masks, social distancing, temperature taking and any other precautions your school has planned. Here are other suggestions parents can use to help their children get ready for school: – Keep your children up-to-date on immunizations and the flu vaccine. Here is the recommended from the American Academy of Pediatrics. – Put your child’s name on their mask. Remind your student to only take the mask off when eating or drinking, and to not share their mask. Send an extra mask in your child’s backpack just in case. Review the right way to put on and remove a mask from our . – Review proper hand-washing: Use soap and water or use hand sanitizer to wash hands. If using hand sanitizer, remember to rub until the hands are dry. This shows how to make handwashing more fun. – Help your child visualize what six feet around them looks like. Explain how to follow the school’s social distancing plan. As a family, keep six feet away from others when in public areas. Here are some ways to visualize the right distance. – Check your child’s temperature before school and at bedtime. If your child has any symptoms keep your child home. Watch for fever, cough, nasal congestion, sore throat, shortness of breath, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, fatigue, muscle pain headache and poor appetite. – Help your child learn the variety of feelings related to school and the virus.

Dry your hands with a clean paper towel and throw the paper towel away. Check surgical masks for any defects and throw away defective masks. Place mask on your face. If mask has a bendable edge, put it on your nose. Put one loop around each ear or tie the upper ties behind your head with a bow. Pinch the bendable top edge of the mask around the bridge of your nose. Tie the lower ties behind your head with a bow. Make sure the mask covers your nose and mouth so that the bottom edge is under your chin. Do not touch the part of the mask covering the nose and mouth, it may be contaminated. Untie or remove the ear loops and remove the mask by the straps. Cloth masks can be removed and reused during the day. Wash hands, remove mask by the straps, hang or place it away from others. Throw surgical masks away after intended use (at hospital/clinic). Wash cloth masks in a laundry bag in hot water, and fully dry on medium/high heat.

National Jewish Health is a world leader in research on all facets of lung function, disease and health as well as inflammation and immune function. We have several COVID-19 research initiatives in planning stages and some already up and running. Below are a few of the project our researchers are working on. A major question for both clinical and basic researchers is what causes such a wide range of severity – from asymptomatic to deadly – of COVID-19. The Center for Genes, Environment & Health collaborated with the Advanced Diagnostics (ADx) Microbiology and Clinical Laboratories to develop rapid molecular testing for the SARS-CoV-2 virus and antibody tests for the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which could show who has been infected, mounted an immune response and may have immunity. National Jewish Health pulmonologist and researcher Robert Mason, MD, describes course of a SARS-CoV-2 infection from the perspective of a cell biologist in the . Infections limited to the upper airways are likely to be mild. When the infection spreads to cells in the alveoli, deep in the lung, severe disease is likely to occur. . A research team of Drs. Mike Wechsler, Russ Bowler, Barry Make and Hong Wei Chu are planning studies of the virus’s effects on asthma and COPD as well as on the youth who are vaping, and in patients who have Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome. Researcher Max Seibold, PhD, and his colleagues have also reported results of genetic studies evaluating the potential risk that asthma patients face of SARS-CoV-2 infections and severe COVID-19. They looked at expression patterns of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 genes, which are involved in SARS-CoV-2 entry into cells. High expression of those genes suggests higher risk. Overall, there appeared to be no difference between healthy patients and those with asthma in the expression of these genes. Among asthma patients, however, African Americans, males and those with diabetes showed higher expression of the ACE2 and TMPRSS2 genes. Those taking inhaled corticosteroids had lower expression of those genes. . Kara Mould, MD, received a Boettcher Foundation COVID-19 Research Grant. Dr. Mould will leverage a non-bronchoscopic lavage technique to collect samples from patients with COVID-19 acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), as well as those with non-COVID ARDS, in order to construct a time course of inflammatory responses. She will then correlate them with presence of leukocytes and inflammatory mediators in the circulating blood. This study will provide the first-ever, time-resolved assessment of inflammatory responses in COVID-19 and non-COVID ARDS. Investigators at National Jewish Health in collaboration with our colleagues at Colorado State University, Kaiser Permanente health outcomes, SCL health, and University of Colorado continue to develop novel ideas and approaches to the diagnosis and treatment of patients infected with SARS CoV2. Drs. Jeff Kern, Bill Janssen, Jay Finigan, Tasha Fingerlin, Reeti Khare, Ron Harbeck, and others are participating in clinical research studies of novel drug treatments and the utility of blood serum from convalescent COVID-19 patients in treatment of the most critically ill of the SARS CoV2-infected patients. On the clinical front, we have three trials at Saint Joseph Hospital underway. We are leading one trial at Saint Joseph Hospital that is evaluating the effectiveness of the medication sarilumab, a drug that inhibits IL-6 signaling. IL-6 is a pro-inflammatory cytokine that is elevated in COVID-19 and believed to contribute to the severity of illness.  Two clinical trials will evaluate the anti-viral medication, remdesivir, which was developed in response to the SARS and MERS outbreaks, but never reached clinical trials. Remdesivir will be evaluated in moderate and severe COVID-19 cases. National Jewish Health is also participating in a consortium that includes SCL Health, the University of Colorado Anschutz, and the Colorado State University to test and use purified anti-SARS-CoV2 antibodies isolated from convalescent serum to treat patients with severe COVID-19 disease. We are also positioned to study and treat survivors and who develop chronic respiratory symptoms. James Crapo, MD, and colleagues received a Boettcher Foundation COVID-19 Research Grant to investigate the effects of the novel drug, BMX-001 to determine if it could be a new therapy to reduce pulmonary injury, morbidity, and mortality from COVID-19 and other viruses that cause virus-associated acute respiratory distress syndrome. Critical Care Section Chief Bill Janssen is arranging to collect blood and lung lavage fluid samples from COVID-19 patients in the three intensive care units National Jewish Health intensivists staff and manage. This will provide an exceptional chance to conduct basic investigations of the disease including biomarkers, gene expression, cell biology and many other basic biological factors of the disease. Gongyi Zhang, has established an expression system that can express the receptor-binding domain and the entire SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. That protein is the “key” that binds to receptors on cell surfaces, which is thought to allow entry into cells and infection. He is raising monoclonal antibodies against these proteins, which could block the virus binding to human epithelial cells. Several researchers across the institution are using Dr. Zhang’s proteins to investigate many aspects of the viral function and human response to the virus.  Dr. Max Seibold is adapting an ongoing study of respiratory infections in asthma to investigations examining the role of the ACE2 receptor that binds SARS-CoV-2 and patients’ responses to other coronaviruses, which cause milder disease similar to the common cold. Michael Strong and his group in the Center for Genes Environment & Health analyzed 50 coronavirus genomes from patients around the world to understand how the virus is evolving, and to identify potential targets for vaccines, medications and diagnosis. Researchers at National Jewish Health and across the nation have launched a study to determine the incidence of coronavirus infection among U.S. children. National Jewish Health, led by Max A. Seibold, PhD, associate professor of Pediatrics and the Center for Genes, Environment and Health, will serve as the experimental and computational analysis center for the study. The study, known as Human Epidemiology and Response to SARS-CoV-2 (HEROS), funded by the National Institutes of Health, will identify new SARS-CoV-2 infections and COVID-19 illnesses among 2,000 children and their family members over a six-month period.

f749a3d9-2856-498f-ad31-a6e3b597f722,"The great majority of the nearly 23 million people with asthma, including 6.5 million children, can avoid serious symptoms and disability if they follow the latest guidelines to keep their disease under control. Highlights of the 2007 asthma guidelines from the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute's National Asthma Education and Prevention Program (NAEPP) were presented during the Annual Meeting of the American College of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology (ACAAI) in an effort not only to increase awareness of the new recommendations, but to help make sure they get put into practice. “Asthma is not an event, it is a chronic disease that can be managed so that symptoms are controlled and severe attacks are prevented,” said Michael B. Foggs, M.D chief of asthma, allergy and immunology, Advocate Health Care, Chicago. “The guidelines underscore the fact that people who are diagnosed with asthma do not have to suffer breathing difficulties or cut back on their activities. We want to make this a reality for all asthma patients.” Asthma occurs when the linings of the airways become inflamed and swollen and muscle spasms constrict airflow to the lungs. An “asthma attack” is characterized by labored or restricted breathing, a tight feeling in the chest, coughing and wheezing. The condition can develop quickly and may vary in severity from mild discomfort to life-threatening attacks in which breathing stops altogether. Each year, nearly 4,000 asthma deaths occur in the United States and the disease accounts for a half million hospitalizations, most of which can be prevented with appropriate care. According to the NAEPP report, under-diagnosis and inadequate treatment are significant contributors to poor asthma control and the worsening of asthma severity. The new guidelines, the first major update in a decade, include the latest information on the best way to manage the chronic disease. Highlights include emphasis on ongoing monitoring and management of asthma, routine use of inhaled corticosteroids as the standard of care for most patients with chronic persistent asthma, distinguishing between managing acute and chronic asthma, and the identification of new risk factors for the disease. According to Dr. Foggs, the guidelines put a new emphasis on the physician-patient partnership and ongoing monitoring and management. Specific recommendations include: : All patients with asthma should be monitored by a doctor every one to six months, regardless of how severe their condition is and whether they are experiencing symptoms. patient should have a written asthma action plan with instructions for daily treatment and what to do if symptoms become worse. The action plan should be developed by a doctor or nurse, with input from the patient, and shared with all those who interact with the patient such as family members, teachers and coaches. Education that takes into account cultural background and literacy should be part of asthma care, and patients should play an active role in managing their condition. Asthma treatment based on severity is classified in six steps, rather than four in previous guidelines. A stepwise approach to treatment is still recommended, with medication stepped up or increased when asthma symptoms increase and stepped down, if possible, when asthma is under control. High levels of steroids put asthma patients at greater risk of serious side-effects Children with asthma having fewer attacks amid the coronavirus pandemic, study says Study elucidates mechanisms behind protective farm effect on childhood asthma “When patients and physicians work together to follow these guidelines, asthma symptoms can be prevented and patients can participate in all activities, and not miss days of work or school because of asthma. No one should expect anything less,” Dr. Foggs said. Anti-inflammatory medications should be routinely prescribed for long-term control of chronic persistent asthma. “Low to medium dose inhaled corticosteroids are very safe, and remain the first line of treatment for preventing asthma symptoms,” said H. William Kelly, PharmD, professor emeritus, department of pediatrics, University of New Mexico Health Sciences, Albuquerque. “Unfortunately, they are not prescribed as often as they should be. “Some people confuse these safe medications with the risky anabolic steroids used by some athletes to improve performance. When used appropriately, corticosteroids are safe and effective in controlling asthma,” Dr. Kelly said. Children ages 5 to 11 have been singled out as a separate category, based on research suggesting they may respond somewhat differently to medications than adults. For many children in this age group, disease control usually can be maintained with a low daily dose of an inhaled corticosteroid, rather than combination treatments, such as long acting beta agonists, needed by many adults. Other age groups in the new guidelines are children up to 4 years old and ages 12 to adult. The guidelines also emphasize that patients must take their controller medications even when they do not have symptoms, and should be taught how to use inhalers properly so the medication reaches their lungs. The guidelines emphasize the distinction between acute and chronic asthma management, according to Carlos Camargo, M.D., DrPH, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston. “The new guidelines modify the spirometry cut points used to assign the severity of an asthma exacerbation, or flare-up,” Dr. Camargo said. Spirometry is a test that measures lung function. “The guidelines also encourage increased use of ‘quick relief' medications such as albuterol and oral corticosteroids in the pre-hospital setting, and consideration of adjunctive treatments in severe exacerbations. The guidelines also recommend that emergency physicians and other acute care providers consider prescribing inhaled corticosteroids before patients are discharged from the hospital,” he said. Newly identified risk factors for asthma include obesity, use of acetaminophen and exposure to formaldehyde and other volatile organic substances, according to Harold S. Nelson, M.D., professor of medicine, National Jewish Medical and Research Center and University of Colorado Health Sciences Center, Denver. “According to one study, exposure to new surface materials such as linoleum flooring, synthetic carpeting, particle board, wall coverings and furniture, and recent painting significantly increased the risk of asthma in children,” Dr. Nelson said. Other risk factors identified in the past include allergy to pollen, molds, animal danders and house dust mites, some occupational exposures, and exposure to tobacco smoke and to certain types of air pollution.

If someone had symptoms of a lower respiratory tract infection, including a significant cough, shortness of breath and fever, that would definitely be a trigger to go in and see your local provider right away, and then they will make the decision. Do you fall into that category of someone that should be tested or do we have other explanations for those symptoms? Because, again, right now there are so many other pathogens in the community that can cause those same kind of symptoms than this particular virus. So there's a really specific criteria that the CDC has released to us to work up what we consider a suspect, and the first is that someone needs to have symptoms. So they need to have a fever and lower respiratory tract symptoms like a cough or shortness of breath. But beyond the symptoms, they also need to have a significant exposure risk. So that exposure right now is travel and exposure to people where there's high communities spread like China, like South Korea, Japan, Iran and Italy. The second important person to consider who should need testing would be someone that has symptoms and has a contact with a confirmed case of coronavirus. Now, there's a third category of patients that the CDC has recommended testing, and that is a patient that has a severe acute respiratory syndrome. This is a hospitalized patient that has pneumonia and we have ruled out other causes of that pneumonia.

It’s important to note that being diabetic does not increase your risk of contracting coronavirus. Diabetics do, however, have a harder time fighting off infections like the viral infection caused by COVID-19 if your diabetes is not well-managed. Minimize your risk of contracting coronavirus by following the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) guidelines: Wash your hands for at least 20-seconds regularly. Stay home if you feel ill and avoid those who feel ill. Keeping your blood sugar levels in range is important, as high blood sugar suppresses your immune system. Check your blood sugar levels frequently to avoid any substantial drops or peaks. It is also good to have plenty of foods on hand to help you safely and efficiently manage your carbohydrate intake. Be sure to stock up on supplies for managing your diabetes, including: Having extra medications that you take regularly on hand also is important. If a State of Emergency is declared where you live, you may be able to refill prescriptions early. It’s better to be prepared than to be caught without critical diabetes supplies and medications if you are quarantined or catch COVID-19. As someone with diabetes, it is important that you have a plan to follow if symptoms of coronavirus develop. Pack a “to-go bag” of diabetic medical supplies and medicine in case you need to go to the hospital and have a list of phone numbers for the doctors involved in your medical care. It is common for diabetics to develop a condition called diabetic ketoacidosis with viral infections. This condition can make it challenging for diabetics to regulate fluid consumption and electrolyte levels and can lead to sepsis. If you feel as though you are getting sick, regularly check for symptoms of elevated ketones. Elevated ketones can be a sign of high blood sugar. It may be hard to swallow fluids and foods, so keep a variety of foods and beverages like sodas stocked. Blood sugar levels also may vary if you decrease your carbohydrate or fluid intake when you feel sick. Monitor your blood sugar levels more frequently than usual during an illness to manage fluctuating blood sugar levels. Be aware that over the counter (OTC) medications can have an effect on your blood sugar. Many OTC cough syrups contain sugar, and while there are syrups that do not contain sugar, these medications can cause your blood sugar levels to rise. Other medications can be used to treat the symptoms of COVID-19, but should be used with caution if you are diabetic. Aspirin taken in large doses can cause blood sugar levels to drop. Acetaminophen can cause false or no readings in continuous glucose monitors. Ibuprofen can alter the hypoglycemic effect of insulin.

They prevent sick people from spreading their germs through the air. Medical masks block large-particles of viruses and bacteria that travel through coughs and sneezes. These masks fit loosely but completely cover your mouth and nose. When you have symptoms of cold, flu, COVID-19 or other infections, wear a facemask to protect others, including health care providers, from catching your illness. Here are the CDC directions for putting a mask on and taking it off safely. Wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. Dry your hands with a clean paper towel and throw the paper towel away. Check the mask for any defects such as a tear or missing tie or ear loop. Throw away any that are defective. Make sure the blue side of the mask is facing out, away from your face. Place the mask on your face with the blue side facing out and the stiff, bendable edge at the top by your nose. If the mask has ear loops, put one loop around each ear. If the mask has ties, pick up the mask by the ties and tie the upper ties behind your head with a bow. Once the mask is in place, use your index finger and thumb to pinch the bendable top edge of the mask around the bridge of your nose. If the mask has a lower tie, then once the mask is fitted to the bridge of your nose, tie the lower ties behind your head with a bow. Make sure the mask is completely secure. Make sure it covers your nose and mouth so that the bottom edge is under your chin. Do not touch the front of the mask (the part over nose and mouth). It may be contaminated from your breathing, coughing or sneezing. Untie or remove the ear loops and remove the mask by the straps. If you are using a reusable cloth mask, at the end of the day, take the mask off from the straps (not touching the front), place in a pillowcase to keep the ties with the mask. Wash it in the washing machine with hot water and completely dry on medium or high heat.​ N95 respirators are masks that can prevent a person from inhaling infectious particles. They must be fitted to each person and tested to assure that they are effectively preventing inhalation of infectious particles. The CDC does NOT recommend the general public wear this mask. The CDC recommends health care workers wear the N95 facemask. Not designed for children or people with facial hair Some have exhalation valve to reduce condensation build-up Talk with your doctor if you have questions about wearing a facemask.

7ff5ec9e-dbfb-4ea5-a64b-f27e5d749e06,"Asthma is one of the major noncommunicable diseases that affects millions across the world including children.  This condition, which affects your airways, is triggered when inhaled substances provoke allergic reactions. Asthma can be controlled by medications and avoiding triggers. Asthma is a that affects your airways and causes difficulty in breathing. It is triggered by inflammation of the air passages which makes them narrow. Symptoms of narrowing airways include whistling noisy breathing, shortness of breath, chest tightness and coughing. There can be several triggers or factors that can aggravate the symptoms of asthma. Common factors include dust, mites, pollen, smoke, , weather change, cold & cough and respiratory infections. Asthma can be broadly classified into two categories – specific and non-specific. Specific asthma hits you when you breathe in allergens or irritants while non-specific asthma is caused by exercise, weather or genetic predisposition. The exact cause of asthma is not known but it is seen in families with a history of the condition. Asthma cannot be cured, but it can be managed well with a number of treatment options aimed at relieving the symptoms and preventing the occurrence of severe attacks. Here's what Dr Navneet Sood, Consultant, Pulmonary & Critical Care Medicine, Jaypee Hospital, Noida has to say about the types, causes, symptoms, and treatment of asthma. Broadly speaking, there are two types of asthma, based on the nature of trigger behind it: Extrinsic asthma and intrinsic asthma. It is an immune response to an external allergen such as pollen, animal dander, dust, etc.  It occurs when you inhale certain chemical agents such as cigarette smoke, paint vapours, etc. In some cases, it may also be worsened by a chest infection, stress, and even loud bouts of laughter. Some drugs like aspirin and other  are also known to cause asthma attacks. Most people with asthma experience symptoms intermittently. The time gap between asthma flare-ups could be weeks or months. The symptoms generally worsen in the night or early in the morning. Other factors that can worsen asthma manifestations are breathing in cold air, strenuous physical exercise and heartburn. The tell-tale signs of this condition include Chest tightness: Pulling in of the skin between the ribs when breathing Wheezing: A musical, whistling or hissing sound with breathing. Apart from these, there are other manifestations of this condition which demand immediate addressal by the doctor Decreased level of alertness, such as severe drowsiness or confusion During an episode of asthma attack, the muscles surrounding the airways become tight and the lining of the air passages become swollen. This reduces the amount of air that can pass by. Though doctors haven’t been able to identify a specific cause behind asthma, specific triggers  have been spotted. Asthma triggers can be broadly categorized into Specific and Non-Specific Trigger When we say specific triggers, we talk about , irritants, conditions like heartburn and more. Any substance you breathe in can become an allergen. These might include traffic fumes, animal dander (from dogs and cats), house dust mites, pollen, mold, industrial fumes (especially those containing sulphur dioxide), household chemicals (air fresheners and aerosols), perfumed cosmetics, scented flowers, etc.  Viral or bacterial respiratory infections that trigger an asthma attack are common cold, flu, bronchitis and sinus infections. They are a common cause of asthma, especially in children.  Some of the most common foods associated with allergic symptoms are eggs, cow’s milk, peanuts, soy, wheat, fish, shrimp, etc. Food preservatives, especially sulphite additives can also be potential triggers behind an asthma flare-up. They include sodium bisulphite, potassium bisulphite, sodium metabisulphite, potassium metabisulfite and sodium sulphite.  Cigarette smoke contains different chemicals and gases that can irritate the lungs. Smoking increases your chance of getting asthma. Symptoms such as coughing and wheezing become worse when you smoke with asthma. Newborns can have poor lung function and an increased risk of wheezing if their moms smoke during pregnancy.  Severe , known as gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), and asthma often go hand-in-hand. Your stomach acids reflux into the oesophagus when the valve between this organ and the stomach does not function properly. If the acid reaches your airways, the irritation and inflammation can trigger an asthma attack.  Certain prescription and over-the-counter drugs like aspirin and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (ibuprofen and beta blockers) may trigger asthma attacks. : alcohol can cause asthma symptoms to worsen. One possible reason could be that alcohol causes acid reflux. Another probable factors could be the sulphites used in wines and beers. This category of triggers includes everything from emotional stress to genetic predisposition. Extreme emotions such as anxiety, anger and fear induce stress which in turn changes heart rate and breathing patterns. Rapid, shallow breathing causes constriction of airways which consequently leads to an asthmatic attack. Asthma can be triggered by intense exercise sessions or physical exertion. Hot and humid weather or extremely cold weather causes asthma symptoms to flare-up. : Yes, if you have a family member with asthma or have a family history of allergies, you are more likely to be vulnerable to asthma attack triggers. : It signifies the decreased ability to exercise and take part in other activities, fatigue, under performance or absence from work, psychological problems including stress, anxiety and depression. : Asthma can lead to a number of serious respiratory complications, like (infection of the lungs), a collapse of part or all of thelung and respiratory functions. In acute respiratory failure, the bronchial tubes are completely blocked. Oxygen level in the blood becomes dangerously low, or carbon dioxidelevel becomes alarmingly high. Such patients have to beimmediately shifted on ventilators to avoid fatality. In pregnant women asthma complications may include early labour, hypertension, gestational diabetes and haemorrhage. Asthma also puts the babies at risk of lower birth weight and breathing disorders. The diagnosis of asthma is based on a patient’s medical history, physical examination and laboratory test results. Your doctor will take a detailed medical history and ask you about your symptoms and allergy triggers. He may suggest one or more of the following tests to diagnose asthma, assess your breathing and monitor the effectiveness of asthma treatment: These include a battery of diagnostic tests to assess the performance of your lungs. Most commonly advised lung function tests include: : This is a breathing test that tells your doctor how much and how fast you blow out air. The purpose is to measure airway obstruction. This is a confirmatory test for asthma, in case your spirometry doesn’t show clear results. It measures your capacity to push air out of your lungs. It can be performed at home with a device called peak flow meter to figure out how successful your treatment is, whether or not you need emergency, etc. It measures the levels of nitric oxide in your breath. An increase in the volume of this gas indicates inflammation in the airways. This is a first level imaging test that your doctor may suggest just to have a broad overview of your lungs. The aim of asthma treatment is symptom control and easing of airway inflammation. Broadly speaking, treatment of this condition rests on three pillars: Long-term asthma control medicines, quick-acting drugs and breathing workouts. Your treatment regimen has to be decided by your doctor. Do not indulge in self-medication as the consequences can be dangerous. They don’t provide immediate relief to your symptoms. They work to reduce the severity and instances of asthma attack. These are commonly used for most people with asthma, particularly the inhaled steroids. They prevent asthma attacks by reducing swelling and mucus production in the airways.For severe asthma (status asthmaticus), injections of drugs such as prednisone are often necessary. Prednisone is the most potent and effective anti-inflammatory asthma medication available. : They are often combined with inhaled steroids for long-term control of asthma symptoms. Long-acting bronchodilators are never used alone for long-term therapy. These drugs are mainly used during an emergency caused by a severe flare-up. They are prescribed by a pulmonologist and the patient is told how to use them in case the need arises.  inhalers are used to quickly relieve cough, wheezing, chest tightness, and shortness of breath caused by asthma. Bronchodilators relieve the symptoms of asthma by dilating or widen the bronchial tubes. They should not be used regularly. The most commonly used short-acting bronchodilator is albuterol. Here's every you need to know about . Your doctor will suggest breathing techniques to increase your lung capacity and ensure healthy inflow and outflow of air. During a severe asthma attack that does not respond to asthma drugs, a mechanical ventilator may be needed to assist the lungs and respiratory muscles. A facemask is applied or a breathing tube is inserted in the nose or mouth for this asthma treatment. These breathing aids are temporary and removed once the attack has subsided and the lungs have recovered sufficiently to resume the work of breathing on their own. A short hospital stay in an intensive care unit may be necessary with an acute attack. In case of a severe flare-up, continuous use of an asthma nebulizer and injections of drugs such as epinephrine and prednisone for asthma are often necessary. Other therapies may include terbutaline injections, magnesium sulphate (induces smooth muscle relaxation of the airways) and leukotriene inhibitors. They are anti-inflammatory drugs. Here are dietary guidelines by nutritionist,  to deal with asthma: Here is detailed information on . The best way to prevent the relapse of an asthma attack episode is to avoid the triggers. However, the triggers vary from person to person. Common triggers include air pollution, allergies, cold air, a cold or virus, smoke, fragrances, etc. Here, we guide you on how to tackle the culprits behind an asthma attack. Identify your triggers and make a note of them in a diary. Also, keep a tab on your symptoms and pen them down. This will help you avoid and manage them. Discuss with your physician about all of these to chalk out a fool proof plan for dealing with asthma. Smoke from tobacco, candles and fire aren’t good for asthma patients. Do not smoke or allow anyone to do so in your car or at home. Coming in close contact with someone suffering from cough and cold will increase your risk of asthma attack. Stay away from them. Also, wash your hands well before eating and avoid touching your face as much as possible. Immunise yourself against the flu virus because it can trigger an asthma attack. You need to take this shot every year. Getting a vaccine for pneumonia is highly recommended for asthma patients. This vaccine needs to be administered once in every 5 to 10 years. ‘Enhanced immunity, no serious adverse events’: Lancet releases Covaxin’s Phase 1 trial data South African coronavirus variant may 'escape antibodies, cause reinfection' Beware!

cf60816b-5fd4-4e75-bc9f-1c65280f1c69,"COVID-19 is an emerging, rapidly evolving situation Get the latest information and resources from NHLBI We breathe oxygen from the air into our lungs, and we breathe out carbon dioxide, which is formed in our body as a waste gas. Breathing is essential to life itself. Oxygen must pass from our lungs into our blood for our tissues and organs to work properly. Respiratory failure is a serious condition that develops when the lungs can’t get enough oxygen into the blood. Buildup of carbon dioxide can also damage the tissues and organs and further impair oxygenation of blood and, as a result, slow oxygen delivery to the tissues. Acute respiratory failure happens quickly and without much warning. It is often caused by a disease or injury that affects your breathing, such as , opioid overdose, , or a lung or spinal cord injury. Acute respiratory failure requires emergency treatment. if you suddenly experience trouble breathing, feel confused, or if your family and/or caregivers notice a bluish color on your skin or lips. Respiratory failure can also develop slowly. When it does, it is called chronic respiratory failure. Symptoms include shortness of breath or feeling like you can’t get enough air, fatigue (extreme tiredness), an inability to exercise as you did before, and sleepiness. A doctor may diagnose you with respiratory failure based on the oxygen and carbon dioxide levels in your blood, how fast and shallow your breathing is, the results of , and other aspects, such as how hard you are working to breathe. If you are diagnosed with a serious lung disease, you may need extra oxygen through tubes in your nose or support with a breathing machine called a . Explore this Health Topic to learn more about respiratory failure, our role in research and clinical trials, and where to find more information. Any condition or injury that affects breathing can cause respiratory failure. The condition or injury may affect your airways or lungs. Or it may affect the muscles, nerves, and bones that help you breathe. When you can't breathe well, your lungs can’t easily move oxygen into your blood or remove carbon dioxide. This causes a low oxygen or high carbon dioxide level in your blood. Learn more about how your lungs normally exchange oxygen and carbon dioxide in this video. Conditions that make it difficult to breathe in and get air into your lungs. Examples include weakness following a , collapsed airways, and food getting stuck in and blocking your windpipe. Conditions that make it difficult for you to breathe out. causes your airways to narrow, while can cause mucus to buildup and narrow your airways, which can make it hard for you to breathe out. When no air is able to enter your lungs, one or both lobes may collapse and cause a condition called . This collapsing of the lung can happen in certain situations, such as when the lungs become extremely weak, mucus blocks one of the large airways, a rib is broken or fractured, or severe pain in the lung makes it difficult to take a deep breath.Chest trauma or lung injury can also cause air to leak from the lung, filling the space around the lung within the chest. This air could cause the lung to collapse, called a pneumothorax. Thismakes it harder for oxygen to pass from the air sacs into your blood and for carbon dioxide in your blood to pass into the air sacs to be breathed out. , (), drowning, and other lung diseases can cause this fluid buildup. It can also be caused by the inability of the heart to pump enough blood to the lungs (called ). Severe head injury or trauma can also cause sudden fluid buildup in the lungs. Such problems can occur after a spinal cord injury or when you have a nerve and muscle condition such as .It can also happen when your diaphragm and other breathing muscles do not get enough oxygen-rich blood, when the heart is not pumping well enough (), or when you get a severe infection called sepsis. Conditions that affect the brain’s control over breathing. In opioid overdose, for example, the brain may not detect high levels of carbon dioxide in the blood. Normally, the brain would signal to you to deepen your breathing so that you breathe out the carbon dioxide. Instead carbon dioxide builds up in the body, while oxygen levels fall, leading to respiratory failure. You may have an increased risk of respiratory failure because of your age, environment or occupation, lifestyle habits, and other medical conditions or medicines and procedures. Premature babies who have neonatal respiratory distress due to an under-developed lung, , or certain lung birth defects have a higher risk of respiratory failure. Older adults have more risk factors for respiratory failure. It is more likely that food will accidentally go down the windpipe instead of the food pipe or that a cold will lead to a severe chest infection. Older adults are also more likely to have muscle weakness that can affect breathing. Breathing in lung irritants can lead to lung damage over the long term and put you at risk of serious lung diseases. You may breathe in these irritants from the air where you live or work. Lung irritants include air pollution, chemical fumes, asbestos, aniline dyes and paints, dust, and secondhand smoke (smoke in the air from other people smoking). You may have a greater risk of respiratory failure if you have certain medical conditions or injuries. such as, , and Acan also affect the area of the brain that controls breathing. such as , , COPD, and . Fluid buildup in the lungs or (a blood clot in your lungs) can also lead to respiratory failure. in your brain or spinal cord (such as ), lungs (such as ), or airways (such as ).

Your epiglottis is the flap at the back of your throat that prevents food or drink from getting into your airways when you swallow. During , your upper airway becomes blocked repeatedly during sleep, reducing or completely stopping airflow. that damage your ribs or lungs. a condition in which the spine is curved from side-to-side. can cause your throat to swell up. Many other serious health conditions can also raise your risk. This includes , kidney or liver disease, or a weakened immune system. Smoking can cause lung diseases that raise your risk of respiratory failure. Using drugs or alcohol raises your risk of an overdose. A drug or alcohol overdose affects the area of the brain that controls breathing. During an overdose, breathing becomes slow and shallow, and this can cause acute respiratory failure. This can happen from using illegal drugs or misusing prescription opioid painkillers. Certain sedatives used during surgery affect your breathing. This can put you at risk of respiratory failure, especially if you have other risk factors. Complications from major surgery can also raise your risk of respiratory failure. If you have a condition that puts you at of respiratory failure, talk to your doctor. He or she can ask questions and do a physical exam to look for issues that may put you at risk of getting respiratory failure in the future. Your doctor can also talk to you about how to manage your condition to prevent respiratory failure. He or she can also screen you if you have a planned surgery. If you have  or another condition that raises your of respiratory failure, it is very important to follow your treatment plan. There are things you can do to keep your lungs healthy, including quitting or not smoking, limiting alcohol, and not misusing opioids or taking illegal drugs.

This may include , choosing a diet such as the , , , and getting good-quality sleep. Signs, Symptoms, and Complications Symptoms of respiratory failure depend on its , the levels of oxygen and carbon dioxide in your blood, and whether respiratory failure developed slowly over time or suddenly. You may start out with mild symptoms such as shortness of breath or rapid breathing, which may get worse over time. Acute respiratory failure can be a life-threatening emergency. Respiratory failure may cause damage to your lungs and other organs, so it is important to get treated quickly. Difficulty or extreme tiredness with routine activities such as dressing, taking a shower, and climbing stairs Shortness of breath or feeling like you cannot get enough air (called air hunger) High carbon dioxide levels in your blood can cause: You can have symptoms of low oxygen and high carbon dioxide at the same time. Some people who have respiratory failure become extremely sleepy or lose consciousness if their brain does not get enough oxygen or if carbon dioxide levels are very high. Symptoms of respiratory failure in newborns include rapid breathing, grunting, widening of the nostrils with each breath, a bluish tone to your baby's skin and lips, and a pulling inward of the muscles between the ribs between the ribs while breathing.  Respiratory failure can cause serious or life-threatening problems such as: Your doctor will check your medical history, perform a physical exam, and do tests and procedures to diagnose respiratory failure. Your doctor will ask you or your family members about your medical history and , especially any medical conditions that may affect your lungs and breathing. Your doctor will also ask if you have any of respiratory failure such as shortness of breath, rapid breathing, and confusion. During a physical exam your doctor may do the following: on your lips, fingers, or toes. with a stethoscope to check for a fast or irregular heartbeat. with a stethoscope for rapid breathing or any unusual sounds when you breathe. He or she will also see if your chest moves unevenly while you breathe. with a clip on a finger, called pulse oximetry. to check if it is too high or low. to check for a fever and ask if you have recently had a fever. To diagnose respiratory failure, your doctor may order some of the following tests and procedures. to measure levels of oxygen, carbon dioxide, pH, and bicarbonate.A sample of your blood will be taken from your arteries. These tests help determine whether you have respiratory failure and what type it is. to help find the cause of your respiratory failure. Blood tests can also help your doctor see how well your other organs are working. using samples of your blood, urine, or phlegm (a slimy substance that you cough out) to check for a bacterial infection. to check for blockages, , or other possible causes of respiratory failure. to identify any lung or heart conditions that may be causing respiratory failure. to image the lungs and look for or damage. to check your heart rhythm and how well your heart is working. to check how well your heart is working. to check for lung conditions such as . to collect samples of your lung tissue. to measure how well your lungs are working Acute respiratory failure can be life-threatening and may need a quick and emergency medical treatment in a hospital. Emergency treatment can help quickly improve your breathing and provide oxygen to your body to help prevent organ damage. Your healthcare team will then treat the cause of your respiratory failure. Treatments for respiratory failure may include , medicines, and procedures to help your lungs rest and heal. Chronic respiratory failure can often be treated at home. If you have serious chronic respiratory failure, you may need treatment in a long-term care center. If you have respiratory failure, you may receive . There are different ways to get the oxygen into your lungs, depending on how severe your respiratory failure is. called a nasal cannula,attached to a portable oxygen tank. You may need a special system to get a higher flow of oxygen, called a high flow nasal canula. You may wear a mask attached to a bag to get more air into your lungs. This is often done while you are waiting for a complex procedure to treat the cause of your respiratory failure. This treatment uses mild air pressure to keep your airways open while you sleep. You wear a mask or another device that fits over your nose or your nose and mouth. A tube connects the mask to a machine that blows air into the tube. Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is one type of NPPV. For more information, visit the Health Topic. Although it focuses on CPAP treatment for sleep apnea, it explains how CPAP works. if the oxygen level in your blood doesn’t increase, or if you're still having trouble breathing. A is a machine that supports breathing. It blows air—or air with increased amounts of oxygen—into your airways and then your lungs. Using a ventilator, especially for a long time, can damage your lungs and airways and cause infections such as pneumonia. if your airways are blocked. A is a surgically made hole that goes through the front of your neck and into your windpipe. A breathing tube, also called a tracheostomy or trach tube, is placed in the hole to help you breathe. People with severe breathing problems may need ECMOThis treatment pumps your blood through an artificial lung to add oxygen and remove carbon dioxide before returning the blood to your body.may be used for several days or weeks to give the lungs a chance to recover. Some complications of ECMO are blood clots, bleeding, and infections, all of which can be life-threatening. Your doctor may prescribe medicines to improve your symptoms or treat the cause of your respiratory failure. These may include: to treat bacterial lung infections such as . to open your airways or treat an asthma attack. to shrink swollen airways and treat any inflammation. If you have to stay in the hospital for a while, you may need treatments to avoid or manage other conditions or complications. You may be given fluids to improve blood flow throughout your body. Fluids are usually given through an intravenous (IV) line inserted in one of your blood vessels. You may need afeeding tube to make sure you get enough of the right nutrients while you are on a ventilator. This can help maintain muscle strength and prevent sores from forming. Movement may also help shorten the time you are on a ventilator and improve recovery after you leave the hospital. For severe respiratory failure, your doctor may recommend that you spend most of the time lying facedown, which helps oxygen get to more of your lungs. This program of education and exercise teaches you breathing techniques that can improve your oxygen levels. If you are very sick or got sick very quickly, this medicine can prevent blood clots from forming. If you cannot use a blood thinner for some reason, your doctor may order special stockings or devices to increase the pressure on your legs. For both acute (short-term) and chronic (long-term) respiratory failure, it is important to follow your plan, manage your condition, and know when you should seek medical care. You may need pulmonary rehabilitation to help your lungs work better. Your oxygen and carbon dioxide levels may take a while to return to a healthy range. Because of this, you may continue to have shortness of breath or other for a few weeks or longer. You may need to do daily activities more slowly. sing a mechanical ventilator for a long time may hurt your lungs and windpipe. You may need follow-up care for these complications. As you recover at home, watch to see if they develop. If you have chronic respiratory failure, you will likely need ongoing care. Ask your doctor how often you will need it. You may also have to carry a portable oxygen cannula and tank with you. For either acute or chronic respiratory failure, your doctor may refer you to . This is an exercise training, education, and counselling program that can help your lungs work better. Your doctor may talk to you about ways to prevent complications in the future, especially if you have chronic respiratory failure.

For some children with asthma, their first asthmatic experience can be a frightening asthma attack — heavy wheezing, a tight chest and shortness of breath can quickly catch their active young bodies off guard. For others, asthma can present subtly, with exercise intolerance or a chronic cough. Asthma is a chronic lung disease, sometimes worrisome and inconvenient, but a manageable condition. With proper understanding, good medical care and monitoring, you and your child can keep asthma well controlled. That’s our treatment goal at National Jewish Health, to teach patients and families how to manage asthma, so that they can lead full and productive lives. If your child has asthma, he or she is not alone. In the United States, asthma affects 22 million people. It is the most common chronic disease of childhood. Today, 6 million children have asthma. Participate in activities, including physical activity without asthma symptoms, Have few, if any, emergency room visits and hospitalizations, Have few, if any, side effects from the medications taken and Asthma, also known as reactive airway disease, is defined as a chronic lung condition with: Increased sensitivity of the airways to a variety of things that make asthma worse Let’s look take a closer look at the airways in the lungs with controlled and uncontrolled asthma. Recent research has shown that inflammation (swelling) of the lining of the airways is the most common chronic feature of asthma. When they are stimulated, certain cells lining the airways produce chemical substances (mediators), which leads to inflammation and excessive mucus. This causes the airway lining to swell and narrow. The inflammation may last for weeks following an episode. Most people with asthma have some degree of inflammation all of the time. Some long-term control medications can help prevent and reduce inflammation. Another characteristic of asthma is increased sensitivity of the airways. When inflammation occurs in the airways, the airways become more sensitive (or ""twitchy""). When the airways are more sensitive, your child is more likely to have asthma symptoms when exposed to things that make asthma worse. When there is less inflammation, the airways are less sensitive, and your child is less likely to have asthma symptoms when exposed to . In addition to inflammation and thick mucus production, further airway obstruction can occur with asthma. This obstruction is caused by tightening of muscles that surround the airways, called bronchospasm. Bronchospasm causes further narrowing of the inflamed airways. Inhaled  are generally very effective in reversing a bronchospasm. For more than 100 years, National Jewish Health has been committed to finding new treatments and cures for diseases. .

Therefore, the airways are sensitive to things that make asthma worse. These, either individually or together, are the triggers that cause symptoms in people with asthma. Identifying and controlling or treating factors and conditions that make asthma worse - and vary from person to person - is essential to good asthma management. It is helpful to think about your last asthma episode - did you experience any of the situations described in this information? Discuss this information with your healthcare provider. Substances found in the environment can irritate sensitive airways. Common ones include smoke (such as and smoke from wood-burning or kerosene stoves and fireplaces), aerosol sprays, strong odors (like perfumes, cologne and gasoline fumes), dust, and air pollution. Cigarette smoke is a particularly serious asthma trigger - if you have asthma, do not allow smoking in your home or car and always look for non-smoking sections in public areas. A variety of can make asthma symptoms worse, but it is important to note that not all people with asthma have allergies. Reliable and valid allergy tests are available, and a board-certified allergist can guide you through this process. Common allergens include animal dander, saliva and urine from feathered or furry , (a major component of house dust in humid climates), cockroaches, , , and . If you are allergic to any of these substances, making changes in your environment to control or avoid contact with the allergen is very important. It is also important to know what allergens are in your home and how they can be the cause of your attacks. This can be achieved with a home allergen testing kit. Ask your healthcare provider about environmental control and read more about the . Infections can also make asthma worse. Common cold viruses, respiratory infections, , and influenza frequently cause an increase of asthma symptoms. As a result, your healthcare provider may recommend an . Exercise or physical activity can make asthma worse - and for some, it may be the only cause of asthma symptoms. However, exercise is important for everyone and should not be avoided. Read more about . There are certain types of weather that may cause problems for some people with asthma in any climate. Some weather situations that may make asthma symptoms worse include extremely hot or cold temperatures, windy conditions, and changes in the humidity or barometric pressure. Emotions do not cause asthma, but can make asthma worse because strong feelings can lead to changes in breathing patterns. Times of ""good"" stress and ""bad"" stress can cause problems for people with asthma. However, it is important to express your emotions, and good asthma management can minimize the effect of stress. Sneezing, laughing, stress, holding your breath, and sleep disorders may cause changes in breathing patterns, which may make asthma worse. It is not always possible or desirable to avoid these situations; however, good asthma management may minimize these effects.

Anticoagulation in COVID Pro Con Debate with Drs Todd Bull and Eric Schmidt “We’re going be stronger”: A Frontline Physician’s View of COVID-19 A: Vaccination is a medical process that is critical to the prevention and control of infectious-disease outbreaks. Vaccines are already used to prevent millions of deaths every year from diseases like tetanus, measles and influenza. A  is a medical preparation of biologic material that is introduced into the body in order to provide the recipient with immunity (an effective host defense) against an infectious disease. A: Vaccines expose us to pieces of either a bacteria or a virus, which causes our bodies to recognize a potential threat and to mount an immune response. The goal with a vaccine is to help the body prepare for an actual infection, so it is ready to rapidly and effectively eliminate the SARS-CoV-2 virus when exposed to it. There are different types of vaccines. The Pfizer and Moderna vaccines are called messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines. The mRNA in the vaccines carry genetic instructions which cells in the body use to make copies of viral proteins. Once your cells make those proteins, your immune system will make the antibodies that bind to the protein, disable the virus, and protect you from getting sick or as sick from this virus. Q: How do we know that the vaccine is safe and effective? A: The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) reviews all vaccines for safety before allowing them to be administered to the public. Additionally, The Advisory Committee for Immunization Practices (ACIP), a group of medical and public health experts that advises the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), also assesses the safety and effectiveness of vaccines. Clinical trials of the vaccines lead to an understanding of safety and effectiveness. With the two early vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna, preliminary data suggests they are both about 95% effective. That means that under controlled conditions there were about 95 percent fewer cases of COVID-19 in the group of people who got the vaccine compared to the group of people who got the placebo. Q: How soon will someone be protected after taking the vaccine? A: With the two mRNA vaccines, it is estimated that immunity develops around two to three weeks after completing the second shot in the series, but each vaccine works a little differently and every individual responds a little differently. Both the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines are a two shot series, and it is important that an individual have both shots in order to confer immunity.  A: Most of the COVID-19 vaccines currently in phase 3 clinical trials in the U.S. require two (2) consecutive shots, three or four weeks apart, for the vaccine series. Future COVID-19 vaccines may require only one shot. Currently, Pfizer’s vaccine requires two doses in the vaccine series to be given three weeks apart. Q: Can I get the vaccine if I am not feeling well? A: If you are in a group that is currently eligible to receive the vaccine and you are not feeling well, it is recommended that you wait until you are feeling better to get the vaccine. If you have symptoms and/or signs of respiratory infection, evaluation and testing from health care resources in your community is recommended. A: Side effects in the phase 3 trials included flu-like symptoms such as aches, headache and fever. In the first few days of vaccination in the United Kingdom (where Pfizer’s vaccine was recently approved), two health care workers developed a severe allergic reaction (anaphylaxis) after receiving the vaccine, but both of these individuals had a prior history of severe allergic reactions. In response, British regulators have now advised patients with a history of severe allergic reactions to avoid getting the Pfizer vaccine until more is known about allergic reactions in severely allergic patients. Q: If I had COVID-19 and recovered do I need to get the vaccine? A: There is not enough information currently available to say if or for how long after infection someone is protected from getting COVID-19 again. Early evidence suggests natural immunity from COVID-19 is variable between individuals and may not last very long, but more studies are needed to better understand this area. Until we understand more about natural immunity to COVID-19, it is not known whether people who had COVID-19 will need to get a COVID-19 vaccine, although at least as of today it is recommended. That said, in Colorado, patients are advised that they can wait for up to ninety days after their infection before getting a vaccine, as re-infection is uncommon within the first three months following infection. Ultimately, if you recently had COVID-19 infection or have other concerns about receiving the vaccine, you should discuss your concerns and when and how to proceed with vaccination with your primary care physician. Q: Does the COVID-19 vaccine take the place of the A: No, the COVID-19 vaccine specifically protects against infection by SARS-CoV-2. It does not take the place of the pneumonia vaccine or the flu vaccine, which are caused by other organisms. Please consult with your health care provider regarding which vaccines are recommended for you. Q: Is the COVID-19 vaccine safe for pregnant women? Breastfeeding women? A: In early clinical trials for various COVID-19 vaccines, only non-pregnant adults participated. As of now, if you are pregnant or breastfeeding, it is recommended that you discuss the pros, cons, risks and benefits of vaccination as well as the timing of vaccination with your health care provider.  A: No. Children under 16 were not included in the early clinical trials for various COVID-19 vaccines. The groups recommended to receive the vaccines could change in the future, particularly as more clinical trials are completed. As of now, it is recommended that children under 16 do not receive the Pfizer vaccine and children under 18 do not receive the Moderna vaccine. Q: Will the safety of the vaccine be monitored as it rolls out? A: Yes. The CDC collects data to look for adverse events that are unexpected, appear to happen more often than expected, or have unusual patterns of occurrence. This data will continue to be gathered and analyzed. Q: Can we stop masking and social distancing after receiving the vaccine? A: No. You should continue to mask, practice social distancing and wash your hands often and well, even if you get a vaccine. These practices protect you and those around you. A vaccine does not immediately protect you. In addition, COVID-19 vaccines may protect against severe infection, but not necessarily prevent mild or asymptomatic infection. If this is the case, an infected person could still spread the virus, which can put others nearby at risk. Until we have a better idea of whether or not individuals who have been vaccinated can still spread the virus to others, and until a large percentage of the population has been fully vaccinated, you should still practice basic safety – mask-up, practice social distancing, wash your hands often and well. That said, we are clearly safer as individuals and as a community with vaccination than without. A: The FDA can issue an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) during a public health emergency to allow the use of tested but unapproved medical products. They sometimes allow medical products and treatments that are approved for a certain use to be used in expanded or new ways. For the FDA to issue an EUA, safety and efficacy must be demonstrated, and certain criteria must be met, including that there are no adequate, approved and available alternatives. Q: How much will a vaccine reduce the risk of COVID-19 and its complications? A: The FDA guidance expects that an authorized or approved COVID-19 vaccine will prevent disease or decrease its severity in at least 50% of people who are vaccinated. Clinical trials of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines indicated that those vaccines prevent or decrease the severity of the infection in about 95% of recipients. In some cases, COVID-19 vaccines may protect against severe infection, but not necessarily prevent mild or asymptomatic infection. If this is the case, an infected person could still spread the virus. This is why it is expected that even after a vaccine becomes available, people will need to continue wearing masks and practicing social distancing measures for some time. Q: What are the phases for COVID-19 Vaccine Distribution? Given the limited supply of vaccines in the first months of its availability, vaccines will be distributed in a phased process, with people at high risk of infection or severe disease inoculated first. The CDC has created a system to guide distribution of the vaccine. Each state has then fine-tuned these to the needs of their state. Here is the CDPHE guidance: A: The Pfizer vaccine received EUA on Dec.11. The CDC and state guidelines recommend a phased rollout of the vaccine. Distribution of the first vaccines began on Monday, Dec. 14, with the first inoculations in Colorado occurring the same day. To ensure Colorado’s readiness to distribute the vaccine, CDPHE worked with hospitals, public health agencies, pharmacies and others to plan for COVID-19 vaccine distribution following the guidelines they set. Fully rolling out a vaccine to all who want it, will likely take several months, especially because supplies are limited at first. CDPHE is working to distribute the vaccine as equitably and efficiently as possible. We anticipate that the model of vaccination is likely to change over time and be adapted to reflect the populations we need to serve. Q: I had a known exposure in the last 14 days with a COVID-19 case, can I get the vaccine to stop me from developing the disease?  A: No. current evidence suggests that the vaccine cannot be used for post-exposure prophylaxis as protection from the vaccine is not immediate, requires 2 doses, and may take 1 to 2 weeks from second dose to acquired immunity.  If you have had a known exposure to COVID-19 you should not seek vaccination until the quarantine period has ended to avoid potentially exposing healthcare personnel and other during the vaccine visit and to make sure you are not sick with COVID-19 at the time of vaccination. Q: I recently received passive antibody therapy for COVID-19, can I still get vaccinated with a COVID-19 vaccine?  A: Yes, BUT vaccination should be deferred for at least 90 days for individuals who had received monoclonal antibodies or convalescent plasma as part of COVID-19 treatment. See Patient Vaccine Information for additional details.  Q: What is the National Jewish Health vaccine roll-out plan? A: The Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment (CDPHE) is guiding the distribution process and priorities. National Jewish Health is following CDPHE guidance. We anticipate receiving our first allotment of vaccine on Dec.15. We are currently developing logistical plans for how the vaccine gets administered to our faculty, staff and other frontline staff who meet criteria under the CDPHE guidelines. Q: Who will receive the vaccine at National Jewish Health first? A: We will follow the CDPHE established guidelines and will first vaccinate frontline patient-facing health care workers who are at higher risk of exposure to COVID-19. We are currently working internally to notify those patient-facing staff to receive the initial doses and will manage this process going forward. Q: Will National Jewish Health offer the COVID-19 vaccine to our patients? A: Following CDPHE recommendations for prioritization of vaccine administration, we will be providing the vaccine to frontline, patient-facing health care workers first. However, health care staff and residents in long-term care facilities are also in the initial groups. Our vulnerable patients who meet the age and risk criteria for being at higher risk, along with those staff and employees who qualify as essential workers, will be vaccinated as part of the State’s Phase 2 vaccination plan. The timing of the Phase 2 rollout will depend upon vaccine supply, other logistical factors and public health considerations. Q: Which patients will be eligible to receive the vaccine? A: CDPHE is finalizing guidance on which patients will be prioritized to receive the vaccine first. We will post these guidelines on our website once they are confirmed. Q: Will National Jewish Health offer the COVID-19 vaccine to our broader communities? A: Once there is sufficient supply and following CDPHE guidance on prioritization, National Jewish Health is prepared to partner with CDPHE and serve the needs of our broader community. We will make our facilities and personnel available to vaccinate those individuals and populations as needed in accordance with the Phased roll out. National Jewish Health is fortunate to have the infrastructure and expertise available on its main campus to store and administer a large volume of vaccine. We anticipate that the model of vaccination is likely to change over time and be adapted to reflect the populations we need to serve.

Social distancing is a public health tactic used to slow down the spread of a contagious disease like coronavirus. When a person coughs or sneezes, a spray of small liquid droplets goes into the air. If you are too close, you can breathe in the droplets and any virus the droplets may contain. Social distancing is being careful about what you are exposed to and who you are around. Yes. You can have the virus without having any symptoms. Even if you feel healthy, it’s important to stay home as much as possible to protect others and to help stop the virus from spreading. Older adults, especially those with heart or lung conditions or a weakened immune system, need to stay home and away from people to prevent getting sick. It’s is also important to keep older adults connected with family and friends. Call, Facetime or stream a movie to watch together. Help them with their grocery shopping. Stay at least six feet away from others, especially those show symptoms of illness. Connect with family and friends by phone, face chat or other online communication device. Replace hugs and handshakes with elbow or foot bumping, a head nod, a slight bow, or other no-touch greeting. Being away from others can be stressful. Manage stress with deep breathing, yoga, meditation, laughter or other activities. Work from home and attend meetings by phone or video conferencing. Cancel or postpone large group meetings and optional travel. Take a walk or go on a hike, but keep at least six feet of distance from others. If you order food from a restaurant, use drive-through, pickup or delivery options. Wash your hands when you get home. Transfer food to your own plates and recycle the containers. Wash your hands before you eat. Do not visit nursing homes, retirement or senior centers, or long-term care facilities. Avoid medical and dental appointments that are not absolutely necessary. Use delivery or pick-up options at the grocery store or go to the store at off-peak times when it is not busy. If you have been exposed to the COVID-19 virus, the CDC recommends that you self-quarantine for 14 days. It takes two weeks for coronavirus symptoms to appear. To self-quarantine, you need to stay home and away from others as much as possible. Continue to practice respiratory hygiene by covering coughs and sneezes and personal hygiene by washing your hands often with soap and water. Don’t share towels, dishes, drinks, etc. Stay at least six feet away from other people. If you have been tested and are confirmed to have COVID-19, you need to be isolated from others until you are no longer contagious with coronavirus. Isolation can happen at home or at a health care facility if your doctor feels that is necessary. Stay away from others and pets as much as possible. Use a separate bathroom and sleep away from others in a separate room. Continue to wash your hands often with soap and water. Stay at least six feet away from other people in your house. Monitor your symptoms and let your doctor know if you are not feeling better, or if you have another health condition that is affected.

Even before the COVID-19 pandemic, National Jewish Health was researching how e-cigarette vapor affects the lungs. Hong Wei Chu, MD, a pulmonologist and researcher at National Jewish Health, found that similar to smoking, vaping decreases the body’s ability to fight off diseases like coronavirus. Quit Now to Better Defend Yourself from Coronavirus “The body almost immediately begins to recover when a smoker or vaper quits,” Dr. Ylioja explained. “Most people know quitting tobacco is an important step in protecting their health in general. In addition to social distancing, washing your hands, and staying home, quitting smoking or vaping can be an important step to defend yourself from COVID-19.” National Jewish Health has resources available to help people stop smoking or vaping. For help quitting, adults can call 1-800-QUIT NOW (1-800-784-8669) and youth ages 12-17 can visit or call or text 855.891.9989.

Vitamin D had recently been reviewed as one of the factors that may affect the severity in COVID-19. The objective of current study is to analyze the vitamin D level in COVID-19 patients and its impact on the disease severity. After approval from Ethics Committee, M.L.B Medical College the current study was undertaken as continuous prospective observational study of 6 weeks. Participants were COVID-19 patients of age group 30–60 years admitted during the study period of 6 weeks. Study included either asymptomatic COVID-19 patients (Group A) or severely ill patients requiring ICU admission (Group B). Serum concentration of 25 (OH)D, were measured along with serum IL-6; TNFα and serum ferritin. Standard statistical analysis was performed to analyze the differences. Current Study enrolled 154 patients, 91 in Group A and 63 patients in Group B. The mean level of vitamin D (in ng/mL) was 27.89 ± 6.21 in Group A and 14.35 ± 5.79 in Group B, the difference was highly significant. The prevalence of vitamin D deficiency was 32.96% and 96.82% respectively in Group A and Group B. Out of total 154 patients, 90 patients were found to be deficient in vitamin D (Group A: 29; Group B: 61). Serum level of inflammatory markers was found to be higher in vitamin D deficient COVID-19 patients viz. IL-6 level (in pg/mL) 19.34 ± 6.17 vs 12.18 ± 4.29; Serum ferritin 319.17 ± 38.21 ng/mL vs 186.83 ± 20.18 ng/mL; TNFα level (in pg/mL) 13.26 ± 5.64 vs 11.87 ± 3.15. The fatality rate was high in vitamin D deficient (21% vs 3.1%). Vitamin D level is markedly low in severe COVID-19 patients. Inflammatory response is high in vitamin D deficient COVID-19 patients. This all translates into increased mortality in vitamin D deficient COVID-19 patients. As per the flexible approach in the current COVID-19 pandemic authors recommend mass administration of vitamin D supplements to population at risk for COVID-19. In December 2019, several cases of pneumonia with unknown etiology reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. The disease spread quickly to other provinces of China and overseas. On 7 January 2020, a novel coronavirus was identified in the throat swab sample of one such patient and later declared to be the etiologic virus and was subsequently named as 2019nCoV by World Health Organization (WHO). On worsening of the situation WHO declared the outbreak as the public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC). In February 2020, WHO provided a nomenclature to the epidemic disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). As on 12th August 2020 there are more than 20 million cases worldwide, so for now it’s almost impossible to contain the disease spread and focus is diverting towards better treatment and prevention of factors that enhance the severity of COVID-19. COVID-19 is characterized by its high infectivity and marked variability in clinical severity, of which 40–45% patients remain asymptomatic and 30–40% develop only mild symptoms. Only fewer than 15% of cases develop severe disease. Diabetes and hypertension are commonest co morbidities associated with severe disease. Until recently researchers focus towards more deep survey of the modifiable factors which enhance/reduce the severity of COVID-19. Authors after reviewing the literature available postulated the hypothesis that vitamin D level plays significant role in determining the severity of COVID-19. Vitamin D known to play key role in the maintenance of bone health and calcium–phosphorus metabolism, yet many other functions of this vitamin have been recently postulated, such as modulation of the immune response in both infectious and autoimmune diseases. Vitamin D includes fat soluble secosteroids that are responsible for a wide spectrum of immunomodulatory, anti-inflammatory antifibrotic, and anti-oxidant actions. In humans vitamin D (cholecalciferol) and vitamin D (ergocalceferol) are the most abundant subtype of vitamin D. Liver converts vitamin D in to calcifediol (25-hydroxycholecalciferol); and D subtype is converted into 25-hydroxyergocalciferol. 25-hydroxyvitamin D or 25(OH)D) the principal metabolite of these two vitamin D can be measured in serum to know the vitamin D status of the individual. Calcitriol (1,25-(OH)D), is the active form of vitamin D which is generated by 1α hydroxylase enzyme present in kidney. Calcitriol circulates as a hormone in the blood, playing major role in calcium and phosphate homeostasis and encourages the healthy remodeling of the bone. Beside this calcitriol, has definite role in cellular growth, neuromuscular functions and plays an important role in immune functions, in particular with anti-inflammatory action. It inhibits the expression of inflammatory cytokine [e.g., IL-1α, IL-1β, tumor necrosis factor-α] and its insufficiency was associated with over- expression of Th1 cytokines. To confirm the hypothesis authors performed the present observational study in which authors measured the vitamin D levels of all COVID-19 patients who had been advised admission in COVID-ICU and simultaneously in COVID -19 patients who were asymptomatic. The interleukin 6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) and ferritin concentration was also measured in all patients and correlated with serum 25(OH) D concentration. The current study was undertaken as continuous prospective observational study of 6-week duration. All experimental protocols were approved by Ethics Committee M.L.B Medical College. An informed and written consent was obtained either from the participants himself or their first degree relative. Participants were COVID-19 patients of age group 30–60 years who were admitted in tertiary COVID-19 care center during the study span of 6 weeks. First participant was recruited on 5th June. Only two subtypes of COVID-19 patients were included in study. RT-PCR confirmed COVID-19 patients who were asymptomatic at the time of admission and remained asymptomatic till discharge on 12th Day. RT-PCR confirmed COVID-19 patients requiring ICU admission due to severe COVID disease. Authors included all eligible subjects admitted to dedicated COVID-19 management center during study span of 6 weeks started from 5th June 2020 and all eligible subjects were followed till the closure of case i.e. either discharge or mortality. Pregnancy; chronic obstructive airway disease; chronic renal disease patients on dialysis, patients on chemotherapy were excluded from the study. Institute adopts following criteria for ICU admission of COVID-19 patients: Clinical signs of pneumonia (fever, cough, breathlessness) plus one of the following: respiratory rate > 30 breaths/min; severe respiratory distress; or SpO < 90% on room air. Signs of multi-organ involvement: altered sensorium, decreased urine output, heart Rate > 120/min, with cold extremities or low blood pressure (Systolic BP < 90 mm of Hg and/or Diastolic BP < 60 mm of Hg). Laboratory evidence of coagulation abnormalities, thrombocytopenia, acidosis (pH < 7.25), lactate level > 2 mmol/L, or hyperbilirubinemia. All COVID-19 patients who got admitted in the recruitment period of 6 weeks starting from 5th June were evaluated at triage and advised admission to dedicated COVID wards accordingly. Asymptomatic and mildly symptomatic patients were advised admission in isolation wards. Patients with moderate and severe COVID-19 were advised admission in high dependency unit. Patients with severe COVID-19 who fulfilled ICU admission criteria were advised admission in ICU. Asymptomatic patients were allotted to Group A and given serial number series A1, A2, A3 and so on where as ICU patients were allotted to Group B and given number B1, B2, B3 and so on. After informed and written consent Serum 25 (OH)D estimation was performed along with other routine blood test that includes complete blood count; liver function test; renal function test and estimation of Serum IL-6; TNFα and ferritin level. On the basis of multiple guidelines serum 25(OH) D level of < 20 ng/mL has been defined as vitamin D deficiency. Calculations were also performed adopting 30 ng/ml as the cutoff level of 25(OH) D for defining vitamin D deficiency. Serum 25 (OH)D concentration was estimated by automated immunoassays through Architecti1000sr Make 2015 last calibration on 2nd June 2020. All investigations were carried out in accordance with relevant guidelines and regulations. Quantitative data are expressed as mean ± 2SD. Qualitative variables were expressed as proportions. Serum 25 (OH)D concentration was expressed as continuous variable. Cumulative prevalence of vitamin D deficiency estimated in both the groups using standard formula. Mann–Whitney test; unpaired ‘t’ test and Chi Square Test was performed for statistical analysis. -value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. SPSS for Windows (version 22; IBM SPSS Inc., Chicago IL) was used for all statistical analyses. 372 COVID-19 patients were admitted in the institute in the study span of six weeks, out of which 202 patients were enrolled in current study after applying inclusion criteria. On 48 patients were excluded after application of exclusion criteria providing the final number of 154 patients as shown in Strobes flow diagram (Fig. ). Out of 154 patients 91 were asymptomatic (Group A) 63 patients were severely ill and had required ICU admission (Group B). The demographic variables are shown in Table and there was statistically significant difference in the mean age and sex distribution. Among patients admitted in ICU the mean age was higher and sex ration predominated towards male sex. The mean concentration (in ng/mL) of 25 (OH)D in Group A was 27.89 ± 6.21where as in Group B the mean level was 14.35 ± 5.79. (Table ) When compared statistically the difference was found to be highly significant. The prevalence of vitamin D deficiency was 31.86% in Group A. In Group B 96.82% patients were vitamin D deficient (Fig. ). On Chi square test the difference in the prevalence of vitamin D among two groups was found to be highly significant. On adopting the cutoff concentration level of Serum 25 (OH) D as < 30 ng/ml for defining vitamin D deficiency the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency was 43.95% in Group A and 98.41% in Group B. On categorization of the patients on the basis of vitamin D Deficiency, out of total 154 patients, 90 patients were found to be deficient in vitamin D among which 61 were critical and 29 were asymptomatic (Table ). If we take 10 ng/mL as the guide for severe vitamin D deficiency, 62 patients were found to be severely deficient in vitamin D among which 52 were critical and 10 were asymptomatic. Two critical patients have normal level of vitamin D. The analysis of serum level of inflammatory markers reveals mean IL-6 level (in pg/mL) of 19.34 ± 6.17 in patients with vitamin D deficiency (serum Serum 25 (OH)D < 20 ng/mL) and 12.18 ± 4.29 in patients with normal vitamin D level, the difference was found to be statistically significant. Serum ferritin level was also significantly high in patients with vitamin D deficiency (319.17 ± 38.21 ng/mL vs 186.83 ± 20.18 ng/mL) than in patients with normal vitamin D. Serum TNFα level (in pg/mL) was also high in vitamin D deficient COVID-19 patients (13.26 ± 5.64 vs 11.87 ± 3.15) but the difference was not significant (Table ). Among both the groups diabetes was the commonest co-morbidity followed by hypertension. On follow up till closure of case (discharge vs fatality), the fatality rate in Group A was 1.09% (1 patient died) whereas in Group B was 31.74% (20 patients died). When the fatality was compared on the basis of vitamin D deficiency, the fatality rate was 21% (19 patients died in 90 patients) among vitamin D deficient and 3.1% (2 patient died in 64) among patients with normal vitamin D level. The clinical manifestations of COVID-19 varies from asymptomatic or paucisymptomatic forms to critical illness characterized by respiratory failure that warrants mechanical ventilation in an ICU. Multiple organ dysfunction syndromes (MODS); sepsis and septic shock are other serious COVID-19 manifestation that warrants ICU admission. As per various studies only 10–15% of cases develop serious disease. Even in same age group without any cormorbid condition there is wide variation in the clinical severity. As till now there is no definitive treatment or vaccine is available for SARS-CoV-2., if one can identify some or other modifiable factor whose presence or absence affects the severity of disease one can definitely reduce the severity of disease. The first such factor that comes to mind is viral load itself. However, Argyropoulos et al. ruled out any association of initial viral load to the severity or chances of developing acute respiratory distress syndrome in SARS-CoV-2 patients. There were media reports which correlates severity of COVID-19 with blood group, however the prospective multi-institutional study conducted by Latz et al. ruled out any independent association between blood type and peak inflammatory markers. The study concluded that no specific blood type is associated with the risk of intubation or mortality in COVID-19. Regarding, acute lung injury in COVID-19 the data so far available has indicated than an unrestricted immune reaction in the host is the main process which leads to so called 'cytokine storm' the net effect is is extensive tissue damage with dysfunctional coagulation. Just a month ago, Italian researchers introduced MicroCLOTS (microvascular COVID-19 lung vessels obstructive thromboinflammatory syndrome) as mechanism for underlying pulmonary injury in COVID-19. Out of several cytokines like the tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α), IL-1β, IL-8, IL-12 play definite role in the pathogenic cascade of the disease and the most important mediator of this storm is interleukin 6 (IL-6). IL-6 can be produced by immune system cells (B lymphocytes, T lymphocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells, monocytes, mast cells); stromal cells and by many non-lymphocytes cells including fibroblast and endothelial cells. IL-1β and TNFα are the key activators for the secretion of the IL-6. Vitamin D is usually acknowledged for the maintenance of bone health and calcium–phosphorus metabolism, many other roles like stimulation of insulin production, effects on myocardial contractility have been recently discovered. Vitamin D plays an essential role in the immune system. Vitamin D interferes with the majority of the immune systems cells such as macrophages, B and T lymphocytes, neutrophils and dendritic cells. The T and B lymphocytes can form the active metabolite of vitamin D, 1,25(OH)2D3 which inhibits T cell proliferation and activation. Beside this, vitamin D inhibits the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and enhance the production of anti-inflammatory cytokines. Vitamin D inhibits the adaptive immune system and promotes the innate immune system which balances the immune response and provides an overall anti-inflammatory response. In Current study authors found that vitamin D deficiency (as suggested by serum 25 (OH)D concentration < 20 ng/mL) is far more prevalent in patients with severe COVID–19 disease requiring ICU admission and thereby increased chances of mortality. For non-skeletal purpose many researchers had suggested cutoff level of serum 25 (OH)D to < 30 ng/ml for defining vitamin D deficiency, on adopting this criterion the prevalence was almost 100% in critically ill patients (62 out of 63). On the same side the patients with vitamin D deficiency exhibit higher levels of chemical markers of inflammation. The current study is the first and the most comprehensive study in which both severe and asymptomatic COVID patients were included and vitamin D level along with inflammatory markers were estimated the so as to correlate the association. In current study authors preferred of using period-based inclusion of subject over specifying the sample size because of the reason that COVID-19 is an emerging pandemic with variable level of seropositivity in the society and none of the sample size formula fits well with satisfactory reduction in the chances of error. Authors adopted 6-week criterion for inclusion of eligible subjects which is around 10.71% of year (56 weeks). Beside this all the subjects were followed till the closure that is successful discharge or mortality. In western countries there is a strong association of vitamin D deficiency with socioeconomic status, which doesn’t holds true in India, rather few studies have demonstrated lower prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in low socioeconomic status and correlated this to higher sunlight exposure in lower socioeconomic strata of India. Keeping this in view authors excluded accounting of socioeconomic status as independent variable. Jun Xu, et al. in had demonstrated beneficial effect of vitamin D agonist, calcitriol, on LPS-induced acute lung injury in rats; they had demonstrated that calcitriol pretreatment significantly improved LPS-induced lung permeability. Through ELISA analysis they demonstrated that calcitriol modulates the expression of members of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), including angiotensin I-converting enzymes (ACE and ACE2), renin and angiotensin II, to exert the protective effects on LPS-induced lung injury. Surprisingly, SARS Cov-2 also uses ACE receptors for infection. Biesalski, in the review article emphasize the fatal relationship of Vitamin D and comorbidities in COVID-19 patients. E Laird, J Rhodes also conducted a literature search study to conclude that optimising vitamin D status certainly have benefits in COVID-19. The results of current study however be interpreted with few limitations. First, the study has been conducted in a single centre located in central India, the area has itself high prevalence of vitamin D deficiency. Second: Time elapsed between actual infection and admission has not been taken in to consideration and the quantitative variables are measured only when patient got admitted in the hospital. This may have impact over chemical markers of inflammation. Third Current study doesn’t take co morbidities in account while estimating pro-inflammatory markers as co-morbidities like diabetes and hypertension enhance the severity in COVID-19. So keeping these in view a multicentre study with large number of subjects can be carried out or a large pooled prospective datasets can be collected to re-assess the result and will generate more robust conclusions. Vitamin D deficiency markedly increases the chance of having severe disease after infection with SARS Cov-2. The intensity of inflammatory response is also higher in vitamin D deficient COVID-19 patients. This all translates to increase morbidity and mortality in COVID-19 patients who are deficient in vitamin D. Keeping the current COVID-19 pandemic in view authors recommend administration of vitamin D supplements to population at risk for COVID-19. Huang, C.

Autosomal recessive genetic disorder characterized by abnormal transport of chloride and sodium across an epithelium, leading to thick, viscous secretions. Salty tasting skin, poor growth, poor weight gain, accumulation of thick, sticky mucus, frequent chest infections, coughing, and shortness of breath. Airspace enlargement and wall destruction caused by smoking. Characteristic dyspnea The flow of air into and out of the lungs is impaired. COPD includes the conditions emphysema and chronic bronchitis. Typically caused by smoking. Chronic cough with sputum production, dyspnea, rhonchi (low pitch gurgling lung sounds). Found in premature infants caused by developmental insufficiency of surfactant production (HMD) and structural immaturity in the lungs. Tachypnea, tachycardia, chest wall retractions, expiratory grunting, nasal flaring, and cyanosis. Airways become reduced in volume or have free flow of gas impeded, making it more difficult to move air in and out of the lung. Hyperplasia and hypersecretion of mucous glands due to smoking and air pollutants resulting in a productive cough. The abnormal, irreversible dilatation of the bronchi caused by destructive and inflammatory changes in the airway walls with persistent severe infections with a cough, purulent sputum (pus filled) and fever. Asthma, Emphysema, and Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) Typically from the radiation given for cancer treatment. Malignant tumors of the respiratory system, particularly primary carcinomas of the lung, are a major health problem responsible for 15% of all cancer diagnoses and 29% of all cancer deaths. The majority of respiratory system cancers are attributable to smoking tobacco. Most common Upper Respiratory Tract Infection. Viral infectious disease which affects primarily the nose. Well over 200 viruses are implicated in the cause while the rhinoviruses are the most common. Symptoms include cough, sore throat, runny nose, and fever. Inflammation of the paranasal sinuses caused by infection, allergy, or autoimmune issues. Most cases are due to a viral infection and resolve over the course of 10 days. Symptoms include headache/facial pain or dull aching pressure over the affected sinuses. Inflammation of the tonsils most commonly caused by a viral or bacterial infection. Infection between the tympanic membrane and the inner ear, including the auditory canal. Inflammation of the throat often brought on by bacterial or viral drainage from sinusitis. Inflammation of the larynx due to an irritation to the vocal cords resulting in dysphonia. Most common Lower Respiratory Tract Infection. Typically caused by bacteria, particularly Streptococcus pneumoniae in Western countries. Worldwide, tuberculosis is an important cause of pneumonia. Other pathogens include viruses and fungi. Viral respiratory disease cause by a coronavirus. In 2002/03 an outbreak of SARS in Hong Kong nearly became pandemic, with 916 deaths worldwide and an 11% fatality rate. Initial symptoms are flu-like and may include fever, myalgia, lethargy, cough, and sore throat. A yeast-like fungus that causes pneumonia as an opportunistic infection in people with a weak immune system. TB - Common, potentially lethal, infectious disease typically caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Most infections are asymptomatic and latent, but about one in 10 latent infections eventually progresses to active disease which, if left untreated, kills more than 50% of those so infected. Symptoms include chronic cough, blood-tinged sputum, fever, night sweats, and weight loss. Excess fluid that accumulates between the serous membrane layers. Four types include a serous fluid (hydrothorax), blood (hemothorax), lymphatic fluid (chylothorax), and pus (pyothorax). Presents with decreased movement of the chest on the affected side, stony dullness to percussion over the fluid, and diminished breath sounds on the affected side. Air or gas in the pleural space separating the lung from the chest wall which may interfere with normal breathing. Presents with chest pain and mild breathlessness Considered to be present when a pneumothorax leads to significant impairment of respiration or blood circulation. Presents with chest pain, respiratory distress, tachycardia, tachypnea, and decreased blood oxygen saturation levels. Tends to occur in 20-30 year old tall, slender men without underlying lung problems. In individuals with significant underlying lung disease with the most common being Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease. Blunt trauma or a penetrating injury to the chest wall with the most common mechanism being sharp bony points at a rib fracture penetrating the pleura.

Holiday celebrations this year will need to place health and safety over some traditions because of how easily the coronavirus spreads, and how dangerous it can be for some people. The safest celebrations will be with your immediate family in your own home. An important first step in making holiday plans is to check your local COVID-19 transmission rate. If COVID-19 cases have increased in your community, the risk of the virus being transmitted to you has also increased. Stay updated and follow public health guidelines regarding Stay-at-Home and Safer-at-Home orders. The safest way to celebrate this holiday season is to stay home with the family members who live with you. Staying home protects you from getting exposed to viruses at holiday gatherings. Staying home also prevents you from sharing germs with other people, especially those in high-risk groups. Many traditions can be shared virtually via FaceTime or Zoom. Here are some ideas: Have each person share something important to them – what they are thankful for, favorite holiday memory, favorite holiday food, etc. Watch a holiday show, movie or parade simultaneously in multiple homes Read a holiday classic or have a family talent show via Zoom One way to keep the tradition of sharing holiday foods, is to prepare the food (while wearing a mask and gloves), wrap it up and deliver it without coming into contact with the recipient   Small gatherings outdoors that are appropriately , have limited contact with commonly touched surfaces and limited number of people handling and serving food have some risk for exposure to COVID-19. Here are some suggestions for reducing that risk: Use single-use food options for salad dressings, condiments, etc. Have hand sanitizing or washing stations outside. Use paper towels for drying hands Wear masks if less than six feet apart and when you have to be indoors Follow local public health recommendations for gatherings The (CDC) recommends you quarantine after attending a group gathering   Large indoor gatherings, even with close family, is not recommended. Even just talking can increase the risk of spreading the virus. If you feel like you must attend a large family gathering, consider the following ways to protect everyone. Allow high-risk family members to participate remotely Follow local public health recommendations for gatherings     Avoid attending large public gatherings, especially those indoors, because they substantially increase your risk of catching many viruses, including SARS-CoV-2. The CDC recommends avoiding shopping in crowded stores and attending indoor public events and large gatherings Opt for participating in online concerts, virtual gatherings and phone calls to be safe Follow local public health recommendations for gatherings     if you do not feel well or are at higher risk for getting very sick from COVID-19. when in public and stay at least six feet from others.

It looks just like any other viral syndrome. For moderate disease you're in the hospital for a few days, you need a little oxygen. You might have a little chest pain, a little exercise intolerance if you have a little inflammation on your heart, those people are going to recover fine too just like any other viral disease. : It's all the severe disease people we worry about. We know critical illness comes along with a host of problems that are difficult to recover from including memory issues, post-traumatic stress disorders, exercise intolerance, just to name a few. There's a whole list of things that people experience. One unique thing that people with this disease might experience is there are some reports of pulmonary fibrosis afterwards so scarring in 20% to 30% of the patients who require ventilation. We know that in regular ARDS, the lung disease, by six months the lungs have recovered. So it might just be too soon to tell but there is a possibility that this disease can cause more injury to the lung and more residual fibrosis than other forms of ARDS.

You need an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that has at least 60 percent alcohol to reduce the number of germs on the hands. How much hand sanitizer is needed to clean your hands? Follow the instructions on the bottle of hand sanitizer. Most will instruct you to use an amount the size of a quarter. You need to cover all surfaces of your hands, the top, bottom, fingers, around fingertips and fingernails, and rub up your wrist about two inches. How long do you rub your hands together when using hand sanitizer? Rub your hands together for about 15-30 seconds (about the time it takes to sing the Happy Birthday to You song) or until hands feel dry. Do I have to wait for the hand sanitizer to dry on my skin? Yes. Rub your hands together until the hand sanitizer feels dry on your skin. DO NOT wave your hands around to dry them because they will pick up microorganisms that are in the air. When do you need to use soap and water instead of hand sanitizer? Hand sanitizers are not as effective on hands that are greasy or heavily soiled. It is best to use soap and water after handling food, playing sports, gardening, camping, fishing or working on vehicles. It is better for people with eczema to wash hands with soap and water, then apply hand cream. Hand sanitizers can be very irritating to eczema skin.

Hojaiji, H., Zhao, Y., Gong, M. C., Mallajosyula, M., Tan, J., Lin, H., Hojaiji, A. M., Lin, S., Milla, C., Madni, A. M., Emaminejad, S. To track dynamically varying and physiologically relevant biomarker profiles in sweat, autonomous wearable platforms are required to periodically sample and analyze sweat with minimal or no user intervention. Previously reported sweat sensors are functionally limited to capturing biomarker information at one time-point/period, thereby necessitating repeated user intervention to increase the temporal granularity of biomarker data. Accordingly, we present a compact multi-compartment wearable system, where each compartment can be activated to autonomously induce/modulate sweat secretion (via iontophoretic actuation) and analyze sweat at set time points. This system was developed following a hybrid-flex design and a vertical integration scheme-integrating the required functional modules: miniaturized iontophoresis interfaces, adhesive thin film microfluidic-sensing module, and control/readout electronics. The system was deployed in a human subject study to track the diurnal variation of sweat glucose levels in relation to the daily food intake. The demonstrated autonomous operation for diurnal sweat biomarker data acquisition illustrates the system's suitability for large-scale and longitudinal personal health monitoring applications.

Brockmeyer, J. M., Wise, R. T., Burgener, E. B., Milla, C., Frymoyer, A. BACKGROUND: The area under the concentration-time curve over 24 hours (AUC24 ) is frequently utilized to monitor tobramycin exposure in children with cystic fibrosis (CF). An understanding of exposure target achievement during clinical implementation of an AUC24 based approach in children is limited.METHODS: A retrospective chart review was performed in children with CF treated with once daily tobramycin and drug concentration monitoring at a pediatric CF center. During clinical care AUC24 was estimated using a traditional log-linear regression approach (LLR). AUC24 was also estimated retrospectively using a pharmacokinetic model-based Bayesian forecasting approach (BF). AUC24 achievement after both approaches were compared.RESULTS: In 77 treatment courses (mean age 12.7 5.0 years), a target AUC24 100-125 mg*h/L was achieved after starting dose in 21 (27%) and after initial dose adjustment in 35 (45%). In the first 7 days of treatment, 24 (32%) required 3 dose adjustments, and the mean number of drug concentrations measured was 7.1 3.2. Examination of a BF approach demonstrated adequate prediction of measured tobramycin concentrations (median bias -2.1% [95% CI -3.1 to -1.4]; median precision 7.6% [95% CI 7.1 to 8.2%]). AUC24 estimates utilizing the BF approach were higher than the LLR approach with a mean difference of 6.4 mg*h/L (95% CI 4.8 to 8.0 mg*h/L).CONCLUSIONS: Achievement of a narrow AUC24 target is challenging during clinical care, and dose individualization is needed in most children with CF. Implementing a BF approach for estimating AUC24 in children with CF is supported. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved. Noninvasive wearable electroactive pharmaceutical monitoring for personalized therapeutics. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America Lin, S., Yu, W., Wang, B., Zhao, Y., En, K., Zhu, J., Cheng, X., Zhou, C., Lin, H., Wang, Z., Hojaiji, H., Yeung, C., Milla, C., Davis, R. W., Emaminejad, S. To achieve the mission of personalized medicine, centering on delivering the right drug to the right patient at the right dose, therapeutic drug monitoring solutions are necessary. In that regard, wearable biosensing technologies, capable of tracking drug pharmacokinetics in noninvasively retrievable biofluids (e.g., sweat), play a critical role, because they can be deployed at a large scale to monitor the individuals' drug transcourse profiles (semi)continuously and longitudinally. To this end, voltammetry-based sensing modalities are suitable, as in principle they can detect and quantify electroactive drugs on the basis of the target's redox signature. However, the target's redox signature in complex biofluid matrices can be confounded by the immediate biofouling effects and distorted/buried by the interfering voltammetric responses of endogenous electroactive species. Here, we devise a wearable voltammetric sensor development strategy-centering on engineering the molecule-surface interactions-to simultaneously mitigate biofouling and create an ""undistorted potential window"" within which the target drug's voltammetric response is dominant and interference is eliminated. To inform its clinical utility, our strategy was adopted to track the temporal profile of circulating acetaminophen (a widely used analgesic and antipyretic) in saliva and sweat, using a surface-modified boron-doped diamond sensing interface (cross-validated with laboratory-based assays, R 2 0.94). Through integration of the engineered sensing interface within a custom-developed smartwatch, and augmentation with a dedicated analytical framework (for redox peak extraction), we realized a wearable solution to seamlessly render drug readouts with minute-level temporal resolution. Leveraging this solution, we demonstrated the pharmacokinetic correlation and significance of sweat readings.

E., Bollyky, P. L. Pf bacteriophage are temperate phages that infect the bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a major cause of chronic lung infections in cystic fibrosis (CF) and other settings. Pf and other temperate phages have evolved complex, mutualistic relationships with their bacterial hosts that impact both bacterial phenotypes and chronic infection. We and others have reported that Pf phages are a virulence factor that promote the pathogenesis of P. aeruginosa infections in animal models and are associated with worse skin and lung infections in humans. Here we review the biology of Pf phage and what is known about its contributions to pathogenesis and clinical disease. First, we review the structure, genetics, and epidemiology of Pf phage. Next, we address the diverse and surprising ways that Pf phages contribute to P. aeruginosa phenotypes including effects on biofilm formation, antibiotic resistance, and motility. Then, we cover data indicating that Pf phages suppress mammalian immunity at sites of bacterial infection. Finally, we discuss recent literature implicating Pf in chronic P. aeruginosa infections in CF and other settings. Together, these reports suggest that Pf bacteriophage have direct effects on P. aeruginosa infections and that temperate phages are an exciting frontier in microbiology, immunology, and human health.

R., Tracy, M. C., Sweere, J. M., Bik, E. M., Milla, C. E., Bollyky, P. L. Background: There is increasing interest in the pulmonary microbiome's bacterial and viral communities, particularly in the context of chronic airway infections in cystic fibrosis (CF). However, the isolation of microbial DNA from the sputum from patients with CF is technically challenging and the optimal protocols for the analysis of viral species, including bacteriophage, from clinical samples remains difficult. Materials and Methods: In this study, we evaluate a set of methods developed for processing and analyzing sputum from patients with CF with the goal of detecting Pf bacteriophage virion-derived nucleic acid. We evaluate the impact of bead beating, deoxyribonuclease digestion, and heating steps in these protocols focusing on the quantitative assessment of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Pf bacteriophage in sputum. Results: Based on these comparative data, we describe an optimized protocol for processing sputum from patients with CF and isolating DNA for polymerase chain reaction or sequencing-based studies. Conclusion: These studies demonstrate the assessment of a specific bacteriophage and bacteria in sputum from patients with CF.

Despite such advances, effective sweat sampling remains a significant challenge for reliable biomarker analysis, with many existing methods requiring active stimulation (e.g., iontophoresis, exercise, heat). Natural perspiration offers a suitable alternative as sweat can be collected with minimal effort on the part of the user. To leverage this phenomenon, we devised a thin hydrogel micropatch (THMP), which simultaneously serves as an interface for sweat sampling and a medium for electrochemical sensing. To characterize the performance of the THMP, caffeine and lactate were selected as two representative target molecules. We demonstrated the suitability of the sampling method to track metabolic patterns, as well as to render sample-to-answer biomarker data for personal monitoring (through coupling with an electrochemical sensing system). To inform its potential application, this biomarker sampling and sensing system is incorporated within a distributed terminal-based sensing network, which uniquely capitalizes on the fingertip as a site for simultaneous biomarker data sampling and user identification. Proof of concept for identifying cystic fibrosis from perspiration samples. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America The gold standard for cystic fibrosis (CF) diagnosis is the determination of chloride concentration in sweat. Current testing methodology takes up to 3 h to complete and has recognized shortcomings on its diagnostic accuracy. We present an alternative method for the identification of CF by combining desorption electrospray ionization mass spectrometry and a machine-learning algorithm based on gradient boosted decision trees to analyze perspiration samples. This process takes as little as 2 min, and we determined its accuracy to be 98 2% by cross-validation on analyzing 277 perspiration samples. With the introduction of statistical bootstrap, our method can provide a confidence estimate of our prediction, which helps diagnosis decision-making. We also identified important peaks by the feature selection algorithm and assigned the chemical structure of the metabolites by high-resolution and/or tandem mass spectrometry. We inspected the correlation between mild and severe CFTR gene mutation types and lipid profiles, suggesting a possible way to realize personalized medicine with this noninvasive, fast, and accurate method.

View details for Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia: Longitudinal Study of Lung Disease by Ultrastructure Defect and Genotype AMERICAN JOURNAL OF RESPIRATORY AND CRITICAL CARE MEDICINE Davis, S. D., Rosenfeld, M., Lee, H., Ferkol, T. W., Sagel, S. D., Dell, S. D., Milla, C., Pittman, J. E., Shapiro, A. J., Sullivan, K. M., Nykamp, K. R., Krischer, J. P., Zariwala, M. A., Knowles, M. R., Leigh, M. W., Genetic Disorders Mucociliary Cl In primary ciliary dyskinesia, factors leading to disease heterogeneity are poorly understood.To describe early lung disease progression in primary ciliary dyskinesia and identify associations between ultrastructural defects and genotypes with clinical phenotype.This was a prospective, longitudinal (5 yr), multicenter, observational study. Inclusion criteria were less than 19 years at enrollment and greater than or equal to two annual study visits. Linear mixed effects models including random slope and random intercept were used to evaluate longitudinal associations between the ciliary defect group (or genotype group) and clinical features (percent predicted FEV1 and weight and height z-scores).A total of 137 participants completed 732 visits. The group with absent inner dynein arm, central apparatus defects, and microtubular disorganization (IDA/CA/MTD) (n=41) were significantly younger at diagnosis and in mixed effects models had significantly lower percent predicted FEV1 and weight and height z-scores than the isolated outer dynein arm defect (n=55) group. Participants with CCDC39 or CCDC40 mutations (n=34) had lower percent predicted FEV1 and weight and height z-scores than those with DNAH5 mutations (n=36). For the entire cohort, percent predicted FEV1 decline was heterogeneous with a mean (SE) decline of 0.57 (0.25) percent predicted/yr. Rate of decline was different from zero only in the IDA/MTD/CA group (mean [SE], -1.11 [0.48] percent predicted/yr; P=0.02).Participants with IDA/MTD/CA defects, which included individuals with CCDC39 or CCDC40 mutations, had worse lung function and growth indices compared with those with outer dynein arm defects and DNAH5 mutations, respectively. The only group with a significant lung function decline over time were participants with IDA/MTD/CA defects. Filamentous bacteriophages are associated with chronic Pseudomonas lung infections and antibiotic resistance in cystic fibrosis. Burgener, E. B., Sweere, J. M., Bach, M. S., Secor, P. R., Haddock, N., Jennings, L. K., Marvig, R. L., Johansen, H. K., Rossi, E., Cao, X., Tian, L., Nedelec, L., Molin, S., Bollyky, P. L., Milla, C. E. Filamentous bacteriophage (Pf phage) contribute to the virulence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections in animal models, but their relevance to human disease is unclear. We sought to interrogate the prevalence and clinical relevance of Pf phage in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) using sputum samples from two well-characterized patient cohorts. Bacterial genomic analysis in a Danish longitudinal cohort of 34 patients with CF revealed that 26.5% (n = 9) were consistently Pf phage positive. In the second cohort, a prospective cross-sectional cohort of 58 patients with CF at Stanford, sputum qPCR analysis showed that 36.2% (n = 21) of patients were Pf phage positive. In both cohorts, patients positive for Pf phage were older, and in the Stanford CF cohort, patients positive for Pf phage were more likely to have chronic P. aeruginosa infection and had greater declines in pulmonary function during exacerbations than patients negative for Pf phage presence in the sputum. Last, P. aeruginosa strains carrying Pf phage exhibited increased resistance to antipseudomonal antibiotics. Mechanistically, in vitro analysis showed that Pf phage sequesters these same antibiotics, suggesting that this mechanism may thereby contribute to the selection of antibiotic resistance over time. These data provide evidence that Pf phage may contribute to clinical outcomes in P. aeruginosa infection in CF. New Algorithm for the Integration of Ultrasound Into Cystic Fibrosis Liver Disease Screening. Journal of pediatric gastroenterology and nutrition Sellers, Z. M., Lee, L. W., Barth, R. A., Milla, C. Liver nodularity occurs across the spectrum of cystic fibrosis liver disease (CFLD), from regenerative nodules to cirrhosis, and can occur without liver enzyme abnormalities. Our aims were to determine if incorporating abdominal ultrasound (US) with annual laboratory testing improves the detection of CFLD and establish CF-specific thresholds for liver screening labs.CF patients at least 6 years old who were exocrine pancreatic-insufficient had an US with Doppler and shear wave elastography. Patients were divided into Normal, Echogenic, or Nodular groups, based on US findings. Results were compared with aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), platelets, AST to platelet ratio index (APRI), Fibrosis 4 (FIB-4), and gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) to platelet ratio (GPR). Receiver operator curve, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and optimal cut-off with Youden Index were calculated.From 82 patients, incorporation of US identified more nodular livers than using labs alone. The Nodular group had significantly greater median AST (44), ALT (48), GGT (46), APRI (0.619), FIB-4 (0.286), GPR (1.431). Optimal cut-offs to detect liver nodularity in CF were AST >33, ALT >45, GGT >21, Platelets <230, APRI >0.367, FIB-4 >0.222, GPR >0.682. Using GGT, APRI, and GPR, we generated an algorithm to direct the use of US in CFLD screening.Using modified serum lab thresholds, addition of liver fibrosis indices, and/or abdominal US can increase detection of liver nodularity in CF. A combination of GGT, GPR, and APRI can help direct which CF children should undergo US evaluation. These tools may improve earlier identification of fibrosis and/or cirrhosis in CF patients. High-Efficiency, Selection-free Gene Repair in Airway Stem Cells from Cystic Fibrosis Patients Rescues CFTR Function in Differentiated Epithelia. Vaidyanathan, S., Salahudeen, A. A., Sellers, Z. M., Bravo, D. T., Choi, S. S., Batish, A., Le, W., Baik, R., de la O, S., Kaushik, M. P., Galper, N., Lee, C. M., Teran, C. A., Yoo, J. H., Bao, G., Chang, E. H., Patel, Z. M., Hwang, P. H., Wine, J. J., Milla, C. E., Desai, T. J., Nayak, J. V., Kuo, C. J., Porteus, M. H. Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a monogenic disorder caused by mutations in the Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator (CFTR) gene. Mortality in CF patients is mostly due to respiratory sequelae. Challenges with gene delivery have limited attempts to treat CF using invivo gene therapy, and low correction levels have hindered exvivo gene therapy efforts. We have used Cas9 and adeno-associated virus 6 to correct the F508 mutation in readily accessible upper-airway basal stem cells (UABCs) obtained from CF patients. On average, we achieved 30%-50% allelic correction in UABCs and bronchial epithelial cells (HBECs) from 10 CF patients andobserved 20%-50% CFTR function relative to non-CF controls in differentiated epithelia. Furthermore, we successfully embedded the corrected UABCs on an FDA-approved porcine small intestinal submucosal membrane (pSIS), and they retained differentiation capacity. This study supports further development of genetically corrected autologous airway stem cell transplant as a treatment for CF. Impact of Residential Distance on Lung Function in the Adult Cystic Fibrosis Population: A Single Center Study Marmor, M., Hernandez, C., Dhillon, G. S., Rehkopf, D., Milla, C. E. View details for Salivary thiocyanate as a biomarker of Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Regulator function. Malkovskiy, A. V., Yacob, A. A., Dunn, C. E., Zirbes, J. M., Ryan, S. P., Bollyky, P. L., Rajadas, J., Milla, C. E. Improved methods are needed to reliably assess CFTR function in vivo in light of recent therapeutic developments targeting the Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator (CFTR) protein. Saliva from patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) and healthy controls (HC) was studied using colorimetry and non-resonant Raman spectroscopy. Colorimetry experiments showed only a 36% decrease in thiocyanate (SCN-) concentration, but a sharp Raman peak at 2068 cm-1, attributable to (SCN-) vibrations, normalized to C-H peak, was on average 18 times higher for HC samples. Samples from patients under-going treatment with CFTR modulators including ivacaftor, lumacaftor and tezacaftor, showed a high normalized peak in response to therapy. The peak intensity was consistent in longitudinal samples from single donors and in stored samples. The Raman peak ratio is a more sensitive, convenient, non-invasive biomarker for assessments of the therapeutic efficacy of drugs targeting CFTR and provides a value that is in much better agreement with theoretical expectations of saliva SCN- concentrations, compared to colorimetry. Moreover, samples from patients can be collected remotely, as they are stable and can be shipped in dry state. This insight may greatly facilitate assessments of CFTR modulator efficacy in individual pa-tients as well as development of new ones. Elafin Treatment Rescues EGFR-Klf4 Signaling and Lung Cell Survival in Ventilated Newborn Mice. American journal of respiratory cell and molecular biology Alejandre Alcazar, M. A., Kaschwich, M., Ertsey, R., Preuss, S., Milla, C., Mujahid, S., Masumi, J., Khan, S., Mokres, L. M., Tian, L., Mohr, J., Hirani, D. V., Rabinovitch, M., Bland, R. D. Mechanical ventilation with O2-rich gas (MV-O2) inhibits alveologenesis and lung growth. We previously showed that MV-O2 increased elastase activity and apoptosis in lungs of newborn mice, whereas elastase inhibition by elafin suppressed apoptosis and enabled lung growth. Pilot studies suggested that MV-O2 reduces lung expression of prosurvival factors phosphorylated epidermal growth factor receptor (pEGFR) and Kruppel-like factor 4 (Klf4). Here, we sought to determine whether apoptosis and lung growth arrest evoked by MV-O2 reflect disrupted pEGFR-Klf4 signaling, which elafin treatment preserves, and to assess potential biomarkers of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Five-day-old mice underwent MV with air or 40% O2 for 8-24 hours with or without elafin treatment. Unventilated pups served as controls. Immunoblots were used to assess lung pEGFR and Klf4 proteins. Cultured MLE-12 cells were exposed to AG1478 (EGFR inhibitor), Klf4 siRNA, or vehicle to assess effects on proliferation, apoptosis, and EGFR regulation of Klf4. Plasma elastase and elafin levels were measured in extremely premature infants. In newborn mice, MV with air or 40% O2 inhibited EGFR phosphorylation and suppressed Klf4 protein content in lungs (vs. unventilated controls), yielding increased apoptosis. Elafin treatment inhibited elastase, preserved lung pEGFR and Klf4, and attenuated the apoptosis observed in lungs of vehicle-treated mice. In MLE-12 studies, pharmacological inhibition of EGFR and siRNA suppression of Klf4 increased apoptosis and reduced proliferation, and EGFR inhibition decreased Klf4. Plasma elastase levels were more than twofold higher, without a compensating increase of plasma elafin, in infants with BPD, compared to infants without BPD. These findings indicate that pEGFR-Klf4 is a novel prosurvival signaling pathway in lung epithelium that MV disrupts. Elafin preserves pEGFR-Klf4 signaling and inhibits apoptosis, thereby enabling lung growth during MV. Together, our animal and human data raise the question: would elastase inhibition prevent BPD in high-risk infants exposed to MV-O2? Age-related heterogeneity in dental caries and associated risk factors in individuals with cystic fibrosis ages 6-20 years: A pilot study Chi, D. L., Rosenfeld, M., Mancl, L., Chung, W. O., Presland, R. B., Sarvas, E., Rothen, M., Alkhateeb, A., McNamara, S., Genatossio, A., Virella-Lowell, I., Milla, C., Scott, J. The literature conflicts regarding dental caries risk in cystic fibrosis (CF) relative to controls.Prospective, observational study of age-related heterogeneity in caries rates and potential risk factors in individuals with CF ages 6-20 at a single clinic in Washington state (N=85). Caries rates for enrolled CF participants and historical controls from NHANES were compared using cubic spline regression models. Generalized linear regression models identified correlates of age and caries in CF.Children ages 6-9 with CF had significantly lower caries than controls (Holm's P<0.05). There was no difference for ages 10-20 by CF status (Holm's P>0.05). Various biological/intraoral, medical, and behavioral factors were associated with caries and age in CF.Younger children with CF may be protected from caries, but there is apparent loss of protection in early adolescence associated with multiple risk factors. Additional studies are needed to confirm these findings.

American journal of respiratory and critical care medicine KB001-A, a novel anti-inflammatory, found to be safe and well-tolerated in cystic fibrosis patients infected with Pseudomonas aeruginosa Jain, R., Beckett, V. V., Konstan, M. W., Accurso, F. J., Burns, J. L., Mayer-Hamblett, N., Milla, C., VanDevanter, D. R., Chmiel, J. F., KB001-A Study Grp Chronic Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Pa) airways infection, exuberant local inflammation, and progressive lung function loss are hallmarks of cystic fibrosis (CF). KB001-A is an anti-PcrV PEGylated monoclonal antibody fragment to the Type III secretion system of Pa. This 16-week study evaluated KB001-A associated effect on time-to-need for antibiotics for worsening respiratory signs and symptoms, as well as safety, and treatment-associated changes in symptom scores, inflammatory markers, and spirometry.This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, repeat-dose study in CF subjects with Pa. Intravenous 10mg/kg KB001-A or placebo infusions were administered at baseline and weeks 2, 4, 8, and 16, with a 4-week follow-up. Sputum inflammatory markers were assessed in a sub-study. Time-to-need for antibiotics was compared between groups by Kaplan Meier analysis and Cox proportional hazards modeling adjusting for randomization strata.Of 182 subjects, 169 received at least one infusion of KB001-A (n=83) or placebo (n=86). KB001-A was generally safe and well-tolerated as compared to placebo, with no significant emergent adverse effects other than one serious adverse event of elevated hepatic enzymes of unclear etiology. Time to need for antibiotics did not differ between groups (HR: 1.00; 95% CI: 0.69, 1.45, p=0.995). A 3.2 increase in ppFEV1 from placebo favoring KB001-A was observed at week 16 (95% CI: 1.12, 5.30, p=0.003). Mean changes from baseline in log10 sputum neutrophil elastase (NE) had a non-significant decrease (-0.27, 95% CI: -0.58,0.04, p=0.084) while IL-8 concentrations at week 16 were significantly lower (-0.27, 95% CI: -0.55,0.00, p=0.048) among KB001-A subjects (n=16) relative to placebo (n=13).KB001-A was safe and well-tolerated and associated with a modest FEV1 benefit and reduction in select sputum inflammatory markers (IL-8). KB001-A was not associated with an increased time to need for antibiotics. The lack of efficacy seen with KB001-A may be due, in part, to the low levels of the type III secretion proteins previously reported in sputum of CF patients chronically infected with Pa. Ivacaftor restores CFTR-dependent sweat gland fluid secretion in cystic fibrosis subjects with S945L alleles Kim, J., Davies, Z., Dunn, C., Wine, J. J., Milla, C. To determine in vivo effects of CFTR modulators on mutation S945L.We measured effects of CFTR modulators on CFTR-dependent sweating ('C-sweat') in two pancreatic sufficient cystic fibrosis (CF) subjects. S1 (S945L/G542X) took ivacaftor and S2 (S945L/F508del) took ivacaftor+tezacaftor. Sweating was stimulated pharmacologically to produce sequentially both CFTR-independent (methacholine stimulated) M-sweat and C-sweat; and the ratio of these was compared. Sweat secretion was measured with two methods: real time secretory rate quantitative recording and by optically measuring the growth of sweat bubbles under oil from multiple identified glands.Using the quantitative recorder, we saw zero C-sweat secretion off-drug, but when on-drug the C-sweat responses for both subjects were comparable to those seen in carriers. The on-drug response was further quantified using the sweat bubble method. Each subject again showed robust C-sweat responses, with C-sweat/M-sweat ratios~half of the ratio determined for a cohort of 40 controls tested under identical conditions.These in vivo results, consistent with prior in vitro findings, indicate that the drug treatments restore near-normal function to S945L-CFTR, and support the use of ivacaftor as a treatment for CF patients who carry this allele. Progress in Definition, Prevention and Treatment of Fungal Infections in Cystic Fibrosis Schwarz, C., Hartl, D., Eickmeier, O., Hector, A., Benden, C., Durieu, I., Sole, A., Gartner, S., Milla, C. E., Barry, P. Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a chronic lethal multi-system condition; however, most of the morbidity and mortality is dependent on the status of the respiratory system. Progressive respiratory decline is mediated by chronic infection and inflammation, punctuated by important acute events known as pulmonary exacerbations which can lead to accelerated decline. The main bacterial species causing infections include Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae and Achromobacter xylosoxidans. In addition to bacteria, fungi are detected in a significant number of patients. The impact of fungal colonization of the airways is still not completely elucidated, but an increasing body of evidence suggests an important role for moulds and yeasts. Although fungal infections are rare, fungi can cause severe pneumonia requiring appropriate targeted treatment. The most common fungi in respiratory samples of patients with CF are Aspergillus fumigatus, Aspergillus terreus and Scedosporium species for filamentous fungi, and yeasts such as Candida albicans and Candida glabrata. Therapeutic strategies depend on the detected fungus and the underlying clinical status of the patient. The antifungal therapy can range from a simple monotherapy up to a combination of three different drugs. Treatment course may be indicated in some patients for two weeks and in others for up to six months, and in rare cases even longer. New antifungal drugs have been developed and are being tested in clinical studies offering the hope of therapeutic alternatives to existing drugs. Identifying relevant risk factors and diagnostic criteria for fungal colonization and infection is crucial to enabling an adequate prevention, diagnosis and treatment. Diffuse Large Pulmonary Nodules in a Young Child: Is It Always Metastatic? View details for Sweat rate analysis of ivacaftor potentiation of CFTR in non-CF adults. Kim, J., Farahmand, M., Dunn, C., Milla, C. E., Horii, R. I., Thomas, E. A., Moss, R. B., Wine, J. J. To determine if ivacaftor (Kalydeco) influences non-CF human CFTR function in vivo, we measured CFTR-dependent (C-sweat) and CFTR-independent (M-sweat) rates from multiple identified sweat glands in 8 non-CF adults. The two types of sweating were stimulated sequentially with intradermal injections of appropriate reagents; each gland served as its own control via alternating off-on drug tests on both arms, given at weekly intervals with 3 off and 3 on tests per subject. We compared drug effects on C-sweating stimulated by either high or low concentrations of -adrenergic cocktail, and on methacholine-stimulated M-sweating. For each subject we measured ~700 sweat volumes from ~75 glands per arm (maximum 12 readings per gland), and sweat volumes were log-transformed for statistical analysis. T-tests derived from linear mixed models (LMMs) were more conservative than the familiar paired sample t-tests, and show that ivacaftor significantly increased C-sweating stimulated by both levels of agonist, with a larger effect in the low cocktail condition; ivacaftor did not increase M-sweat. Concurrent sweat chloride tests detected no effect of ivacaftor. We conclude that ivacaftor in vivo increases the open channel probability (PO) of WT CFTR, provided it is not already maximally stimulated.

H., eICE Study Team Individuals with cystic fibrosis (CF) experience frequent acute pulmonary exacerbations, which lead to decreased lung function and reduced quality of life.The goal of this study was to determine if an intervention directed toward early detection of pulmonary exacerbations using home spirometry and symptom monitoring would result in slower decline in lung function than in control subjects.We conducted a multicenter, randomized trial at 14 CF centers with subjects at least 14 years old. The early intervention arm subjects measured home spirometry and symptoms electronically twice per week. Sites were notified if a participant met criteria for an exacerbation and contacted participants to determine if treatment for acute exacerbation was required. Participants in the usual care arm were seen every 3 months and were asked to contact the site if they were concerned about worsening pulmonary symptoms.The primary outcome was the 52-week change in FEV1. Secondary outcomes included time to first exacerbation and subsequent exacerbation, quality of life, and change in weight. A total of 267 patients were randomized, and the study arms were well matched at baseline. There was no significant difference between study arms in 52-week mean change in FEV1 slope (mean slope difference, 0.00 L, 95% confidence interval, -0.07 to 0.07; P=0.99). The early intervention arm subjects detected exacerbations more frequently than usual care arm subjects (time to first exacerbation hazard ratio, 1.45; 95% confidence interval, 1.09 to 1.93; P=0.01). Adverse events were not significantly different between treatment arms.An intervention of home monitoring among patients with CF was able to detect more exacerbations than usual care, but this did not result in slower decline in lung function. Clinical trial registered with www.clinicaltrials.gov (NCT01104402). Lung clearance index is sensitive to small airway disease in pediatric lung transplant recipients Kao, J. E., Zirbes, J. M., Conrad, C. K., Milla, C. E. The principal obstacle to long-term survival after lung transplant is chronic lung allograft dysfunction (CLAD), which primarily affects the small airways. After transplant, patients are monitored with spirometry, which is a generally insensitive detector of small airways obstruction. The lung clearance index (LCI) is a measure obtained during multiple breath washout (MBW) maneuvers. We hypothesized that among lung allograft recipients, LCI would detect small airways disease not detected with spirometry.This study enrolled 15 patients, 5 of whom already had a diagnosis of CLAD. We added MBW as an additional index of peripheral airway function to the established post-transplant routine care protocol.Of trials, 87.9% yielded valid measurements, and single maneuvers were 2-8 minutes. LCI did not yield any false-negative findings-no patients were considered obstructed by forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) but normal by LCI. At enrollment, 6 patients without CLAD had an elevated LCI, and 4 progressed to CLAD. Only 2 of these 4 patients would have been identified by a decrease in FEV1.LCI identified lung allograft dysfunction in more patients than the use of standardized spirometric measures, including patients with abnormal FEV1. These data suggest that LCI from MBW may be a more sensitive means to detect allograft peripheral airway disease than standard methods for measurement of small airways function. Autonomous sweat extraction and analysis applied to cystic fibrosis and glucose monitoring using a fully integrated wearable platform PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA Emaminejad, S., Gao, W., Wu, E., Davies, Z. A., Nyein, H. Y., Challa, S., Ryan, S. P., Fahad, H. M., Chen, K., Shahpar, Z., Talebi, S., Milla, C., Javey, A., Davis, R. W. Perspiration-based wearable biosensors facilitate continuous monitoring of individuals' health states with real-time and molecular-level insight. The inherent inaccessibility of sweat in sedentary individuals in large volume (10 L) for on-demand and in situ analysis has limited our ability to capitalize on this noninvasive and rich source of information. A wearable and miniaturized iontophoresis interface is an excellent solution to overcome this barrier. The iontophoresis process involves delivery of stimulating agonists to the sweat glands with the aid of an electrical current. The challenge remains in devising an iontophoresis interface that can extract sufficient amount of sweat for robust sensing, without electrode corrosion and burning/causing discomfort in subjects. Here, we overcame this challenge through realizing an electrochemically enhanced iontophoresis interface, integrated in a wearable sweat analysis platform. This interface can be programmed to induce sweat with various secretion profiles for real-time analysis, a capability which can be exploited to advance our knowledge of the sweat gland physiology and the secretion process. To demonstrate the clinical value of our platform, human subject studies were performed in the context of the cystic fibrosis diagnosis and preliminary investigation of the blood/sweat glucose correlation. With our platform, we detected the elevated sweat electrolyte content of cystic fibrosis patients compared with that of healthy control subjects. Furthermore, our results indicate that oral glucose consumption in the fasting state is followed by increased glucose levels in both sweat and blood. Our solution opens the possibility for a broad range of noninvasive diagnostic and general population health monitoring applications. The magnitude of ivacaftor effects on fluid secretion via R117H-CFTR channels: Human in vivo measurements Char, J. E., Dunn, C., Davies, Z., Milla, C., Moss, R. B., Wine, J. J. We optically measured effects of orally available ivacaftor (Kalydeco) on sweat rates of identified glands in 3 R117H subjects, each having a unique set of additional mutations, and compared them with 5 healthy control subjects tested contemporaneously. We injected -adrenergic agonists intradermally to stimulate CFTR-dependent 'C-sweat' and methacholine to stimulate 'M-sweat', which persists in CF subjects. We focused on an R117H-7T/F508del subject who produced quantifiable C-sweat off ivacaftor and was available for 1 blinded, 3 off ivacaftor, and 3 on ivacaftor tests, allowing us to estimate in vivo fold-increase in sweat rates produced by ivacaftor's effect on the open probability (PO) of R117H-CFTR. Measured sweat rates must be corrected for sweat losses. With estimated sweat losses of 0.023 to 0.08 nlgland-1min-1, ivacaftor increased the average C-sweat rates 3-7 fold, and estimated function as % of WT were 4.1-12% off ivacaftor and 21.9-32% on ivacaftor (larger values reflect increased loss estimates). Based on single tests, an R117H-7T/ R117H-7T subject showed 6-9% WT function off ivacaftor and 28-43% on ivacaftor. Repeat testing of an R117H-5T/F508del subject detected only trace responding to ivacaftor. We conclude that in vivo, R117H PO is strongly increased by ivacaftor, but channel number, mainly determined by variable deletion of exon 10, has a marked influence on outcomes.

Combination lumacaftor/ivacaftor has been shown to improve lung function and other endpoints in patients aged 12 years with cystic fibrosis homozygous for F508del-CFTR but has not been assessed in younger patients.This open-label phase 3 trial evaluated the safety, tolerability, pharmacodynamics, and efficacy of lumacaftor/ivacaftor combination therapy in patients aged 6-11 years with cystic fibrosis homozygous for F508del-CFTR.Patients (N = 58) received 200 mg lumacaftor/250 mg ivacaftor orally every 12 hours for 24 weeks in addition to their existing cystic fibrosis medications.Lumacaftor/ivacaftor was well tolerated; the safety profile was generally similar to that observed in larger lumacaftor/ivacaftor trials in older patients. Four patients discontinued (two due to drug-related adverse events: elevated liver transaminases, n=1; rash, n=1). No safety concerns were associated with spirometry. No significant changes in % predicted FEV1 were observed (change from baseline at Week 24, +2.5 percentage points; 95% CI, -0.2 to 5.2; P = 0.0671). At Week 24, significant improvements from baseline were observed in sweat chloride (-24.8 mmol/L; 95% CI, -29.1 to -20.5; P < 0.0001), BMI z score (+0.15; 95% CI, 0.08 to 0.22; P < 0.0001), Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire-Revised respiratory domain score (+5.4; 95% CI, 1.4 to 9.4; P = 0.0085), and lung clearance index 2.5 (-0.88; 95% CI, -1.40 to -0.37; P = 0.0018).Lumacaftor/ivacaftor was well tolerated in this young population; no new safety concerns were identified. Improvements in lung clearance index, sweat chloride, nutritional status, and health-related quality of life were observed after 24 weeks of treatment.

S., Gonska, T., Howenstine, M. S., Levy, H., Massie, J., Milla, C., Munck, A., Southern, K. W. An unintended consequence of cystic fibrosis (CF) newborn screening (NBS) is the identification of infants with a positive NBS test but inconclusive diagnostic testing. These infants are classified as CF transmembrane conductance regulator-related metabolic syndrome (CRMS) in the US and CF screen positive, inconclusive diagnosis (CFSPID) in other countries. Diagnostic and management decisions of these infants are challenges for CF healthcare professionals and stressful situations for families. As CF NBS has become more widespread across the world, increased information about the epidemiology and outcomes of these infants is becoming available. These data were reviewed at the 2015 CF Foundation Diagnosis Consensus Conference, and a harmonized definition of CRMS and CFSPID was developed.At the consensus conference, participants reviewed published and unpublished studies of CRMS/CFSPID and used a modified Delphi methodology to develop a harmonized approach to the definition of CRMS/CFSPID.Several studies of CRMS/CFSPID from populations around the world have been published in the past year. Although the studies vary in the number of infants studied, study design, and outcome measures, there have been some consistent findings. CRMS/CFSPID occurs relatively frequently, with CF:CRMS that ranges from 3 to 5 cases of CF for every 1 case of CRMS/CFSPID in regions where gene sequencing is not used. The incidence varies by NBS protocol used, and in some regions more cases of CRMS/CFSPID are detected than cases of CF. The majority of individuals with CRMS/CFSPID do not develop CF disease or progress to a diagnosis of CF. However, between 10% and 20% of asymptomatic infants can develop clinical features concerning for CF, such as a respiratory culture positive for Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Most studies have only reported short-term outcomes in the first 1-3 years of life; the long-term outcomes of CRMS/CFSPID remain unknown. The European CF Society definition of CFSPID and the CF Foundation definition of CRMS differ only slightly, and the consensus conference was able to create a unified definition of CRMS/CFSPID.CRMS/CFSPID is a relatively common outcome of CF NBS, and clinicians need to be prepared to counsel families whose NBS test falls into this classification. The vast majority of infants with CRMS/CFSPID will remain free from disease manifestations early in life. However, a small proportion may develop clinical features concerning for CF or demonstrate progression to a clinical phenotype compatible with a CF diagnosis, and their long-term outcomes are not known. A consistent international definition of CRMS/CFSPID will allow for better data collection for study of outcomes and result in improved patient care. Implementation of Depression Screening and Global Health Assessment in Pediatric Subspecialty Clinics. The Journal of adolescent health : official publication of the Society for Adolescent Medicine Iturralde, E., Adams, R. N., Barley, R. C., Bensen, R., Christofferson, M., Hanes, S. J., Maahs, D. M., Milla, C., Naranjo, D., Shah, A. C., Tanenbaum, M. L., Veeravalli, S., Park, K. T., Hood, K. K. Adolescents with chronic illness face greater risk of psychosocial difficulties, complicating disease management. Despite increased calls to screen for patient-reported outcomes, clinical implementation has lagged. Using quality improvement methods, this study aimed to investigate the feasibility of standardized screening for depression and assessment of global health and to determine recommended behavioral health follow-up, across three pediatric subspecialty clinics.A total of 109 patients aged 12-22years (median= 16.6) who were attending outpatient visits for treatment of diabetes (80% type 1), inflammatory bowel disease, or cystic fibrosis completed the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) depression and Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Pediatric Global Health measures on electronic tablets. Patients screening positive on the PHQ-9 received same-day behavioral health assessment and regular phone check-ins to facilitate necessary follow-up care.Overall, 89% of 122 identified patients completed screening during a 6-month window. Patients completed measures in a timely manner (within 3minutes) without disruption to clinic flow, and they rated the process as easy, comfortable, and valuable. Depression scores varied across disease type. Patients rated lower global health relative to a previously assessed validation cohort. Depression and global health related significantly to certain medical outcomes. Fifteen percent of patients screened positive on the PHQ-9, of whom 50% confirmed attending behavioral health appointments within 6months of screening.A standardized depression and global health assessment protocol implemented across pediatric subspecialties was feasible and effective. Universal behavioral health screening for adolescents and young adults living with chronic disease is necessary to meet programmatic needs in pediatric subspecialty clinics. Efficacy and safety of lumacaftor and ivacaftor in patients aged 611 years with cystic fibrosis homozygous for F508del-CFTR: a randomised, placebo-controlled phase 3 trial Ratjen, F., Hug, C., Marigowda, G., Tian, S., Huang, X., Stanojevic, S., Milla, C. E., Robinson, P. D., Waltz, D., Davies, J. C. Lumacaftor and ivacaftor combination treatment showed efficacy in patients aged 12 years or older with cystic fibrosis homozygous for F508del-cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) in placebo-controlled studies and patients aged 6-11 years with cystic fibrosis homozygous for F508del-CFTR in an open-label study. We report efficacy and safety of lumacaftor and ivacaftor in patients with cystic fibrosis aged 6-11 years homozygous for F508del-CFTR.In this phase 3, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre study, patients were enrolled at 54 hospitals and medical centres in nine countries (the USA, Australia, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, Sweden, and the UK). Eligible patients weighed at least 15 kg, with a confirmed diagnosis of cystic fibrosis, percent predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) of 70 or more, and lung clearance index25 (LCI25) of 75 or more at screening (values less than these thresholds were permitted at day 1). All patients were tested for CFTR genotype at screening; eligible patients had to have the F508del-CFTR mutation on both alleles. Exclusion criteria included any comorbidity or laboratory abnormality that might confound the study results or pose additional risk to the patient. Patients were stratified by weight (<25 kg vs 25 kg) and ppFEV1 severity (<90 vs 90) determined at the screening visit, and randomly assigned 1:1 to treatment using an interactive web response system to receive 200 mg lumacaftor and 250 mg ivacaftor every 12 hours or placebo for 24 weeks. Patients, all site personnel including the investigator and the site monitor, and the study team were blinded, with the exception of site personnel needing this information in the event of medical emergency or pregnancy and patient safety and regulatory affairs personnel to meet serious adverse event reporting requirements. The primary endpoint was the mean absolute change in LCI25 from all on-treatment study visits up to and including week 24. All randomly assigned patients who were exposed to any amount of study drug, with treatment assignment as assigned were included in primary and other efficacy analyses. All patients who were exposed to any amount of study drug, with treatment assignment as treated, were included in the safety analysis. This study was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02514473.Between July 23, 2015, and Sept 20, 2016, a total of 206 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to receive lumacaftor and ivacaftor (n=104) or placebo (n=102). Two randomly assigned patients were never dosed with study drug (one in the placebo arm due to ineligibility arising from a streptococcal throat infection and one in the lumacaftor and ivacaftor arm due to withdrawal based on refusal to provide blood tests) and were not included in the analyses. 103 patients received at least one dose of lumacaftor and ivacaftor and 101 patients received at least one dose of placebo. For the primary endpoint, the average absolute change in LCI25 from baseline over all study visits up to and including the week 24 visit, least squares mean difference was -109 units (95% CI -143 to -075, p<00001) for lumacaftor and ivacaftor versus placebo. For the key secondary endpoint of sweat chloride concentration, the least squares mean difference versus placebo was -208 mmol/L (95% CI -234 to -182, average absolute change at day 15/week 4; p<00001). The least squares mean difference compared with placebo in absolute change in ppFEV1 from all on-treatment study visits until week 24 was 24 (95% CI 04-44, p=00182). 196 (96%) of 204 patients reported adverse events, most of which were mild (87 [43%]) or moderate (98 [48%]). Treatment was discontinued due to adverse events in three (3%) of 103 patients in the lumacaftor and ivacaftor group and two (2%) of 101 patients in the placebo group. Serious adverse events were reported in 13 (13%) of 103 patients in the lumacaftor and ivacaftor group and 11 (11%) of 101 patients in the placebo group.Treatment with lumacaftor and ivacaftor was associated with statistically significant improvements in lung function, as measured by LCI25 and ppFEV1, versus placebo in patients aged 6-11 years with cystic fibrosis homozygous for F508del-CFTR.

V., Milla, C. E., Axelrod, J. D. Motile airway cilia that propel contaminants out of the lung are oriented in a common direction by planar cell polarity (PCP) signaling, which localizes PCP protein complexes to opposite cell sides throughout the epithelium to orient cytoskeletal remodeling. In airway epithelia, PCP is determined in a 2-phase process. First, cell-cell communication via PCP complexes polarizes all cells with respect to the proximal-distal tissue axis. Second, during ciliogenesis, multiciliated cells (MCCs) undergo cytoskeletal remodeling to orient their cilia in the proximal direction. The second phase not only directs cilium polarization, but also consolidates polarization across the epithelium. Here, we demonstrate that in airway epithelia, PCP depends on MCC differentiation. PCP mutant epithelia have misaligned cilia, and also display defective barrier function and regeneration, indicating that PCP regulates multiple aspects of airway epithelial homeostasis. In humans, MCCs are often sparse in chronic inflammatory diseases, and these airways exhibit PCP dysfunction. The presence of insufficient MCCs impairs mucociliary clearance in part by disrupting PCP-driven polarization of the epithelium. Consistent with defective PCP, barrier function and regeneration are also disrupted. Pharmacological stimulation of MCC differentiation restores PCP and reverses these defects, suggesting its potential for broad therapeutic benefit in chronic inflammatory disease.

Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), a genetically heterogeneous, recessive disorder of motile cilia, is associated with distinct clinical features. Diagnostic tests, including ultrastructural analysis of cilia, nasal nitric oxide measurements, and molecular testing for mutations in PCD genes, have inherent limitations.To define a statistically valid combination of systematically defined clinical features that strongly associates with PCD in children and adolescents.Investigators at seven North American sites in the Genetic Disorders of Mucociliary Clearance Consortium prospectively and systematically assessed individuals (aged 0-18 yr) referred due to high suspicion for PCD. The investigators defined specific clinical questions for the clinical report form based on expert opinion. Diagnostic testing was performed using standardized protocols and included nasal nitric oxide measurement, ciliary biopsy for ultrastructural analysis of cilia, and molecular genetic testing for PCD-associated genes. Final diagnoses were assigned as ""definite PCD"" (hallmark ultrastructural defects and/or two mutations in a PCD-associated gene), ""probable/possible PCD"" (no ultrastructural defect or genetic diagnosis, but compatible clinical features and nasal nitric oxide level in PCD range), and ""other diagnosis or undefined."" Criteria were developed to define early childhood clinical features on the basis of responses to multiple specific queries. Each defined feature was tested by logistic regression. Sensitivity and specificity analyses were conducted to define the most robust set of clinical features associated with PCD.From 534 participants 18 years of age and younger, 205 were identified as having ""definite PCD"" (including 164 with two mutations in a PCD-associated gene), 187 were categorized as ""other diagnosis or undefined,"" and 142 were defined as having ""probable/possible PCD."" Participants with ""definite PCD"" were compared with the ""other diagnosis or undefined"" group. Four criteria-defined clinical features were statistically predictive of PCD: laterality defect; unexplained neonatal respiratory distress; early-onset, year-round nasal congestion; and early-onset, year-round wet cough (adjusted odds ratios of 7.7, 6.6, 3.4, and 3.1, respectively). The sensitivity and specificity based on the number of criteria-defined clinical features were four features, 0.21 and 0.99, respectively; three features, 0.50 and 0.96, respectively; and two features, 0.80 and 0.72, respectively.Systematically defined early clinical features could help identify children, including infants, likely to have PCD. Clinical trial registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT00323167). View details for The evolving spectrum of ciliopathies and respiratory disease Research on the biology of cilia, complex hair-like cellular organelles, has greatly informed our understanding of its crucial role in respiratory health and the pathogenesis of primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), including the genetics behind this condition. This review will summarize the current state of the art in the field highlighting its clinical implications.The genetics of PCD have exploded over the past few years as knowledge acquired from model systems has permitted the identification of genes that are key components of the ciliary apparatus and its function. In addition, clinical criteria and diagnostic tools have emerged that permit more clear identification of affected individuals.The rate of progress in the field continues to accelerate through international collaborative efforts and standardization of methods. Although the genetics behind PCD are complex, given the large number of genes associated with disease, as well as the large number of possible mutations even at the individual gene level, this knowledge is rapidly translating in improved diagnostics and hopefully in the near future in the identification of potential therapeutics. View details for RASA1 somatic mutation and variable expressivity in capillary malformation/arteriovenous malformation (CM/AVM) syndrome. Macmurdo, C. F., Wooderchak-Donahue, W., Bayrak-Toydemir, P., Le, J., Wallenstein, M. B., Milla, C., Teng, J. M., Bernstein, J. A., Stevenson, D. A. Germline mutations in RASA1 are associated with capillary malformation-arteriovenous malformation (CM-AVM) syndrome. CM-AVM syndrome is characterized by multi-focal capillary malformations and arteriovenous malformations. Lymphatic anomalies have been proposed as part of the phenotype. Intrafamilial variability has been reported, suggesting modifiers and somatic events. The objective of the study was to identify somatic RASA1 ""second hits"" from vascular malformations associated with CM-AVM syndrome, and describe phenotypic variability. Participants were examined and phenotyped. Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood on all participants. Whole-exome sequencing was performed on the proband. Using Sanger sequencing, RASA1 exon 8 was PCR-amplified to track the c.1248T>G, p.Tyr416X germline variant through the family. A skin biopsy of a capillary malformation from the proband's mother was also obtained, and next-generation sequencing was performed on DNA from the affected tissue. A familial germline heterozygous novel pathogenic RASA1 variant, c.1248T>G (p.Tyr416X), was identified in the proband and her mother. The proband had capillary malformations, chylothorax, lymphedema, and overgrowth, while her affected mother had only isolated capillary malformations. Sequence analysis of DNA extracted from a skin biopsy of a capillary malformation of the affected mother showed a second RASA1 somatic mutation (c.2245C>T, p.Arg749X). These results and the extreme variable expressivity support the hypothesis that somatic ""second hits"" are required for the development of vascular anomalies associated with CM-AVM syndrome. In addition, the phenotypes of the affected individuals further clarify that lymphatic manifestations are also part of the phenotypic spectrum of RASA1-related disorders. 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Diagnosis, monitoring, and treatment of primary ciliary dyskinesia: PCD foundation consensus recommendations based on state of the art review. Shapiro, A. J., Zariwala, M. A., Ferkol, T., Davis, S. D., Sagel, S. D., Dell, S. D., Rosenfeld, M., Olivier, K. N., Milla, C., Daniel, S. J., Kimple, A. J., Manion, M., Knowles, M. R., Leigh, M. W. Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is a genetically heterogeneous, rare lung disease resulting in chronic oto-sino-pulmonary disease in both children and adults. Many physicians incorrectly diagnose PCD or eliminate PCD from their differential diagnosis due to inexperience with diagnostic testing methods. Thus far, all therapies used for PCD are unproven through large clinical trials. This review article outlines consensus recommendations from PCD physicians in North America who have been engaged in a PCD centered research consortium for the last 10 years. These recommendations have been adopted by the governing board of the PCD Foundation to provide guidance for PCD clinical centers for diagnostic testing, monitoring, and appropriate short and long-term therapeutics in PCD patients. Assessing Differences in Mortality Rates and Risk Factors Between Hispanic and Non-Hispanic Patients With Cystic Fibrosis in California Buu, M. C., Sanders, L. M., Mayo, J. A., Milla, C. E., Wise, P. H. Over the past 30 years, therapeutic advances have extended the median life span of patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). Hispanic patients are a vulnerable subpopulation with high of prevalence of risk factors for worse health outcomes. The consequences of these differences on health outcomes have not been well described. The objective of this study is to characterize the difference in health outcomes, including mortality rate, between Hispanic and non-Hispanic patients with CF.Retrospective analysis of CF Foundation patient registry data of California residents with CF, diagnosed during or after 1991, from 1991-2010. Ethnicity was self-reported. Primary outcome was mortality. Hazard ratios were estimated from a Cox regression model, stratified by gender and adjusted for socioeconomic status, clinical risk factors, and year of diagnosis.Of 1719, 485 (28.2%) self-identified as Hispanic. Eighty-five deaths occurred, with an overall mortality rate of 4.9%. Unadjusted mortality rate was higher among Hispanic patients than non-Hispanic patients (9.1% vs. 3.3%, p<0.0001). Compared with non-Hispanic patients, Hispanic patients had lower survival rate 18 years post-diagnosis (75.9% vs. 91.5%, p<0.0001). Adjusted for socioeconomic status and clinical risk factors, Hispanic patients had increased rate of death compared to non-Hispanic patients (HR 2.81, 95% CI 1.70-4.63).Hispanic patients with CF have a higher mortality rate than non-Hispanic patients, even after adjusting for socioeconomic status and clinical severity. Further investigation of mechanism for the measured difference in lung function will help inform interventions and improve the health of all CF patients.

Kim, J., Farahmand, M., Dunn, C., Davies, Z., Frisbee, E., Milla, C., Wine, J. J. Beta-adrenergically-stimulated sweat rates determined by evaporimetry or by sweat bubble imaging are useful for measuring CFTR function because they provide a near-linear readout across almost the full range of CFTR function. They differentiate cystic fibrosis (CF) subjects from CF carriers and carriers from controls. However, evaporimetry, unlike bubble imaging, appears to be unable to detect improved levels of CFTR function in G551D subjects taking the CFTR modulator ivacaftor. Here, we quantify the sensitivity of evaporimetry and bubble imaging methods for assessing low levels of CFTR-dependent sweat rates. To establish sensitivity, we did dose-ranging studies using intradermally injected [cAMP]i-elevating cocktails. We reduced isoproterenol/aminophylline levels while maintaining a high level of atropine to block muscarinic elevation of [Ca2+]i. We stimulated the same sets of glands for both assays and recorded responses for 20 min. In response to a 3-log dilution of the stimulating cocktail (0.1%), bubble responses were detected in 12/12 tests (100%), with 49% 3% of glands secreting to produce an aggregate volume of 598 nl across the 12, 20-min tests. This was ~5% of the response to full cocktail. Evaporimetry detected responses in 3/12 (25%) tests with an aggregate secretion volume of 175 nl. After stimulation with a still more dilute cocktail (0.03%), bubble imaging detected 15 13% of glands secreting at a rate ~0.9% of the response to full cocktail, while zero responding was seen with evaporimetry. The bubble imaging method detected secretion down to aggregate rates of <0.2 nl/(cm2min), or ~1/30th of the average basal transepithelial water loss (TEWL) in the test subject of 4 g/m2hr or 6.7 nl/(cm2min). The increased sensitivity of bubble imaging may be required to detect small but physiologically important increases in secretion rates produced by CFTR modulators. Inhaled 2-Agonist Therapy Increases Functional Residual Capacity in Mechanically Ventilated Children With Respiratory Failure. Ramsi, M. A., Henry, M., Milla, C. E., Cornfield, D. N. To test the hypothesis that in mechanically ventilated children with respiratory failure, aerosolized albuterol modifies functional residual capacity, lung mechanics, oxygen consumption, and hemodynamics.Prospective, self-control clinical trial.A 24-bed PICU in a quaternary care, academic children's hospital.25 children (age range, 1-18 yr) undergoing mechanical ventilation to treat respiratory failure. Entry criteria included previously prescribed inhaled 2 agonists. Physiologic measurements were performed prior to and 20 minutes after administration of aerosolized albuterol solution. Functional residual capacity was determined via nitrogen washout.Functional residual capacity, oxygen consumption, respiratory mechanics, and vital signs were measured were measured prior to and 20 minutes after administration of aerosolized albuterol solution. Functional residual capacity was determined via nitrogen washout.At baseline, functional residual capacity is only 53% of predicted. After aerosolized albuterol, functional residual capacity increased by 18.3% (p = 0.008). Overall, aerosolized albuterol had no effect on airway resistance. However, in patients with an endotracheal tube size of more than or equal to 4.0mm, resistance decreased from 333 to 253 (p < 0.02). Inhaled albuterol administration had no effect on oxygen consumption despite an increase in heart rate from 1162 to 1282 beats/min (p < 0.0001).In pediatric patients with respiratory failure, aerosolized albuterol increases functional residual capacity without a decrease in resistance. In infants and children, aerosolized albuterol might favorably enhance pulmonary mechanics and thereby represent a novel strategy for lung recruitment in children with respiratory failure. Multiple-Breath Washout as a Lung Function Test in Cystic Fibrosis. A Cystic Fibrosis Foundation Workshop Report. Subbarao, P., Milla, C., Aurora, P., Davies, J. C., Davis, S. D., Hall, G. L., Heltshe, S., Latzin, P., Lindblad, A., Pittman, J. E., Robinson, P. D., Rosenfeld, M., Singer, F., Starner, T. D., Ratjen, F., Morgan, W. The lung clearance index (LCI) is a lung function parameter derived from the multiple-breath washout (MBW) test. Although first developed 60 years ago, the technique was not widely used for many years. Recent technological advances in equipment design have produced gains in popularity for this test among cystic fibrosis (CF) researchers and clinicians, particularly for testing preschool-aged children. LCI has been shown to be feasible and sensitive to early CF lung disease in patients of all ages from infancy to adulthood. A workshop was convened in January 2014 by the North American Cystic Fibrosis Foundation to determine the readiness of the LCI for use in multicenter clinical trials as well as clinical care. The workshop concluded that the MBW text is a valuable potential outcome measure for CF clinical trials in preschool-aged patients and in older patients with FEV1 in the normal range. However, gaps in knowledge about the choice of device, gas, and standardization across systems are key issues precluding its use as a clinical trial end point in infants. Based on the current evidence, there are insufficient data to support the use of LCI or MBW parameters in the routine clinical management of patients with CF. View details for The field of cystic fibrosis (CF) continues to evolve at a fast pace thanks to novel observations that have enabled deeper understanding of the disease pathophysiology. Parallel groundbreaking developments in innovative therapies permit, for the first time, distinct disease modification.This review highlights important discoveries in fluid homeostasis and mucus secretion in CF that further informs the pathophysiology of the airway disease that characterizes CF. In addition, current concepts and novel paradigms, such as 'theratypes' and 'CF transmembrane conductance regulator chaperome', which will be important for the continued development of disease modifying therapies, are reviewed.The rate of progress in the field continues to accelerate with new knowledge informing the development of innovative therapies. This has already led to tangible substantial and unprecedented clinical benefit for selected subsets of the CF patient population. In the years ahead, further knowledge acquisition may motivate the extension of these benefits to the larger population of people with CF. View details for Lung matrix and vascular remodeling in mechanically ventilated elastin haploinsufficient newborn mice. American journal of physiology. Lung cellular and molecular physiology Hilgendorff, A., Parai, K., Ertsey, R., Navarro, E., Jain, N., Carandang, F., Peterson, J., Mokres, L., Milla, C., Preuss, S., Alcazar, M. A., Khan, S., Masumi, J., Ferreira-Tojais, N., Mujahid, S., Starcher, B., Rabinovitch, M., Bland, R. Elastin plays a pivotal role in lung development. We therefore queried if elastin haploinsufficient newborn mice (Eln(+/-)) would exhibit abnormal lung structure and function related to modified extracellular matrix (ECM) composition. Because mechanical ventilation (MV) has been linked to dysregulated elastic fiber formation in the newborn lung, we also asked if elastin haploinsufficiency would accentuate lung growth arrest seen after prolonged MV of neonatal mice. We studied 5-day-old wild-type (Eln(+/+)) and Eln(+/-) littermates at baseline and after MV with air for 8-24 h. Lungs of unventilated Eln(+/-) mice contained 50% less elastin and 100% more collagen-1 and lysyl oxidase compared with Eln(+/+) pups. Eln(+/-) lungs contained fewer capillaries than Eln(+/+) lungs, without discernible differences in alveolar structure. In response to MV, lung tropoelastin and elastase activity increased in Eln(+/+) neonates, whereas tropoelastin decreased and elastase activity was unchanged in Eln(+/-) mice. Fibrillin-1 protein increased in lungs of both groups during MV, more in Eln(+/-) than in Eln(+/+) pups. In both groups, MV caused capillary loss, with larger and fewer alveoli compared with unventilated controls. Respiratory system elastance, which was less in unventilated Eln(+/-) compared with Eln(+/+) mice, was similar in both groups after MV. These results suggest that elastin haploinsufficiency adversely impacts pulmonary angiogenesis and that MV dysregulates elastic fiber integrity, with further loss of lung capillaries, lung growth arrest, and impaired respiratory function in both Eln(+/+) and Eln(+/-) mice. Paucity of lung capillaries in Eln(+/-) newborns might help explain subsequent development of pulmonary hypertension previously reported in adult Eln(+/-) mice. Clinical features of childhood primary ciliary dyskinesia by genotype and ultrastructural phenotype. American journal of respiratory and critical care medicine Davis, S. D., Ferkol, T. W., Rosenfeld, M., Lee, H., Dell, S. D., Sagel, S. D., Milla, C., Zariwala, M. A., Pittman, J. E., Shapiro, A. J., Carson, J. L., Krischer, J. P., Hazucha, M. J., Cooper, M. L., Knowles, M. R., Leigh, M. W. The relationship between clinical phenotype of childhood primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) and ultrastructural defects and genotype is poorly defined.To delineate clinical features of childhood PCD and their associations with ultrastructural defects and genotype.A total of 118 participants younger than 19 years old with PCD were evaluated prospectively at six centers in North America using standardized procedures for diagnostic testing, spirometry, chest computed tomography, respiratory cultures, and clinical phenotyping.Clinical features included neonatal respiratory distress (82%), chronic cough (99%), and chronic nasal congestion (97%). There were no differences in clinical features or respiratory pathogens in subjects with outer dynein arm (ODA) defects (ODA alone; n=54) and ODA plus inner dynein arm (IDA) defects (ODA+IDA; n=18) versus subjects with IDA and central apparatus defects with microtubular disorganization (IDA/CA/MTD; n=40). Median FEV1 was worse in the IDA/CA/MTD group (72% predicted) versus the combined ODA groups (92% predicted; P=0.003). Median body mass index was lower in the IDA/CA/MTD group (46th percentile) versus the ODA groups (70th percentile; P=0.003). For all 118 subjects, median number of lobes with bronchiectasis was three and alveolar consolidation was two. However, the 5- to 11-year-old IDA/CA/MTD group had more lobes of bronchiectasis (median, 5; P=0.0008) and consolidation (median, 3; P=0.0001) compared with the ODA groups (median, 3 and 2, respectively). Similar findings were observed when limited to participants with biallelic mutations.Lung disease was heterogeneous across all ultrastructural and genotype groups, but worse in those with IDA/CA/MTD ultrastructural defects, most of whom had biallelic mutations in CCDC39 or CCDC40. Assessing differences in mortality rates and risk factors between Hispanic and non-Hispanic patients with cystic fibrosis in California. Buu, M. C., Sanders, L. M., Mayo, J., Milla, C. E., Wise, P. H. Over the past 30 years, therapeutic advances have extended the median life span of patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). Hispanic patients are a vulnerable subpopulation with high of prevalence of risk factors for worse health outcomes. The consequences of these differences on health outcomes have not been well described. The objective of this study is to characterize the difference in health outcomes, including mortality rate, between Hispanic and non-Hispanic patients with CF.Retrospective analysis of CF Foundation patient registry data of California residents with CF, diagnosed during or after 1991, from 1991-2010. Ethnicity was self-reported. Primary outcome was mortality. Hazard ratios were estimated from a Cox regression model, stratified by gender and adjusted for socioeconomic status, clinical risk factors, and year of diagnosis.Of 1719, 485 (28.2%) self-identified as Hispanic. Eighty-five deaths occurred, with an overall mortality rate of 4.9%. Unadjusted mortality rate was higher among Hispanic patients than non-Hispanic patients (9.1% vs. 3.3%, p<0.0001). Compared with non-Hispanic patients, Hispanic patients had lower survival rate 18 years post-diagnosis (75.9% vs. 91.5%, p<0.0001). Adjusted for socioeconomic status and clinical risk factors, Hispanic patients had increased rate of death compared to non-Hispanic patients (HR 2.81, 95% CI 1.70-4.63).Hispanic patients with CF have a higher mortality rate than non-Hispanic patients, even after adjusting for socioeconomic status and clinical severity. Further investigation of mechanism for the measured difference in lung function will help inform interventions and improve the health of all CF patients. Prevalence Of Airway Microbial Flora In Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia Chang, H., Adjemian, J., Dell, S. M., Ferkol, T. W., Leigh, M. W., Milla, C. E., Rosenfeld, M., Sagel, S. D., Knowles, M. R., Olivier, K. N. View details for Pulmonary nocardiosis in an immunocompetent patient with cystic fibrosis. Schoen, L., Santoro, J. D., Milla, C., Bhargava, S. Nocardia spp. are bacteria of low virulence that cause infection classically in immunocompromised hosts with the lungs as the primary site of infection in the majority of cases. Patients with cystic fibrosis have pulmonary disease characterized by frequent and progressive bacterial infections. Reports of Nocardia spp. isolation in CF are rare in the literature and may represent colonization or active infection, the significance and optimal treatment of which are unknown. We report the second case to date of Nocardia transvalensis pulmonary infection in an immunocompetent patient with CF and the first in a child under the age of eighteen. Laterality defects other than situs inversus totalis in primary ciliary dyskinesia: insights into situs ambiguus and heterotaxy. Shapiro, A. J., Davis, S. D., Ferkol, T., Dell, S. D., Rosenfeld, M., Olivier, K. N., Sagel, S. D., Milla, C., Zariwala, M. A., Wolf, W., Carson, J. L., Hazucha, M. J., Burns, K., Robinson, B., Knowles, M. R., Leigh, M. W. Motile cilia dysfunction causes primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), situs inversus totalis (SI), and a spectrum of laterality defects, yet the prevalence of laterality defects other than SI in PCD has not been prospectively studied.In this prospective study, participants with suspected PCD were referred to our multisite consortium. We measured nasal nitric oxide (nNO) level, examined cilia with electron microscopy, and analyzed PCD-causing gene mutations. Situs was classified as (1) situs solitus (SS), (2) SI, or (3) situs ambiguus (SA), including heterotaxy. Participants with hallmark electron microscopic defects, biallelic gene mutations, or both were considered to have classic PCD.Of 767 participants (median age, 8.1 years, range, 0.1-58 years), classic PCD was defined in 305, including 143 (46.9%), 125 (41.0%), and 37 (12.1%) with SS, SI, and SA, respectively. A spectrum of laterality defects was identified with classic PCD, including 2.6% and 2.3% with SA plus complex or simple cardiac defects, respectively; 4.6% with SA but no cardiac defect; and 2.6% with an isolated possible laterality defect. Participants with SA and classic PCD had a higher prevalence of PCD-associated respiratory symptoms vs SA control participants (year-round wet cough, P < .001; year-round nasal congestion, P = .015; neonatal respiratory distress, P = .009; digital clubbing, P = .021) and lower nNO levels (median, 12 nL/min vs 252 nL/min; P < .001).At least 12.1% of patients with classic PCD have SA and laterality defects ranging from classic heterotaxy to subtle laterality defects. Specific clinical features of PCD and low nNO levels help to identify PCD in patients with laterality defects.ClinicalTrials.gov; No.: NCT00323167; URL: www.clinicaltrials.gov. Anti-PcrV Antibody in Cystic Fibrosis: A Novel Approach Targeting Pseudomonas aeruginosa Airway Infection Milla, C. E., Chmiel, J. F., Accurso, F. J., VanDevanter, D. R., Konstan, M. W., Yarranton, G., Geller, D. E. Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Pa) airway infection is associated with increased morbidity and mortality in cystic fibrosis (CF). The type III secretion system is one of the factors responsible for the increased virulence and pro-inflammatory effects of Pa. KB001 is a PEGylated, recombinant, anti-Pseudomonas-PcrV antibody Fab' fragment that blocks the function of Pa TTSS. We studied the safety, pharmacokinetic (PK), and pharmacodynamic properties of KB001 in CF subjects with chronic Pa infection. Twenty-seven eligible CF subjects (12 years of age, FEV1 40% of predicted, and sputum Pa density >10(5) CFU/g) received a single intravenous dose of KB001 (3mg/kg or 10mg/kg) or placebo. Safety, PK, Pa density, clinical outcomes, and inflammatory markers were assessed. KB001 had an acceptable safety profile and a mean serum half-life of 11.9 days. All subjects had Pa TTSS expression in sputum. There were no significant differences between KB001 and placebo for changes in Pa density, symptoms, or spirometry after a single dose. However, compared to baseline, at Day 28 there was a trend towards a dose-dependent reduction in sputum myeloperoxidase, IL-1, and IL-8, and there were significant overall differences in change in sputum neutrophil elastase and neutrophil counts favoring the KB001 10mg/kg group versus placebo (-0.61log(10) and -0.63log(10) , respectively; P<0.05). These results support targeting Pa TTSS with KB001 as a nonantibiotic strategy to reduce airway inflammation and damage in CF patients with chronic Pa infection. Repeat-dosing studies are necessary to evaluate the durability of the anti-inflammatory effects and how that may translate into clinical benefit. (NCT00638365).

A., Halbritter, J., Kohl, S., Kircher, M., Krischer, J., Bamshad, M. J., Nickerson, D. A., Hildebrandt, F., Shendure, J., Zariwala, M. A. Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is a genetically heterogeneous recessive disorder of motile cilia, but the genetic cause is not defined for all patients with PCD.To identify disease-causing mutations in novel genes, we performed exome sequencing, follow-up characterization, mutation scanning, and genotype-phenotype studies in patients with PCD.Whole-exome sequencing was performed using NimbleGen capture and Illumina HiSeq sequencing. Sanger-based sequencing was used for mutation scanning, validation, and segregation analysis.We performed exome sequencing on an affected sib-pair with normal ultrastructure in more than 85% of cilia. A homozygous splice-site mutation was detected in RSPH1 in both siblings; parents were carriers. Screening RSPH1 in 413 unrelated probands, including 325 with PCD and 88 with idiopathic bronchiectasis, revealed biallelic loss-of-function mutations in nine additional probands. Five affected siblings of probands in RSPH1 families harbored the familial mutations. The 16 individuals with RSPH1 mutations had some features of PCD; however, nasal nitric oxide levels were higher than in patients with PCD with other gene mutations (98.3 vs. 20.7 nl/min; P < 0.0003). Additionally, individuals with RSPH1 mutations had a lower prevalence (8 of 16) of neonatal respiratory distress, and later onset of daily wet cough than typical for PCD, and better lung function (FEV1), compared with 75 age- and sex-matched PCD cases (73.0 vs. 61.8, FEV1 % predicted; P = 0.043). Cilia from individuals with RSPH1 mutations had normal beat frequency (6.1 Hz at 25C), but an abnormal, circular beat pattern.The milder clinical disease and higher nasal nitric oxide in individuals with biallelic mutations in RSPH1 provides evidence of a unique genotype-phenotype relationship in PCD, and suggests that mutations in RSPH1 may be associated with residual ciliary function. A Little CFTR Goes a Long Way: CFTR-Dependent Sweat Secretion from G551D and R117H-5T Cystic Fibrosis Subjects Taking Ivacaftor Char, J. E., Wolfe, M. H., Cho, H., Park, I., Jeong, J. H., Frisbee, E., Dunn, C., Davies, Z., Milla, C., Moss, R. B., Thomas, E. A., Wine, J. J. To determine if oral dosing with the CFTR-potentiator ivacaftor (VX-770, Kalydeco) improves CFTR-dependent sweating in CF subjects carrying G551D or R117H-5T mutations, we optically measured sweat secretion from 32-143 individually identified glands in each of 8 CF subjects; 6 F508del/G551D, one G551D/R117H-5T, and one I507del/R117H-5T. Two subjects were tested only (-) ivacaftor, 3 only (+) ivacaftor and 3 (+/-) ivacaftor (1-5 tests per condition). The total number of gland measurements was 852 (-) ivacaftor and 906 (+) ivacaftor. A healthy control was tested 4 times (51 glands). For each gland we measured both CFTR-independent (M-sweat) and CFTR-dependent (C-sweat); C-sweat was stimulated with a -adrenergic cocktail that elevated [cAMP]i while blocking muscarinic receptors. Absent ivacaftor, almost all CF glands produced M-sweat on all tests, but only 1/593 glands produced C-sweat (10 tests, 5 subjects). By contrast, 6/6 subjects (113/342 glands) produced C-sweat in the (+) ivacaftor condition, but with large inter-subject differences; 3-74% of glands responded with C/M sweat ratios 0.04%-2.57% of the average WT ratio of 0.265. Sweat volume losses cause proportionally larger underestimates of CFTR function at lower sweat rates. The losses were reduced by measuring C/M ratios in 12 glands from each subject that had the highest M-sweat rates. Remaining losses were estimated from single channel data and used to correct the C/M ratios, giving estimates of CFTR function (+) ivacaftor = 1.6%-7.7% of the WT average. These estimates are in accord with single channel data and transcript analysis, and suggest that significant clinical benefit can be produced by low levels of CFTR function.

Standardizing nasal nitric oxide measurement as a test for primary ciliary dyskinesia. Leigh, M. W., Hazucha, M. J., Chawla, K. K., Baker, B. R., Shapiro, A. J., Brown, D. E., LaVange, L.

A., Knowles, M. R. Several studies suggest that nasal nitric oxide (nNO) measurement could be a test for primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), but the procedure and interpretation have not been standardized.To use a standard protocol for measuring nNO to establish a disease-specific cutoff value at one site, and then validate at six other sites.At the lead site, nNO was prospectively measured in individuals later confirmed to have PCD by ciliary ultrastructural defects (n = 143) or DNAH11 mutations (n = 6); and in 78 healthy and 146 disease control subjects, including individuals with asthma (n = 37), cystic fibrosis (n = 77), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (n = 32). A disease-specific cutoff value was determined, using generalized estimating equations (GEEs). Six other sites prospectively measured nNO in 155 consecutive individuals enrolled for evaluation for possible PCD. Measurements and MainAt the lead site, nNO values in PCD (mean standard deviation, 20.7 24.1 nl/min; range, 1.5-207.3 nl/min) only rarely overlapped with the nNO values of healthy control subjects (304.6 118.8; 125.5-867.0 nl/min), asthma (267.8 103.2; 125.0-589.7 nl/min), or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (223.7 87.1; 109.7-449.1 nl/min); however, there was overlap with cystic fibrosis (134.0 73.5; 15.6-386.1 nl/min). The disease-specific nNO cutoff value was defined at 77 nl/minute (sensitivity, 0.98; specificity, >0.999). At six other sites, this cutoff identified 70 of the 71 (98.6%) participants with confirmed PCD.Using a standardized protocol in multicenter studies, nNO measurement accurately identifies individuals with PCD, and supports its usefulness as a test to support the clinical diagnosis of PCD. View details for In Vivo Readout of CFTR Function: Ratiometric Measurement of CFTR-Dependent Secretion by Individual, Identifiable Human Sweat Glands Wine, J. J., Char, J. E., Chen, J., Cho, H., Dunn, C., Frisbee, E., Joo, N. S., Milla, C., Modlin, S. E., Park, I., Thomas, E. A., Tran, K. V., Verma, R., Wolfe, M. H. To assess CFTR function in vivo, we developed a bioassay that monitors and compares CFTR-dependent and CFTR-independent sweat secretion in parallel for multiple (50) individual, identified glands in each subject. Sweating was stimulated by intradermally injected agonists and quantified by optically measuring spherical sweat bubbles in an oil-layer that contained dispersed, water soluble dye particles that partitioned into the sweat bubbles, making them highly visible. CFTR-independent secretion (M-sweat) was stimulated with methacholine, which binds to muscarinic receptors and elevates cytosolic calcium. CFTR-dependent secretion (C-sweat) was stimulated with a -adrenergic cocktail that elevates cytosolic cAMP while blocking muscarinic receptors. A C-sweat/M-sweat ratio was determined on a gland-by-gland basis to compensate for differences unrelated to CFTR function, such as gland size. The average ratio provides an approximately linear readout of CFTR function: the heterozygote ratio is 0.5 the control ratio and for CF subjects the ratio is zero. During assay development, we measured C/M ratios in 6 healthy controls, 4 CF heterozygotes, 18 CF subjects and 4 subjects with 'CFTR-related' conditions. The assay discriminated all groups clearly. It also revealed consistent differences in the C/M ratio among subjects within groups. We hypothesize that these differences reflect, at least in part, levels of CFTR expression, which are known to vary widely. When C-sweat rates become very low the C/M ratio also tended to decrease; we hypothesize that this nonlinearity reflects ductal fluid absorption. We also discovered that M-sweating potentiates the subsequent C-sweat response. We then used potentiation as a surrogate for drugs that can increase CFTR-dependent secretion. This bioassay provides an additional method for assessing CFTR function in vivo, and is well suited for within-subject tests of systemic, CFTR-directed therapeutics.

Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is caused when defects of motile cilia lead to chronic airway infections, male infertility, and situs abnormalities. Multiple causative PCD mutations account for only 65% of cases, suggesting that many genes essential for cilia functionremain to be discovered. By using zebrafish morpholino knockdown of PCD candidate genes as an invivo screening platform, we identified c21orf59, ccdc65, and c15orf26 as critical for cilia motility. c21orf59 and c15orf26 knockdown in zebrafish and planaria blocked outer dynein arm assembly, and ccdc65 knockdown altered cilia beat pattern. Biochemical analysis in Chlamydomonas revealed that the C21orf59 ortholog FBB18 is a flagellar matrix protein that accumulates specifically when cilia motility is impaired. The Chlamydomonas ida6 mutant identifies CCDC65/FAP250 as an essential component of the nexin-dynein regulatory complex. Analysis of 295 individuals with PCD identified recessive truncating mutations of C21orf59 in four families and CCDC65 in two families. Similar to findings in zebrafish and planaria, mutations in C21orf59 caused loss of both outer and inner dynein arm components. Our results characterize two genes associated with PCD-causing mutations and elucidate two distinct mechanisms critical for motile cilia function: dynein arm assembly for C21orf59 and assembly of the nexin-dynein regulatory complex for CCDC65.

D., Elborn, J. S., Milla, C. E., Starner, T. D., Weiner, D. J., Lee, P., Ratjen, F. Ivacaftor has shown a clinical benefit in patients with cystic fibrosis who have the G551D-CFTR mutation and reduced lung function. Lung clearance index (LCI) using multiple-breath washout might be an alternative to and more sensitive method than forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) to assess treatment response in the growing number of children and young adults with cystic fibrosis who have normal spirometry. The aim of the study was to assess the treatment effects of ivacaftor on LCI in patients with cystic fibrosis, a G551D-CFTR mutation, and an FEV1 >90% predicted.This phase 2, multicentre, placebo-controlled, double-blind 22 crossover study of ivacaftor treatment was conducted in patients with cystic fibrosis, at least one G551D-CFTR allele, and an FEV1 >90% predicted. Patients also had to have an LCI higher than 74 at screening, age of 6 years or older, and a weight higher than or equal to 15 kg. Eligible patients were randomly allocated to receive one of two treatment sequences (placebo first followed by ivacaftor 150 mg twice daily [sequence 1] or ivacaftor 150 mg twice daily first followed by placebo [sequence 2]) of 28 days' treatment in each period, with a 28-day washout between the two treatment periods. Randomisation (ratio 1:1) was done with block sizes of 4, and all site personnel including the investigator, the study monitor, and the Vertex study team were masked to treatment assignment. The primary outcome measure was change from baseline in LCI. The study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01262352.Between February and November, 2011, 21 patients were enrolled, of which 11 were assigned to the sequence 1 group, and 10 to the sequence 2 group. 20 of these patients received treatment and 17 completed the trial (eight in sequence 1 group and 9 in sequence 2 group). Treatment with ivacaftor led to significant improvements compared with placebo in LCI (difference between groups in the average of mean changes from baseline at days 15 and 29 was -216 [95% CI -288 to -144]; p<00001). Adverse events experienced by study participants were similar between treatment groups; at least one adverse event was reported by 15 (79%) of 19 patients who received placebo and 13 (72%) of 18 patients who received ivacaftor. No deaths occurred during study period.In patients with cystic fibrosis aged 6 years or older who have at least one G551D-CFTR allele, ivacaftor led to improvements in LCI. LCI might be a more sensitive alternative to FEV1 in detecting response to intervention in these patients with mild lung disease.Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated.

F., Seastrand, M., Jhawar, S., Nickerson, B., Landon, C., Thompson, A., Nussbaum, E., Chin, T., Wojtczak, H. California uses a unique method to screen newborns for cystic fibrosis (CF) that includes gene scanning and DNA sequencing after only one California-40 cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) panel mutation has been identified in hypertrypsinogenemic specimens. Newborns found by sequencing to have one or more additional mutations or variants (including novel variants) in the CFTR gene are systematically followed, allowing for prospective assessment of the pathogenic potential of these variants. During the first 3 years of screening, 55 novel variants were identified. Six of these novel variants were discovered infive screen-negative participants and three were identified in multiple unrelated participants. Ten novelvariants (c.2554_2555insT, p.F1107L, c.-152G>C, p.L323P, p.L32M, c.2883_2886dupGTCA, c.2349_2350insT, p.K114del, c.-602A>T, and c.2822delT) were associated with a CF phenotype (42% of participants were diagnosed at 4 to 25 months of age), whereas 26 were associated with CFTR-related metabolic syndrome to date. Associations with the remaining novel variants were confounded by the presence of other diseases or other mutations in cis or by inadequate follow-up. These findings have implications for how CF newborn screening and follow-up is conducted and will help guide which genotypes should, and which should not, be considered screen positive for CF in California and elsewhere. View details for Polyvinylpyrrolidone microneedles enable delivery of intact proteins for diagnostic and therapeutic applications Sun, W., Araci, Z., Inayathullah, M., Manickam, S., Zhang, X., Bruce, M. A., Marinkovich, M. P., Lane, A. T., Milla, C., Rajadas, J., Butte, M. J. We present a method of fabricating microneedles from polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) that enables delivery of intact proteins (or peptides) to the dermal layers of the skin. PVP is known to self-assemble into branched hollow fibers in aqueous and alcoholic solutions; we utilized this property to develop dissolvable patches of microneedles. Proteins were dissolved in concentrated PVP solution in both alcohol and water, poured into polydimethylsiloxane templates shaped as microneedles and, upon evaporation of solvent, formed into concentric, fibrous, layered structures. This approach of making PVP microneedles overcomes problems in dosage, uniform delivery and stability of protein formulation as compared to protein-coated metallic microneedles or photopolymerized PVP microneedles. Here we characterize the PVP microneedles and measure the delivery of proteins into skin. We show that our method of fabrication preserves the protein conformation. These microneedles can serve as a broadly useful platform for delivering protein antigens and therapeutic proteins to the skin, for example for allergen skin testing or immunotherapy. The field of cystic fibrosis (CF) is changing dramatically as the scientific knowledge accumulated since the cloning of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene is being translated into effective therapies to correct the basic defect and provide better disease models and in-depth understanding of the basic mechanisms of disease.This review focuses on three main aspects of the recent advances in the field: understanding the lung disease pathophysiology (in particular, the early events that condition its onset), better definition of the complex microbiology of the CF airway, and therapeutic developments. Although the most recently developed therapies, whether approved or under study, do not constitute a definitive cure, the benefit to patients is already becoming clearly apparent.As the field continues to change rapidly and new therapies are being identified, CF has become a paradigm for the application of concepts such as translational medicine, genomic medicine, and personalized care, with measurable clinical benefit for the patients affected by this disease. Exome Sequencing Identifies Mutations in CCDC114 as a Cause of Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia Knowles, M. R., Leigh, M. W., Ostrowski, L. E., Huang, L., Carson, J. L., Hazucha, M. J., Yin, W., Berg, J.

Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is a genetically heterogeneous, autosomal-recessive disorder, characterized by oto-sino-pulmonary disease and situs abnormalities. PCD-causing mutations have been identified in 14 genes, but they collectively account for only ~60% of all PCD. To identify mutations that cause PCD, we performed exome sequencing on six unrelated probands with ciliary outer dynein arm (ODA) defects. Mutations in CCDC114, an ortholog of the Chlamydomonas reinhardtii motility gene DCC2, were identified in a family with two affected siblings. Sanger sequencing of 67 additional individuals with PCD with ODA defects from 58 families revealed CCDC114 mutations in 4 individuals in 3 families. All 6 individuals with CCDC114 mutations had characteristic oto-sino-pulmonary disease, but none had situs abnormalities. In the remaining 5 individuals with PCD who underwent exome sequencing, we identified mutations in two genes (DNAI2, DNAH5) known to cause PCD, including an Ashkenazi Jewish founder mutation in DNAI2. These results revealed that mutations in CCDC114 are a cause of ciliary dysmotility and PCD and further demonstrate the utility of exome sequencing to identify genetic causes in heterogeneous recessive disorders.

W., Borowitz, D., Mayer-Hamblett, N., Milla, C., Hendeles, L., Murray, S., Kronmal, R. A., Casey, S., Rose, L. M., Morgan, W. J., Ramsey, B. W. In 2006, the US FDA issued a 'Guidance for Industry' regarding submission of New Drug Applications for pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy (PERT) products. Five oral delayed-release PERT products have been approved by the FDA, and several others are under development and/ or evaluation for New Drug Application submission. We present in this paper recommendations of the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation's Cystic Fibrosis (CF) Therapeutics Development Network and Data Safety Monitoring Board regarding study design considerations for evaluating PERT products in patients with CF. Careful attention to study design and accuracy of the outcome measures has confirmed our understanding of the efficacy and safety of PERT for the treatment of exocrine pancreatic insufficiency of CF. In vivo readout of CFTR function: ratiometric measurement of CFTR-dependent secretion by individual, identifiable human sweat glands. Wine, J. J., Char, J. E., Chen, J., Cho, H., Dunn, C., Frisbee, E., Joo, N. S., Milla, C., Modlin, S. E., Park, I., Thomas, E. A., Tran, K. V., Verma, R., Wolfe, M. H. To assess CFTR function in vivo, we developed a bioassay that monitors and compares CFTR-dependent and CFTR-independent sweat secretion in parallel for multiple (50) individual, identified glands in each subject. Sweating was stimulated by intradermally injected agonists and quantified by optically measuring spherical sweat bubbles in an oil-layer that contained dispersed, water soluble dye particles that partitioned into the sweat bubbles, making them highly visible. CFTR-independent secretion (M-sweat) was stimulated with methacholine, which binds to muscarinic receptors and elevates cytosolic calcium. CFTR-dependent secretion (C-sweat) was stimulated with a -adrenergic cocktail that elevates cytosolic cAMP while blocking muscarinic receptors. A C-sweat/M-sweat ratio was determined on a gland-by-gland basis to compensate for differences unrelated to CFTR function, such as gland size. The average ratio provides an approximately linear readout of CFTR function: the heterozygote ratio is 0.5 the control ratio and for CF subjects the ratio is zero. During assay development, we measured C/M ratios in 6 healthy controls, 4 CF heterozygotes, 18 CF subjects and 4 subjects with 'CFTR-related' conditions. The assay discriminated all groups clearly. It also revealed consistent differences in the C/M ratio among subjects within groups. We hypothesize that these differences reflect, at least in part, levels of CFTR expression, which are known to vary widely. When C-sweat rates become very low the C/M ratio also tended to decrease; we hypothesize that this nonlinearity reflects ductal fluid absorption. We also discovered that M-sweating potentiates the subsequent C-sweat response. We then used potentiation as a surrogate for drugs that can increase CFTR-dependent secretion. This bioassay provides an additional method for assessing CFTR function in vivo, and is well suited for within-subject tests of systemic, CFTR-directed therapeutics. Quantitative Analysis of the Human Airway Microbial Ecology Reveals a Pervasive Signature for Cystic Fibrosis Blainey, P. C., Milla, C. E., Cornfield, D. N., Quake, S. R. Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an autosomal recessive disease caused by mutations in the gene encoding the CF transmembrane conductance regulator. Disruption of electrolyte homeostasis at mucosal surfaces leads to severe lung, pancreatic, intestinal, hepatic, and reproductive abnormalities. Loss of lung function as a result of chronic lung disease is the primary cause of death from CF. Using high-throughput sequencing to survey microbes in the sputum of 16 CF patients and 9 control individuals, we identified diverse microbial communities in the healthy samples, contravening conventional wisdom that healthy airways are not significantly colonized. Comparing these communities with those from the CF patients revealed significant differences in microbial ecology, including differential representation of uncultivated phylotypes. Despite patient-specific differences, our analysis revealed a focal microbial profile characteristic of CF. The profile differentiated case and control groups even when classically recognized CF pathogens were excluded. As a control, lung explant tissues were also processed from a group of patients with pulmonary disease. The findings in lung tissue corroborated the presence of taxa identified in the sputum samples. Comparing the sequencing results with clinical data indicated that diminished microbial diversity is associated with severity of pulmonary inflammation within our adult CF cohort.

M., Dunitz, J. M., Rimell, F. L., Milla, C. E. Functional endoscopic sinus surgery (FESS) provides symptomatic relief of sinus disease in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF), but it is unclear whether it has beneficial effects on lung disease in this population. This study assessed the effect of FESS on the respiratory status of adult patients with CF.Retrospective chart review.Tertiary medical center.Thirty-two adult patients with CF who underwent 45 operative cases.Clinical information retrieved for the 12-month periods preceding and following to determine the effect of FESS on the rate of decline in lung function, as well as intravenous antibiotic use and hospitalization for pulmonary exacerbation.The rate of decline in forced expiratory volume in 1 second and forced vital capacity was not significantly different in the 12 months before and after FESS. Functional endoscopic sinus surgery did not reduce days hospitalized or days on intravenous antibiotics for a respiratory exacerbation in the pre- vs postoperative period. Limiting the analysis to the 30 surgeries that were performed in patients with concomitant respiratory symptoms (ie, excluding the 15 surgeries performed for sinus symptoms alone) did not significantly alter the results. Covariates of importance in CF, including CFTR genotype, gender, or microbiology, did not affect the study results.These results did not demonstrate an effect of FESS on progression of lung disease in patients with CF, but further research is needed because low statistical power has made some of the negative findings inconclusive.

View details for Pulmonary Complications of Endocrine and Metabolic Disorders There are many important respiratory manifestations of endocrine and metabolic diseases in children. Acute and chronic pulmonary infections are the most common respiratory abnormalities in patients with diabetes mellitus, although cardiogenic and non-cardiogenic pulmonary oedema are also possible. Pseudohypoaldosteronism type 1 may be indistinguishable from cystic fibrosis (CF) unless serum aldosterone, plasma renin activity, and urinary electrolytes are measured and mutation analysis rules out CF. Hypo- and hyperthyroidism may alter lung function and affect the central respiratory drive. The thyroid hormone plays an essential role in lung development, surfactant synthesis, and lung defence. Complications of hypoparathyroidism are largely due to hypocalcaemia. Laryngospasm can lead to stridor and airway obstruction. Ovarian tumours, benign or malignant, may present with unilateral or bilateral pleural effusions. Metabolic storage disorders, primarily as a consequence of lysosomal dysfunction from enzymatic deficiencies, constitute a diverse group of rare conditions that can have profound effects on the respiratory system.

W., Wang, N., Merlo, C., Milla, C., Borowitz, D., Green, E. D., Mogayzel, P. J., Cutting, G. R. Patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) manifest a multisystem disease due to deleterious mutations in each gene encoding the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR). However, the role of dysfunctional CFTR is uncertain in individuals with mild forms of CF (ie, pancreatic sufficiency) and mutation in only one CFTR gene.Eleven pancreatic sufficient (PS) CF patients with only one CFTR mutation identified after mutation screening (three patients), mutation scanning (four patients) or DNA sequencing (four patients) were studied. Bi-directional sequencing of the coding region of CFTR was performed in patients who had mutation screening or scanning. If a second CFTR mutation was not identified, CFTR mRNA transcripts from nasal epithelial cells were analysed to determine if any PS-CF patients harboured a second CFTR mutation that altered RNA expression.Sequencing of the coding regions of CFTR identified a second deleterious mutation in five of the seven patients who previously had mutation screening or mutation scanning. Five of the remaining six patients with only one deleterious mutation identified in the coding region of one CFTR gene had a pathologic reduction in the amount of RNA transcribed from their other CFTR gene (8.4-16% of wild type).These results show that sequencing of the coding region of CFTR followed by analysis of CFTR transcription could be a useful diagnostic approach to confirm that patients with mild forms of CF harbour deleterious alterations in both CFTR genes.

D., Dell, S. D., Ferkol, T. W., Milla, C. E., Olivier, K. N., Rosenfeld, M., Baker, B., Leigh, M. W., Knowles, M. R., Sagel, S. D. Examination of ciliary ultrastructure remains the cornerstone diagnostic test for primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), a disease of abnormal ciliary structure and/or function. Obtaining a biopsy with sufficient interpretable cilia and producing quality transmission electron micrographs (TEM) is challenging. Methods for processing tissues for optimal preservation of axonemal structures are not standardized. This study describes our experience using a standard operating procedure (SOP) for collecting nasal scrape biopsies and processing TEMs in a centralized laboratory. We enrolled patients with suspected PCD at research sites of the Genetic Disorders of Mucociliary Clearance Consortium. Biopsies were performed according to a SOP whereby curettes were used to scrape the inferior surface of the inferior turbinate, with samples placed in fixative. Specimens were shipped to a central laboratory where TEMs were prepared and blindly reviewed. Four hundred forty-eight specimens were obtained from 107 young children (0-5 years), 189 older children (5-18 years), and 152 adults (> 18 years), and 88% were adequate for formal interpretation. The proportion of adequate specimens was higher in adults than in children. Fifty percent of the adequate TEMs showed normal ciliary ultrastructure, 39% showed hallmark ultrastructural changes of PCD, and 11% had indeterminate findings. Among specimens without clearly normal ultrastructure, 72% had defects of the outer and/or inner dynein arms (IDA), while 7% had central apparatus defects with or without IDA defects. In summary, nasal scrape biopsies can be performed in the outpatient setting and yield interpretable samples, when performed by individuals with adequate training and experience according to an SOP.

Gastroesophageal reflux (GER) in adults with cystic fibrosis (CF) is poorly characterized. This study examines the frequency and predictors of GER symptoms and their relationship to lung function in adults with CF.Cross-sectional study of adults at the University of Minnesota CF Clinic using two validated self report surveys: The Mayo GER questionnaire and the GERD Symptom Assessment Scale (GSAS).Of 274 invited patients, 201 (73%) completed the surveys and 173 performed spirometry at the same visit. Frequent symptoms (at least weekly) were reported by 24% of the patients and an additional 39% experienced occasional symptoms. Heartburn, acid regurgitation and dysphagia were the most common symptoms and 18% reported that GER symptoms worsened their respiratory condition. Females and patients reporting weight loss had more symptoms (mean GSAS symptom score 4.9 vs. 4.0, p=0.025 and 5.3 vs. 4.2, p=0.04) and more severe symptoms (mean GSAS distress score 5.6 vs. 3.8, p=0.005 and 6.8 vs. 4.0, p=0.01) compared to males and those who did not report weight loss. Patients on acid suppression (n=122, 61%) continued to report heartburn (n=80, 66%) and acid regurgitation (n=47, 23%). GER symptoms and severity of symptoms were not predictive of FEV(1) or FVC.GER symptoms were present in a majority of patients. Females and patients with weight loss require special attention to their GER symptoms. Many patients on acid suppression continued to be report symptoms.

Allogeneic transplantation remains the standard of care for patients with Hurler syndrome. As enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) has become available, controversy has emerged in regards to whether the use of enzyme in the peri-transplant period is appropriate. An analysis was performed on 74 patients with Hurler syndrome transplanted at the University of Minnesota between 1990 and 2003, before our use of ERT associated with transplant, with the intention of determining if patients at higher risk during the transplant can be identified based on evaluations and events before transplantation. Age, the presence of hydrocephalus, a history of cardiovascular issues or upper airway obstruction before transplant was not associated with significant differences in survival. In contrast, patients who had a history of lower airway disease, including reactive airway disease or bronchiolitis, or a history of pneumonia, had a significantly inferior outcome based on OS. The risk for serious respiratory complications was also assessed by evaluating the incidence of intubation. Overall, 31% of these patients were intubated. The risk of intubation was higher in older patients and in those with a history of lower airway disease. These findings have implications for the care of patients with high-risk features. View details for Comparison of Settings Used for High-Frequency Chest-Wall Compression in Cystic Fibrosis Kempainen, R. R., Milla, C., Dunitz, J., Savik, K., Hazelwood, A., Williams, C., Rubin, B. K., Billings, J. L. Cystic fibrosis (CF) patients commonly use a high-frequency chest-wall compression (HFCWC) device for airway clearance that generates oscillatory flow with a sine-wave configuration. Typical HFCWC settings combine a lower Vest inflation pressure setting (eg, 5 on the Vest's arbitrary 1-10 scale for the setting that controls the background pressure of the inflatable vest) with mid-range frequency (14-16 Hz) (lower-pressure/mid-frequency HFCWC).To determine whether HFCWC with higher pressure settings (6-10 on the Hill-Rom Vest's arbitrary 1-10 scale) combined with variable mid-frequencies (8, 9, and 10 Hz, plus 18, 19, and 20 Hz) (higher-pressure/variable-frequency HFCWC) results in greater sputum expectoration than lower-pressure/mid-frequency HFCWC.This was a controlled randomized crossover study. Sixteen clinically stable, adult CF patients participated. Patients performed airway clearance with HFCWC, once each with lower-pressure/mid-frequency HFCWC and higher-pressure/variable-frequency HFCWC, on separate occasions. All sputum produced during each session was collected. Patients completed pulmonary function tests before and after each session.Median sputum wet weight was greater with higher-pressure/variable-frequency HFCWC than with lower-pressure/mid-frequency HFCWC (6.4 g, range 0.49-22.0 g, versus 4.8 g, range 0.24-15.0 g, P = .02). Dry sputum weight differences did not reach statistical significance (higher-pressure/variable-frequency HFCWC 0.20 g, range 0.009-0.62 g, lower-pressure/mid-frequency HFCWC 0.12 g, range 0.0001-1.0 g, P = .23). Higher-pressure/variable-frequency HFCWC and lower-pressure/mid-frequency HFCWC resulted in similar increases in FEV(1) (70 mL vs 90 mL, P = .21) and forced vital capacity (80 mL vs 80 mL, P = .94). Post-therapy sputum viscoelastic properties did not differ. Patients perceived the 2 regimens as equally comfortable and effective (P = .35 and P = .35, respectively).In adult CF patients, single-session higher-pressure/variable-frequency HFCWC resulted in greater sputum expectoration by wet weight, but not other differences, compared to the commonly used lower-pressure/mid-frequency settings. Longer-term comparisons are needed in a larger, more diverse population to determine whether sustained use of the higher-pressure/variable-frequency settings results in clinically important differences in outcomes.

View details for SEMINARS IN RESPIRATORY AND CRITICAL CARE MEDICINE Cystic fibrosis (CF) is mostly recognized for its pulmonary morbidity, but the earliest manifestations of the disease are related to its gastrointestinal and nutritional derangements. Destruction of acinar pancreatic tissue, pancreatic ductular obstruction, and lack of enzymatic activity lead to malabsorption (particularly of fats), diarrhea, and failure to thrive. A minority of CF patients carrying milder CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) mutations have preserved pancreatic secretory activity and are free from significant malabsorption early in life. However, these patients are at risk for losing pancreatic function over time. Nutritional status plays an important role in the progression of the pulmonary disease in CF. Further, CF patients with better nutritional status have a survival advantage. Several factors contribute to impaired nutritional status in CF (e.g., pancreatic insufficiency, chronic malabsorption, recurrent sinopulmonary infections, chronic inflammation, increased energy expenditure, suboptimal intake). Progressive lung disease further increases calorie requirements by increasing the work of breathing. Treatment programs that place an emphasis on higher caloric intake and more aggressive nutritional management in CF patients report better outcomes. Basic tenets of nutritional repletion in CF include the use of pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy and following a high calorie, high protein, unrestricted diet. At the Stanford Cystic Fibrosis Center, nutritional status is assessed on an ongoing basis through anthropometric parameters and annual assessment of body composition, bone density, glucose tolerance, and various biochemical and micronutrient levels. Based on the anthropometric data obtained on routine clinical encounters, patients are categorized as to their nutritional risk. This proactive approach for the early identification of nutritional risk has become a major theme within the network of US CF centers. Aggressive nutritional support with adequate pancreatic replacement management should lead to both normal growth and lung function preservation. In addition, nutritional status has to be monitored closely during routine encounters to allow for early intervention once derangements are noted. This will include increasing calories in the early stages of lung disease and being vigilant of gastrointestinal symptomatology and complications. View details for Diabetes is a frequent complication seen in cystic fibrosis patients as they reach adulthood. Cystic fibrosis related diabetes (CFRD) is distinguished as a separate entity with features that include progressive loss of islet beta cell mass and insulin deficiency, as well as insulin resistance. Abnormalities in glucose tolerance may be detectable for many years prior to the development of overt diabetes. Therefore oral glucose tolerance testing is the preferred screening method for the identification of those patients at the highest risk for progression to diabetes. Progression to diabetes has been linked to poor outcomes in CF including loss of pulmonary function and increased mortality among females. Given the role that insulin deficiency plays in CFRD, insulin replacement therapy remains the only recommended intervention. In the absence of definitive supportive data, the use of oral antidiabetic agents is not considered standard therapy and needs further study. As with other forms of diabetes, CFRD patients also experience microvascular complications and should be periodically evaluated for manifestations. View details for Longitudinal Assessment of Lung Function From Infancy to Childhood in Patients With Cystic Fibrosis 20th Annual North American Cystic Fibrosis Conference Harrison, A. N., Regelmann, W. E., Zirbes, J. M., Milla, C. E. Infant pulmonary function testing (IPFT) has become an important clinical tool for the evaluation of lung function in infants with Cystic Fibrosis (CF); however, it is still unclear whether lung function in infancy is predictive of lung function later in life. We hypothesized that measures of airflow obstruction by IPFT would correlate strongly with lung function by conventional spirometry later in childhood. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODOLOGY: A retrospective analysis was performed of all CF infants studied with IPFT at the University of Minnesota Children's Hospital between September 1994 and March 2003. A total of 41 patients underwent IPFT and had valid spirometry results available at age 6 or later. IPFT values, such as I:E ratio, respiratory rate, tidal volume, and T(ptef)/T(e), were calculated from tidal breathing loops. Passive respiratory system mechanics, which included C(rs), R(rs), and tau(rs), were measured by the single breath end-inspiratory occlusion technique. Forced expiratory flows, including V(max)FRC, FVC, FEF(50), and FEF(75), were obtained by rapid thoracic compression and included a full vital capacity maneuver by the multiple inflation method. FRC measurements were calculated from data obtained via nitrogen washout in a subset of patients. In addition, information on age at diagnosis and results of oropharyngeal (OP) cultures at diagnosis and on subsequent visits was recorded. Standard spirometry was performed in all patients starting at age 5. The first valid flow-volume loop after age six was selected for analysis.Significant correlations were observed for the R(rs) and the FEF(50) by IPFT and the FEV(1) and the FEF(25-75) by standard spirometry (r > 0.4 and P < 0.03 for all correlations). These correlations were the strongest for those IPFT measurements obtained within 1 month of diagnosis and when R(rs) was expressed as sG(rs). The correlations observed were independent of the effects of age at diagnosis, gender and presence of Pseudomonas in oropharyngeal cultures at the time of diagnosis. Mean R(rs) declined from 0.050 to 0.027 cm H(2)O/ml/sec with treatment (P < 0.0001). There were no other significant associations found between other IPFT values measured and FEV(1) by spirometry.Measures of airflow obstruction on IPFT, specifically R(rs), sG(rs), and FEF(50), were strongly correlated with future lung function. IPFT measurement of R(rs) in addition to forced expiratory flows may help select patients at the greatest risk of early lung function decline. This study supports the use of R(rs) as a surrogate variable to help assess the impact of early therapies in CF.

View details for Associations of Psychosocial Factors With Health Outcomes Among Youth With Cystic Fibrosis The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship of strains, resources, feelings, and behaviors about treatment adherence reported by youth with cystic fibrosis (CF) with repeated clinic measures of their pulmonary function and nutritional status.Linear mixed models, stratified by gender, adjusting for age, were used to examine the effects of strains, resources, and adherence behaviors on repeated pulmonary function and nutritional status measures. All 10-21 years old with CF at the Minnesota Cystic Fibrosis Center were invited by mail to participate. Of these 177 youth, 51% (43 boys, 47 girls) returned surveys. Forced expiratory volume in 1 sec and predicted weight-for-height were extracted from participants' clinic records for the 18 months following receipt of the survey.Females showed significantly greater variability in repeated measures of pulmonary function and nutritional status compared to males. Parent-youth strains, physical strains, activity limitations, and cough suppression had significant effects on the 18-month mean of pulmonary function measures for females, but only physical strains had a significant effect for males.Compared to males, females experienced more strains and poorer treatment adherence, which may be factors associated with declines in pulmonary function observed among females with CF during the adolescent years. View details for Steroid-sparing effect of Omalizumab for allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis and cystic fibrosis Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) is a complication commonly encountered in patients with CF that produces significant respiratory morbidity. Chronic airway colonization with Aspergillus induces strong inflammatory responses with high IgE levels. Current guidelines for therapy include prolonged courses of systemic corticosteroids as the main therapeutic strategy. However this has the potential to induce significant detrimental side effects in children. Omalizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody directed against IgE that prevents its binding to high- and low-affinity receptors on effector cells. It has been shown to be effective in improving asthma control in patients with a strong allergic component. We present our long term experience with the use of Anti-IgE therapy in three children with CF and ABPA (mean age at start of therapy 14.2 years) who were steroid dependent. All three were already experiencing significant side effects from chronic steroid therapy. After the start of Omalizumab these children have experienced significant and sustained clinical improvements at the same time that they were discontinued from chronic systemic steroids. Our experience suggests that IgE blockade has tremendous potential as a strategy to control this disease in steroid dependent patients. View details for Gender differences in treatment adherence among youth with cystic fibrosis: Development of a new questionnaire Some prior studies have reported that girls with cystic fibrosis (CF) experience higher morbidity and mortality compared to boys. In this study, the authors compared boys' and girls' perceptions of disease-related strains and resources associated with living with CF, and the relationship of these factors to CF treatment feelings and behaviors.All 10-21 year olds with CF at the Minnesota Cystic Fibrosis Center were invited by mail to complete a new self-report survey (Living with CF Questionnaire--LCFQ). Of these 177 youth, 58% (49 boys and 54 girls) returned surveys.Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses revealed nine factors in the LCFQ. Partial support was found for hypothesized gender differences in these factors. Compared to boys, girls reported significantly more illness-related strains and worries, including emotional strains, greater treatment discouragement, lower self-esteem, and lower adherence to some aspects of the CF treatment regimen (coughing, eating high-fat foods, taking meds/pills).Living with CF appears to have a greater emotional impact on adolescent girls compared to boys. These gender differences may contribute to the poorer pulmonary function observed among girls with cystic fibrosis during the adolescent years. View details for Comparison of high-frequency chest wall oscillation with differing waveforms for airway clearance in cystic fibrosis Kempainen, R. R., Williams, C. B., Hazelwood, A., Rubin, B. K., Milla, C. E. High-frequency chest wall oscillation (HFCWO) is commonly used by cystic fibrosis (CF) patients for airway clearance. The primary objective of this study was to determine whether the use of a newer HFCWO device that generates oscillations with a triangular waveform results in greater sputum production than a commonly used device that generates oscillations with a sine waveform.This was a controlled, randomized, double-blind, crossover study. Fifteen clinically stable, adult CF patients participated. Patients performed airway clearance with each device once and at matched oscillation frequencies and pressures. All sputum produced during each session was collected. Patients completed pulmonary function tests before and after each session, and rated the comfort of the two devices.Mean sputum wet and dry weight produced during sine waveform and triangular waveform HFCWO sessions did not differ (p = 0.11 and p = 0.2, respectively). Mean changes in FEV(1) and FVC following HFCWO therapy were also comparable (p = 0.21 and p = 0.56, respectively). However, there was a significant reduction in air trapping by residual volume/total lung capacity ratio following triangular waveform HFCWO (p = 0.01). In addition, in vitro cough transportability was 10.6% greater following therapy with the triangular waveform device (p = 0.05). Patients perceived the two devices as equally comfortable (p = 0.8).Single-session sputum production is comparable with sine and triangular waveform HFCWO devices. Longer term comparisons are needed to determine whether sustained use of the devices results in clinically important differences in outcomes.

B., Heald, A. E. Previous studies have demonstrated that delivery of a recombinant adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector encoding the complete human cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator (CFTR) cDNA (tgAAVCF) to the nose, sinus, and lungs of subjects with cystic fibrosis (CF) was safe and well tolerated. In a small randomized, double-blind study of three doses of aerosolized tgAAVCF or placebo at 30-day intervals, encouraging but non-significant trends in pulmonary function and induced sputum interleukin 8 (IL-8) levels were seen at early time points. This larger study was conducted to verify these trends. One hundred and two subjects aged 12 years and older with mild-to-moderate cystic fibrosis (forced expiratory flow in 1 sec [FEV1]:60% predicted) were randomized to two aerosolized doses of 1x10(13)DNase-resistant particles of tgAAVCF (n=51) or matching placebo (n=51) administered 30 days apart. Although tgAAVCF was well tolerated, the study did not meet its primary efficacy end point of statistically significant improvement in FEV1 30 days after initial administration of tgAAVCF compared with placebo. There were no significant differences in spirometric lung function over time, induced sputum biologic markers, or days of antibiotic use in either treatment group. Thus repeated doses of aerosolized tgAAVCF were safe and well tolerated, but did not result in significant improvement in lung function over time. Because gene transfer is the simplest, most basic way to correct the underlying genetic defect that leads to disease in CF, further research is warranted to develop an effective gene transfer agent for the treatment of CF. View details for Among patients who have cystic fibrosis (CF), lung disease is a significant contributor to morbidity. From a clinical perspective, the link between malnutrition and lung dysfunction in CF is well established; however, the causal relationship remains unclear. Nutritional intervention for CF patients is predicated on the hypothesis that improved nutritional status improves pulmonary function. Which interventions will be of most value and have sustained gains is not completely clear from the available data. Taking into account that several factors condition the deficits that lead to malnutrition in CF, multidisciplinary interventions are likely to give the best results. More research is needed to better dissect the nutritional factors involved in lung disease and to identify effective and safe interventions through systematic controlled trials. View details for Microvascular complications in cystic fibrosis-related diabetes Schwarzenberg, S. J., Walk, D., Thomas, W., Milla, C., Olsen, T. W., Moran, A., Grover, T. The incidence of cystic fibrosis-related diabetes (CFRD) and the prevalence of diabetic microvascular complications were determined at the University of Minnesota.Cystic fibrosis patients have undergone annual oral glucose tolerance testing since 1990. Database review was performed to determine diabetes duration and the results of annual urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (U(alb:Cr)) screening and dilated retinal exams. In addition, 59 individuals underwent detailed retinopathy, nephropathy, neuropathy, and gastroenteropathy screening.During 1990-2005, 775 patients aged > or = 6 years were followed. CFRD was diagnosed by an oral glucose tolerance test or fasting hyperglycemia in 285 subjects (52% female), 64% of whom had fasting hyperglycemia. Most patients with CFRD without fasting hyperglycemia progressed to CFRD with fasting hyperglycemia over time. No subject with CFRD without fasting hyperglycemia had retinopathy or abnormal U(alb:Cr). In CFRD subjects with fasting hyperglycemia and diabetes for > or = 10 years, 14% had microalbuminuria and 16% had retinopathy. Autonomic neuropathy and gastrointestinal symptoms each were seen in 52% and somatic abnormalities in 22% of patients with or without fasting hyperglycemia.Diabetic microvascular complications occur in CFRD, although the prevalence of retinopathy and nephropathy appears to be less than that found in other forms of diabetes. Annual complication screening should occur after known diabetes duration of 5 years in patients with CFRD with fasting hyperglycemia. View details for Microbiology, safety, and pharmacokinetics of aztreonam lysinate for inhalation in patients with cystic fibrosis 18th Annual North American Cystic Fibrosis Conference Gibson, R.

Aztreonam lysinate for inhalation (AI) is a novel monobactam formulation being investigated for pulmonary Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF).Pre-clinical studies investigated the pre- and post-nebulization activity of AI and its activity in the presence of CF sputum. A double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-escalation trial determined pharmacokinetics and tolerability of AI in subjects with CF. Single daily escalating doses of AI 75, 150, or 225 mg, or placebo were self-administered using an eFlow Electronic Nebulizer. Sputum samples were collected up to 4 hr and blood samples up to 8 hr post-dose.AI activity against multiple CF isolates was retained after nebulization via eFlow, and activity was not inhibited by CF sputum. All 12 adult subjects and 11/12 adolescents tolerated all AI doses. One patient had an asymptomatic FEV1 decrease > 20% with the 150 mg dose. Median aztreonam sputum concentrations in adults 10 min after AI 75, 150, and 225 mg were 383, 879, and 985 microg/g, respectively. Median sputum concentrations in adolescents 10 min after AI 75, 150, and 225 mg were 324, 387, and 260 microg/g, respectively. Systemic exposure to AI was low. Plasma pharmacokinetics in adults receiving AI 75 mg were Cmax = 419 ng/g, Tmax = 0.99 hr, t1/2 = 2.1 hr. Aztreonam concentrations in sputum were at or above the MIC50 for at least 4 hr post-dose.These data support the continued development of AI for treatment of pulmonary infections in patients with CF. View details for Different frequencies should be prescribed for different high frequency chest compression machines. High frequency chest compression (HFCC) is used for treatment and prevention of the lung diseases characterized by impaired mucus clearance and/or cough, where patients are at risk for acquiring acute bronchitis or pneumonia. The HFCC treatment frequencies may be prescribed according to the manufacturers' generic guidelines or may be determined for each individual patient by a ""tuning"" method that measures, at the mouth, the air volume displacement and the associated airflows produced at each frequency. Tuning is performed while the patient is breathing normally during the HFCC system operation. After measurements for several breaths at one frequency have been collected, the program randomly selects and measures another frequency until the entire frequency range of the machine being tuned has been sampled. Frequencies range from 6 to 21 Hz for the sine waveform machines and from 6 to 25 Hz for the square waveform machines. Each group of flow signals is digitized and analyzed by the program. For each frequency, the HFCC flow velocities and volumes are computed and averaged. These average flows and volumes are rank ordered; the three frequencies with the highest flows and the three frequencies producing the largest volumes are selected for prescription. If the same frequency is selected as one of the three best frequencies for both flow and volume, the next ranked frequency is selected randomly for flow or volume. Significant differences exist between patients and HFCC machines. In a series of 100 cystic fibrosis (CF) patients with varying degrees of lung disease, we found that the best-ranked frequencies varied from patient to patient and did not correlate with patients' age, gender, height, weight, or spirometry parameters. With the sine waveform, the highest HFCC airflows were between 13 and 20 Hz 82% of the time and the largest HFCC volumes were between 6 and 10 Hz 83% of the time. With the square waveform, both the highest average HFCC flow rates and the largest volume average HFCC displacements were between 6 and 14 Hz. Nevertheless, in this sample of 100 consecutive tunings, every frequency from 6 and 20 Hz was a best frequency for at least one patient. These findings provide the basis for recommending a tuning protocol to be used for prescribing frequencies with the various HFCC machines, because they are different from one another. If a patient's tuning cannot be done, it may be useful to prescribe the best frequencies based on the waveform machine he or she uses. Inflammatory cytokines and the development of pulmonary complications after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation in patients with inherited metabolic storage disorders Kbarbanda, S., Panoskaltsis-Mortari, A., Haddad, I. Y., Blazar, B. R., Orchard, P. J., Cornfield, D. N., Grewal, S. S., Peters, C., Regelmann, W. E., Milla, C. E., Baker, K. S. Patients with inherited metabolic storage disorders are at a higher risk of developing pulmonary complications after hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). This single-center prospective study of 48 consecutive inherited metabolic storage disorder patients was performed to identify risk factors for the development of pulmonary complications after HCT. Before HCT, subjects underwent bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) for cell count, culture, nitrite levels, and analysis of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines. The overall incidence of pulmonary complications was 52% (infectious, 23%; noninfectious, 29%) over a period of 4 years. Diffuse alveolar hemorrhage was the most frequent noninfectious complication and occurred in 19% of patients, all of whom had a diagnosis of mucopolysaccharidosis (Hurler and Maroteaux-Lamy syndromes). Levels of interleukin (IL)-1beta, IL-6, IL-8, tumor necrosis factor alpha, macrophage inflammatory protein 1alpha, and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor in BAL fluid samples obtained before HCT were higher in patients with mucopolysaccharidoses than in patients with leukodystrophies. In addition, levels of IL-1beta, IL-6, IL-8, and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor were increased in the BAL fluid of patients who developed noninfectious pulmonary complications compared with those who did not develop pulmonary complications. It is interesting to note that most noninfectious pulmonary complications occurred in patients with mucopolysaccharidoses, especially diffuse alveolar hemorrhage, which occurred exclusively in patients with mucopolysaccharidoses. Higher levels of bronchial proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines may be predictive of the development of subsequent posttransplantation noninfectious complications in patients with mucopolysaccharidoses, especially those with Hurler syndrome. Larger studies will be required to further elucidate etiologic mechanisms and predictive factors. View details for View details for Diabetes is associated with dramatically decreased survival in female but not male subjects with cystic fibrosis Survival analysis was performed on a prospectively followed cohort of patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) to determine the impact of the development of diabetes on survival.Clinical data were retrieved for patients diagnosed with CF-related diabetes (CFRD) at the Minnesota CF Center in 1987-2002. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was performed to estimate median survival. Data were analyzed by Cox regression to evaluate the influence of clinical characteristics at the time of CFRD diagnosis on mortality.Clinical information was reviewed from 1,081 CF patients. A total of 123 patients with CFRD with fasting hyperglycemia were identified (58 males). Median survival was 49.5 years for male subjects without diabetes, 47.4 years for male subjects with diabetes, 47.0 years for female subjects without diabetes, and 30.7 years for female subjects with diabetes. Only female sex and forced expiratory volume in 1 s at the time of CFRD diagnosis were significant predictors of the subsequent risk of death (P < 0.001). This strong association was not confounded by CFTR genotype, BMI, steroid use, respiratory pathogens, HbA1c, or pregnancy.Female subjects with CFRD have a remarkably poorer prognosis compared with all male subjects with CF and female subjects with CF but without diabetes. The etiology of this sex difference is not clear. We speculate it might involve the interaction of female hormones and diabetes on promotion of a proinflammatory state or that androgens might protect male subjects from the catabolic effects of insulin deficiency. Alternatively, the appearance of frank diabetes in female subjects with CF may simply be a marker for some other biological difference that is not immediately apparent.

X., Milla, C., Panoskaltsis-Mortari, A., Blazar, B. R., Haddad, I. Y. The interaction of TNF-alpha with TNF receptor 1 (TNFR1) activates several signal transduction pathways that lead to apoptosis or NF-kappa B-dependent inflammation and immunity. We hypothesized that host TNFR1 expression contributes to noninfectious lung injury and inflammation commonly observed after bone marrow transplantation (BMT), termed idiopathic pneumonia syndrome (IPS). C57BL/6 TNFR1-sufficient (TNFR1(+/+)) and -deficient (TNFR1(-/-)) mice were total body irradiated with or without cyclophosphamide conditioning and were given bone marrow plus IPS-inducing donor spleen T cells from B10.BR wild-type mice. TNFR1(-/-) recipient mice exhibited improved early post-BMT survival associated with decreased permeability edema. In addition, the low lung compliance measured in anesthetized, ventilated TNFR1(+/+) mice on day 7 after BMT was restored to baseline during TNFR1 deficiency. Importantly, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) inflammatory cells from TNFR1(-/-) vs. TNFR1(+/+) mice generated less nitric oxide (.NO) and nitrating species and exhibited suppressed programmed cell death as assessed using flow cytometry. However, cellular infiltration and levels of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines were generally higher in BALF collected on day 7 after BMT from TNFR1(-/-) compared with TNFR1(+/+) recipient mice. Our results support a major role of host TNFR1 in regulation of .NO production and lung dysfunction after allogeneic BMT. View details for Safety and tolerability of denufosol tetrasodium inhalation solution, a novel P2Y(2) receptor agonist: Results of a phase 1/phase 2 multicenter study in mild to moderate cystic fibrosis Deterding, R., Retsch-Bogart, G., Milgram, L., Gibson, R., Daines, C., Zeitlin, P. L., Milla, C., Marshall, B., LaVange, L., Engels, J., Mathews, D., Gorden, J., Schaberg, A., Williams, J., Ramsey, B. Denufosol tetrasodium (INS37217) is a selective P2Y(2) agonist that stimulates ciliary beat frequency and Cl(-) secretion in normal and cystic fibrosis (CF) airway epithelia, and is being investigated as an inhaled treatment for CF. The Cl(-) secretory response is mediated via a non-CFTR pathway, and the driving force for Cl(-) secretion is enhanced by the effect of P2Y(2) activation to also inhibit epithelial Na(+) transport. Denufosol is metabolically more stable and better tolerated, and may enhance mucociliary clearance for a longer period of time than previously investigated P2Y(2) agonists. The goal of this phase 1/phase 2 study was to assess the safety and tolerability of single and repeated doses of aerosolized denufosol in subjects with CF. The study was a double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter comparison of ascending single doses of denufosol (10, 20, 40, and 60 mg, administered by inhalation via the Pari LC Star nebulizer) vs. placebo (normal saline), followed by a comparison of twice-daily administration of the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of denufosol or placebo for 5 days. Thirty-seven adult (18 years of age or older) and 24 pediatric (5-17 years of age) subjects with CF were evaluated in five cohorts. Subjects were randomized in a 3:1 ratio to receive either denufosol or placebo within each cohort. The percent of subjects experiencing adverse events was similar between the denufosol and placebo groups. The most common adverse event in subjects receiving denufosol was chest tightness in adult subjects (39%) and cough in pediatric subjects (56%). Three (7%) subjects receiving denufosol and one (7%) subject receiving placebo experienced a serious adverse event. Forced expiratory volume in 1 sec (FEV(1)) profiles following dosing were similar across treatment groups, with some acute, reversible decline seen in both groups, most notably in subjects with lower lung function at baseline. In conclusion, doses up to 60 mg of denufosol inhalation solution were well-tolerated in most subjects. Some intolerability was noted among subjects with lower baseline lung function. Based on the results of this phase 1/phase 2 study, the Therapeutics Development Network (TDN) of the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation (CFF) and Inspire Pharmaceuticals, Inc., recently completed a multicenter, 28-day, phase 2 safety and efficacy clinical trial of denufosol inhalation solution in CF subjects with mild lung disease.

F., Lund, F. E., Kannan, M. S. Cyclic ADP-ribose (cADPR) mobilizes calcium from intracellular stores and contributes to agonist-induced intracellular calcium elevation in airway smooth muscle (ASM). In this study we determined the functional role of CD38/cADPR signaling in the regulation of airway tone using CD38 deficient (cd38(-/-)) mice. The responsiveness to different doses of methacholine, as determined by changes in lung resistance and dynamic compliance, was significantly (P < or = 0.05) lower in cd38(-/-) mice compared with wild-type controls. To determine the mechanism responsible for the reduced responsiveness, we measured the intracellular calcium responses to contractile agonists in ASM cells. In ASM cells isolated from cd38(-/-) mice, the intracellular calcium responses to acetylcholine and endothelin-1 were significantly lower than in controls. Pretreatment of ASM cells with a cADPR antagonist resulted in attenuated intracellular calcium responses to endothelin-1 in cells isolated from wild-type mice, but not in those isolated from the cd38(-/-) mice. Very low cADPR levels and no detectable ADP-ribosyl cyclase activity were observed in lung tissue from cd38(-/-) mice, suggesting that CD38 is a critical source for cADPR synthesis. The results of the present study demonstrate that CD38/cADPR contributes to airway smooth muscle tone and responsiveness through its effects on agonist-induced elevation of intracellular calcium in ASM cells. View details for Natural history of pulmonary complications in children after bone marrow transplantation Eikenberry, M., Bartakova, H., DeFor, T., Haddad, I. Y., Ramsay, N. K., Blazar, B. R., Milla, C. E., Cornfield, D. N. We sought, in children after bone marrow transplantation (BMT), (1) to determine the natural history and incidence of pulmonary complications, (2) to evaluate the diagnostic yield of fiberoptic bronchoscopy and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL); and (3) to determine the effect of bronchoscopy with lavage on patient outcome. The study design was a retrospective review in a tertiary care university hospital of all children undergoing BMT over a 5-year period. Patients were separated into 2 study groups: children with and without pulmonary complications. Pulmonary complications were defined as new or persistent pulmonary infiltrates on chest radiograph or chest computed tomography scan, respiratory symptoms, hypoxemia, or hemoptysis. Three hundred sixty-three pediatric patients underwent BMT between January 1, 1995, and December 31, 1999. Ninety patients (25%) developed pulmonary complications and were evaluated with bronchoscopy and BAL. Patients with pulmonary complications had a higher mortality (65% versus 44%; P < .01). The median posttransplantation survival for children with pulmonary complications was 258 days, compared with 1572 days in patients without pulmonary complications. The incidence of pulmonary complications was increased in patients with allogeneic BMT (P < .01). The time-dependent onset of severe (grade III to IV) graft-versus-host disease increased the relative risk of pulmonary complications by 2.0 (95% confidence interval, 1.1-3.7; P = .02). Pulmonary complications increased the time-dependent relative risk of mortality by 3.5 (95% confidence interval, 2.5-4.8). The diagnostic yield of bronchoscopy with lavage was 46% in patients undergoing BAL. Diagnostic bronchoscopy did not enhance either 30- or 100-day survival. Pathogen identification did not decrease mortality (P = .45). Pulmonary complications occur in 25% of children undergoing BMT and increase the risk of death in the first year after BMT. Although pathogen identification does not confer a survival advantage, rigorous, prospective screening may allow for earlier identification of pathogens and thereby provide a benefit to this uniquely vulnerable population. View details for Insulin regulation of free fatty acid kinetics in adult cystic fibrosis patients with impaired glucose tolerance Cystic fibrosis (CF) patients are insulin-resistant with regards to suppression of hepatic glucose production and proteolysis, but the effect of insulin on adipose free fatty acid (FFA) release has not been studied. [9,10-(3)H]palmitate kinetics were measured in 11 stable adult CF patients with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) and 9 normal control subjects. Baseline plasma palmitate concentrations [CF = 99 +/- 13 (median 74, range 65 to 187); control = 88 +/- 9 (88, 46 to 138) micromol/L, P = .9] and palmitate flux [CF = 114 +/- 11 (100, 72 to 171); control = 105 +/- 12 (106, 54 to 182) micromol/min, P = 0.9] were not different between CF patients and controls. During a euglycemic clamp with infusion of insulin to physiologic postprandial levels, however, palmitate concentrations tended to be higher in CF patients: CF = 18 +/- 3 (13, 10 to 47), control = 12 +/- 1 (11, 8 to 18) micromol/L, P = 0.08. The higher palmitate concentrations during hyperinsulinemia appeared to be due to reduced suppression of adipose tissue palmitate release, because mean palmitate flux was 33% greater in CF subjects [32 +/- 5 (26, 17 to 66) micromol/min] than controls: [24 +/- 2 (23, 17 to 34) micromol/min], P = .20. There was considerably greater heterogeneity in insulin-induced suppression of plasma palmitate concentration and flux in CF patients compared to normal control subjects. In summary, a defect in insulin suppression of lipolysis was seen in clinically stable CF patients with IGT, similar to what has been described in CF for amino acid and glucose metabolism. This quantitative difference in lipolysis may account for inadequate insulin-induced suppression of hepatic glucose production in CF, and may be a metabolic adaptation to increased energy needs. View details for View details for Association of nutritional status and pulmonary function in children with cystic fibrosis Multiple studies have shown that nutritional status is a strong predictor of morbidity and mortality in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). Since CF is characterized by progressive lung disease, it could be argued that the underlying lung disease is what determines the nutritional failure seen in most patients. This review will summarize the data available from studies that have attempted to better define this relation and also present a review of the possible mechanisms involved taken from both observational and interventional studies.Longitudinal studies with sufficiently large follow-up times have demonstrated that young underweight patients have worst pulmonary function outcomes. More importantly, these studies concur in that the yearly change in growth parameters has a significant effect on the rate at which pulmonary function develops. Although the mechanisms behind this important association are yet unclear, there is some suggestion from interventional studies that the accrual of lean body mass is the factor that is involved in the preservation of lung function.Nutritional status strongly influences pulmonary health among CF patients. Therefore, aggressive nutritional support aiming at achieving normal growth patterns should lead to adequate development of lung function and maintenance of pulmonary health. However, more research is required with long-term longitudinal studies to better identify the most critical nutritional characteristics influencing this process as well as the most effective nutritional interventions. View details for Myeloperoxidase deficiency enhances inflammation after allogeneic marrow transplantation AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSIOLOGY-LUNG CELLULAR AND MOLECULAR PHYSIOLOGY Milla, C., Yang, S. X., Cornfield, D. N., Brennan, M. L., Hazen, S. L., Panoskaltsis-Mortari, A., Blazar, B. R., Haddad, I. Y. Myeloperoxidase (MPO)-derived oxidants participate in the respiratory antimicrobial defense system but are also implicated in oxidant-mediated acute lung injury. We hypothesized that MPO contributes to lung injury commonly observed after bone marrow transplantation (BMT). MPO-sufficient (MPO+/+) and -deficient (MPO-/-) mice were given cyclophosphamide and lethally irradiated followed by infusion of inflammation-inducing donor spleen T cells at time of BMT. Despite suppressed generation of nitrative stress, MPO-/- recipient mice unexpectedly exhibited accelerated weight loss and increased markers of lung dysfunction compared with MPO+/+ mice. The increased lung injury during MPO deficiency was a result of donor T cell-dependent inflammatory responses because bronchoalveolar lavage fluids (BALF) from MPO-/- mice contained increased numbers of inflammatory cells and higher levels of the proinflammatory cytokine TNF-alpha and the monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 compared with wild-type mice. Enhanced inflammation in MPO-/- mice was associated with suppressed apoptosis of BALF inflammatory cells. The inflammatory process in MPO-/- recipients was also associated with enhanced necrosis of freshly isolated alveolar type II cells, critical for preventing capillary leak. We conclude that suppressed MPO-derived oxidative/nitrative stress is associated with enhanced lung inflammation and persistent alveolar epithelial injury. View details for Peroxidase activity within circulating neutrophils correlates with pulmonary phenotype in cystic fibrosis Garner, H. P., PHILLIPS, J. R., Herron, J. G., Severson, S. J., Milla, C. E., Regelmann, W. E. Excess neutrophils are present in the airways of patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). Myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity of acid extracts of sputum is directly correlated with airflow obstruction in CF patients. We hypothesized that the sputum MPO was derived from the MPO of neutrophils that entered the airways from the circulation. Active MPO without protease activity injures airways. If MPO activity from circulating neutrophils that emigrate into the airways of these patients causes increased airway epithelial permeability and mucus-gland secretion, then (1) those patients with greater MPO activity per circulating neutrophil would be more likely to produce sputum and (2) the MPO activity per circulating neutrophil would positively correlate with airflow obstruction. We determined the MPO activity for both circulating and sputum neutrophils. Spirometry and respiratory cultures were obtained simultaneously with blood and sputum samples. CF patients with more MPO activity within their circulating neutrophils were more likely to produce sputum ( P =.001, chi 2 test), and the MPO activity per circulating neutrophil was positively correlated with airflow obstruction as measured on the basis of the ratio of 1-second forced expiratory volume to forced vital capacity ( P <. 03, Kruskal-Wallace test). These associations were independent of age, sex, the results of respiratory-tract culture, or protease activity in the circulating neutrophils. MPO activity in circulating neutrophils from CF patients homozygotic for the deletion of phenylalanine at position 508 in the CF transmembrane regulator protein is directly related to the severity of these patients' pulmonary disease. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that circulating neutrophils deliver active MPO to the airway, producing airway injury and airflow obstruction in homozygotic delF508 CF patients.

S., Ji, G., Johnston, R., Lakser, O., Lee, J., Lund, F. E., Milla, C., Mitchell, R. W., Nakai, J., Rishniw, M., Walseth, T. F., White, T. A., Wilson, J., Xin, H., Woodruff, P. G. The study of isolated airway myocytes has provided important information relative to specific processes that regulate contraction, proliferation, and synthetic properties of airway smooth muscle (ASM). To place this information in physiological context, however, improved methods to examine airway biology in vivo are needed. Advances in genetic, biochemical, and optical methods provide unprecedented opportunities to improve our understanding of in vivo physiology and pathophysiology. This article describes 4 important methodologic advances in the study of ASM: (1) the development of transgenic mice that could be used to investigate ASM proliferation and phenotype switching during the development of hypersensitivity, and to investigate excitation-contraction coupling; (2) the use of CD38-deficient mice to confirm the role of CD38-dependent, cyclic adenosine diphosphate-ribose-mediated calcium release in airway responsiveness; (3) investigation of the role of actin filament length and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase activity in regulating the mechanical plasticity-elasticity balance in contracted ASM; and (d) the use of bronchial biopsies to study ASM structure and phenotype in respiratory science. High-frequency chest compression: effect of the third generation compression waveform. Milla, C. E., Hansen, L. G., Weber, A., Warwick, W. J. High-frequency chest compression (HFCC) therapy has become the prevailing form of airway clearance for patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) in the United States. The original square waveform was replaced in 1995 with a sine waveform without published evidence of an equality of effectiveness. The recent development of a triangle waveform for HFCC provided the opportunity to compare the functional and therapeutic effects of different waveforms. Clinical testing was done in patients at home with therapy times recorded with all sputum collected in preweighed sealable vials. The eight study patients with CF were regular users of a sine waveform device. They produced sputum consistently and were clinically stable. They used their optimum frequencies for therapy for each waveform and, for one week for each waveform, collected all sputum during their twice-daily timed HFCC therapies. After collection, these vials were reweighed, desiccated, and reweighed to calculate wet and dry weights of sputum per minute of therapy time. Frequency associated vest pressures transmitted to the mouth, and induced airflows at the mouth were measured in healthy volunteers. The pressure waveforms produced in the vest were, in shape, faithfully demonstrable at the mouth. In the healthy subject the transmission occurred in 2 ms and was attenuated to about 75% of the vest pressure for the triangle waveform and 60% for the sine waveform. All patients produced more sputum with the triangle waveform than with the sine waveform. The mean increase was 20%+ range of 4% to 41%. P value was <.001. Future studies of HFCC should investigate the other effects of the sine and triangle waveforms, as well as the neglected square waveform, on mucus clearance and determine the best frequencies for each waveform, disease, and patient. Repeated adeno-associated virus serotype 2 aerosol-mediated cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator gene transfer to the lungs of patients with cystic fibrosis - A multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial Moss, R. B., Rochman, D., Spencer, L. T., Aitken, M. L., Zeitlhi, P. L., Waltz, D., Milla, C., Brody, A. S., Clancy, J. P., Ramsey, B., Hamblett, N., Heald, A. E. The primary objective was to determine the safety and tolerability of repeated doses of aerosolized adeno-associated serotype 2 vector containing cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) complementary DNA (cDNA) [tgAAVCF], an adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector encoding the complete human CFTR cDNA. Secondary objectives included evaluation of pulmonary function assessed by spirometry, lung abnormalities by high-resolution CT (HRCT), airway cytokines, vector shedding, serum neutralizing antibody to AAV serotype 2 (AAV2), and gene transfer and expression in a subset of subjects undergoing bronchoscopy with bronchial brushings.Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase II trial.Eight cystic fibrosis (CF) centers in the United States.CF patients with mild lung disease, defined as FEV(1) > or =60% predicted.Subjects were randomized to inhale three aerosolized doses of 1 x 10(13) deoxyribonuclease-resistant particles of tgAAVCF or matching placebo at 30-day intervals using the Pari LC Plus nebulizer (PARI; Richmond, VA). Measurements and results: Of 42 subjects randomized, 20 subjects received at least one dose of tgAAVCF and 17 subjects received placebo. No difference in the pattern of adverse events or laboratory abnormalities was noted between the two treatment groups. Improvements in induced-sputum interleukin-8 (p = 0.03) and FEV(1) (p = 0.04) were observed at day 14 and day 30, respectively, in the group receiving tgAAVCF when compared to those receiving placebo. No significant differences in HRCT scans were noted. Vector shedding in sputum was observed at low levels up to 90 days after the third dose of vector. All subjects receiving tgAAVCF exhibited an increase (by at least fourfold) in serum AAV2-neutralizing antibodies and detectable levels in BAL fluid from five of six treated subjects undergoing BAL. Gene transfer but not gene expression was detected in a subset of six tgAAVCF subjects who underwent bronchoscopy.Repeat doses of aerosolized tgAAVCF were safe and well tolerated, and resulted in encouraging trends in improvement in pulmonary function in patients with CF and mild lung disease.

Y., Milla, C., Yang, S. X., Panoskaltsis-Mortari, A., Hawgood, S., Lacey, D. L., Blazar, B. R. We reported an association between the ability of recombinant human keratinocyte growth factor (rHuKGF) to upregulate the expression of surfactant protein A (SP-A) and to downregulate pulmonary inflammation that occurs after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT). To establish a causal relationship, rHuKGF (5 mg/kg) was administered subcutaneously for three consecutive days before irradiation to SP-A-sufficient and -deficient [SP-A(+/+) and SP-A(-/-), respectively] mice given inflammation-inducing allogeneic spleen T cells at the time of BMT. In contrast with SP-A(+/+) mice, rHuKGF failed to suppress the high levels of TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma, and nitric oxide contained in bronchoalveolar lavage fluids collected on day 7 after BMT from SP-A(-/-) mice. Early post-BMT weight loss was attenuated by rHuKGF in both SP-A(+/+) and SP-A(-/-) recipients. In the absence of supportive respiratory care, however, SP-A deficiency eventually abolished the ability of rHuKGF to prevent weight loss and to improve survival monitored for 1 mo after allogeneic BMT. In further experiments, the addition of cyclophosphamide (which is known to cause severe injury to the alveolar epithelium in donor T cell-recipient mice) to the conditioning regimen prevented rHuKGF-induced upregulation of SP-A and suppression of lung inflammation in both SP-A(+/+) and SP-A(-/-) mice. We conclude that endogenous baseline SP-A levels and optimal upregulation of SP-A are required for the anti-inflammatory protective effects of KGF after allogeneic transplantation. View details for Longitudinal changes in growth parameters are correlated with changes in pulmonary function in children with cystic fibrosis Nutritional status is associated with pulmonary health and survival in children with cystic fibrosis (CF). This study evaluated the weight gain pattern of children with CF in relation to the longitudinal trends of their pulmonary function. Our hypothesis was that children who experience continuous weight gain at a given rate will have better average forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV(1)) and change in FEV(1) than children who have weight gain patterns that deviate from this rate, even when total weight gain seems adequate.Prospectively collected data were examined in 319 children, aged 6 to 8, who were routinely followed at the Minnesota Cystic Fibrosis Center. One to 67 measurements of weight (kg), height (cm), and FEV(1) (mL) were taken per child during this 2-year period. The data were analyzed by repeated measure regression analysis and by growth pattern analysis.At baseline, a 1-kg higher initial weight was associated with a 55-mL higher average FEV(1). During the follow-up period, a 1-kg gain in weight was associated with an increase in FEV(1) by 32 mL. Children who had a steady weight gain tended to experience greater increases in FEV(1) than children who experienced periodic losses in weight.We established that children who weigh more and who gain weight at an appropriate and uninterrupted rate have a better FEV(1) trajectory. Aggressive nutritional support to maintain growth in these children may therefore improve FEV(1), which can be taken as a surrogate for better lung health, and may ultimately lead to better survival. View details for Safety of inhaled nitric oxide after lung transplantation Cornfield, D. N., Milla, C. E., Haddad, I. Y., Barbato, J. E., Park, S. J. The present study tests the hypothesis that therapy with inhaled nitric oxide (iNO) at the time of lung transplantation in patients undergoing bilateral angle lung transplantation: (i) is safe; and (ii) does not increase either the duration of mechanical ventilation or the incidence of acute graft dysfunction.We conducted a prospective, non-randomized trial of iNO at 20 parts per million. The treatment group was comprised of 14 patients (10 females, 4 males) undergoing lung transplantation to address severe end-stage lung disease and pulmonary hypertension (mean pulmonary artery pressure > 30 mmHg). Clinical and histologic parameters were compared with 22 historical control subjects who were matched with the study population for age, diagnosis and disease severity (17 females, 5 males) and had undergone lung transplantation in the preceding 2-year time period. No significant differences were noted between the 2 study groups at baseline.No toxic effect of iNO treatment was evident. Although the incidence of acute graft dysfunction was the same in both groups, the occurrence of acute graft rejection in the initial 4 weeks after transplant was less frequent in the iNO group than in the control group (7% vs 32%, p = 0.05). Fifty percent of the treatment group, as compared with 22% of the control group, were discharged from the hospital within 2 weeks of the procedure (p = 0.05).Early initiation of iNO in lung transplant patients with pulmonary hypertension is safe and may decrease the incidence of acute graft rejection. We speculate that iNO may exert an immunomodulatory effect.

Jackson, A., Ternand, C., Brunzell, C., Kleinschmidt, T., Dew, D., Milla, C., Moran, A. The pediatric diabetes team at the University of Minnesota made a clinical decision to switch patients with type 1 diabetes with a hemoglobin A1c level greater than 8.0% to insulin glargine in an effort to improve glycemic control. Retrospective chart analysis was performed on 37 patients 6 months after the switch to insulin glargine therapy.After 6 months, the average hemoglobin A1c level in the entire cohort dropped from 10.1 +/- 2.0 to 8.9 +/- 1.6% (p = 0.001). Thirty patients responded with an average hemoglobin A1c drop of 1.7 +/- 1.5%, from 10.3 +/- 2.2 to 8.6 +/- 1.5% (p < 0.001). Seven patients did not respond to insulin glargine therapy, with an average hemoglobin A1c rise of 1.0 +/- 0.8% from a baseline of 9.5 +/- 1.0% to 10.4 +/- 1.4% (p = 0.01). The greatest response was seen in children with an A1c > 12.0%, who dropped their hemoglobin A1c by 3.5 +/- 1.9%. Compared with responders, non-responders had significantly less contact with the diabetes team in the form of clinic visits and telephone conversations both before and after initiation of glargine therapy. Sixty-two per cent of patients received insulin glargine at lunchtime, when injections could be supervised at school. Three episodes of severe hypoglycemia occurred after initiation of insulin glargine therapy.Insulin glargine substantially improved glycemic control in children and adolescents with poorly controlled type 1 diabetes. This response was most remarkable in those with a baseline hemoglobin A1c level > 12.0%, and may have been related to increased supervision of injections. Abnormal glucose tolerance in cystic fibrosis: Why should patients be screened? View details for Continuous propofol infusion in 142 critically ill children Cornfield, D. N., Tegtmeyer, K., Nelson, M. D., Milla, C. E., Sweeney, M. In recent years, continuous intravenous propofol infusion has been widely used in pediatric intensive care units. Several case reports have raised concerns about its safety. The objective of this study was to report our experience with continuous intravenous propofol in consecutive patients during an 18-month period.The study design was a retrospective review of a case series. Case was defined as a critically ill child who was treated with continuous intravenous propofol. The attending physician staff agreed to prescribe propofol via continuous intravenous infusion at a dose not to exceed 50 microg/kg/min. The protocol allowed for each patient to receive an additional intravenous bolus of propofol at a dose of 1 mg/kg no more than once per hour. The study entailed data collection from consecutive patients who were prescribed a continuous infusion of propofol in either the pediatric intensive care unit or bone marrow transplant unit.Data from 142 patients were analyzed. Each patient enrolled was adequately sedated. Administration of propofol via continuous intravenous infusion was not associated with metabolic acidosis or hemodynamic compromise. No patient in the study group was inadvertently extubated or had a central venous catheter accidentally discontinued.Propofol can be safely and effectively used to provide sedation to critically ill infants and children. We speculate that continuous infusion of propofol for extended periods of time should not exceed 67 microg/kg/min. Surfactant protein A decreases lung injury and mortality after murine marrow transplantation AMERICAN JOURNAL OF RESPIRATORY CELL AND MOLECULAR BIOLOGY Yang, S. X., Milla, C., Panoskaltsis-Mortari, A., Hawgood, S., Blazar, B. R., Haddad, I. Y. Surfactant protein A (SP-A), a collectin associated with surfactant lipids, can have immune modulatory effects. We hypothesized that exogenous and basal endogenous SP-A can function to suppress donor T-cell-dependent inflammation that occurs during the generation of idiopathic pneumonia syndrome after bone marrow transplantation (BMT). Wild-type and SP-A-deficient mice were conditioned with cyclophosphamide and lethal irradiation and then given allogeneic donor bone marrow plus inflammation-inducing spleen T cells. On Day 7 after BMT, bronchoalveolar lavage fluids from SP-A-deficient mice contained increased numbers of inflammatory cells and higher levels of proinflammatory mediators tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interferon-gamma, and nitric oxide than wild-type mice. Exaggerated inflammation in SP-A-deficient mice was associated with decreased dynamic lung compliance and increased donor T-cell-dependent mortality (P = 0.0007, n = 10). Nitrative stress in alveolar macrophages from SP-A(-/-)-conditioned BMT recipients was higher than for SP-A(+/+) mice. Similarly, mice treated with transtracheal human SP-A (50 micro g), instilled on Day 4 after BMT during a time of in vivo donor T cell activation, exhibited decreased inflammation and improved early survival compared with buffer-instilled mice. We concluded that basal endogenous SP-A and enhanced alveolar SP-A level modulate donor T-cell-dependent immune responses and prolong survival after allogeneic BMT.

Concentrations of cholesterol and triacylglycerol are commonly believed to be low in persons with cystic fibrosis and thus not of concern.The goal was to determine whether concentrations of cholesterol and triacylglycerol are related to glucose tolerance or nutritional status in patients with cystic fibrosis.Fasting lipid profiles were measured in 192 patients ( +/- SD age: 21 +/- 11 y) in conjunction with an oral-glucose-tolerance test.Cystic fibrosis patients in all age groups had higher triacylglycerol (1.51 +/- 0.95 mmol/L) and lower cholesterol (3.57 +/- 0.96 mmol/L) concentrations than US population means. Thirty patients (16%) had hypertriglyceridemia (3.22 +/- 1.22 mmol/L), and 8 patients (4%) had elevated cholesterol (6.05 +/- 1.32 mmol/L). In most cases, hypertriglyceridemia was isolated; only 3 subjects had elevation of both cholesterol and triacylglycerol. Lipid concentrations were not related to body mass index, weight, glucose tolerance, the areas under the curve for glucose or insulin, or glycated hemoglobin. Lipid concentrations also did not correlate with cystic fibrosis genotype, use of systemic steroids, blood pressure, liver enzymes, C-reactive protein, or pulmonary function.Isolated hypertriglyceridemia appears to be common in cystic fibrosis, whereas cholesterol concentrations are generally low. Hypertriglyceridemia may be related to chronic low-grade inflammation or to a dietary macronutrient imbalance with excessive simple carbohydrate absorption relative to fat absorption. Whether it is associated with a risk of cardiovascular disease in this population is uncertain, but the clinical significance of triacylglycerol elevation may become important as survival improves. View details for View details for Effects of oxidant stress on inflammation and survival of iNOS knockout mice after marrow transplantation AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSIOLOGY-LUNG CELLULAR AND MOLECULAR PHYSIOLOGY Yang, S. X., Porter, V. A., Cornfield, D. N., Milla, C., Panoskaltsis-Mortari, A., Blazar, B. R., Haddad, I. Y. In a model of idiopathic pneumonia syndrome after bone marrow transplantation (BMT), injection of allogeneic T cells induces nitric oxide (.NO), and the addition of cyclophosphamide (Cy) generates superoxide (O.) and a tissue-damaging nitrating oxidant. We hypothesized that.NO and O. balance are major determinants of post-BMT survival and inflammation. Inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) deletional mutant mice (-/-) given donor bone marrow and spleen T cells (BMS) exhibited improved survival compared with matched BMS controls. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluids obtained on day 7 post-BMT from iNOS(-/-) BMS mice contained less tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interferon-gamma, indicating that.NO stimulated the production of proinflammatory cytokines. However, despite suppressed inflammation and decreased nitrotyrosine staining, iNOS(-/-) mice given both donor T cells and Cy (BMS + Cy) died earlier than iNOS-sufficient BMS + Cy mice. Alveolar macrophages from iNOS(-/-) BMS + Cy mice did not produce.NO but persisted to generate strong oxidants as assessed by the oxidation of the intracellular fluorescent probe 2',7'-dichlorofluorescin. We concluded that.NO amplifies T cell-dependent inflammation and addition of Cy exacerbates.NO-dependent mortality. However, the lack of.NO during Cy-induced oxidant stress decreases survival of T cell-recipient mice, most likely by generation of.NO-independent toxic oxidants. View details for Insulin and glucose excursion following premeal insulin lispro or repaglinide in cystic fibrosis-related diabetes Insulin and glucose levels in response to premeal insulin lispro or repaglinide were evaluated in adult patients with cystic fibrosis-related diabetes (CFRD) without fasting hyperglycemia.Seven patients with CFRD were fed 1,000-kcal liquid mixed meals. Three study conditions were administered in random order on separate mornings: 1) no premeal diabetes medication, 2) insulin lispro, 0.1 unit/kg body wt premeal and 3) repaglinide 1 mg premeal. Glucose and insulin levels were measured every 20 min for 5 h.Fasting insulin and glucose levels were normal in patients with CFRD, but the peak glucose level was elevated. Insulin lispro significantly decreased the peak glucose level (P = 0.0004) and the 2-h (P = 0.001) and 5-h (P < 0.0001) glucose area under the curve (AUC). Repaglinide significantly decreased the 5-h glucose AUC (P = 0.03). Neither drug completely normalized cystic fibrosis glucose excursion at the doses used for this study. Insulin lispro significantly increased the 5-h insulin AUC (P = 0.04).In response to subcutaneous insulin lispro, postprandial glucose excursion was significantly diminished and insulin secretion was enhanced compared with a control meal in which no medication was given to patients with CFRD. The oral agent repaglinide resulted in lesser corrections in these parameters. Neither drug completely normalized glucose or insulin levels, suggesting that the doses chosen for this study were suboptimal. Placebo-controlled longitudinal studies comparing the effectiveness of repaglinide and insulin on glucose metabolic control as well as overall nutrition and body weight are needed to help determine optimal medical treatment of CFRD. View details for Protein metabolism in clinically stable adult cystic fibrosis patients with abnormal glucose tolerance Cystic fibrosis (CF) patients are reported to experience chronic protein catabolism. Since diabetes or impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) is common in CF, we hypothesized that their protein catabolic state is related to reduced insulin secretion or reduced insulin action. A total of 12 clinically stable adult CF patients with abnormal glucose tolerance and 12 age-, sex-, and lean body mass-matched healthy control subjects underwent protein turnover studies using L-[1-(13)C]leucine, L-[(15)N]phenylalanine, and L-[(2)H(4)]tyrosine, with and without exogenous insulin infusion. In the baseline fasting state, protein metabolism was entirely normal in CF patients, with no evidence of increased protein catabolism. In contrast, striking abnormalities were seen in CF patients when insulin was infused, since they did not experience normal suppression of the appearance rates of leucine, phenylalanine, or tyrosine (indexes of protein breakdown). At an insulin concentration of 45 +/- 2 microU/ml, normal control subjects suppressed the leucine appearance rate by 19 +/- 5% (P < 0.01), ketoisocaproate appearance rate by 10 +/- 3% (P = 0.03), tyrosine appearance rate by 11 +/- 2% (P = 0.03), and phenylalanine appearance rate by 6 +/- 3% (P = 0.07). Phenylalanine conversion to tyrosine decreased by 22 +/- 7% (P = 0.03). At a similar insulin concentration of 44 +/- 3 microU/ml, normal suppression of amino acid appearance did not occur in CF. The leucine appearance rate decreased by 4 +/- 2% (P = 0.65), ketoisocaproate appearance rate by 1 +/- 2% (P = 0.94), tyrosine appearance rate by 0 +/- 6% (P = 0.56), phenylalanine appearance rate by 5 +/- 6% (P = 0.34), and phenylalanine conversion to tyrosine by 5 +/- 6% (P = 0.95). Poor suppression of the amino acid appearance rate in CF was not related to previously documented glucose tolerance status (IGT or CF-related diabetes without fasting hyperglycemia), fasting insulin levels, the acute insulin response, insulin sensitivity, cytokine or counterregulatory hormone levels, resting energy expenditure, caloric intake, pulmonary function, or clinical status. Protein synthesis was not significantly affected by insulin infusion in either normal control subjects or CF patients. In conclusion, clinically stable adult CF patients have normal indexes of protein breakdown and synthesis in the fasting state. In contrast, elevation of plasma insulin to physiological postprandial levels fails to normally suppress indexes of protein breakdown. It is therefore likely that inability to spare protein during the postprandial state is the cause of protein catabolism in these patients. View details for Human surfactant protein A suppresses T cell-dependent inflammation and attenuates the manifestations of idiopathic pneumonia syndrome in mice AMERICAN JOURNAL OF RESPIRATORY CELL AND MOLECULAR BIOLOGY Yang, S. X., Milla, C., Panoskaltsis-Mortari, A., Ingbar, D. H., Blazar, B. R., Haddad, I. Y. We have previously shown an association between growth factor-induced upregulation of surfactant protein (SP)-A and suppression of alveolar inflammation in our murine model of donor T cell-dependent lung dysfunction after bone-marrow transplantation, referred to as idiopathic pneumonia syndrome (IPS). We hypothesized that SP-A protects the lung in vivo from IPS injury by downregulation of alveolar inflammation. Human SP-A (100 microg), purified by n-butanol extraction or preparative isoelectric focusing, was transtracheally instilled on Day 4 after BMT during a time of in vivo donor T-cell activation. At 48 h after treatment, immunohistochemical staining of lung sections showed that SP-A did not alter T cell- dependent cellular infiltration. However, macrophages from SP-A-instilled mice were less injured and spontaneously produced less tumor necrosis factor-alpha than did cells from buffer-instilled mice. Although exogenous SP-A did not significantly alter bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) high levels of total protein (TP), an inverse correlation between BALF SP-A and TP concentrations (r = -0.65; P = 0.02) was observed in SP-A-treated but not in buffer-instilled mice. The only difference between the effects of the two sources of SP-A was that butanol-extracted SP-A, but not isoelectric focusing-purified SP-A, suppressed the interferon-gamma/nitric oxide pathway. We conclude that SP-A downregulates T cell-dependent alveolar inflammation by multiple pathways leading to decreased IPS injury. View details for Trends in pulmonary function in patients with cystic fibrosis correlate with the degree of glucose intolerance at baseline 12th Annual North American Cystic Fibrosis Conference In patients with cystic fibrosis, CF-related diabetes mellitus (CFRD) has been associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Whether glucose intolerance is also associated with poor outcomes is unclear. To better define these relationships we prospectively followed a group of 152 patients with CF without diabetes for 4 yr. Patients were classified as having normal glucose tolerance (NGT), impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), or CFRD without fasting hyperglycemia (CFRD-No FH). FEV(1), FVC, and body mass index (BMI) were measured at baseline and quarterly. At baseline 45% of the patients had NGT, 38.8% had IGT, and 15.8% had CFRD-No FH. FEV(1), FVC, and BMI at baseline were comparable among these groups (all p > 0.1). After 4 yr an overall decline in FEV(1) and FVC occurred, with no change in BMI. The rates of decline for FEV(1) and FVC correlated with the glucose tolerance groups, with the highest rates of decline occurring among the CFRD-No FH group. In addition, patients in the lowest quartile for insulin production at baseline experienced the highest rates of pulmonary function decline over time, suggesting a relationship between insulin deficiency and clinical deterioration. We conclude that the degree of glucose intolerance is a strong determinant of future lung function decline in patients with CF. View details for Randomized, controlled trial of low-dose inhaled nitric oxide in the treatment of term and near-term infants with respiratory failure and pulmonary hypertension 66th Annual Meeting of the Society-for-Pediatric-Research Cornfield, D. N., Maynard, R. C., deRegnier, R. A., Guiang, S. F., Barbato, J. E., Milla, C. E. Recent reports indicate that inhaled nitric oxide (iNO) causes selective pulmonary vasodilation, increases arterial oxygen tension, and may decrease the use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) in infants with persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN). Despite these reports, the optimal dose and timing of iNO administration in PPHN remains unclear.To test the hypotheses that in PPHN 1) iNO at 2 parts per million (ppm) is effective at acutely increasing oxygenation as measured by oxygenation index (OI); 2) early use of 2 ppm of iNO is more effective than control (0 ppm) in preventing clinical deterioration and need for iNO at 20 ppm; and 3) for those infants who fail the initial treatment protocol (0 or 2 ppm) iNO at 20 ppm is effective at acutely decreasing OI.A randomized, controlled trial of iNO in 3 nurseries in a single metropolitan area. Thirty-eight children, average gestational age of 37.3 weeks and average age <1 day were enrolled. Thirty-five of 38 infants had echocardiographic evidence of pulmonary hypertension. On enrollment, median OI in the control group, iNO at 0 ppm, (n = 23) was 33.1, compared with 36.9 in the 2-ppm iNO group (n = 15).Initial treatment with iNO at 2 ppm for an average of 1 hour was not associated with a significant decrease in OI. Twenty of 23 (87%) control patients and 14 of 15 (92%) of the low-dose iNO group demonstrated clinical deterioration and were treated with iNO at 20 ppm. In the control group, treatment with iNO at 20 ppm decreased the median OI from 42.6 to 23.8, whereas in the 2-ppm iNO group with a change in iNO from 2 to 20 ppm, the median OI did not change (42.6 to 42.0). Five of 15 patients in the low-dose nitric oxide group required ECMO and 2 died, compared with 7 of 23 requiring ECMO and 5 deaths in the control group.In infants with PPHN, iNO 1): at 2 ppm does not acutely improve oxygenation or prevent clinical deterioration, but does attenuate the rate of clinical deterioration; and 2) at 20 ppm acutely improves oxygenation in infants initially treated with 0 ppm, but not in infants previously treated with iNO at 2 ppm. Initial treatment with a subtherapeutic dose of iNO may diminish the clinical response to 20 ppm of iNO and have adverse clinical sequelae.

B., Miller, R. B., Porter, V. A., Milla, C. E., Cornfield, D. N. Evidence suggests that nitric oxide (NO) causes perinatal pulmonary vasodilation through K+-channel activation. We hypothesized that this effect worked through cGMP-dependent kinase-mediated activation of Ca2+-activated K+ channel that requires release of intracellular Ca2+ from a ryanodine-sensitive store. We studied the effects of 1) K+-channel blockade with tetraethylammonium, 4-aminopyridine, a voltage-dependent K+-channel blocker, or glibenclamide, an ATP-sensitive K+-channel blocker; 2) cyclic nucleotide-sensitive kinase blockade with either KT-5823, a guanylate-sensitive kinase blocker, or H-89, an adenylate-sensitive kinase blocker; and 3) blockade of intracellular Ca2+ release with ryanodine on NO-induced pulmonary vasodilation in acutely prepared late-gestation fetal lambs. N-nitro-L-arginine, a competitive inhibitor of endothelium-derived NO synthase, was infused into the left pulmonary artery, and tracheotomy was placed. The animals were ventilated with 100% oxygen for 20 min, followed by ventilation with 100% oxygen and inhaled NO at 20 parts/million (ppm) for 20 min. This represents the control period. In separate protocols, the animals received an intrapulmonary infusion of the different blockers and were ventilated as above. Tetraethylammonium (n = 6 animals) and KT-5823 (n = 4 animals) attenuated the response, whereas ryanodine (n = 5 animals) blocked NO-induced perinatal pulmonary vasodilation. 4-Aminopyridine (n = 5 animals), glibenclamide (n = 5 animals), and H-89 (n = 4 animals) did not affect NO-induced pulmonary vasodilation. We conclude that NO causes perinatal pulmonary vasodilation through cGMP-dependent kinase-mediated activation of Ca2+-activated K+ channels and release of Ca2+ from ryanodine-sensitive stores.

Y., Panoskaltsis-Mortari, A., Ingbar, D. H., Yang, S. X., Milla, C. E., Blazar, B. R. In a murine bone-marrow transplant (BMT) model designed to determine risk factors for lung dysfunction in irradiated mice, we reported that cyclophosphamide (Cy)-induced injury and lethality depended on the infusion of donor spleen T cells. In the study reported here, we hypothesized that alveolar macrophage (AM)-derived reactive oxygen/nitrogen species are associated with lung dysfunction caused by allogeneic T cells, which stimulate nitric oxide (.NO) production, and by Cy, which stimulates superoxide production.NO reacts with superoxide to form peroxynitrite, a tissue-damaging oxidant. On Day 7 after allogeneic BMT, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) obtained from mice injected with T cells contained increased levels of nitrite, which was associated with increased lactate dehydrogenase and protein levels, both of which are indices of lung injury. The injury was most severe in mice receiving both T cells and Cy. Messenger RNA (mRNA) for inducible nitric oxide synthase was detected only in murine lungs injected with T cells +/- Cy. AMs obtained on Day 7 after BMT from mice receiving T cells +/- Cy spontaneously generated between 20 and 40 microM nitrite in culture, versus < 2 microM generated by macrophages obtained from mice undergoing BMT but not receiving T cells. The level of 3-nitrotyrosine, the stable byproduct of the reaction of peroxynitrite with tyrosine residues, was increased in the BALF proteins of mice injected with both T cells and Cy. We conclude that allogeneic T cells stimulate macrophage-derived.NO, and that the addition of Cy favors peroxynitrite formation. Peroxynitrite generation clarifies the dependence of Cy-induced lung injury and lethality on the presence of allogeneic T cells.

S., Prasad, B. A., Chugh, S. S., Rao, K. R., Cornfield, D. N., Milla, C. E., Singh, N., Singh, S., Selvamurthy, W. High-altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE) is characterized by pulmonary hypertension, increased pulmonary capillary permeability, and hypoxemia. Treatment is limited to descent to lower altitude and administration of oxygen.We studied the acute effects of inhaled nitric oxide (NO), 50% oxygen, and a mixture of NO plus 50% oxygen on hemodynamics and gas exchange in 14 patients with HAPE. Each gas mixture was given in random order for 30 minutes followed by 30 minutes washout with room air. All patients had severe HAPE as judged by Lake Louise score (6.4+/-0.7), PaO2 (35+/-3. 1 mm Hg), and alveolar to arterial oxygen tension difference (AaDO2) (26+/-3 mm Hg). NO had a selective effect on the pulmonary vasculature and did not alter systemic hemodynamics. Compared with room air, pulmonary vascular resistance fell 36% with NO (P<0.001), 23% with oxygen (P<0.001 versus air, P<0.05 versus NO alone), and 54% with NO plus 50% oxygen (P<0.001 versus air, P<0.005 versus oxygen and versus NO). NO alone improved PaO2 (+14%) and AaDO2 (-31%). Compared with 50% oxygen alone, NO plus 50% oxygen had a greater effect on AaDO2 (-18%) and PaO2 (+21%).Inhaled NO may have a therapeutic role in the management of HAPE. The combined use of inhaled NO and oxygen has additive effects on pulmonary hemodynamics and even greater effects on gas exchange. These findings indicate that oxygen and NO may act on separate but interactive mechanisms in the pulmonary vasculature. View details for Long term effects of aerosolised rhDNase on pulmonary disease progression in patients with cystic fibrosis After multiple studies, including clinical trials, suggested some mild clinical benefits from the use of rhDNase by patients with cystic fibrosis, a widespread acceptance of the drug has followed. However, long-term effects, specifically on lung disease progression, have not been demonstrated. Experience with the use of this drug in a single cystic fibrosis centre is presented and compared with the trends seen in the patient population of the centre before the introduction of the drug.Patients with cystic fibrosis routinely followed at the University of Minnesota Cystic Fibrosis Center and prescribed rhDNase for at least two years were included in this retrospective study. Data on spirometric parameters (FEV1 and FEV1/FVC), allometric index, and admissions to hospital were retrieved from the centre's database for the two years preceding the prescription of rhDNase and the two years that followed. Trends in pulmonary function and allometric index were analysed by mixed linear modelling, and hospital admission rates for both periods were calculated and compared.One hundred and ninety patients met the inclusion criteria for the study. In the two years preceding the prescription of rhDNase the trends noted were those of a mild decline in FEV1, a stable FEV1/FVC, and a mild improvement in allometric index. In the two years that followed the prescription of rhDNase a mild decline in all these parameters occurred which was a significant change from the previous period (all p < 0.009). There was no difference between females and males in the trends experienced after the start of rhDNase. By logistic regression analysis only the presence of malnutrition at the time of prescription was associated with a positive trend after the introduction of rhDNase. No significant change in the hospital admission rates occurred, with rates of 0.52 (0.16) and 0.56 (0.21) admissions/patient/year for the periods before and after the prescription of rhDNase, respectively.The introduction of rhDNase to the regimen of patients with cystic fibrosis cared for at this centre has not been followed by a positive trend in lung function and nutritional parameters. There are some differences between this patient population and those who participated in previous studies which may help to explain the contrasting findings of this study. However, it is also possible that factors other than mucus clearance need to be improved to achieve a favourable response in disease progression. Patients on this treatment should be followed closely and the benefit judged on an individual basis. More studies are needed to define better the specific indications and use of this form of treatment. View details for Risk of death in cystic fibrosis patients with severely compromised lung function 1994 International Conference of the American-Thoracic-Society Lung disease accounts for most of the mortality in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). Lung transplantation is an option for patients severely impaired, being recommended when life expectancy is estimated to be <2 years. Our objectives were to evaluate in our patient population the validity of currently accepted criteria for low life expectancy and to identify other potentially useful criteria.Data were retrieved from CF patients followed up at our center who reached and kept an FEV1 <30% predicted. A life table was created and stratified according to characteristics believed to be of importance. In addition, the rate of decline in percent predicted FEV1 was analyzed. These characteristics were evaluated as predictors of risk of death.The median survival was 3.9 years (95% confidence interval, 2.88 to 4.12 years), with no significant differences according to gender, nutritional status, presence of diabetes, or decade in which the patient was cared for. Only by age was there a significant difference in the median survival (p<0.05). By proportional hazards regression, only the rate of decline in percent predicted FEV1 was a significant predictor of the risk of death, with a borderline effect from younger age (p=0.06).In our patient population, a cutoff value of FEV1 of < 30% predicted is not a reliable predictor of high risk of death within 2 years. The yearly rate of decline of percent predicted FEV1 is a better parameter to identify those patients at high risk for death.

J., Milla, C. E., Wielinski, C. L., Regelmann, W. E. Because of conflicting data about hospital-based transmission of Burkholderia (Pseudomonas) cepacia, an important respiratory pathogen in cystic fibrosis (CF), we compared strains found in sputum, lung, or blood of 29 CF patients in our center from 1988 to 1994, studying the relationship between strain and hospital exposure of incident and that of prevalent cases. Exposure was defined as a concurrent hospital stay between a prevalent and an incident case. B. cepacia strains were determined by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) ribotyping and endonuclease subtyping. The 16S to 23S spacer regions of the bacterial ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes were amplified by PCR, and the product-size patterns used to type each B. cepacia isolate. Endonuclease digestion of the PCR products provided length polymorphisms for subtyping. There were 17 incident events during the period from 1988 to 1994, 16 of which involved a single ribotype. These 16 ribotypes could be divided into five subtypes by endonuclease mapping. Four patients grew B. cepacia from the blood, with the organism being the same strain as found in the lung in each case. Case controls were obtained to evaluate risk factors for B. cepacia acquisition. Concurrent hospitalization with a prevalent case significantly increased the risk of acquisition. There was no association between length of hospitalization, length of exposure, or FEV1 and the risk of B. cepacia acquisition. View details for Glycemic response to dietary supplements in cystic fibrosis is dependent on the carbohydrate content of the formula Milla, C., Doherty, L., Raatz, S., Schwarzenberg, S. J., Regelmann, W., Moran, A. Enteral formula feedings are frequently prescribed to cystic fibrosis (CF) patients to boost caloric intake. A substantial number of these patients are glucose intolerant and have severe respiratory compromise.To determine the effect of the carbohydrate content on glucose tolerance and respiratory function in glucose-intolerant CF patients with poor lung function, we examined the response to bolus feedings of five dietary supplements; a high-fat formula developed in our Clinical Research Center (CRC), Pulmocare, a high-carbohydrate formula developed in our CRC, Ensure Plus, and sugar-free Scandishake.Glucose excursion in response to the formulas with the lowest carbohydrate content was significantly less than that found in response to formulas with higher carbohydrate content. Insulin levels were also markedly lower in response to the low-carbohydrate high-fat formulas. Glucose excursion, expressed as a percent of the response to the CRC high-fat formula, was 111% +/- 12% for Pulmocare (p = NS), 202% +/- 34% for Ensure Plus (p < 01), 227% +/- 37% for CRC high carbohydrate (p = .001), and 357% +/- 33% for sugar-free Scandishake (p < .001). CO2 production, O2 consumption, minute ventilation, and respiratory rate increased modestly but not significantly in response to all formulas. No significant differences were found between the formulas in regards to these parameters. There were no subjective complaints of dyspnea during any of the five studies.The carbohydrate content of liquid dietary supplements appears to be an important determinant of hyperglycemia in glucose-intolerant adult CF patients. View details for Clinical significance of the recovery of Aspergillus species from the respiratory secretions of cystic fibrosis patients The frequent recovery of Aspergillus species from the respiratory tract secretions of cystic fibrosis (CF) patients is well recognized, and the presence of the fungus in the airways may trigger an inflammatory response that can manifest as the clinical entity known as allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA). In our CF patient population we studied the clinical characteristics of those who had Aspergillus sp. recovered from their respiratory tract secretions (n = 45) and compared them with the characteristics seen, during the same time period, in those patients who were culture negative for Aspergillus sp. (n = 167). There were no differences in peripheral blood eosinophil count (P = 0.9) or serum immunoglobulin E levels (P = 0.61). By logistic regression analysis there seemed to be an increased risk for more advanced lung disease, both radiographically (defined by a Brasfield chest radiograph score < 18) and by lung function parameters in those who were culture positive. However, after appropriate adjustment, almost all the increased risk was associated with age and gender, but not with the presence of Aspergillus sp. in respiratory secretions. Additionally, increasing age was strongly correlated with the risk of Aspergillus sp. being cultured from respiratory secretions (P = 0.0025). The presence of Aspergillus sp. in respiratory secretions was not associated with two indicators of atopy in our CF patient population. We do not have evidence that the culture of Aspergillus sp. from CF respiratory secretions is independently associated with an increased risk for more advanced lung disease.

146b566b-e689-451e-987f-715f3f1375c0,"Targeting Vitamin D Deficiency to Limit Exacerbations in Respiratory Diseases: Utopia or Strategy With Potential? Targeting Vitamin D Deficiency to Limit Exacerbations in Respiratory Diseases: Utopia or Strategy With Potential?   , , –() Patients with respiratory diseases such as cystic fibrosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or asthma often experience an acute worsening of respiratory symptoms, termed exacerbations. Although the course of exacerbations is disease specific, they are mostly triggered by a respiratory infection. Exacerbations often require hospitalization and are an important cause of mortality. Treatments of exacerbations aim to minimize the negative impact and to prevent subsequent events. Despite many existing therapy options, many patients do not benefit from therapy and suffer from recurrent events. Vitamin D deficiency is a worldwide problem and is extremely prevalent in these patients. Vitamin D, known for its calcemic effects, also has immunomodulatory and anti-infectious actions and can therefore be a possible agent to treat or prevent exacerbations. This review will focus on vitamin D as a potential candidate to treat or prevent exacerbations in CF, COPD, and asthma. Chronic respiratory diseases such as cystic fibrosis (CF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and asthma are generally characterized as inflammatory airway diseases. All three are heterogeneous in both progression and underlying pathology. However, they share a common feature namely acute exacerbations of the disease that have dramatic effects on the health and well-being of the patients. Exacerbations often lead to frequent and prolonged hospital stays, rapid disease worsening eventually leading to increased mortality []. Definitions of acute exacerbations of chronic respiratory diseases vary according to the respiratory disease and exist based upon clinical findings. For cystic fibrosis (CF), the EuroCFCare Working group has recommended to use modified Fuchs criteria to define exacerbations of CF which include the need for additional antibiotic therapy and a recent change of at least two of the following criteria: change in sputum volume or color, increased cough, increased fatigue, malaise or anorexia, decrease in lung function by 10% or more, and increased dyspnea [, ]. The Global Alliance of obstructive lung disease defines COPD exacerbations as an acute event characterized by worsening of the patient’s respiratory symptoms that is beyond normal day-to-day variations and leads to a change in medication []. The Global Initiative for Asthma defines exacerbations as an episode of progressive increase in shortness of breath, cough, wheezing, or chest tightness (or a combination), accompanied by decreases in lung function []. However, in all cases, the definition of exacerbation includes a subjective change in symptoms. Air pollution, some specific medication, smoking, chronic stress, and other triggers have been identified to cause exacerbations, but the most important trigger for exacerbations are respiratory infections caused by viruses or bacteria [, ]. Pathogens enter the host by airborne transmissions (e.g., droplets or aerosols), replicate in the respiratory tract, and cause clinical worsening of symptoms (exacerbations). Common viruses infecting the human respiratory tract include the rhinovirus, the influenza virus, the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), the parainfluenza virus or the adenovirus [] but there are many others as well. Not only viruses but also bacteria, including Streptococcus Pneumoniae, Moraxella Catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae and with more sever disease also S can be the cause of a respiratory infection []. The majority of exacerbations are treated with a combined regimen of antibiotics and systemic corticosteroids. Although these acute treatments are proven effective, many patients suffer from recurrent events despite optimal maintenance therapy. Therefore there is an urgent need for alternative strategies to treat or prevent exacerbations. The use of vitamin D as a strategy to reduce the frequency and severity of respiratory infections in respiratory diseases is an option that deserves further consideration. Vitamin D is a fat-soluble vitamin essential for life and known for its calcemic effects. Vitamin D refers to two compounds, vitamin D (ergocalciferol) and vitamin D (cholecalciferol). Vitamin D can be obtained from the diet or can be produced in the skin [] (see Figure ). It has been estimated that 80% of vitamin D supply comes from the production in the skin []. Endogenous vitamin D is produced in the skin from 7-dehydrocholesterol through a two-step process in which pre-D is first generated by UV light radiation from the sun, followed by a thermo-sensitive but non-catalytic step to form vitamin D []. Once vitamin D is produced in the skin or taken up from the diet, it enters the circulation and is bound to the vitamin D binding protein (DBP) for transport to the liver or other tissues in which it is hydroxylated by one or more 25-hydroxylases (CYP2R1, CYP27A1, CYP3A4) into 25 hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D). The latter is the major circulating form of vitamin D and its plasma levels, because of its long half-life (15 days), are routinely measured as a marker of vitamin D status. The conversion to 25(OH)D is achieved primarily in the liver but can also occur in a variety of other tissues such as breast, colon, skin, ovary, lung, etc []. This form is, however, biologically inactive and must be converted in the kidney by 1α-hydroxylase (CYP27B1) to 1,25(OH)D which is the active form of vitamin D. The active form has a much shorter half-life (4 hours) and can therefore not be used to measure vitamin D status []. The activity of CYP27B1 is critical for the production and maintenance of physiologic levels of circulating 1,25(OH)D and is therefore tightly regulated. Broad studies suggest that the expression of CYP27B1 may not be restricted to the kidney but it is synthesized in other cell types as well (lung, monocytes, macrophages) []. In the kidney, the degradation of 1,25(OH)D is accomplished via the action of CYP24A1. Besides conversion to 1,25(OH)D by CYP27B1, 25(OH)D can also be converted to 24,25(OH)D by hydroxylation by CYP24A1in the kidney, leading to secretion into the blood. CYP24A1 is reciprocally regulated by 1,25(OH)D itself and by parathyroid hormone (PTH) to sustain systemic levels of 1,25(OH)D [] (Figure ). The direct, well-controlled, and fast actions of vitamin D in the context of calcium homeostasis have been extensively described elsewhere []. 1,25(OH)D also exerts genomic actions by regulating gene transcription true binding to a nuclear Vitamin D receptor (VDR) and forming a heterodimer with the retinoid X receptor (RXR), regulating in this way 3% of the human genome [, , ]. As such, vitamin D regulates genes that are linked to diverse biological processes such as cell proliferation and differentiation, cell control, apoptosis, and angiogenesis []. Vitamin D exerts diverse and extensive effects on the immune system, due to the expression of VDR, vitamin D metabolic enzymes, and the expression of the enzyme CYP27B1 by most immune cells, including macrophages, neutrophils, T cells, B cells, and dendritic cells [, ]. Also airway epithelial cells as well as immune cells in the lung express VDR. Interestingly, the expression of CYP27B1 has been detected also in pulmonary immune cells resulting in local activation of 25(OH)D in the lung []. In contrast to renal 1α-hydroxylation of 25(OH)D, it has been suggested that CYP27B1 in the lung is not depending on a negative feedback control of 1,25(OH)D itself [] which might result in higher local levels of the active compound. It may indicate therefore that vitamin D can be used as an agent with immune regulatory actions in the lung and therefore be used to prevent or treat respiratory infections. Vitamin D deficiency is highly prevalent in common respiratory diseases such as cystic fibrosis (CF), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and asthma [, ]. A serum level of 25(OH)D < 25 nmol/l has been a traditional cutoff used for several decades to define vitamin D deficiency []. In most studies, vitamin D deficiency is defined as serum 25(OH)D levels < 20 ng/ml, insufficiency as 25(OH)D < 30 ng/ml, and sufficiency as 25(OH)D > 30 ng/ml. Based on these criteria, vitamin D deficiency is widespread across Europe [] and the world [] at prevalence rates that reach the criteria of a pandemic. Vitamin D status is largely determined by the level of skin synthesis and dietary intake. Vitamin D synthesized in the skin is dependent on UVB exposure and therefore influenced by latitude, skin pigmentation, skin coverage, time spent outdoors, and use of sunscreen. Dietary vitamin D can be obtained through naturally occurring vitamin D or D in food, dietary supplementation, or food fortification. A number of other factors such as adiposity, genetics, age, sex, and specific diseases also contribute to variation []. Traditional risk groups to develop vitamin D deficiency include newborns, pregnant women, older persons, and people in diseased states [, ]. Vitamin D deficiency was shown to be very prevalent in populations with chronic lung diseases. Fifty-nine per cent of patients with diffuse parenchymal lung diseases undergoing evaluation for lung transplant were found to have decreased vitamin D levels []. The respiratory tract is constantly exposed to the external environment and must therefore be well equipped to respond to and eliminate pathogens. The activation of pathogen recognition receptors (PRRs) on the respiratory epithelial cells is critical to limit viral or bacterial spread and to activate the immune system. Generally, PRR signaling upregulates cell-autonomous and non-cell-autonomous immune responses to infection. Cell-autonomous functions include the secretion of anti-microbial peptides by epithelial cells, programmed cell death, and other intracellular response pathways. Non-cell-autonomous processes are more linked to the initiation of the immune system by releasing pro-inflammatory mediators, cytokines, and chemokines [, ]. Vitamin D can interfere with several of these steps involved in the elimination of viruses and bacteria and in the activation of the immune system (Figure ). First, vitamin D is involved in the regulation of the PRRs which are believed to play a crucial role in the proper function of the innate immune system. PRRs are expressed by dendritic cells, macrophages, monocytes, neutrophils, and epithelial cells. After stimulation of PRRs, a cascade of reactions is initiated that directs host defense responses such as production of cytokines and anti-microbial peptides (AMPs) []. Vitamin D enhances the production of AMPs such as cathelicidin and β-defensin [, ], which serve as a first line of defense against invading pathogens. Secondly, stimulation of PRRs also leads to induction of antigen-presenting cells to initiate the adaptive immune system. Vitamin D also modulates the adaptive immune system first by attenuating the antigen-presenting capacity of Antigen-presenting cells, such as dendritic cells and macrophages []. Furthermore, vitamin D was shown to enhance the phagocytic and chemotactic capacity of macrophages [, ] and it acts to suppress T cell-driven inflammation and enhance the effects of Tregs by increased production of anti-inflammatory cytokines (Il-10, Il-4, TGFβ) []. Also B cells are affected by vitamin D, as shown by decreased immunoglobulin production, proliferation, and differentiation but increased apoptosis []. The importance of vitamin D deficiency in respiratory infections was emphasized in observational studies that consistently reported independent associations between low serum concentrations of 25(OH)D and susceptibility to acute respiratory infection []. Upper respiratory tract infections (URI), mostly caused by a rhinoviral infection, are believed to be one of the major causes of exacerbations. Serum levels of 25(OH)D were shown to be inversely correlated with upper respiratory tract infections []. Also genetic studies confirm that polymorphism in the VDR independently associates with susceptibility to URI. Finally, in vitro studies in epithelial cell lines [] and in human primary bronchial epithelial cells [, ] infected with rhinoviruses show that vitamin D is able to increase the antiviral defenses most likely via an upregulation of cathelicidin. From a mechanistic point of view, it is clear that vitamin D can be an important modulator of the host defense against respiratory infections by potentiating the clearance of pathogens while attenuating the associated inflammatory burst. As such it is important to explore vitamin D’s role in the prevention or treatment of exacerbations in respiratory diseases. Detailed data on CF, COPD, and asthma will be discussed in the next paragraphs. Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a common autosomal recessive disorder where a mutation in the CFTR gene results in a dysregulation of ion transport across epithelial surfaces leading to abnormally thickened mucus on the surface of the lungs. Because of the defective mucociliary clearance, bacteria cannot be eradicated and survive and proliferate leading to chronic bronchial infections. Acute pulmonary exacerbations are a very common event in CF patients and are usually triggered by respiratory viruses or bacteria. These repeated infections might lead to chronic infections and inflammation of the airways leading to progressive destruction of the lungs and respiratory failure []. Pulmonary exacerbations in CF have a profound impact on the morbidity and quality of life of individuals with CF []. Therefore efforts should be made to improve the management of these events. Patients with CF often experience nutritional deficits, including vitamin D due to poor nutritional uptake, secondary fat malabsorption, decreased sunlight exposure, and impairment in hepatic hydroxylation of vitamin D [, ]. Vitamin D deficiency is common in patients with CF and prevalence ranges from 40 to 90%, depending on age and definition of deficiency [, ]. Treatment guidelines for vitamin D in the CF population only focus on optimizing bone health [] and despite nutritional management recommendations, vitamin D deficiency can still be present even after supplementation [, ]. Associations between vitamin D status, lung function, and exacerbations are unclear. Indeed, some studies found positive associations with levels of vitamin D and lung function, as measured by FEV1 [, ,,,,,] while others found no relationship [,,,]. When we focus on the relationship between serum 25(OH)D levels and exacerbations in CF, most studies reported that deficient vitamin D levels (25(OH)D < 20 ng/ml) are associated with more exacerbations [, , ] and more bacterial colonizations []. Only one large multicenter intervention study in CF has been performed trying to prevent exacerbations in CF []. In this study, 25,000 IU of vitamin D were given to adults with CF at the time of a pulmonary exacerbations, resulting in significant increases in serum 25(OH)D concentrations remaining for the complete duration of the study. No improvement of the time to next exacerbation or the 1-year survival was observed and there were no differences in lung function recovery or concentration of plasma cathelicidin []. These results are in contrast with the pilot study performed by the same group showing that bolus vitamin D supplementation (25,000 IU), improved and maintained vitamin D status and improved clinical outcomes []. In vitro mechanistic studies in cell lines have shown that vitamin D can be converted to its active form when topically administered to airway cells [] while in a bronchial epithelial cell line with a CFTR mutation this ability was lost []. Although this loss was only observed in one particular cell line, it may suggest that the ability to convert vitamin D to its active form might be less available in CF airways. Other studies in CF respiratory cell lines showed anti-inflammatory and anti-bacterial effects after treatment with 1,25(OH)D in response to bacterial stimuli [, ]. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that vitamin D increased the mRNA expression of cathelicidin from primary bronchial epithelial cells collected from CF patients with no evidence for an antiviral response following a rhinoviral infection []. Even though mechanistic studies mostly were done , few studies in human suggest that the positive effects of vitamin D on exacerbations in CF are mostly attributed to its immunomodulatory properties as reflected by reduced serum IL-6, TNF levels [], and IL-8 levels [] or reduced serum Ig(G) levels []. A study on metabolomics on plasma of a supplemented CF population revealed that the beneficial effects of high-dose vitamin D in hospitalized CF adults with an acute pulmonary exacerbation may have occurred through a metabolic stabilization of amino acids, lipids, and other metabolites []. Based on one RCT with vitamin D supplementation in CF and the conflicting results in observational trials, it is difficult to conclude whether vitamin D can be used as an adjunctive therapy for CF exacerbations. Future investigations are needed to conclude if low-cost supplementation with vitamin D can be beneficial in preventing or treating exacerbations in the CF population. A difficult issue to address in any study in a CF population is the presence of many cofounders in this complex disease. Patients are diagnosed with the disease already at very young ages and it is known that the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency increases with age []. Some CF patients have poorer compliance to their medications, including vitamin D supplements and sicker patients may spend less time outdoors and may have less sun exposure or less appetite and therefore eat fewer vitamin D containing foods. These factors all contribute to the fact that studies that have addressed the relationship between vitamin D status and pulmonary function or exacerbations in CF show conflicting results. COPD is characterized by airflow limitation that is not fully reversible and is associated with an abnormal inflammatory response in the lungs to noxious particles or gases []. Smoking is the most important risk factor to develop COPD and accounts for 95% of COPD cases. COPD is complicated by exacerbations that are mostly triggered by respiratory viruses or bacteria. Studies have indicated that the quality of life and health status of patients are mainly determined by the presence and frequency of exacerbations []. Indeed, COPD exacerbations have important clinical and economic consequences, including lost work productivity, increased utilization of healthcare resources, temporary or permanent reductions in lung function and exercise capacity, hospitalization, and sometimes death []. Although the precise mechanisms of the onset of COPD exacerbations have not been fully clarified, the viral/bacterial infection-mediated immune response is thought to play a critical role. Vitamin D deficiency (defined as serum 25 hydroxyvitamin D < 20 ng/ml) has been shown to be highly prevalent in COPD patients compared to age-matched healthy controls and increased with disease severity []. COPD patients are at risk for vitamin D deficiency for a variety of reasons, including unbalanced diet, absence of outdoor activity, and therefore, sun exposure and reduced capacity for vitamin D synthesis due to premature aging of the skin and smoking, increased vitamin D catabolism by glucocorticoids and lower vitamin D storage capacity []. Additionally, the majority of COPD patients are elderly, known to be more vitamin D deficient than the younger population. Clear associations have been found between vitamin D status and COPD. Indeed, meta-analysis reported inverse associations between vitamin D levels and COPD risk and COPD severity (Zhu 2016). Also epidemiologic studies reported a strong relationship between vitamin D levels and pulmonary function (FEV1 and FVC) [,,]. In animal studies, vitamin D deficiency was shown to promote an early lung function decline after cigarette smoke [], suggesting a role for vitamin D in the development of COPD. The association between vitamin D serum levels and the frequency of exacerbations is, however, still unclear []. In the meta-analysis of Zhu et al [], no clear relationship was reported. In fact, two studies showed that vitamin D deficiency was related to more frequent exacerbations [, ], while other studies did not show such association [,,,,]. Interestingly, polymorphisms in the vitamin D binding protein gene might also be related to higher exacerbation frequencies (Ishii 2014), suggesting a relationship between vitamin D and the occurrence of exacerbations. Current strategy to treat exacerbations in COPD includes long-acting bronchodilators and long-term use of inhaled corticosteroids or macrolide antibiotics but they are all modestly effective and evidence on the preferred drug and optimal treatment duration are lacking []. An attractive alternative target for intervention studies in COPD is the vitamin D pathway. Few RCTs with vitamin D supplementation aimed to prevent COPD exacerbations have been performed. A supplementation of 100,000 IU monthly for 1 year, resulting in sufficient serum vitamin D levels, showed no effect of vitamin D supplementation on the number of exacerbations. However, in a subgroup analysis of patients with severe vitamin D deficiency at baseline (25 (OH)D levels < 10 ng/ml), a significant reduction in exacerbations was observed []. Similar results were observed by two other studies [, ] and by a recent meta-analysis, including all individual patient data, confirming that the protective effect of vitamin D supplementation against COPD exacerbations is restricted to those with the lowest baseline 25(OH)D levels []. Two large RCTs are still ongoing and might give us more insight into the role of vitamin D in exacerbations: Lung VITAL [] and PRECOVID []. The ongoing Lung VITAL study is taking advantage of a large clinical trial: VITAL, to conduct the first major evaluation of the influences of vitamin D supplementation on respiratory exacerbation in a sub-cohort enriched for active, symptomatic respiratory disease, over a period of 5 years. The PRECOVID study will be the first RCT examining the effects of vitamin D supplementation on exacerbation rate in vitamin D-deficient COPD patients. As shown in the meta-analysis of prior studies [], the anticipated effect in this targeted subgroup may be huge. Insights in the mechanisms of vitamin D to treat or prevent COPD exacerbations come from several mechanistic studies . In alveolar macrophages of smokers and non-smokers, it was shown that 1,25(OH)D inhibited the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNFα, MCP-1, and IL-6 in response to LPS/IFN-γ stimulation []. This was confirmed in a macrophage cell line exposed to cigarette smoke extract [] or to LPS [, ]. 1,25 (OH)D did not show any effect on the phagocytic capacity of these macrophages but it increased the levels of cathelicidin []. Furthermore, in venous blood samples, the rate of peripheral blood neutrophilic apoptosis in patients with acute exacerbations of COPD was slower than in healthy controls and this neutrophilic apoptosis is increased after administration of vitamin D through the p38MAPK pathway []. Taken together, even though in a controlled setting of cell culture, these data clearly show that vitamin D has potential to interfere with the immune reaction in response to a respiratory infection in COPD. Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disease of the airway, which is characterized by airway inflammation, airway hyper responsiveness (AHR), mucus hypersecretion, and airway remodeling. The latter is irreversible and includes airway wall thickening, increased airway muscle mass, and subepithelial fibrosis, which restricts the constant airflow. Respiratory tract infections are common precipitants of acute asthma exacerbations in adults, playing a role in about 45–80% of exacerbations. Asthma mortality arises primarily during episodes of exacerbations, mostly due to viral respiratory infections, but also to exposure to particulate matter []. Many studies have reported high prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in asthmatic children, ranging from 50–80% worldwide [, ]. This was confirmed in a systematic review showing that children with asthma have lower vitamin D levels than healthy age-matched children []. Inadequate dietary intake, low use of vitamin D supplements, skin pigmentation, obesity, and low sun exposure all increase the risk of vitamin D insufficiency. Whether vitamin D intake during pregnancy has an impact on the development of childhood asthma is unclear as one meta-analysis found no significant association between prenatal vitamin D status and risk of asthma. However, recently, it was suggested that lower maternal vitamin D intake during pregnancy is associated with increased risk of children wheezing and being diagnosed with asthma in the first 10 years [], indicating a role for vitamin D in the development of childhood asthma. Vitamin D deficiency has been linked to an overall poor outcome of lung function and symptoms in patients with asthma [,,,]. Additionally, it was shown that the response to standard corticosteroid therapy was reduced in vitamin D-deficient asthmatic patients []. Studies in asthma also suggest an association between vitamin D deficiency and exacerbations [, ]. More specifically, vitamin D deficiency is associated with an increased risk for exacerbations []. In a 4-year follow-up study, Brehm found that vitamin D insufficiency (25(OH)D < 30 ng/ml) at baseline was associated with increased risk of severe asthma exacerbations []. The magnitude of this association was the greatest in children who were vitamin D insufficient and did not receive corticosteroids []. By contrast, Boonpiyatad et al observed that vitamin D deficiency indeed was present in patients with asthma exacerbations but could not find a causal relationship []. Additionally, it was shown that children who were both vitamin D deficient and living near a major roadway were 5 times more likely to experience asthma exacerbations in comparison with children who were vitamin D sufficient and living in the same regions of high particulate matter []. This indicates that vitamin D deficiency represents an important factor in the development of exacerbations during asthma. Current treatment of asthma exacerbations consists in a stepwise approach with increasing doses of medications, primarily inhaled corticosteroids (ICS), often in conjunction with a second controller medication to achieve disease control []. For most asthma patients, particularly those with mild-to-moderate disease, guideline-directed step care is effective resulting in symptom control and prevention of exacerbations. In severe asthma, however, this stepwise approach is not effective resulting in diminished responsiveness to treatment and need for alternative treatment strategies. As such, supplementation with vitamin D to treat vitamin D insufficiency might be an alternative strategy to prevent frequent exacerbations in asthmatic patients. Indeed, many RCTs of vitamin D supplementation to improve asthma control and exacerbations have been completed and these studies have reported a mixture of positive and negative results. However, several meta-analyses show that vitamin D supplementation significantly reduced the rate of severe exacerbations in patients with asthma [,,,,]. Whether these effects are only observed in patients with vitamin D deficiency, as was shown in COPD, is less clear since only two studies performed subgroups analysis, showing conflicting results [, ]. While the most recent meta-analysis clearly concluded that vitamin D supplementation played a role in reducing the rate of exacerbations particularly in patients with vitamin D insufficiency [], subgroup analysis using individual patient data did not result in such a firm conclusion []. Indeed, reductions in exacerbation rate were found with vitamin D supplementations but only in participants with baseline circulating 25(OH)D levels less than 25 nmol/l and not in those with higher levels of circulating 25(OH)D (adjusted incidence rate ratio was 0.33 (95% CI 0.11–0.98) and 0.77 (95% CI 0.58–1.03), respectively). However, the p value for interaction for this subgroup analysis was not significant indicating no definitive evidence that effects of the intervention with vitamin D differed across subgroups of patients []. Interestingly, most intervention studies are performed in adults, while many children are suffering from asthma as well. Recent studies report that vitamin D supplementation helps in preventing the development of asthma and recurrent wheeze in early life, and may also help in the management of asthma during childhood [, ]. Mechanistic studies in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) isolated from patients with severe asthma reported an inhibition of the production of Th17 cytokines (IL-17 and IL-22), important in the pathogenesis of asthma, after treatment with 1,25(OH)D []. These Th17 cytokines were not inhibited by corticosteroids suggesting a steroid-enhancing property of vitamin D in asthmatic patients. In PBMCs from patients with severe asthma exacerbation and vitamin D deficiency, increased oxidative stress and DNA damage were observed compared to vitamin D-sufficient asthmatic patients with an exacerbation. In the same study, vitamin D was shown to down-regulate the expression of TNF-α, NFκB, and its phosphorylation in an LPS-stimulated airway epithelial cell line suggesting a possible mechanism for vitamin D therapy in severe asthma exacerbation []. Additionally, when asthma patients were treated with vitamin D, a reduction of respiratory infections was observed, and this effect was related to the increase in cathelicidin []. As in COPD and in CF, we should be careful in drawing conclusions concerning the role of vitamin D in asthma exacerbations. Most intervention studies are performed in adults and these results cannot be generalized to children. Still little is known about the optimal serum 25(OH)D levels to exert beneficial effects on the respiratory system. Additionally, it was observed that a rapid vitamin D supplementation (intramuscularly) compared to maintenance dose of vitamin D supplementation (orally) for children with low levels of vitamin D resulted in short- but not long-term reduction in asthma exacerbations []. The relationship between Vitamin D and the respiratory system remains inconclusive. Even though most exacerbations are triggered by a respiratory infection, different pathways or mechanisms are activated with respect to the respiratory disease. Larger clinical trials and more comparable data are needed to draw conclusions on vitamin D’s association with the risk of exacerbations. It is possible that failure to demonstrate an association between vitamin D deficiency and increased exacerbation risk in some studies or populations may be related to the low prevalence of participants with low baseline vitamin D levels. Indeed, mainly in COPD exacerbations, it was shown that actually only the severely deficient patients benefit from vitamin D supplementation. Moreover, even though the relationship between low serum levels of vitamin D and exacerbations remains disputable, vitamin D supplementation may still exert anti-infectious effects. Irrespective of the reasons for the discrepancy between different studies, some important issues should be taken into account when developing new clinical studies. Currently, it is not known if aiming at sufficient serum levels of vitamin D is a good approach to benefit from the anti-inflammatory and anti-bacterial actions of vitamin D. And if so, which serum levels can be considered as “beneficial”? Can we assume that these levels should be similar in all populations and in all respiratory diseases? Additionally, can we assume that all populations, healthy and patients, need similar oral doses to reach certain serum levels? For example, CF patients seem to require much higher doses to achieve similar vitamin D serum levels than patients with other respiratory diseases. Are circulating levels of 25(OH)D the best way to measure vitamin D status? 25(OH)D levels represent the reservoir available for the production of active 1,25(OH)D produced in the kidney by an enzymatic conversion. It is unclear how these serum levels relate to local tissue concentrations. Therefore, there are several pathways that can influence an individual’s ability to produce an adequate amount of locally active vitamin D irrespective of its serum levels. Little is known about the total dose and dose interval needed for the extra-skeletal effects of vitamin D. We speculate that the current dosing regimens and levels in interventional trials might be insufficient to fully benefit the potential actions of vitamin D. Interestingly, individual patient data analysis even revealed that daily or weekly dosing of vitamin D without additional bolus doses protected against acute respiratory infection, whereas regimens containing large boluses did not suggest that daily or weekly vitamin D administration would be a better strategy to protect against URI. This might be due to the potential adverse effects of fluctuations in circulating 25(OH)D concentrations, which are observed after bolus dosing []. In recent years, interest in the tolerance-inducing potential of vitamin D to modulate immune cells has grown, but one of the major obstacles for the use of active vitamin D is the need for supra-physiological doses to modulate immune responses, risking side effects such as hypercalcemia, hypercalciuria, and kidney stones. In order to avoid adverse side effects of high serum levels of vitamin D, much effort has been made to develop vitamin D analogs that still exert the beneficial effects of vitamin D without the hypercalcemic side effects. Despite the efforts made to develop different analogs, not many, however, progressed beyond the preclinical stage []. Alternatively, to avoid side effects of vitamin D supplementation and to maximize the desired effectiveness, treatment locally into the lung as alternative routes of administration of vitamin D rather than peroral must be considered. Development of a drug for inhaled administration is often a common strategy to achieve high efficiency locally in the lungs and reduce side effects. However ,in the case of vitamin D, the challenge is to find a vehicle that allows effective delivery of the lipophilic agent via inhalation with improved bioavailability and sustained release of vitamin D. In conclusion, it is important to diagnose, prevent, and treat vitamin D deficiency, since it is an epidemic all over the world, not only in patients with respiratory diseases. Vitamin D supplementation is a simple low-cost treatment that may help minimizing exacerbations in view of its immunomodulatory and anti-bacterial properties. However, efforts should be made to develop adequate strategies with vitamin D adapted for lung exacerbations rather than using existing treatment modalities with vitamin D supplementation.

Anticoagulation in COVID Pro Con Debate with Drs Todd Bull and Eric Schmidt “We’re going be stronger”: A Frontline Physician’s View of COVID-19 In December, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for two COVID-19 vaccines by Pfizer and Moderna. Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment (CDPHE) is guiding the distribution process and priorities for the State of Colorado. National Jewish Health is following these guidelines. We are currently reaching out to a randomized list of qualified patients individually by phone and email to schedule appointments and will continue to do so as vaccine is available. Thank you for your patience as we work through this process. We anticipate having enough supply of vaccine to open appointments for the public soon. If you would like to receive updates about when and how to make an appointment for COVID-19 vaccine, . This is NOT a sign-up for vaccine, it is for information only. We anticipate having enough supply of vaccine to open appointments for the public soon. We are currently reaching out to a randomized list of qualified patients individually by phone and email to schedule appointments and will continue to do so as vaccine is available. Get the answers you need from our experts in infection prevention and immunology.  The first two vaccines, by Pfizer and Moderna, are mRNA vaccines. Late-stage clinical trials have indicated that both are safe and highly effective. Vaccines expose us to pieces of either a bacteria or a virus, which causes our bodies to recognize a potential threat and to mount an immune response. The goal with a vaccine is to help the body prepare for an actual infection, so it is ready to rapidly and effectively eliminate the SARS-CoV-2 virus when exposed to it. There are different types of vaccines. The Pfizer and Moderna vaccines are called messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines. The mRNA in the vaccines carry genetic instructions which cells in the body use to make copies of viral proteins. Once your cells make those proteins, your immune system will make the antibodies that bind to the protein, disable the virus, and protect you from getting sick or as sick from this virus. How do we know that the vaccine is safe and effective? The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) reviews all vaccines for safety before allowing them to be administered to the public. Additionally, The Advisory Committee for Immunization Practices (ACIP), a group of medical and public health experts that advises the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), also assesses the safety and effectiveness of vaccines. Clinical trials of the vaccines lead to an understanding of safety and effectiveness. With the two early vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna, preliminary data suggests they are both about 95% effective. That means that under controlled conditions there were about 95 percent fewer cases of COVID-19 in the group of people who got the vaccine compared to the group of people who got the placebo. How soon will someone be protected after taking the vaccine? With the two mRNA vaccines, it is estimated that immunity develops around two to three weeks after completing the second shot in the series, but each vaccine works a little differently and every individual responds a little differently. Both the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines are a two shot series, and it is important that an individual have both shots in order to confer immunity.  Most of the COVID-19 vaccines currently in phase 3 clinical trials in the U.S. require two (2) consecutive shots, three or four weeks apart, for the vaccine series. Future COVID-19 vaccines may require only one shot. Currently, Pfizer’s vaccine requires two doses in the vaccine series to be given three weeks apart. If you are in a group that is currently eligible to receive the vaccine and you are not feeling well, it is recommended that you wait until you are feeling better to get the vaccine. If you have symptoms and/or signs of respiratory infection, evaluation and testing from health care resources in your community is recommended.

31a0be3e-1b97-4528-a6c3-7216a27b98ea,"Here are the complications of asthma you should know about. By: | Asthma is a chronic disease condition which narrows and inflames the airways that transport air to the lungs as well as carry air from it. Asthmatics have inflamed airways that cause the surrounding muscles to tighten thereby resulting in less air flow to the lungs. While the condition itself is manageable, it does have some severe complications if not managed well. Here are some of the ones you should know about. Also Read - AI system learns to diagnose, classify intracranial haemorrhage, say researchers Also Read - Shocking: haemorrhagic stroke highest in northeastern states Also Read - A wide range of serious clinical complications are found to be associated with asthma that primarily includes low supply of blood to lungs resulting in comparatively very low blood oxygen level and very high carbon dioxide levels. And, if the O2 levels dangerously fall below critical limit than the patients have to be shifted on ventilators to avert any casualty. Since asthma is a respiratory complication, it is found that people suffering from it lead an inactive and low life. It affects the ability to exercise; restricting oneself to light physical activities and to stay away from any recreational activities. Also, people are found to underperform due to psychological pressure resulting from anxiety, stress and depression. Fatigue and days away from school & work are also quite commonly observed in asthmatics. Lung infection causing pneumonia, collapse of lungs or a part of it and respiratory failure are the severe clinical complications that are reported in addition to wide range of other respiratory problems. Acute respiratory failure in which the bronchial tubes of person suffering from asthma are completely blocked calling for an emergency. Since, asthma is a lifelong disease, the medications have to be used on long term basis. And, hence the chances of side effects from long term use of these drugs is very high. Asthma complications in pregnant women range from early onset of labour pain to gestational diabetes including hypertension and haemorrhage complications. In addition, the infants are also put on risk of breathing problems and low birth weight issues. Status asthmaticus is an acute complication of asthma in which the sufferer fails to respond to initial treatment with bronchodilators. Sometimes it can become severe and cause bronchospasms and inflammation of the airway, making breathing extremely difficult. It can sometimes lead to respiratory failure. 8 steps to manage asthma in children better (Gallery) World Asthma Day 2013: 10 facts about asthma you should know atural remedies to relieve your child of the discomfort of asthma.

125095c8-71dd-4036-b93f-1e846d971e6a,"Researchers use urine test to identify and verify a patient's type of asthma In a new study, researchers at Karolinska Institutet in Sweden have used a urine test to identify and verify a patient's type of asthma. The study, which has been published in the American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, lays the foundation for a more personalized diagnosis and may result in improved treatment of severe asthma in the future. About 10 percent of the Swedish population suffers from asthma, a disease that has become increasingly widespread over the past 50 years, with annual global mortality of around 400,000 according to the World Health Organization. Asthma is characterized by chronic inflammation in the airways, which can result in symptoms including coughing, mucous formation and shortness of breath. There are many types of asthma, and symptoms can vary between individuals, from mild to severe. Currently, in order to make an asthma diagnosis, a wide-ranging investigation is conducted that can consist of multiple elements including patient interviews, lung function tests, blood tests, allergy investigations and x-rays. ""There are no simple methods to determine what type of asthma an individual has, knowledge that is particularly important in order to better treat patients suffering from the more severe types of the disease,"" says Craig Wheelock, associate professor at the Department of Medical Biochemistry and Biophysics, Karolinska Institutet, and the last author of the study. In this new study, research groups at Karolinska Institutet have made an important discovery, which can offer a simple but clear contribution to a correct diagnosis. Using a mass spectrometry-based methodology developed in the Wheelock laboratory, they were able to measure urinary metabolite levels of certain prostaglandins and leukotrienes —eicosanoid signaling molecules that are known mediators of asthmatic airway inflammation. We discovered particularly high levels of the metabolites of the mast cell mediator prostaglandin D and the eosinophil product leukotriene C in asthma patients with what is referred to as Type 2 inflammation. Using our methodology, we were able to measure these metabolites with high accuracy and link their levels to the severity and type of asthma."" Johan Kolmert, Study First Author, Postdoctoral Researcher, Institute of Environmental Medicine, Karolinska Institutet The study is based on data from the U-BIOPRED study (Unbiased BIOmarkers in PREDiction of respiratory disease outcomes), which was designed to investigate severe asthma. The study included 400 participants with severe asthma, which often requires treatment with corticosteroid tablets, nearly 100 individuals with milder forms of asthma and 100 healthy control participants. Study discusses steep drop off from asthma-related ED visits during spring 2020 COVID-19 Study examines whether asthma is a significant risk factor for severe COVID-19 COVID-19 pandemic drives asthma patients to use telemedicine In addition to the increased eicosanoid metabolite levels associated with asthma type and severity, the study shows that measurement using a urine test provides improved accuracy relative to other measurement methods, for example certain kinds of blood tests. ""Another discovery was that levels of these metabolites were still high in patients who were seriously ill, despite the fact that they were being treated with corticosteroid tablets. This highlights the need for alternative treatments for this group of patients,"" explains Johan Kolmert. The researchers were also able to replicate the discovery in urine samples from a study of schoolchildren with asthma, that was conducted by the pediatricians Gunilla Hedlin, Jon Konradsen and Björn Nordlund at Karolinska Institutet. ""We could see that those children who had asthma with Type 2 inflammation were displaying the same profiles of metabolites in the urine as adults,"" says Sven-Erik Dahlén, professor at the Institute of Environmental Medicine, Karolinska Institutet, who led the work together with Craig Wheelock. According to the researchers, this study of severe asthma may be the largest evaluation of eicosanoid urinary metabolites conducted worldwide, and may be an important step towards future biomarker-guided precision medicine. Treatment with steroid inhalers is often sufficient for patients with mild asthma, but for those with severe asthma it may be necessary to supplement with corticosteroid tablets. Corticosteroids are associated with several side-effects, such as high blood pressure, diabetes and harm to the eyes and bones. ""To replace corticosteroid tablets, in recent times several biological medicines have been introduced to treat patients with Type 2 inflammation characterized by increased activation of mast cells and eosinophils,"" Sven-Erik Dahlén says. ""However, these treatments are very expensive, so it is an important discovery that urine samples may be used to identify precisely those patients who will benefit from the Type 2 biologics.""

It is easily spread through small, invisible droplets that a person with the disease coughs or exhales. The droplets can land on surfaces or objects nearby. If you touch the droplet-covered surface or object and then touch your eyes, nose, or mouth, you can contract COVID-19. In addition to personal safety practices, such as wearing masks and social distancing, it is important to regularly disinfect surfaces to minimize the risk of contracting COVID-19 and other viral and bacterial infections.   It is important to know the difference between cleaning and disinfecting. Imagine you’re baking cookies and some of the ingredients fall on the counter. You can wipe up those ingredients with a wet paper towel or cloth, and they may not be visible on the counter anymore. You have “cleaned” the surface. But microscopic particles such as viruses and bacteria continue to live on the counter’s surface. To remove viruses, destroy bacteria and truly “disinfect” the surface, you must use EPA-registered disinfecting products. And you must follow the instructions on the product’s label. Instructions may include pre-cleaning measures, completely wetting the surface or object with the product, allowing the product to sit for an extended period of time or allowing to air dry, or wiping down with a dry or wet towel. Many surfaces and objects around the home and workplace must be regularly disinfected to help prevent the spread of COVID-19. Surfaces and objects that have a high potential of carrying the COVID-19 virus include: These aren’t the only surfaces to disinfect. It’s important to also disinfect surfaces and objects that are used or touched less often such as:   blinds and blind pulls, and/or window covering like curtains While it’s important to disinfect electronics, you should not use common household disinfectants such as Lysol wipes to clean them. Electronics should be disinfected using alcohol-based wipes or spray containing at least 70 percent alcohol. Items included in this category include: If you have a family member who has symptoms or who was diagnosed with COVID-19, you must protect others from those germs. Disinfecting or killing germs can help prevent others from getting sick. Wear a mask and gloves when you are around a sick person. Disinfect surfaces and objects after the sick person has touched or used them. The sick person also can help by using disinfecting wipes to clean items they’ve touched including their trash can. The sick person must also wear a mask. Washing Laundry from Someone Infected with COVID-19 When washing laundry for a sick person, wear a mask and gloves. Don’t shake dirty laundry. It can unknowingly scatter the virus in the air. Follow the manufacturers’ washing instructions. Dry items completely. Disinfect laundry baskets and hampers When done with laundry and disinfecting, remove and dispose of gloves, and wash your hands right away.  Remember, regularly disinfecting surfaces and items with EPA-approved products slows the spread of COVID-19.

be41ba53-0b2c-454b-b2b3-4ae246532e85,"COVID-19 is an emerging, rapidly evolving situation Get the latest information and resources from NHLBI Also known as Your lungs are a pair of organs in your chest. They have a spongy texture and are pinkish-gray in color. When you inhale (breathe in), air enters your lungs and oxygen from the air moves from your lungs to your blood. At the same time, carbon dioxide, a waste gas, moves from your blood to the lungs and is exhaled (breathe out). This process is called gas exchange and is essential to life. In addition to the lungs, your respiratory system includes the trachea (windpipe), muscles of the chest wall and diaphragm, blood vessels, and tissues that make breathing and gas exchange possible. Your brain controls your breathing rate (how fast or slow you breathe), by sensing your body’s need for oxygen and its need to get rid of carbon dioxide. Healthy lifestyle habits, such as physical activity and not smoking, can help prevent lung injury and disease. Explore this Health Topic to learn more about how the lungs work, our role in research and clinical trials, and where to find more information. Your lungs lie on each side of your heart inside your chest cavity. The right lung is divided into three lobes (sections), and the left lung is divided into two lobes. Your left lung is slightly smaller than your right lung, since your heart takes up some space on the left side. When you breathe in, air enters your airways and travels down into the alveoli (air sacs) in your lungs. This is where gas exchange takes place. Your lungs are two spongy organs in your chest. The left lung is divided into two lobes and the right lung is divided into three lobes. Medical Animation Copyright © 2019 Nucleus Medical Media Inc. All rights reserved. The circulatory system, which is made up of the heart and blood vessels, supports the respiratory system by bringing blood to and from the lungs. The circulatory system helps  to deliver nutrients and oxygen from the lungs to tissues and organs throughout the body and removes carbon dioxide and waste products. Other body systems that work with the respiratory system include the nervous system, The airways are pipes that carry oxygen-rich air to the alveoli in your lungs. They also carry the waste gas carbon dioxide out of your lungs. The airways include these parts of your body: Nose and linked air passages called the nasal cavity and Small tubes called bronchioles that branch off of the bronchial tubes When you breathe in, air enters your nose and/or mouth, and passes into your windpipe, also called the trachea. The windpipe divides into two bronchial tubes, or bronchi, then branches into smaller bronchioles. The bronchioles end in tiny air sacs, called alveoli. Here the oxygen you inhale passes into the bloodstream, and carbon dioxide from your body passes out of the bloodstream into the air in your lungs. The carbon dioxide is expelled from your body when you exhale. Medical Animation Copyright © 2020 Nucleus Medical Media Inc. All rights reserved. Air first enters your body through your nose or mouth, which moistens and warms the air since cold, dry air can irritate your lungs. The air then travels past your voice box and down your windpipe. Rings of tough tissue, called cartilage, acts as a support to keep the bronchial tubes open. Inside your lungs, the bronchial tubes branch into thousands of thinner tubes called bronchioles. The bronchioles end in clusters of tiny air sacs called alveoli. Your lungs have about 150 million alveoli. Normally, your alveoli are elastic, meaning that their size and shape can change easily. Alveoli are able to easily expand and contract, because their insides are coated with a substance called surfactant. Surfactant reduces the work it takes to breathe by helping the lungs inflate more easily when you breathe in and preventing the lungs from collapsing when you breath out. Each of these alveoli is made up of a mesh of tiny blood vessels called capillaries. The capillaries connect to a network of arteries and veins that move blood through your body. The pulmonary artery and its branches deliver blood to the capillaries that surround the alveoli. This blood is rich in carbon dioxide and low in oxygen. Carbon dioxide moves from the blood into the air inside the alveoli. At the same time, oxygen moves from the air into the blood in the capillaries. How does my body protect the airways from food or bacteria? When you swallow, a thin flap of tissue called the epiglottis covers your windpipe. Along with coughing and gag reflexes, the epiglottis prevents food and drink from entering the airway. The epiglottis also helps direct food into your esophagus, which is the pipe that goes to your stomach. Except for the mouth and some parts of the nose, the airways have cells that make mucus, a sticky substance that coats the walls of the airways. Other cells in the airways have hairlike structures called . The cilia and mucus trap germs and other particles that enter your airways when you breathe in air. The cilia then sweep the mucus-coated germs up to the nose or mouth. From there, the germs are swallowed, coughed, or sneezed out of the body. The lungs are surrounded by the pleura, a membrane with two layers. The space between these two layers is called the pleural cavity. A slippery liquid called pleural fluid acts as a lubricant to reduce friction during breathing. How Your Body Controls Breathing The body’s muscles and nervous system help control your breathing. The lungs are like sponges; they cannot expand (get bigger) on their own. Muscles in your chest and abdomen contract (tighten) to create a slight vacuum around your lungs. This causes air to flow in. When you exhale, the muscles relax and the lungs deflate on their own, much like an elastic balloon will deflate if left open to the air. which is a dome-shaped muscle below your lungs. It separates the chest cavity from the abdominal cavity. The diaphragm is the main muscle used for breathing. called intercostal muscles, play a role in breathing during physical activity. help you breathe out when you are breathing fast, such as during physical activity. The pharynx is the part of the throat right behind the mouth. These muscles control the lips, tongue, soft palate, and other structures to help with breathing. Problems with these muscles can narrow the airway, make it more difficult to breathe, and contribute to . help you breathe in. Damage to the nerves in the upper spinal cord can interfere with the movement of your diaphragm and other muscles in your chest, neck, and abdomen. This can happen due to a spinal cord injury, a stroke, or a degenerative disease such as muscular dystrophy. The damage can cause or  may be necessary to maintain oxygen levels in the body and protect the organs from damage. Your breathing usually does not require any thought, because it is controlled by the autonomic nervous system, also called the involuntary nervous system. slows your breathing rate. It causes your bronchial tubes to narrow and the pulmonary blood vessels to widen. increases your breathing rate. It makes your bronchial tubes widen and the pulmonary blood vessels narrow. Your breathing changes depending on how active you are and the condition of the air around you. For example, you need to breathe more often when you do physical activity. At times, you can control your breathing pattern, such as when you hold your breath or sing. To help adjust your breathing to changing needs, your body has sensors that send signals to the breathing centers in the brain. detect lung irritants. The sensors can trigger sneezing or . In people who have asthma, the sensors may cause the muscles around the airways in the lungs to contract. This makes the airways smaller. detect carbon dioxide and oxygen levels in your blood. detect the movement of your arms or legs. These sensors may play a role in increasing your breathing rate when you are physically active. In central sleep apnea, the brain temporarily stops sending signals to the muscles needed to breathe. Learn more at our . What Breathing Does for the Body Breathing involves two phases: breathing in and breathing out. If you have problems breathing, gas exchange may be impaired, which can be a serious health problem. When you breathe in, or inhale, your diaphragm contracts and moves downward. This increases the space in your chest cavity, and your lungs expand into it. The muscles between your ribs also help enlarge the chest cavity. They contract to pull your rib cage both upward and outward when you inhale. As your lungs expand, air is sucked in through your nose or mouth. The air travels down your windpipe and into your lungs. After passing through your bronchial tubes, the air travels to the alveoli, or air sacs. When you breathe in, air enters your nose or mouth, and passes into your windpipe, also called the trachea. At the bottom, the windpipe divides into two bronchial tubes, then branches into smaller bronchioles. The brochioles end in tiny air sacs, called alveoli. In the alveoli, the oxygen you inhaled passes into the bloodstream, and carbon dioxide from your body passes out of the bloodstream. The carbon dioxide is expelled from your body when you exhale. Medical Animation Copyright © 2020 Nucleus Medical Media Inc. All rights reserved. Through the thin walls of the alveoli, oxygen from the air passes into your blood in the surrounding capillaries. At the same time, carbon dioxide moves from your blood into the air sacs. The oxygen in your blood is carried inside your red blood cells by a protein called The oxygen-rich blood from your lungs is carried to the left side of the heart through the pulmonary veins. The heart pumps the blood to the rest of the body, where oxygen in the red blood cells moves from blood vessels into your cells. Your cells use oxygen to make energy so your body can work. During this process, your cells also make a waste gas called carbon dioxide. Carbon dioxide needs to be breathed out or it can damage your cells. Carbon dioxide moves from the cells into the bloodstream, where it travels to the right side of your heart. The blood rich in carbon dioxide is then pumped from the heart through the pulmonary artery to the lungs, where it is breathed out. For more information on blood flow, visit our  Health Topic. When you breathe out, or exhale, your diaphragm and rib muscles relax, reducing the space in the chest cavity. As the chest cavity gets smaller, your lungs deflate, similar to releasing of air from a balloon. At the same time, carbon dioxide-rich air flows out of your lungs through the windpipe and then out of your nose or mouth. Breathing out requires no effort from your body unless you have a lung disease or are doing physical activity. When you are physically active, your abdominal muscles contract and push your diaphragm against your lungs even more than usual. This rapidly pushes air out of your lungs. in the lungs or airways or both, can lead to the following conditions. Exposure to cigarette smoke, air pollutants, or other substances can damage the airways, causing disease of the airways or making a disease more severe. How to Keep Your Lungs Healthy You can take these steps to help protect your lungs from injury or disease: Visit and the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute’s Although these resources focus on heart health, they include basic information about how to quit smoking. For free help and support to quit smoking, you may call the National Cancer Institute’s Smoking Quitline at 1-877-44U-QUIT (1-877-448-7848). by staying away from places where smoking is allowed. Ask friends and family members who smoke not to do it in the house or car. Unhealthy eating patterns and lack of physical activity can lead to overweight and obesity, which can result in sleep apnea. Research has shown that losing weight can reduce sleep apnea in people who have also been diagnosed with obesity. By being physically active, you can help strengthen your heart and lungs so they work more efficiently. Physical activity may also reduce your risk of lung injury or disease. Our includes basic information about physical activity. Before starting any exercise program, ask your doctor what level of physical activity is right for you. by checking the before taking part in outdoor activities and avoiding heavy traffic when possible. by making sure that the places where you live and work are well ventilated and cleaned regularly to prevent the buildup of allergens, dust, and mold. You can also remove products that create fumes, such as strong cleaning products and aerosols. Avoid burning solid fuels such as wood for heating and cooking. Get a flu shot every year. You may also want to ask your doctor or healthcare provider about the pneumonia vaccine. Radon is a colorless, tasteless, and odorless gas that forms naturally. It can enter buildings through cracks in the wall and can cause lung cancer. Inexpensive testing kits are available from many hardware stores. If radon levels are hazardous, take recommended steps to reduce radon levels in your home, or alert the property owners so they can fix the building. if you work in an industry that involves exposure to dust, silica, allergens, chemical fumes, or other indoor or outdoor air pollution. As you age, the lung tissue that helps keep your airways open can lose elasticity, which means they cannot expand or contract as easily as when you were younger. The muscles your body uses for breathing may get smaller or weaker, and your spine can curve more, leaving less space for your lungs to expand. It can take longer to clear mucus and particles from your airways. It can also become harder to cough. These changes can make it harder to breathe during physical activity as you get older.

Research on this topic is part of the NHLBI’s broader commitment to advancing scientific discovery. and Sustaining Research to Reduce the Burden of COPD The NHLBI, with input from federal and nonfederal partners, developed a to guide stakeholders nationwide in their efforts to reduce the burden of COPD. In addition, the NHLBI’s program seeks to increase awareness about lung diseases and conditions, including COPD, and understanding of how to manage and treat them. The National Asthma Education and Prevention Program (NAEPP) raises awareness about asthma as a major public health problem. Working with medical associations, voluntary health organizations, and community programs, NAEPP helps to educate patients, healthcare professionals, and the public about asthma. The  program also aims to raise awareness about asthma as well as educate people about how to treat it. Learn about some of the pioneering research contributions we have made over the years that have improved clinical care. Understanding the risks and benefits of surgery to treat emphysema. The was a landmark study that clarified the risks and benefits of lung volume reduction surgery (LVRS) to treat patients whose COPD is mainly emphysema. LVRS reduces the size of the lungs to make breathing easier. The NETT also helped identify which patients are most likely to benefit from LVRS. Improving critical care for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Since 1994, the NHLBI’s ARDS Network (ARDSNet)enrolled more than 5,000 patients in observational and investigational studies that have informed best practices for care and led to improved survival rates. Building on more than a decade of preliminary NHLBI-funded research showing that oxygen at high pressures can damage the lungs, an ARDSNet-led study demonstrated that using a lower level of air pressure during mechanical ventilation reduced the amount of life-threatening complications and increased ventilator-free days for patients who had acute lung injury and ARDS. As a result, this lifesaving practice is now the standard of care and is being implemented in intensive care units around the country. New treatment for the rare lung disease lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM). The NHLBI supported the Multicenter International LAM Efficacy of Sirolimus (MILES) trial, which also included NHLBI researchers. The study showed that sirolimus, a drug used to help prevent transplant rejection, is safe for people who have LAM and can improve their quality of life. In support of , we are committed to advancing lung research in part through the following ways. Our and its study diseases that affect the lungs. Specific projects aim to answer clinically relevant questions using methods ranging from molecular-level studies to clinical studies of diagnostics, therapeutics, and interventions.

Our Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine (TOPMed) program includes participants who have lung conditions, which may help us understand how genes contribute to differences in disease severity and how patients respond to treatment. highlights ways we may support research over the next decade. Learn about exciting research areas the NHLBI is exploring about the lungs. The Molecular Atlas of Lung Development Program () is integrating many datasets to build a molecular map of the developing lung in both humans and mice. The program is helping advance lung research, in part through its Web-based data resource, called BREATH, that allows users to access LungMAP data and findings. NHLBI-supported LungMAP centers are using high-resolution imaging and molecular techniques to study how lungs develop in humans and in mice. This knowledge may help us understand, prevent, and treat lung problems common in preterm babies. The NHBLI is funding a project aimed at discovering how small arteries in the brain narrow and widen, affecting how the brain responds to levels of oxygen in the blood. Having a better understanding of this mechanism may uncover new ways to help people who have diseases or injuries that affect their breathing. TheNHLBI funds studies to understand how the lung develops and is repaired after damage. Researchers recently found two types of cells that act after lung injury. One promotes the growth and regeneration of lung tissue while the other promotes the development of fibrous connective tissue, which is a harmful response and a known contributor to chronic lung diseases such as . This discovery may pave the way for new treatments that restore healthy lung tissue and prevent scar tissue from forming. People who have lung diseases often have trouble with chronic bronchitis, which is associated with coughing and excessive mucus. By learning more about how mucus forms and moves in health and disease, researchers may be able to develop treatments to help with the symptoms of chronic bronchitis. We lead or sponsor studies on the lungs. See if you or someone you know is eligible to participate in a .

They have a spongy texture and are pinkish-gray in color. When you inhale (breathe in), air enters your lungs and oxygen from the air moves from your lungs to your blood. At the same time, carbon dioxide, a waste gas, moves from your blood to the lungs and is exhaled (breathe out). This process is called gas exchange and is essential to life. In addition to the lungs, your respiratory system includes the trachea (windpipe), muscles of the chest wall and diaphragm, blood vessels, and tissues that make breathing and gas exchange possible. Your brain controls your breathing rate (how fast or slow you breathe), by sensing your body’s need for oxygen and its need to get rid of carbon dioxide. Healthy lifestyle habits, such as physical activity and not smoking, can help prevent lung injury and disease. Explore this Health Topic to learn more about how the lungs work, our role in research and clinical trials, and where to find more information. Your lungs lie on each side of your heart inside your chest cavity. The right lung is divided into three lobes (sections), and the left lung is divided into two lobes. Your left lung is slightly smaller than your right lung, since your heart takes up some space on the left side. When you breathe in, air enters your airways and travels down into the alveoli (air sacs) in your lungs. This is where gas exchange takes place. Your lungs are two spongy organs in your chest. The left lung is divided into two lobes and the right lung is divided into three lobes. Medical Animation Copyright © 2019 Nucleus Medical Media Inc. All rights reserved. The circulatory system, which is made up of the heart and blood vessels, supports the respiratory system by bringing blood to and from the lungs. The circulatory system helps  to deliver nutrients and oxygen from the lungs to tissues and organs throughout the body and removes carbon dioxide and waste products. Other body systems that work with the respiratory system include the nervous system, The airways are pipes that carry oxygen-rich air to the alveoli in your lungs. They also carry the waste gas carbon dioxide out of your lungs. The airways include these parts of your body: Nose and linked air passages called the nasal cavity and Small tubes called bronchioles that branch off of the bronchial tubes When you breathe in, air enters your nose and/or mouth, and passes into your windpipe, also called the trachea. The windpipe divides into two bronchial tubes, or bronchi, then branches into smaller bronchioles. The bronchioles end in tiny air sacs, called alveoli. Here the oxygen you inhale passes into the bloodstream, and carbon dioxide from your body passes out of the bloodstream into the air in your lungs. The carbon dioxide is expelled from your body when you exhale. Medical Animation Copyright © 2020 Nucleus Medical Media Inc. All rights reserved. Air first enters your body through your nose or mouth, which moistens and warms the air since cold, dry air can irritate your lungs. The air then travels past your voice box and down your windpipe. Rings of tough tissue, called cartilage, acts as a support to keep the bronchial tubes open. Inside your lungs, the bronchial tubes branch into thousands of thinner tubes called bronchioles. The bronchioles end in clusters of tiny air sacs called alveoli. Your lungs have about 150 million alveoli. Normally, your alveoli are elastic, meaning that their size and shape can change easily. Alveoli are able to easily expand and contract, because their insides are coated with a substance called surfactant. Surfactant reduces the work it takes to breathe by helping the lungs inflate more easily when you breathe in and preventing the lungs from collapsing when you breath out. Each of these alveoli is made up of a mesh of tiny blood vessels called capillaries. The capillaries connect to a network of arteries and veins that move blood through your body. The pulmonary artery and its branches deliver blood to the capillaries that surround the alveoli. This blood is rich in carbon dioxide and low in oxygen. Carbon dioxide moves from the blood into the air inside the alveoli. At the same time, oxygen moves from the air into the blood in the capillaries. How does my body protect the airways from food or bacteria? When you swallow, a thin flap of tissue called the epiglottis covers your windpipe. Along with coughing and gag reflexes, the epiglottis prevents food and drink from entering the airway. The epiglottis also helps direct food into your esophagus, which is the pipe that goes to your stomach. Except for the mouth and some parts of the nose, the airways have cells that make mucus, a sticky substance that coats the walls of the airways. Other cells in the airways have hairlike structures called . The cilia and mucus trap germs and other particles that enter your airways when you breathe in air. The cilia then sweep the mucus-coated germs up to the nose or mouth. From there, the germs are swallowed, coughed, or sneezed out of the body. The lungs are surrounded by the pleura, a membrane with two layers. The space between these two layers is called the pleural cavity. A slippery liquid called pleural fluid acts as a lubricant to reduce friction during breathing. How Your Body Controls Breathing The body’s muscles and nervous system help control your breathing. The lungs are like sponges; they cannot expand (get bigger) on their own. Muscles in your chest and abdomen contract (tighten) to create a slight vacuum around your lungs. This causes air to flow in. When you exhale, the muscles relax and the lungs deflate on their own, much like an elastic balloon will deflate if left open to the air. which is a dome-shaped muscle below your lungs. It separates the chest cavity from the abdominal cavity. The diaphragm is the main muscle used for breathing. called intercostal muscles, play a role in breathing during physical activity. help you breathe out when you are breathing fast, such as during physical activity. The pharynx is the part of the throat right behind the mouth. These muscles control the lips, tongue, soft palate, and other structures to help with breathing. Problems with these muscles can narrow the airway, make it more difficult to breathe, and contribute to . help you breathe in. Damage to the nerves in the upper spinal cord can interfere with the movement of your diaphragm and other muscles in your chest, neck, and abdomen. This can happen due to a spinal cord injury, a stroke, or a degenerative disease such as muscular dystrophy. The damage can cause or  may be necessary to maintain oxygen levels in the body and protect the organs from damage. Your breathing usually does not require any thought, because it is controlled by the autonomic nervous system, also called the involuntary nervous system. slows your breathing rate. It causes your bronchial tubes to narrow and the pulmonary blood vessels to widen. increases your breathing rate. It makes your bronchial tubes widen and the pulmonary blood vessels narrow. Your breathing changes depending on how active you are and the condition of the air around you. For example, you need to breathe more often when you do physical activity. At times, you can control your breathing pattern, such as when you hold your breath or sing. To help adjust your breathing to changing needs, your body has sensors that send signals to the breathing centers in the brain. detect lung irritants. The sensors can trigger sneezing or . In people who have asthma, the sensors may cause the muscles around the airways in the lungs to contract. This makes the airways smaller. detect carbon dioxide and oxygen levels in your blood. detect the movement of your arms or legs. These sensors may play a role in increasing your breathing rate when you are physically active. In central sleep apnea, the brain temporarily stops sending signals to the muscles needed to breathe. Learn more at our . What Breathing Does for the Body Breathing involves two phases: breathing in and breathing out. If you have problems breathing, gas exchange may be impaired, which can be a serious health problem. When you breathe in, or inhale, your diaphragm contracts and moves downward. This increases the space in your chest cavity, and your lungs expand into it. The muscles between your ribs also help enlarge the chest cavity. They contract to pull your rib cage both upward and outward when you inhale. As your lungs expand, air is sucked in through your nose or mouth. The air travels down your windpipe and into your lungs. After passing through your bronchial tubes, the air travels to the alveoli, or air sacs. When you breathe in, air enters your nose or mouth, and passes into your windpipe, also called the trachea. At the bottom, the windpipe divides into two bronchial tubes, then branches into smaller bronchioles. The brochioles end in tiny air sacs, called alveoli. In the alveoli, the oxygen you inhaled passes into the bloodstream, and carbon dioxide from your body passes out of the bloodstream. The carbon dioxide is expelled from your body when you exhale. Medical Animation Copyright © 2020 Nucleus Medical Media Inc. All rights reserved. Through the thin walls of the alveoli, oxygen from the air passes into your blood in the surrounding capillaries. At the same time, carbon dioxide moves from your blood into the air sacs. The oxygen in your blood is carried inside your red blood cells by a protein called The oxygen-rich blood from your lungs is carried to the left side of the heart through the pulmonary veins. The heart pumps the blood to the rest of the body, where oxygen in the red blood cells moves from blood vessels into your cells. Your cells use oxygen to make energy so your body can work. During this process, your cells also make a waste gas called carbon dioxide. Carbon dioxide needs to be breathed out or it can damage your cells. Carbon dioxide moves from the cells into the bloodstream, where it travels to the right side of your heart. The blood rich in carbon dioxide is then pumped from the heart through the pulmonary artery to the lungs, where it is breathed out. For more information on blood flow, visit our  Health Topic. When you breathe out, or exhale, your diaphragm and rib muscles relax, reducing the space in the chest cavity. As the chest cavity gets smaller, your lungs deflate, similar to releasing of air from a balloon. At the same time, carbon dioxide-rich air flows out of your lungs through the windpipe and then out of your nose or mouth. Breathing out requires no effort from your body unless you have a lung disease or are doing physical activity. When you are physically active, your abdominal muscles contract and push your diaphragm against your lungs even more than usual. This rapidly pushes air out of your lungs. in the lungs or airways or both, can lead to the following conditions. Exposure to cigarette smoke, air pollutants, or other substances can damage the airways, causing disease of the airways or making a disease more severe. How to Keep Your Lungs Healthy You can take these steps to help protect your lungs from injury or disease: Visit and the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute’s Although these resources focus on heart health, they include basic information about how to quit smoking. For free help and support to quit smoking, you may call the National Cancer Institute’s Smoking Quitline at 1-877-44U-QUIT (1-877-448-7848). by staying away from places where smoking is allowed. Ask friends and family members who smoke not to do it in the house or car. Unhealthy eating patterns and lack of physical activity can lead to overweight and obesity, which can result in sleep apnea. Research has shown that losing weight can reduce sleep apnea in people who have also been diagnosed with obesity. By being physically active, you can help strengthen your heart and lungs so they work more efficiently. Physical activity may also reduce your risk of lung injury or disease. Our includes basic information about physical activity. Before starting any exercise program, ask your doctor what level of physical activity is right for you. by checking the before taking part in outdoor activities and avoiding heavy traffic when possible. by making sure that the places where you live and work are well ventilated and cleaned regularly to prevent the buildup of allergens, dust, and mold. You can also remove products that create fumes, such as strong cleaning products and aerosols. Avoid burning solid fuels such as wood for heating and cooking. Get a flu shot every year. You may also want to ask your doctor or healthcare provider about the pneumonia vaccine. Radon is a colorless, tasteless, and odorless gas that forms naturally. It can enter buildings through cracks in the wall and can cause lung cancer. Inexpensive testing kits are available from many hardware stores. If radon levels are hazardous, take recommended steps to reduce radon levels in your home, or alert the property owners so they can fix the building. if you work in an industry that involves exposure to dust, silica, allergens, chemical fumes, or other indoor or outdoor air pollution. As you age, the lung tissue that helps keep your airways open can lose elasticity, which means they cannot expand or contract as easily as when you were younger. The muscles your body uses for breathing may get smaller or weaker, and your spine can curve more, leaving less space for your lungs to expand. It can take longer to clear mucus and particles from your airways. It can also become harder to cough. These changes can make it harder to breathe during physical activity as you get older. The NHLBI is part of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ National Institutes of Health (NIH)—the Nation’s biomedical agency that makes important scientific discoveries to improve health and save lives. We are committed to advancing science and translating discoveries into clinical practice to promote the prevention and treatment of heart, lung, blood, and sleep disorders. Learn about current and future NHLBI efforts to improve health through research and scientific discovery. Learn about the following ways the NHLBI continues to translate current research to prevent and treat lung problems. Research on this topic is part of the NHLBI’s broader commitment to advancing scientific discovery. and Sustaining Research to Reduce the Burden of COPD The NHLBI, with input from federal and nonfederal partners, developed a to guide stakeholders nationwide in their efforts to reduce the burden of COPD. In addition, the NHLBI’s program seeks to increase awareness about lung diseases and conditions, including COPD, and understanding of how to manage and treat them. The National Asthma Education and Prevention Program (NAEPP) raises awareness about asthma as a major public health problem. Working with medical associations, voluntary health organizations, and community programs, NAEPP helps to educate patients, healthcare professionals, and the public about asthma. The  program also aims to raise awareness about asthma as well as educate people about how to treat it. Learn about some of the pioneering research contributions we have made over the years that have improved clinical care. Understanding the risks and benefits of surgery to treat emphysema. The was a landmark study that clarified the risks and benefits of lung volume reduction surgery (LVRS) to treat patients whose COPD is mainly emphysema. LVRS reduces the size of the lungs to make breathing easier. The NETT also helped identify which patients are most likely to benefit from LVRS. Improving critical care for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Since 1994, the NHLBI’s ARDS Network (ARDSNet)enrolled more than 5,000 patients in observational and investigational studies that have informed best practices for care and led to improved survival rates. Building on more than a decade of preliminary NHLBI-funded research showing that oxygen at high pressures can damage the lungs, an ARDSNet-led study demonstrated that using a lower level of air pressure during mechanical ventilation reduced the amount of life-threatening complications and increased ventilator-free days for patients who had acute lung injury and ARDS. As a result, this lifesaving practice is now the standard of care and is being implemented in intensive care units around the country. New treatment for the rare lung disease lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM). The NHLBI supported the Multicenter International LAM Efficacy of Sirolimus (MILES) trial, which also included NHLBI researchers. The study showed that sirolimus, a drug used to help prevent transplant rejection, is safe for people who have LAM and can improve their quality of life. In support of , we are committed to advancing lung research in part through the following ways. Our and its study diseases that affect the lungs. Specific projects aim to answer clinically relevant questions using methods ranging from molecular-level studies to clinical studies of diagnostics, therapeutics, and interventions. The research we fund today will help improve our future health. Our oversees much of the research on the lungs and other parts of the respiratory system, helping us to understand, prevent, and manage health conditions affecting these organs and tissues. The supports research and research training in obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, cystic fibrosis, bronchiolitis, lung imaging, and airway function in health and disease. The supports research and research training in pulmonary vascular biology and pulmonary hypertension, lung development and repair, acute lung injury and critical care, pulmonary fibrosis and other interstitial lung diseases, rare lung diseases, lung transplantation, and lung responses to HIV/AIDS and other infections. Search the to learn about research the NHLBI is funding on the lungs. Our Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine (TOPMed) program includes participants who have lung conditions, which may help us understand how genes contribute to differences in disease severity and how patients respond to treatment. highlights ways we may support research over the next decade. Learn about exciting research areas the NHLBI is exploring about the lungs. The Molecular Atlas of Lung Development Program () is integrating many datasets to build a molecular map of the developing lung in both humans and mice. The program is helping advance lung research, in part through its Web-based data resource, called BREATH, that allows users to access LungMAP data and findings. NHLBI-supported LungMAP centers are using high-resolution imaging and molecular techniques to study how lungs develop in humans and in mice. This knowledge may help us understand, prevent, and treat lung problems common in preterm babies. The NHBLI is funding a project aimed at discovering how small arteries in the brain narrow and widen, affecting how the brain responds to levels of oxygen in the blood. Having a better understanding of this mechanism may uncover new ways to help people who have diseases or injuries that affect their breathing. TheNHLBI funds studies to understand how the lung develops and is repaired after damage. Researchers recently found two types of cells that act after lung injury. One promotes the growth and regeneration of lung tissue while the other promotes the development of fibrous connective tissue, which is a harmful response and a known contributor to chronic lung diseases such as . This discovery may pave the way for new treatments that restore healthy lung tissue and prevent scar tissue from forming. People who have lung diseases often have trouble with chronic bronchitis, which is associated with coughing and excessive mucus. By learning more about how mucus forms and moves in health and disease, researchers may be able to develop treatments to help with the symptoms of chronic bronchitis. We lead or sponsor studies on the lungs. See if you or someone you know is eligible to participate in a . This study will investigate the genes involved in the breathing process and in the development of lung diseases such as asthma or sarcoidosis to improve understanding of the role they play.

Asthma is a long-term lung condition that is caused by narrowing of the airways when they become inflamed. People with asthma experience difficulty breathing, and the most common symptoms are wheezing, coughing, feeling ‘out of breath’ and tightness in the chest. Symptoms are usually mild but can flare up and cause an ‘asthma attack’ that may require hospital care. There are effective medicines for asthma that, if taken correctly, will help you feel well and keep you out of hospital. Asthma can be managed with reliever inhalers to treat symptoms and attacks. Preventer or controller medications can prevent symptoms. Asthma is a common condition that affects the airways (breathing tubes) in your lungs. People with asthma have sensitive airways that become inflamed when exposed to triggers. Inflamed airways make it difficult to breathe which leads to mild symptoms like wheezing, or . Asthma affects 1 in 9 Australians, and 1 in 4 children develop asthma sometime in their childhood. However, any adult can get asthma, even if you didn’t have it as a child. Sometimes asthma can flare up and symptoms become worse compared to usual — known as an asthma attack. Some asthma sufferers describe asthma attacks as feeling as though you are breathing through a straw. They can happen rapidly (such as after exposure to smoke), or emerge gradually over hours or days (for example, after getting a ). A serious or severe asthma flare-up needs urgent medical attention from a doctor or hospital emergency department, even for people whose symptoms are usually mild or well controlled. If you or another person show signs of a severe asthma attack, call triple zero (000) immediately and ask for an ambulance. If calling triple zero (000) does not work on your mobile, call 112. Early treatment could save a life. While symptoms vary from person to person, the most common signs of mild asthma include: — feeling breathless, even while resting, or being unable to finish full sentences before needing to take another breath wheezing — making a whistling sound while breathing — either at specific times (for example, at night, early in the morning, during cool weather) or after certain activities (such as exercise) During a severe asthma attack, you may notice more serious symptoms, such as: feeling very distressed, exhausted or even limp from trying to breathe deep sucking motions at the throat or chest while trying to breathe — Use the for breathing problems and find out if you need to seek medical help. Call triple zero (000) immediately and ask for an ambulance if you notice symptoms of a severe asthma attack. It’s important to have an ‘’ for anyone under your care, so you can recognise symptoms of an attack and know how to manage them when they happen. Experts aren’t sure why some people get asthma and others don’t. You are more likely to have asthma if someone in your immediate family has asthma. A child’s risk of developing asthma is also greater if they were born or with , if the mother , if they , or if they have been exposed to air pollution or mould. Healthy adults can also develop asthma after extended exposure to air pollution (such as fumes that irritate the lungs, or breathing in dusts that they’re to). Even athletes can get asthma this way — for example, if they have trained intensely while breathing in polluted, cold or dry air. allergens such as , , food items and mould (allergic asthma) smoke from cigarettes, and traffic pollution other irritants such as cleaning products, perfumes, aerosol products and certain workplace chemicals physical activity (referred to as exercise-induced asthma) , such as whether your close relatives have asthma or allergies breathing tests to assess how your well your lungs are working (such as ) For children aged under 5 years who find breathing tests difficult, your doctor may prescribe some asthma medication first (referred to as a ‘treatment trial’), then use the results of the treatment to make a diagnosis. Asthma is likely to be diagnosed if the symptoms improve quickly with reliever medication. You may also need to undergo . This is because asthma is more likely to be diagnosed if your symptoms are triggered by known allergies, or occur at the same time each year (seasonal). — The can help you find doctors, pharmacies, hospitals and other health services. Asthma treatment helps keep your lungs healthy, prevents asthma symptoms from interfering with normal life and helps prevent flare-ups or attacks. Your doctor may prescribe or suggest these treatments. There are three main types of : relievers, preventers and controllers. Asthma reliever medication helps open up your airways quickly to relieve symptoms during an asthma attack. They work within minutes and the effects can last for about 4 hours. One common reliever medication is salbutamol (Ventolin). You or your child may need to use asthma relievers more regularly until the symptoms are gone, but use them as prescribed by your doctor. Asthma preventer medicine helps prevent asthma attacks and keeps your asthma under control. Preventer treatments relax your airways with anti-inflammatory medicine — usually corticosteroids, a substance similar to the steroid your body produces — into your lungs. Preventer medication comes in either inhaler or tablet form and should be taken every day. Sometimes, short courses of oral corticosteroids (such as ) may be used to help manage asthma flare-ups. Asthma controller medicine helps to control asthma when a preventer medication isn’t enough. They help in a similar way to asthma reliever medications but last longer, and are often combined with a preventer medicine into a single inhaler. Sometimes, short courses of oral corticosteroids (e.g. prednisolone) may be used to help manage flare-ups of asthma. Using inhalers and spacers properly takes practice, so it’s important to learn the correct technique for getting the optimal amount of medicine. Read our article on . It is important to note that severe asthma is asthma that can’t be controlled despite the correct use of prescribed high-dose regular preventer medicines. A small number of people may experience severe asthma and have symptoms which are not adequately controlled with high doses of treatment, and they may need additional treatments. For more information on the treatment of severe asthma visit the website. Asthma triggers cause your airways to narrow and lead to asthma symptoms. These triggers vary from person to person, but avoiding or managing them can help to control asthma. Read the National Asthma Council’s article on . You and your doctor will also put together an asthma action plan. This is a personalised set of instructions that includes a list of your usual asthma medications and doses, guidance on what to do in different situations (for example, if you have an asthma emergency), and your doctor’s contact details. — Preparing for an appointment? Use the for general tips on what to ask your GP or specialist. Asthma can’t be prevented entirely, but there are some practical ways to reduce the risk of an asthma attack and live well with asthma. Get vaccinated for influenza: flu and other respiratory viruses are common triggers for asthma. Manage any allergies: asthma and allergies are closely linked, so treating and avoiding or managing any allergy triggers will help with your asthma. Live smoke-free: quit if you smoke, and avoid any second-hand smoke (). Eat well: a helps you to maintain a healthy weight. Being makes asthma harder to manage. Care for yourself: and asthma are linked, so let a trusted friend or your doctor know if you have been feeling sad or , or don’t enjoy things as much as before. See your doctor regularly: asthma needs to be regularly assessed and managed, and your medication needs may change over time. Ensure your asthma action plan is up to date by checking in with your doctor regularly. Poorly-controlled asthma can have a negative effect on your quality of life. Complications may include: Taking your medications exactly as prescribed is important. If you feel that your asthma is affecting your quality of life, contact your doctor for a medicines review. About 1 in 2 Australian women with asthma find their symptoms worsen during . Do not stop taking your preventer medication while you’re pregnant. Taking prescribed medications is safer for you and your baby than having poorly-controlled asthma. Read more about . Experts are still trying to understand how may affect people with asthma.

6cd7d796-bac5-4870-8676-96119799d446,"An asthma attack occurs when the endothelial lining of the bronchial tubes becomes inflamed, leading to narrowing of the airways and restriction of the airflow into and out of the lungs. Some particular factors, known as triggers, are linked to the worsening of asthma symptoms and may increase difficulty breathing. Signs that indicate poorly controlled asthma, such as wheezing and difficulty breathing, should prompt intervention to improve symptoms and prevent progression to an acute asthma attack. During an attack, it can be very difficult for the individual to breathe and emergency medical help is often required to manage the symptoms. There are several triggers that are associated with worsening of asthma symptoms and the onset of an asthma attack, including: Exposure to allergens (e.g. pollen, dust, animal fur) Exposure to irritants (e.g. smoke, chemical fumes) Often people with asthma go through periods where their symptoms of asthma are more profound than usual, and their breathing may be somewhat inhibited, known as a flare-up. This commonly occurs after exposure to a trigger, such as when an individual has been sick with the flu.   The lung function can be measured with respiratory tests such as the peak expiratory flow (PEF) meter that indicates how fast the air can be exhaled from the lungs. Lower results than usual indicate that inflammation and narrowing of the airways have increased, making it more difficult for the air to pass through. The symptoms of an asthma attack may last for a varied length of time, depending on the cause and level of inflammation in the airways. In some cases, the symptoms may only last for a few minutes and resolve simultaneously but may last for hours or day. The patient should follow their asthma action plan that outlines the steps to be taken to manage a flare up and may require reliever medication to enable normal breathing. Children with asthma having fewer attacks amid the coronavirus pandemic, study says Wildfire smoke more harmful than other types of air pollution for people with asthma High levels of steroids put asthma patients at greater risk of serious side-effects An acute asthma attack occurs when the inflammation in the airways restricts the airways substantially and may be life-threatening in some cases. It is important for all individuals to have an understanding of these danger signs so that bystanders can recognise an asthma attack and seek the appropriate help. Inability to form full sentences due to shortness of breath The PEF measurement is likely to be significantly reduced but, in many cases, patients are unable to control their breathing significantly to perform the test. When someone is , it is crucial to maintain composure and follow the asthma action plan without causing the patient to become more stressed, which can worsen symptoms. Short-acting, rapid onset beta2-agonist medications, such as salbutamol, should be administered via inhalation to dilate the bronchi and allow the patient to breathe more easily. Anticholinergic medications can also be used to help relax the muscles in the airways. If the symptoms do not resolve with the administration of reliever medications, emergency medical aid is likely to be needed. While waiting for emergency help, administration of reliever medication should be continued at regular intervals to help reduce narrowing of the airways. http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/asthma-attack/basics/symptoms/con-20034148 http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs307/en/ https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/patientinstructions/000062.htm] Last Updated: Aug 23, 2018 Yolanda graduated with a Bachelor of Pharmacy at the University of South Australia and has experience working in both Australia and Italy.

91bb0ae9-7a9a-4e42-a539-ad9a3e356dab,"Asthma is characterized by repeated episodes of coughing, wheezing, chest tightness and shortness of breath. Although there is no known cure for asthma, symptoms of asthma can be brought under control with the help of effective asthma management techniques. Effective management of asthma involves closely following the asthma treatment plan, adherence to medications as directed by the physician, and avoiding factors that trigger asthma symptoms. The patient needs to play an active role in asthma management by taking medicines on time as prescribed, monitoring symptoms regularly and discussing them with the doctor, clarifying queries related to prescribed medicines and their side effects, learning how to use inhalers and peak flow meters, and keeping the doctor informed about the changes or progress in your asthma. Lung function tests give a fairly good idea of the level of control of asthma. They are carried out using a spirometer or peak flow meter. In peak flow testing, a hand-held device known as a peak flow meter is used at home to measure peak expiratory flow which indicates how fast the lungs can expel air. Peak flow readings are noted down at regular intervals and analyzed to see changes in lung function over a period of time. A spirometer is used at the clinic to measure the amount of air lungs can exhale after a deep breath. This reading is called forced expiratory volume, which is a direct indicator of lung function and when taken over time it can give an idea about changes in lung health. Routinely monitoring symptoms, examining lung function and adjusting treatment plans will help significantly in asthma control. Write down the symptoms such as wheezing, coughing, and chest discomfort in a diary whenever possible. Also note the frequency of use of quick-relief inhalers and any absence at work or school due to asthma. Symptoms during physical activity and any other triggers such as dust or pollen should also be recorded. High levels of steroids put asthma patients at greater risk of serious side-effects Proactive interventions associated with reduced healthcare utilization, costs for children with asthma Children with asthma having fewer attacks amid the coronavirus pandemic, study says Controller medications are used to treat symptoms of asthma. These include inhaled corticosteroids such as fluticasone, budesonide, and ciclesonide. Combination inhalers are also available and contain an inhaled corticosteroid along with a long-acting beta-agonist, which controls symptoms by opening up the airways. These beta agonists can cause side effects in some people and should never be used as the only therapy for asthma. Hence, they are usually used along with corticosteroids. Examples of combination medications include fluticasone and salmeterol, budesonide and formoterol, and mometasone and formoterol. Quick-relief medications such as short-acting beta-agonists help rapidly relieve symptoms by opening up the airways . They can also be taken before starting an exercise session. Examples of short-acting beta-agonists are inhaled bronchodilators such as albuterol, levalbuterol, and pirbuterol. Quick-relief medications should not replace controller medications and more frequent use of quick-relief inhalers indicates that it is time for a physician visit. Severe symptoms caused by acute asthma flare ups can be treated using oral and intravenous corticosteroids such as methylprednisolone and prednisone. These drugs should not be used on a long-term basis as they can cause unwanted side effects. Asthma medications need to be continued even during pregnancy, keeping in mind the health of the mother as well as the baby. Asthmatic people are advised to be vaccinated at regular intervals as they are at high risk of developing complications from respiratory diseases such as influenza and pneumonia. People with asthma can closely work with their doctors and develop a customized treatment plan, with the help of which they can keep symptoms under control and improve their quality of life. https://www.asthma.org.uk/advice/understanding-asthma/types/severe-asthma/ http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/asthma/in-depth/asthma-treatment/art-20044284 http://www.aaaai.org/conditions-and-treatments/asthma http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/asthma Last Updated: Feb 26, 2019 Susha has a Bachelor of Science (B.Sc.) degree in Chemistry and Master of Science (M.Sc) degree in Biochemistry from the University of Calicut, India.

Now that the vaccine for COVID-19 is approved for use, what does that mean for the general public? Remember, it may take weeks or months for the vaccine to be available to you depending upon your individual risk factors, vaccine supply and the most up-to-date guidance provided by the Center for Disease Control (CDC) and state health department. The vaccine will be administered in phases over time, first to individuals at greatest risk, and over time, to individuals at lesser risk. Please be patient as the state and national vaccination plans roll out and delivery vaccine in phases to your community.  It is important to continue to wear a mask when in public or around people outside of your immediate family and household members. It is also important to continue social distancing. While the vaccine provides significant protection for vaccinated individuals from getting COVID-19 disease, it is still possible for vaccinated individuals to transmit the virus to others and no vaccination is 100% effective. Social distancing is still important until a majority of the population are vaccinated, and until more is known about who can still spread the virus. Protect yourself by removing germs from your hands with frequent and thorough handwashing. Getting one dose of the vaccine does not immediately protect you. After the second dose, it will take an additional two to three weeks for you to be protected. Watch for side effects such as fever, muscle aches and fatigue, and continue masking, social distancing and handwashing until a majority of the population are vaccinated. COVID-19 vaccines may protect against severe infection, but not necessarily prevent mild or asymptomatic infection. It’s possible that an infected person could still spread the virus, which can put others nearby at risk. Science is still learning about the virus, the disease and about the vaccine’s effectiveness. Until more is known about who can still spread the virus and until most of the population has been vaccinated, practice basic safety – mask-up, practice social distancing, wash your hands often.

Anticoagulation in COVID Pro Con Debate with Drs Todd Bull and Eric Schmidt “We’re going be stronger”: A Frontline Physician’s View of COVID-19 National Jewish Health is providing the Pfizer vaccine to members of the public who are 70 years of age or older. We are following the prioritization guidance set by the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment (CDPHE) for the State of Colorado. We are currently reaching out to a randomized list of qualified patients individually by phone and email to schedule appointments when we have vaccine available. We have also opened an for members of the public who meet the  for Phase 1A and the first half of Phase 1B, including those who are 70 years of age and older. Once appointments are filled, we will close the online system until we have additional supplies of vaccine. Thank you for your patience in this process. If you would like to receive updates about when and how to make an appointment for COVID-19 vaccine, . This is NOT a sign-up for vaccine, it is for information only. Appointments for Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccines are now available for online booking , following Colorado’s state-guided phases of vaccination.  Get the answers you need from our experts in infection prevention and immunology.  The first two vaccines, by Pfizer and Moderna, are mRNA vaccines. Late-stage clinical trials have indicated that both are safe and highly effective. Vaccines expose us to pieces of either a bacteria or a virus, which causes our bodies to recognize a potential threat and to mount an immune response. The goal with a vaccine is to help the body prepare for an actual infection, so it is ready to rapidly and effectively eliminate the SARS-CoV-2 virus when exposed to it. There are different types of vaccines. The Pfizer and Moderna vaccines are called messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines. The mRNA in the vaccines carry genetic instructions which cells in the body use to make copies of viral proteins. Once your cells make those proteins, your immune system will make the antibodies that bind to the protein, disable the virus, and protect you from getting sick or as sick from this virus. How do we know that the vaccine is safe and effective? The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) reviews all vaccines for safety before allowing them to be administered to the public. Additionally, The Advisory Committee for Immunization Practices (ACIP), a group of medical and public health experts that advises the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), also assesses the safety and effectiveness of vaccines. Clinical trials of the vaccines lead to an understanding of safety and effectiveness. With the two early vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna, preliminary data suggests they are both about 95% effective. That means that under controlled conditions there were about 95 percent fewer cases of COVID-19 in the group of people who got the vaccine compared to the group of people who got the placebo. How soon will someone be protected after taking the vaccine? With the two mRNA vaccines, it is estimated that immunity develops around two to three weeks after completing the second shot in the series, but each vaccine works a little differently and every individual responds a little differently. Both the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines are a two shot series, and it is important that an individual have both shots in order to confer immunity.  Most of the COVID-19 vaccines currently in phase 3 clinical trials in the U.S. require two (2) consecutive shots, three or four weeks apart, for the vaccine series. Future COVID-19 vaccines may require only one shot. Currently, Pfizer’s vaccine requires two doses in the vaccine series to be given three weeks apart. If you are in a group that is currently eligible to receive the vaccine and you are not feeling well, it is recommended that you wait until you are feeling better to get the vaccine. If you have symptoms and/or signs of respiratory infection, evaluation and testing from health care resources in your community is recommended.

But as soon as children get back to their classrooms after the school summer break and start swapping germs, the incidence of respiratory infections rises sharply. Colds due to rhinovirus peak in September, with other viral infections also increasing. While this poses a problem for all children, those with asthma are particularly at risk of more severe illness. Viral infections cause more than 80 percent of asthma “attacks” (or exacerbations) in children and more than half of all asthma attacks in adults. Asthma attacks requiring hospitalization are so frequent in September that the ""September epidemic of asthma exacerbations"" is a recognized phenomenon. A quarter of all children hospitalized for an asthma attack are admitted in September. Below are several tips to help parents of children with asthma prepare for the new school year. Ask your doctor for a written for the school. This plan should include what medicine to use to treat asthma symptoms and changes in peak flow zones, what medication to use as a pretreatment before exercise, emergency telephone numbers and a list of things that make your child's asthma worse. Plan a meeting with school staff before or in the beginning of the school year. It is helpful to have the school nurse, health aide, teacher and physical education teacher at the meeting. Your child also can be involved in the meeting. Take the written Asthma Action Plan to the meeting. Review the Asthma Action Plan, use of the , medicines and things that make your child's asthma worse. Keep a peak flow meter, spacer and rescue medicine at school for your child. Make sure the rescue medicine has not passed its expiration date. Takes these items home at the end of each school year. Make sure your child has a pretreatment for gym class or other physical activities, especially outdoors in cold weather. Asthma should not keep your child from participating in an off-site field trip. Be prepared to take medicines along to use for flare-ups. Studies have shown that asthma medicines typically don't cause concentration problems. However, if a child who receives high doses of medicine during an episode may experience side effects, such as restlessness and trouble concentrating. Continue talking with your child and school staff about managing asthma at school on a regular basis, even if everything is fine at school. Talk with the school staff if your child misses school and assignments. Talk with your child's doctor about when it is okay to stay home from school because of asthma or illness. Mild asthma symptoms can usually be handled at school but there are a number of factors (what triggered the asthma, the stability of peak flows, fever, how much medicine your child is taking, etc.) to consider when deciding whether to keep your child at home.

Medical Author: Medical Editor: is a chronic (long-term, ongoing) inflammation of the breathing passages () of the . The inflammation irritates the , causing breathing problems. Most people with have sudden attacks or periods of bothersome or severe symptoms separated by periods of mild symptoms or no symptoms at all. is an inflammatory reaction that is triggered by external factors or specific situations. When a person with asthma is exposed to one of his or her triggers, the inflammation worsens and symptoms ensue. Occupational asthma is a breathing (respiratory) disease caused by exposure to a trigger in the workplace. A trigger is an external factor or condition in the body that causes the asthma to occur or worsen. The list of known triggers is long and varied. Occupational asthma can occur in almost any line of work or any work environment, including offices, stores, hospitals, and medical facilities. Triggers of asthma include contaminants in the air, such as smoke, chemicals, vapors (gases), fumes, dust, or other particles; respiratory infections, such as and (); allergens in the air, such as molds, animal dander, and pollen; extremes of temperature or humidity; and emotional excitement or . Aggravation of preexisting asthma: This is by far the most common type. Over time, with regular exposure, you develop hypersensitivity to the trigger. With this underlying asthma, continued exposure to the trigger causes attacks. Immunologic asthma is characterized by a delay in the onset of symptoms. Nonimmunologic asthma seems to occur after single or multiple exposures to irritant material. Mixed forms can include components of the three other mechanisms described above. Once the attack is triggered, the airways begin to swell and tighten (bronchospasm) and secrete large amounts of mucus. The swelling and extra mucus partially block, or obstruct, the airways. This makes it more difficult to push air out of your lungs (exhale). If this occurs for a period of time, the inflammation can result in abnormal airflow obstruction even when not having an attack. When lung function no longer returns to normal after years of chronic inflammation, asthma evolves into a new class of lung disease referred to as (). Asthma cannot be cured, but it can be controlled by medication. You have a better chance of controlling your asthma if it is diagnosed early and treatment begun right away. With proper treatment, you can have fewer and less severe attacks. Without treatment, you will have more frequent and more severe attacks. You can even die from a severe . Early recognition and avoidance of the asthma trigger is particularly important in occupational asthma. Because people spend so much time at work, they tend to have extensive exposure to their trigger by the time the cause of the symptoms is recognized as asthma. The more time you spend exposed to your trigger, the more likely you are to have permanent lung inflammation and airway hypersensitivity. Occupational asthma is the most common work-related lung disease in developed countries. In some people with asthma in the United States, the condition is at least partly related to their work. Asthma has two components: the underlying chronic inflammation and the periodic attacks. We do not know for certain what causes the underlying inflammation. What we do know is that the tendency to have asthma runs in families and that some people are born with the tendency. We do know what causes asthma attacks: exposure to a trigger. The attack is similar in many ways to an . An is a response by the body's immune system to an ""invader."" That invader can be a substance or anything that the body senses as ""different."" When the cells of the immune system sense an invader, they set off a series of reactions that help fight off the invader. It is this series of reactions that causes the production of mucus and bronchospasms. These responses cause the symptoms of an asthma attack. In occupational asthma, the trigger is a substance or condition in the workplace that causes asthma symptoms. Most of these substances and conditions are very common and are not normally considered hazardous. Although these substances and conditions can be encountered in almost any workplace, occupational asthma is most common in workers in the following industries and jobs: Triggers that are often associated with a delay in the onset of symptoms (latency period) come in two groups (characterized by the size of the molecules involved). These are either high molecular weight or low molecular weight agents. The high molecular weight agents tend to be proteins, and polysaccharides. Examples of these agents include a variety of enzymes (used in the baking and food industry), cereals (also seen in the baking industries), animal waste and shellfish (found in laboratory technicians, farmers, food processors), and latex (found in health-care workers). Low molecular agents often have a shorter onset of symptoms and usually do not include nasal and eye irritation. Some examples of these agents include anhydrides (often used in plastics, dyes, and epoxy), metals (used in refineries, electroplating, welding), diisocyanates (found in plastics, spray paints, foundries), specific wood dusts like red cedar (found in wood carvers, furniture makers, sawmill workers), and cleaning agents (found in maintenance workers health-care professionals). Not everyone exposed to these conditions will develop asthma. Some people are more susceptible to asthma than others. Also, exposure to some of these substances can produce chronic lung diseases other than asthma. Risk factors for occupational asthma include the following: If asthma is not treated, the airways gradually develop a pattern of overreacting, hence, the alternative term for asthma, reactive airways disease. Common, everyday conditions, such as smoke or air, may cause asthma symptoms. In fact, it is part of the normal human condition for a small degree of bronchospasm to occur when the airways are exposed to cold or dry air. Normally, the body's upper airway warms and moistens the air to prevent this from occurring. In most people with occupational asthma, the symptoms appear a short time after beginning work and subside after leaving work. Many have no symptoms or milder symptoms on days they do not work. The symptoms return when they return to work. In some, the symptoms worsen gradually over the work week, go away over the weekend, and return when the new work week starts. In others, the symptoms are slow to develop and may not be noticed until after leaving work for the day. This pattern makes it difficult to recognize a workplace trigger. In the later stages of the disease, after long-term regular exposure, symptoms may not go away after you leave the workplace. These are the most common symptoms of occupational asthma. Most people do not have all these symptoms. symptoms that occur at work but get better away from work also may be a sign of irritants in the air that could provoke asthma symptoms. The following symptoms could occur: If you have asthma symptoms at work that get better away from work, make an appointment with your health-care provider promptly. If you have occupational asthma, you should have an action plan worked out in advance with your health-care provider. This plan should include instructions on what to do when an asthma attack occurs, when to call the health-care provider, and when to go to a hospital emergency department. Although asthma is a reversible disease, and treatments are available, people can die from a severe asthma attack. If you are having an asthma attack and have severe shortness of breath or are unable to reach your health-care provider in a short period of time, you must go to the nearest hospital emergency department. Do not drive yourself to the hospital. Have a friend or family member drive. If you are alone, call 911 immediately for emergency medical transport. If you have had asthma symptoms and are seeking medical care afterward, your health-care provider will ask questions and perform tests to pinpoint the cause of the symptoms. Proper diagnosis is essential to ensure that the most appropriate treatment is given. Your health-care provider should confirm and document that you have asthma before beginning treatment. You should undergo breathing tests to determine the condition of your airways. Spirometry: The spirometer is a device that measures how much air you can exhale and how forcefully you can breathe out. Spirometry is a good way to see how much your breathing is impaired during an attack. This test must be done in the medical office; you may on a treadmill or stationary bicycle or perform the tests before and after using an inhaled medication. Peak flow meter: This is another way of measuring how forcefully you can breathe out during an attack. This device is small and portable and can be used ""in the field."" This device can be very helpful. It is inexpensive and monitoring can be done at various times of the day to help detect any patterns associated with the reactive airways process. These tests may be done at the workplace to determine how your airways react to the work environment. The tests are performed before you go to the workplace and then after you have been in the workplace for some time, and the results are compared. Many employers have a health worker at the workplace who can carry out these tests. The company's representative often will work with you and your health-care provider to determine what is causing your symptoms. The company should cooperate in evaluating workplace exposures as possible triggers of asthma. There is no blood test than can pinpoint the cause of asthma. Your blood may be checked for signs of an infection that might be contributing to the symptoms. In severe attacks, it may be necessary to sample blood from an artery to determine exactly how much oxygen and carbon dioxide are present in your body. A may also be taken. This is mostly to rule out other conditions that can cause similar symptoms. Asthma Pictures: Inflammatory Disorder of the Airways Treatment in occupational asthma depends on how severe the asthma is. Prevention is always the first choice of treatment. If your asthma is not very severe, prevention may be enough to avoid symptoms. For some people, just avoiding exposure to the trigger is possible and is enough to prevent symptoms; for others, a combination of avoiding the trigger and medication can prevent symptoms. People with severe occupational asthma may need to consider changing to a different job or a different line of work. To have as few medication side effects as possible Work with your health-care provider to develop an action plan. Follow your treatment plan closely to avoid asthma attacks. If you do have an asthma attack, the action plan will help you control the attack and make the decision about when to seek medical care. Since occupational asthma is a chronic disease, you will probably require treatment for a very long time, maybe even for the rest of your life. The best way to improve your condition and live your life on your terms is to learn all you can about your asthma and what you can do to make it better. Become a partner with your health-care provider and his or her support staff. Use the resources they can offer - information, education, and expertise - to help yourself. Follow the treatment recommendations of your health-care provider. Understand your treatment. If you are taking medication, know what each drug does and how it is used. Promptly report any changes or worsening of your symptoms. Report any side effects you are having with your medications. Precautions that may help reduce your chance of having an asthma attack include the following: Avoid the trigger. In many cases, this doesn't mean you have to quit your job or change your occupation, although you may want to consider that. Most employers will work with you to reduce or remove your exposure to the trigger in the workplace. If you should have an asthma attack, move to the next step of your action plan. Keep the following tips in mind: Take only the medications your health care provider has prescribed for your asthma. Take them as directed. If the medication is not working, do not take more than you have been directed to take. Overusing can be dangerous. Do not take medicine. These medicines do not help asthma and may cause unwanted side effects. Do not use nonprescription inhalers. These contain a very short-acting inhaler that may not last long enough to relieve an asthma attack and may cause unwanted side effects. These contain a very short-acting inhaler that may not last long enough to relieve an asthma attack and may cause unwanted side effects. (Bayer) and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, such as (), can cause asthma to worsen in certain individuals. These medications should not be taken without the advice of your health-care provider. Do not take any nonprescription preparations, herbs, or , even if they are completely ""natural,"" without talking to your health-care provider first. Some of these may have unwanted side effects or interfere with your medications. Be prepared to go on to the next step of your action plan if necessary. If you think your medication is not working, let your health-care provider know right away. The most important part of treating occupational asthma is avoiding the trigger. Most people assume that means quitting their job and changing their occupation, but this is not always the case. Many employers will work with you to reduce or stop your exposure. This may mean changing the way things are done in the workplace overall or it may mean providing extra protection for you. It may mean moving you to a different location in the workplace. Because acceptable solutions often can be found, many asthma specialists recommend not quitting your job until all possibilities have been exhausted. If your asthma is very severe or cannot be controlled in the workplace, however, you may have to leave your job right away. Once the diagnosis of asthma has been confirmed, you may be started on a regimen of medications. Asthma medications are of the following two types: Controller medications: These are for long-term control of persistent asthma. They help to keep airways open and reduce the inflammation in the lungs that underlies asthma attacks. You take these every day whether you are having symptoms or not. Rescue medications: These are for short-term control of asthma attacks. You take these only when you are having symptoms or are more likely to have an attack; for example, when you have an infection in your respiratory tract. Your treatment plan will also include the following: Awareness of your trigger and avoiding the trigger as much as possible Recommendations for coping with asthma in your daily life Regular follow-up visits to your health-care provider to monitor your condition, whether you are on medication or not Together, you and your health-care practitioner will develop an action plan for you in case of asthma attack. The action plan will include the following: What to do if the rescue medication does not work right away When to go directly to a hospital emergency department Your health-care practitioner may want you to use a peak flow meter regularly, at least at first, to monitor how being at work affects your airway. The peak flow meter is a simple, inexpensive device that measures how forcefully you are able to exhale. This is a good way to help you and your health-care provider assess the severity of your asthma. Ask your health-care practitioner or an assistant to show you how to use the peak flow meter. He or she should watch you use it until you can do it correctly. Keep a record of the results. Over time, your health-care practitioner may be able to use this record to improve your medications, reducing dose or side effects. Peak flow measures fall just before an asthma attack. If you use your peak flow meter regularly, you may be able to predict when you are going to have an attack. It can also be used to check your response to rescue medications. Controller medications are for long-term control of persistent asthma. They help to keep airways open and reduce the inflammation in the lungs that underlies asthma attacks. Controller medications include long-acting beta-agonists and anti-inflammatory medicines. Long-acting beta-antagonists: This class of drugs is chemically related to adrenaline, a hormone produced by the adrenal glands. Inhaled long-acting beta-agonists work to keep breathing passages open for 12 hours or longer. They relax the muscles of the breathing passages, dilating the passages and decreasing the resistance to exhaled airflow, making it easier to breathe. They also may help to reduce inflammation, but they have no effect on the underlying cause of the asthma attack. Side effects include rapid heartbeat and shakiness. (Serevent) and (Foradil) are long-acting beta-agonists. Anti-inflammatory medicines minimize the inflammation that underlies an acute asthma attack. Generally these medications do not help during an attack, but you should continue to take them during an attack. Inhaled corticosteroids are the main class of medications in this group. The inhaled act locally by concentrating their effects directly within the breathing passages, with very few side effects outside of the lungs. Beclomethasone (Vancenase, Beclovent), fluticasone (Flovent), (Pulmicort), and triamcinolone (Azmacort) are examples of inhaled corticosteroids. Other anti-inflammatory drugs used to treat asthma include oral steroids, leukotriene inhibitors, methylxanthines, and . For more information about these medications, see Asthma and Understanding Asthma Medications. Rescue medications are bronchodilators. They quickly open the airways closed off by swelling, bronchospasm, and mucus. These are taken after an asthma attack has already begun. These do not take the place of anti-inflammatory drugs. Do not stop taking your anti-inflammatory drug(s) during an asthma attack. Short-acting beta2-agonists are the most commonly used rescue medications. This class of drugs is chemically related to adrenaline, a hormone produced by the adrenal glands. Inhaled beta2-agonists work rapidly (within minutes) to open the breathing passages. They relax the muscles of the breathing passages, dilating the passages and decreasing the resistance to exhaled airflow, making it easier to breathe. They do not reduce inflammation and have no effect on the underlying cause of the asthma attack. Side effects include and shakiness. (, , ProAir) is the most frequently used beta2-agonist medication. Anticholinergics are another class of drugs useful as rescue medications during asthma attacks. Inhaled anticholinergic drugs open the breathing passages, similar to the action of the beta2-agonists. Inhaled anticholinergics take slightly longer than beta2-agonists to achieve their effect, but they last longer than the beta2-agonists. An anticholinergic drug is often used together with a beta2-agonist drug to produce a greater effect than either drug can achieve by itself. bromide (Atrovent) is the inhaled anticholinergic drug currently used as a rescue asthma medication. Tiotropium (), a long-acting anticholinergic, is now also being used as a maintenance medicine in more severe cases of asthma. Combination therapy which includes a long-acting beta2 agonist and inhaled corticosteroid available in a single inhaler is now commonly used in asthma (for example, Advair, , Dulera). Asthma is a long-term disease, but it can be managed. Your active involvement in treating this disease is vitally important. See your health-care practitioner regularly according to the recommended schedule. By following these steps, you can help minimize the frequency and severity of your asthma attacks. At your follow-up visits, your health-care practitioner will review how you have been doing. He or she will ask you about frequency and severity of attacks, use of rescue medications, and peak flow measurements. Lung functions tests will be done to see how your lungs are responding to your treatment. This is a good time to discuss medication side effects or any problems you are having with your treatment. Treatment in occupational asthma is focused on preventing or minimizing asthma attacks. The main strategy for doing this is reducing or stopping exposure to the trigger. Work with your employer to ""clean up"" the workplace. You or your health-care provider should be able to arrange for measurement of air quality in the workplace. Your employer should provide protective gear, such as masks or respirators, to avoid exposure to the trigger. Careless use or spills of respiratory irritants, inappropriate ventilation, and improper protective gear contribute to the occurrence of asthma in the workplace. These problems can be remedied. If these measures don't reduce your symptoms, talk to your employer about retraining for a different position that would not involve exposure to your trigger. Most people with occupational asthma are able to control their condition if they work together with a health-care provider and follow their treatment regimen carefully. People who do not seek medical care or do not follow an appropriate treatment plan are likely to experience worsening of their asthma and deterioration in their ability to function normally. Asthma is a disease that affects the breathing passages, or airways, of the lungs. Asthma is a chronic (ongoing, long-term) inflammatory disease that causes difficulty breathing. When an exacerbation or ""attack"" of asthma takes place, the inflammation in the airways causes the lining of the breathing passages to swell. This swelling narrows the diameter of the airway, eventually to a point where it is hard to exchange enough air to breathe comfortably. This is when coughing, wheezing, and the sensation of distress start. Medically reviewed by James E.

However, we know that children are more likely to develop asthma if they have allergies or if one or both of their parents have asthma or . Asthma can develop at any age. The amount of difficulty a child has with asthma often changes with age. The airways of an infant/toddler can become obstructed more easily because of their smaller size. This age group can be prone to more noticeable symptoms. As the child’s airways grow larger, these symptoms may decrease. Most children do not experience long-term physical effects of asthma. However, chronic and poorly-controlled asthma may have a slowing effect on growth and may result in reduced lung function as an adult. As with any chronic illness, there may be an emotional impact on children with asthma. Emotions such as anger, fear, inferiority, depression and guilt may be experienced. The first step in diagnosing asthma is a good evaluation. In many cases, a diagnosis of asthma is made based upon your child’s history and symptoms at the time of evaluation. With a younger child, recurrent episodes may be experienced before an actual diagnosis of asthma is made. The family history and the child’s allergy history should also be considered, as these increase the child’s chances of developing asthma. Your child’s doctor may have your child do a number of tests to evaluate breathing. These may include: Your child’s doctor may order other tests based on the history and physical exam. Many children see their family doctor or pediatrician for asthma care. You and your child’s doctor may choose to have your child seen by a specialist, such as a pediatric allergist or pediatric pulmonologist (lung specialist). We recommend this if any one of the following occurs: Several visits to urgent care or emergency room or hospitalization during the last year Conditions that complicate asthma such as chronic sinusitis, nasal polyps or vocal cord dysfunction No matter what type of doctor you establish a partnership with to provide your child’s asthma care, it is important to ask the following: What is the doctor’s overall philosophy about asthma and ? Does the doctor or office staff take time to explain what is happening with your child, provide education and answer your questions? Will the doctor work with you to develop an to treat an asthma episode? In evaluating your child’s progress, remember that asthma is a chronic condition that will change in course from time to time. If you feel that your child is not making progress with his or her current treatment, let your child’s doctor know your concerns. If things are not going well, ask your child’s doctor about seeing a specialist. You should not feel embarrassed about asking for another opinion.

5d604ff8-9278-4bec-96c8-9d861d58f76f,"Asthma is an inflammatory condition of the smaller lung airways, which prevents easy breathing. The inflammation is a result of an exaggerated allergic reaction to environmental substances like dust mites, chemicals, dander, mold or pollen. On the other hand, non-allergic asthma is not dependent on allergy, but may be precipitated by other factors like exercise, cold, heartburn, smoke and strong smells. An asthma attack is characterized by wheezing of varying severity, a tight feeling within the chest caused by the narrowing of the smaller airways, shortness of breath, and coughing. These symptoms are due to tightening of the muscle in the airway walls, and swelling of the mucous lining, besides abnormally increased mucus production.  Symptoms differ between individuals, over a wide range of severity. Asthma often first manifests during childhood. Seasonal asthma is typically allergic asthma. Some common triggers include dust mites, pollen in the air which is also related to hay fever. Many researchers have recognized that asthma symptoms have a seasonal variation. In many parts of the US, for instance, there are many more cases in early fall, coinciding with the opening of schools, and a second peak often occurs in late fall. Midwinter peaks are well known, and in children below two years of age these are attributed to viral infections like respiratory syncytial virus, or influenza virus. Another smaller peak occurs in spring, with rates then declining irregularly to hit a nadir in summer. Adults, however, tend to show asthma peaks towards the end of the year. Why are asthma exacerbations in children, also known as asthma attacks,  more common during the fall? Scientists think children are  have a higher exposure to viral infections and allergens during this season as schools also reopen around this time. However, rhinoviruses and other viral pathogens are known to provoke flare-ups throughout the year, rather than only in fall or spring. People with asthma who also have allergies are at a significantly higher risk of asthma exacerbations. The presence of allergic inflammation is associated with high levels of immunoglobulin E (IgE), an antibody specifically linked to allergic phenomena. When this antibody is present at high levels, as in allergic states, viral infection is much more likely to result in serious asthma attacks. High levels of steroids put asthma patients at greater risk of serious side-effects Researchers use urine test to identify and verify a patient's type of asthma Researchers find a better way to block asthma triggers Some pertinent studies show that patients who are exposed to more dust mites and pollen in the autumn, which can cause allergic reactions in susceptible people, experience more flare-ups at this time. Similarly, more attacks occur during hay fever season (spring and early summer) in asthma patients who are sensitive to grass. Seasonal asthma is thus linked to allergen exposures at various periods of the year. An understanding of this process will potentially help the development of  preventive measures. In fact, one study used an anti-IgE monoclonal antibody to dramatically reduce seasonal asthma peaks in children living in an inner-city region, supporting the theory that allergen exposure contributes to asthma symptoms. Asthma diagram as a healthy and unhealthy bronchial tube with a constricted breathing problem caused by respiratory muscle tightening. Image Credit: Lightspring / Shutterstock Climate variation in different geographical regions also plays a role in seasonal asthma exacerbations. In cold weather children spend more time indoors and are therefore exposed to increased levels of pests, mold and dust mites. In summer, despite the heat and humidity, the absolute exposure to such allergens is likely to be lower and this  may account for the widespread drop in asthma during this season. Similarly, ‘thunderstorm asthma’, which occurs once in about five years in some locations, may be due to the rapid increase in grass and mold allergens coupled with high rainfall and humidity at this time, which affects susceptible people. People with asthma who are sensitized to grass, birch pollen and a type of fungi called Alternaria experience modified seasonal patterns. Grass sensitivity is linked to increased asthma attacks during summer in this population, when other asthma patients typically have the lowest number of attacks. Similarly, birch pollen exposure peaks in May-August in northern Europe, but the peak is much shorter and more intense in the south of the continent. It is thought that the antigenic nature of the pollen may be more important than the absolute amount of pollen in the air. The pattern of seasonal asthma is also modified by air pollution and tobacco smoke. An algorithm that accounts for all these risk factors may help predict asthma flare-ups in children on a seasonal basis, but requires more real-time observation of environmental and climatic factors in association with actual patients. For optimal application, asthma control measures must consider the time of year, local environment and geographic region, along with individual-specific risk factors. This will help doctors recommend appropriate preventive and treatment measures at peak times for children with asthma. More research is needed to understand how environmental exposures correlate with seasonal asthma peaks to help predict and prevent serious asthma attacks at certain seasons. Nhlbi.nih.gov. Asthma.

997a54ab-bffb-44fc-839a-6a502968c91e,"Electronic alert on general practitioners can reduce excessive prescribing of short-acting asthma reliever An automatic, electronic alert on general practitioners' (GPs) computer screens can help to prevent excessive prescribing of short-acting asthma reliever medication, according to research presented at the 'virtual' European Respiratory Society International Congress. The alert pops up when GPs open the medical records for a patient who has been issued with three prescriptions for short-acting reliever inhalers, such as salbutamol, within a three-month period. It suggests the patient should have an asthma review to assess symptoms and improve asthma control. Short-acting beta2-agonists (SABAs), usually described as blue inhalers, afford short-term relief of asthma symptoms by expanding the airways, but do not deal with the underlying inflammatory cause. ""Excessive use of reliever inhalers such as salbutamol is an indicator of poorly controlled asthma and a risk factor for asthma attacks. It has also been implicated in asthma-related deaths. Yet, despite national and international asthma guidelines, excessive prescribing of short-acting beta2-agonists persists,"" said Dr Shauna McKibben, an honorary research fellow at the Institute of Population Health Sciences Queen Mary University of London (QMUL), UK, and clinical nurse specialist in asthma and allergy at Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust, London, who led the research. ""This research aimed to identify and target excessive SABA prescribing using an electronic alert in GPs' computer systems to identify at-risk patients, change prescribing behaviour and improve asthma management."" The study of 18,244 asthma patients in 132 general practices in north-east London found a 6% reduction in the excessive prescribing of reliever inhalers in the 12 months following the alert first appearing on patients' records. In addition, three months after the alert, asthma reviews increased by 12%, within six months after the alert, repeat prescribing of SABAs reduced by 5% and asthma exacerbations requiring treatment with oral steroids reduced by 8%. The alert to identify excessive SABA prescribing was introduced in 2015 on GPs' computer systems that used EMIS clinical software. At the time of the research EMIS was used by almost all general practices in north-east London, and 56% of English practices used it by 2017 [2]. Dr McKibben analysed data on SABA prescribing for patients in all practices in the north-east London boroughs of City and Hackney, Tower Hamlets and Newham between 2015 and 2016. She compared these with excessive SABA prescribing between 2013 to 2014, before the alert was introduced. She said: ""The most important finding is the small but potentially clinically significant reduction in SABA prescribing in the 12 months after the alert. This, combined with the other results, suggests that the alert prompts a review of patients who may have poor asthma control. An asthma review facilitates the assessment of SABA use and is an important opportunity to improve asthma management."" COVID-19 pandemic drives asthma patients to use telemedicine ACAAI releases guidance related to risk of allergic reactions to Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine Children with asthma having fewer attacks amid the coronavirus pandemic, study says Dr McKibben also asked a sample of GPs, receptionists and nurses in general practice about their thoughts on the alert. ""The alert was viewed as a catalyst for asthma review; however, the provision of timely review was challenging and response to the alert was dependent on local practice resources and clinical priorities,"" she said. A limitation of the research was that the alert assumed that only one SABA inhaler was issued per prescription, when often two at a time may be issued. ""Therefore, excessive SABA prescribing and the subsequent reduction in prescribing following the alert may be underestimated,"" said Dr McKibben. She continued: ""Excessive SABA use is only one indicator for poor asthma control but the risks are not well understood by patients and are often overlooked by healthcare professionals. Further research into the development and robust evaluation of tools to support primary care staff in the management of people with asthma is essential to improve asthma control and reduce hospital admissions."" The study's findings are now being used to support and inform the REAL-HEALTH Respiratory initiative, a Barts Charity funded three-year programme with the clinical effectiveness group at QMUL. The initiative provides general practices with EMIS IT tools to support the identification of patients with high-risk asthma. This includes an electronic alert for excessive SABA prescribing and an asthma prescribing tool to identify patients with poor asthma control who may be at risk of hospital admission. Daiana Stolz, who was not involved in the research, is the European Respiratory Society Education Council Chair and Professor of Respiratory Medicine and a leading physician at the University Hospital Basel, Switzerland. She said: ""This study shows how a relatively simple intervention, an electronic alert popping up on GPs' computers when they open a patient's records, can prompt a review of asthma medication and can lead to a reduction in excessive prescribing of short-acting asthma relievers and better asthma control."" However, the fact that general practices often struggled to provide a timely asthma review in a period before the COVID-19 pandemic, suggests that far more resources need to be made available to primary care, particularly in this pandemic period.""

Collapsed Lung (Pneumothorax) Symptoms, Causes, Types, Treatments, Surgery, and Outcome Topic Guide : A collapsed lung or pneumothorax is a condition in which the space between the wall of the chest cavity, the as a result all or a portion of the lung collapses. Types of pneumothorax include tension and simple. Causes of pneumothorax include spontaneous, traumatic, disease and related. Pneumothorax is a life-threatening emergency. Medical care should be sought immediately. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a severe lung condition caused by trauma, sepsis, pancreatitis, aspiration, drug overdose, and massive blood transfusion. Symptoms include: shortness of breath, anxiety, agitation, and fever. Treatment is generally ICU care in a hospital with antibiotics and oxygen treatments. There is no cure for ARDS. Asthma is a disease that affects the breathing passages of the lungs (bronchioles). Asthma may be caused by genes and environmental factors. Asthma causes wheezing, shortness of breath, and other symptoms. Treatment includes avoidance of triggers and medications to control and prevent symptoms. Experiencing an asthma attack during pregnancy may deprive the fetus of oxygen, so it's important to continue taking the asthma medication that you took before becoming pregnant, especially if your asthma was well controlled. Though it's impossible to predict how pregnancy may affect your asthma, it's important to note that your asthma can still be controlled during pregnancy. Asthma is a disease marked by inflammation of the airways that cause difficulty breathing. Ther are millions who suffer from this chronic disease, and this article covers some of their frequently asked questions (FAQs). Children account for 47.8% of asthma-related visits to the emergency department. Asthma symptoms include wheezing, coughing, and chest tightness. Treatment focuses on managing the child's symptoms and preventing future asthma attacks with medicines that provide the best results with the fewest side effects. Bronchiectasis is a condition in which the bronchial tubes of the lung become damaged. Inflammation from infection or other causes destroys the smooth muscles of the bronchial tubes. Bronchiectasis is a form of COPD (which includes emphysema and chronic bronchitis). There are three primary types of bronchiectasis: 1) cylindrical bronchiectasis; 2) saccular bronchiectasis; and 3) cystic bronchiectasis. Bronchiectasis may also be acquired or congenital. The most common symptoms of bronchiectasis are recurrent cough and sputum production. There is no cure for bronchiectasis. Treatment is often geared toward controlling the symptoms of bronchiectasis. Bronchoscopy is performed to view the inside of a person's airway and lungs. There are two types of bronchoscopy, 1) rigid bronchoscopy and 2) flexible bronchoscopy. Risk of bronchoscopy are few, but include chest pain, cough, collapsed lung, or pleurisy. Chest pain has a variety of noncardiac and cardiac causes, some of which can be very serious. Signs and symptoms of chest pain may include burning, squeezing, or heaviness in the chest. Atherosclerosis, angina, lung tumors, chest trauma, abdominal pain, and gastric reflux are just a few potential causes of chest pain. Chest pain is diagnosed by taking the patient history and performing a physical exam. Blood work, imaging tests, and an exercise stress test may be ordered. The treatment and prognosis of chest pain depends on the underlying cause. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a lung condition in which there is a long-lasting obstruction of the airways, and occurs with emphysema, chronic bronchitis, and/or asthma. Causes of COPD include cigarette smoking, exposure to secondhand smoke and environmental tobacco smoke, Alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency, airway hyper-responsiveness, and air pollution. Symptoms of COPD include a productive cough and acute chest illness, shortness of breath, wheezing, heart failure, cyanosis, and weight loss. Treatment of COPD includes medications, oxygen therapy, surgery, and lung transplant. A cough is a symptom of an underlying disease or condition. A chronic or persistent cough may signal certain lung conditions that should be evaluated by a healthcare professional. Common causes of coughs include infection, allergies, lung disease, medications, and GERD (reflux). Acute coughs are categorized as infectious or non-infectious. Chronic cough (persistent cough) have a variety of causes and should be evaluated by physician. Treatment of cough, acute cough, chronic or persistent cough depends on the cause of the cough. Oftentimes, exercise may trigger an asthma attack. Symptoms include wheezing, coughing, chest tightness, chest pain, and fatigue. Treatment involves forming an action plan with your health-care provider and taking asthma medications as advised. HIV has killed about 25 million individuals, and approximately 40 million people are currently living with the disease. Symptoms and signs of HIV include fever, headache, tiredness, and enlarged lymph nodes. Infections that happen with AIDS are called opportunistic infections. There is no cure for HIV/AIDS. Treatment usually involves a combination of at least three drugs to suppress the virus from replicating and boost the immune system. Interstitial lung disease, is a term to describe a certain lung condition. Causes of interstitial lung disease include lung infection, exposure to toxins in the environment (asbestos for example), medications (chemotherapy), radiation therapy, and chronic autoimmune disorders. Common symptoms of interstitial lung disease include a dry cough and shortness of breath. Diagnosis and treatment depend upon the cause of the condition. Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths. Symptoms and signs include coughing up blood, chest pain, wheezing, and chronic respiratory infections. Treatment depends upon the tumor stage, type of lung cancer, and the patient's overall physical condition. Pneumonia is an infection or inflammation of the lungs. It can be in just one part of the lungs, or it can involve many parts. Symptoms of viral pneumonia include low-grade fever, coughing up mucus, tiredness, and muscle aches. A percentage of people who contract the deadly pandemic COVID-19 coronavirus develop severe lung symptoms that may include viral pneumonia. The best treatment for viral pneumonia of any cause is to rest and keep the patient hydrated. Asthma is a chronic inflammation of the airways caused by external triggers. Occupational asthma is asthma caused by something inhaled at the workplace, such as: fumes, dust, smoke, chemicals, vapors, allergens, or molds. Workplace triggers may also include temperature extremes or stress. Pneumonia is inflammation of one or both lungs with consolidation. Pneumonia is frequently but not always caused by infection. The infection may be bacterial, viral, fungal, or parasitic. Symptoms may include fever, chills, cough with sputum production, chest pain, and shortness of breath. The pandemic COVID-19 coronavirus causes viral pneumonia in a percentage of people who contract the virus. Rheumatoid arthritis (often called RA) is a chronic (long-standing) disease that damages the joints of the body. Symptoms and signs of rheumatoid arthritis include joint pain, swelling, inflammation, stiffness, warmth, muscle aches, weakness, fever, fatigue, loss of appetite, weight loss, and malaise. Treatment may involve physical therapy, occupational therapy, hydrotherapy, heat and cold treatments, joint replacements, and medications. Sarcoidosis is a disease that involves a specific type of inflammation of various tissues of the body. Sarcoidosis generally appears in the lungs, lymph nodes, skin, liver, heart, kidneys and nervous system. The cause of sarcoidosis is not clear. Common symptoms involve shortness of breath, chronic cough, skin rashes, weight loss. Treatment is geared to the location of the sarcoidosis. Cigarette smoking remains the leading cause of death and illness among Americans. Effects of smoking can cause cancers, emphysema, bronchitis, COPD, chronic cough, and more. Smoking cessation includes nicotine replacement therapy and behavioral therapy. Do you know your facts about asthma? Take the quiz and see. Tuberculosis (TB) is an infection, typically of the lungs, that is caused by either bacteria or fungus. Though treatments have have greatly evolved over the years, TB is still a major health problem worldwide. Chest pain has a variety of noncardiac and cardiac causes, some of which can be very serious. Signs and symptoms of chest pain may include burning, squeezing, or heaviness in the chest. Atherosclerosis, angina, lung tumors, chest trauma, abdominal pain, and gastric reflux are just a few potential causes of chest pain. Chest pain is diagnosed by taking the patient history and performing a physical exam. Blood work, imaging tests, and an exercise stress test may be ordered. The treatment and prognosis of chest pain depends on the underlying cause. Collapsed Lung (Pneumothorax) Topic Guide - Visuals ©2021 WebMD, Inc.

However, asthma does flare up sometimes without warning. Sudden cough or shortness of breath can happen, usually triggered by some common allergen such as dust or pollen. Asthma can also get worse over a period of time in which you see that more quick-relief medicine than usual is needed to control asthma symptoms. An asthma attack needs to be treated quickly using the right medicine. If left unattended, asthma attacks and related symptoms worsen and can even become fatal. Symptoms of asthma can vary in different situations. To effectively track the symptoms and act when they get worse, you need to work with your doctor to develop a clear asthma action plan. To determine if your asthma is getting worse, you will need to understand the importance of the three zones of asthma control – green zone, yellow zone and red zone. The green zone indicates full control of your asthma. You have up to 90% normal breathing ability and remain largely asymptomatic. You are able to be active and take part in day to day activities at work or school. Your sleep is not disturbed by asthma symptoms such as cough or chest tightness. You don’t use your controller or reliever medication except for the pre-exercise dose. In this stage, continue your controller medications as per your doctor’s directions. If your symptoms are in the green zone for over 3 months, you can discuss with your doctor about decreasing the dose of your controller medications. However, do not stop taking your medications without consulting your doctor. You have 60 to 80% of normal breathing ability and have mild asthma symptoms that interfere with your routine activities or exercise. Symptoms make it difficult to sleep and you may also have a cold or chest infection. Frequency of reliever medication intake is 4 or more times in a week You are forced to miss work or school because of your symptoms. Proactive interventions associated with reduced healthcare utilization, costs for children with asthma Researchers find a better way to block asthma triggers High levels of steroids put asthma patients at greater risk of serious side-effects If you see that you are in the yellow zone, speak to your physician and seek modification of your asthma medications and updation of asthma action plan. If asthma symptoms in the yellow zone are left untreated they might worsen and move to the red zone. The red zone indicates a medical emergency. People in the red zone experience severe asthma symptoms such as: Reliever medications may not work effectively towards easing these symptoms. Make a note of these signs and make sure you recognize them. If you have any of these symptoms, immediate medical attention is required. Call your local emergency service immediately and get to the ER as soon as possible. At the emergency room, healthcare professionals will treat you with oral or intravenous corticosteroids, inhalation of reliever medications such as bronchodilators, and oxygen masks. They also use peak flow monitoring, oximetry, and spirometry to assess the progress of asthma post medication. Remember that delays in getting medical attention when you have red zone asthma symptoms can be fatal. Note down important phone numbers of your doctor, local emergency service, and local ambulance service. Always be alert about your symptoms and follow your doctor’s action plan for managing asthma. https://www.asthma.org.uk/advice/understanding-asthma/types/severe-asthma/ http://www.aaaai.org/conditions-and-treatments/asthma Last Updated: Feb 26, 2019 Susha has a Bachelor of Science (B.Sc.) degree in Chemistry and Master of Science (M.Sc) degree in Biochemistry from the University of Calicut, India.

Reviewed by Asthma, like all chronic conditions of childhood, affects not only the child but the entire family. For children with mild asthma, the impact on the family may be minimal — but with more severe disease, parents may have issues in several areas. As children get older, they are able to take more responsibility for their daily activities, including management of their disease. As your child takes on more responsibility, it should be appropriate for the age and abilities. It may be difficult to find the right balance of support and responsibility at times. A preschooler’s tasks often include learning to cooperate with inhaled medications and the adult takes the leading role in asthma management. A school age child is learning to take more responsibility with the adult still taking the leading role. The adolescent can gradually assume more responsibility and the adult will move into more of a guidance role. It is important for the adult to routinely monitor medication technique and supplies. Family meetings can help identify how the daily medications and activities and the asthma action plan are going. A variety of issues may arise in connection with school. Fortunately, there are steps you can take to address these issues. Arrange a School Conference Before the School Year Begins This conference should include your child’s teachers, physical education teachers, school nurse and teacher aides. It is important for them to have an understanding of your child’s asthma. You can give a brief asthma education lesson — discussing what can make asthma worse in the school environment, your child’s daily treatment including exercise pre-treatment if needed, techniques to inhale medication, asthma symptoms, peak flow zones and the school Asthma Action Plan. This school should include what makes your child’s asthma worse, long-term control medication, especially those taken at school, asthma symptoms, peak flow zones, quick-relief medications to be taken for peak flows in the yellow and red zone or asthma symptoms, and emergency telephone numbers. Immediate access to quick-relief medication is important. When approved by the doctor, parent and school personnel, it is helpful if the child with asthma can carry the quick-relief medication for immediate access. Ask your child’s doctor to work with you and the school if further arrangements are needed. A written asthma action plan is always useful. Talk with your child and the school staff regularly to assure your child’s asthma action plan is working. Some children have difficulty keeping up with their school work because of missed school days. When asthma is severe enough to require hospitalization, school days may be missed. However, it is usually not necessary to miss school because of mild asthma symptoms, which can be handled at school. Monitoring your child’s asthma symptoms and peak flows at home and at school can be very helpful. These steps will help address school issues related to your child and asthma so your child can have a positive and enjoyable school experience. Parents are sometimes hesitant to punish children with asthma for fear punishment will cause an attack.  While it is true that children who are upset by restrictions (or any frustrating situation) may develop asthma symptoms, the harm done by letting a child always have his or her own way because of asthma is much greater, even if some asthma symptoms occur with discipline. Follow your child’s action plan if asthma symptoms occur. Also, if there are other children in the family, they may resent what they see as special treatment. Asthma is not a psychosomatic illness. However, as a result of prolonged asthma, behavior problems can arise. When a child has self-destructive behavior — such as using asthma to avoid school or manipulate the family, or deliberately missing medication to cause an episode — a referral to a psychologist or psychiatrist may be helpful. Asthma, like any chronic illness, may sometimes magnify other family problems. Family stresses which may be tolerable when the child is healthy may become major problems when the child is ill. Sometimes a cycle is set up in which asthma and other family problems aggravate each other. Individual counseling for your child may not be sufficient, and family counseling may be recommended. Children with asthma have the same nutritional requirements as other children. Aside from avoiding specific foods that you know cause symptoms, no special kind of diet has been shown to be beneficial for asthma. Extra vitamins, over and above normal daily requirements, typically are not needed. Some children need extra calcium and vitamin D because of long-term steroid (pills or syrups) therapy.

a8832957-e0b7-4999-a1c4-c76de4c87131,"» Are you sure your patient has asthma? What are the typical findings for this disease? 1. Recurrent cough, wheeze, or shortness of breath often with specific triggers that is at least partially relieved by a bronchodilator. 2. Wheezing with illnesses that responds at least partially to a bronchodilator. 3. Rule out other causes such as those listed below. When a child presents with recurrent symptoms of airway obstruction such as chronic cough, recurrent wheeze, cough or chest tightness with exercise or other triggers, the following elements in the history and physical suggest asthma: History of present illness: recurrent symptoms, at least partial response to bronchodilator. Specific triggers such as exercise, exposure to allergens, or viral illness. Past medical history: history of eczema, allergies (environmental and/or food); history of recurrent bronchiolitis, recurrent pneumonia, or wheeze with illnesses. Environmental history: home environment including exposure to animals, molds, tobacco smoke, and odors; attendance of daycare/school. Physical exam is usually normal. Children may also wheeze or have a prolonged expiratory phase. Consider alternate diagnoses in a child with clubbing, failure to thrive, rhonchi, or rales in a child who is not currently ill; oxygen saturations chronically below 90% in a child who is not ill are not consistent with asthma. What other disease/condition shares some of these symptoms? Diseases and conditions that share some symptoms with asthma Chronic lung disease: bronchopulmonary dysplasia, cystic fibrosis, aspiration pneumonia Immunodeficiency leading to recurrent pulmonary infections Airway anomalies such as laryngomalacia, tracheomalacia, bronchomalacia Airway compression due to: mediastinal mass, vascular ring (e.g. a double aortic arch), or pulmonary artery sling, lymphadenopathy The Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) Guidelines was updated in 2014 and The National Heart Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI) and the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program (NAEPP) published “Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Management of Asthma (Expert Panel Report-3)” in 2007. In 2012, Colorado put together a document that is much shorter and simplifies the guidelines while preserving all of the key elements. This guideline is available at: www.healthteamworks.org/guidelines/asthma.html. The cause of asthma in every patient is multifactorial. In pediatric asthma, 80-90% of children have allergies and the asthma symptoms are often triggered by allergen exposure. Nevertheless, not all children with allergies develop asthma. Therefore there are probably genetic and environmental factors that influence the development of asthma in certain children with allergies. In children who do not have allergies, the cause may be genetic and/or epigenetic. In other words, the development of asthma and the severity of the disease may be the result of exposures to respiratory illness, tobacco smoke, air pollution, or other sources of stress before or after birth that alter the expression of genes. Many investigators and multiple cohort studies are endeavoring to find the cause for asthma in allergic and non-allergic children. In a child with a diagnosis of asthma, the following questions in the history might help discern the cause of an asthma exacerbation while also providing information about the severity of the disease at baseline: Current severity of symptoms of airway obstruction, timing of symptoms, response to bronchodilator, recent frequency of use of the bronchodilator and other asthma medications including a daily controller, if applicable (see below), and recent viral illness or environmental exposures or exposure to any food allergens. History and frequency of severe asthma exacerbations requring hospitalization or intensive care, baseline frequency of bronchodilator use per week and number of bronchodilator refills in the last 6-12 months, compliance with controller medications if applicable (see below). Home environment including exposure to animals, molds, tobacco smoke, and odors; attendance of daycare/school. Check vital signs including oxygen saturation; listen for wheeze or prolonged expiratory phase or decreased aeration. Evaluate the level of respiratory distress. Evaluate for signs of allergic reaction including hives or swelling of the face that might indicate anaphylaxis. What laboratory studies should you request to help confirm the diagnosis of asthma? How should you interpret the results? Asthma causes obstructive lung disease due to airway inflammation and bronchospasm. The flow of air during exhalation will be slower if airways are inflamed or obstructed by bronchospasm. Spirometry can be used to evaluate obstruction by measuring flow rate in children over the age of six. Even basic spirometry can be difficult to perform. Refer to the American Thoracic Society criteria for a comprehensive description of procedures and interpretation. Spirometry involves a deep inhalation to total lung capacity and a strong, sustained exhalation of the whole vital capacity for at least 3 seconds. The measure needs to be repeated 3 times and should be reproducible within 5% of the forced vital capacity (FVC) liter value. The total amount exhaled, or FVC, on a pulmonary function test report (PFT) will show the best of three liter values and the percent predicted. The percent predicted is generated by comparing results to a group of children of similar age, height, gender, and ethnicity. The amount of air forcefully exhaled in one second is the FEV1. The last value to consider in asthma is the FEV1/FVC ratio. The normal value for the FVC and FEV1 on a PFT is greater than 80% predicted. The normal value for the ratio is 0.85 for children up to 18 years old. The amount of air forced out in one second (FEV1) will be decreased in a patient with obstructive lung disease. Another value to consider in the diagnosis of asthma is the FEV1/FVC ratio. The normal value for the FVC and FEV1 on a PFT is greater than 80% of predicted. The normal value for the ratio is 0.85 for children up to 18 years of age. In obstructive disease, the volume of air inhaled should be normal. As a result, the FVC should be normal even if it takes the child longer to exhale. The FEV1 will be low and the ratio will be low. If a child responds clinically to a bronchodilator and has PFT results showing a low FEV1 and FEV1/FVC ratio in the presence of normal FVC, the diagnosis of asthma is confirmed. Asthma can be diagnosed in the absence of a history of bronchodilator use. Since the error of the FEV1 is approximately 12%, 15% improvement in FEV1 15 minutes after three puffs of a bronchodilator represents a positive bronchodilator response and confirms the diagnosis of asthma. If spirometry is not available or the child is unable to perform spirometry, the diagnosis of asthma may be made clinically. The caregiver can be given a bronchodilator to use at home. The medication can be used during an illness when the child is wheezing or to prevent wheezing before exposure to a known trigger such as a trip to the park. If the child at least partially responds to the bronchodilator and no other diagnosis is suspected, asthma may be the diagnosis. Would imaging studies be helpful in the diagnosis of asthma? If so, which ones? Imaging studies can be useful in a child where the diagnosis of asthma is unclear. Children with asthma who are not sick often have a normal chest x-ray. In children with very poorly controlled asthma, the chest x-ray may show hyperinflation. An argument for a chest x-ray in all children who may have asthma is that a mediastinal mass must be ruled out before corticosteroids are administered. However, routine chest x-rays thereafter are not cost effective. If you are able to confirm that the patient has asthma, what treatment should be initiated? Guidelines to the management of asthma can be found in the Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) Guidelines updated in 2014 and in the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute’s (NHLBI) and the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program’s (NAEPP) “Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Management of Asthma (Expert Panel Report-3)”, published in 2007. In 2012, Colorado put together a document that is much shorter and simplifies the guidelines while preserving all of the key elements. This guideline is available at www.healthteamworks.org/guidelines/asthma.html. The first step in the treatment and management of asthma is diagnosis. The next step is to rate the asthma severity in order to understand the degree of disease activity using the guidelines listed above. The most important distinction to be made is between intermittent and persistent asthma. A simple algorithm to use to decide intermittent versus persistent is as follows: Any child who displays ANY of the following has persistent asthma: Quick-relief medication use more than 2 times a week, OR Abnormal pulmonary function tests showing airway obstruction. If the child has been treated with oral corticosteroids more than 2 times in 12 months, the child may also have persistent asthma. If a child needs to take a daily medication to prevent the symptoms listed above, that child has persistent asthma. All children and families with a child who has asthma should understand that asthma is a chronic disease that can be controlled. Children with asthma should be able to play and exercise without limitation, sleep through the night, and attend school every day when they are well. In order to maintain control, all children with asthma need a quick-relief or bronchodilator medication to relieve acute symptoms. Short acting beta-agonists (SABA) are used for quick-relief in asthma. All children with persistent asthma need to be treated with a “controller medication” to control the airway inflammation that is causing the persistent symptoms. The dose of controller medication depends upon the severity of the disease and is described in detail in the algorithms mentioned above. The first choice for all levels of severity will be an inhaled corticosteroid. Inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) are always listed as the first choice because studies show that ICS control symptoms and decrease the risk of exacerbation better than available alternate medications. Asthma education should include information about the disease including the pathophysiology, information about triggers, and a complete description of the medications, including why to use them, which medications to use and when, and how to deliver the medications correctly. Medication device technique should be reviewed at every visit. Patients of all ages should use a spacer with a metered dose inhaler to ensure adequate delivery of the medication. Children should be seen within 4-6 weeks of the initiation of chronic therapy for asthma. At that visit, the asthma control should be rated according to the algorithms mentioned above. If the child is well controlled, management will be continued. If the child is poorly controlled, the provider should evaluate environmental control, medication compliance, medication device technique, and comorbidities before adjusting medications. Children should be followed every 3-6 months depending on the level of control. Medications can be stepped down after 3-6 months of good control. Well controlled asthma criteria are listed below. In the management of exacerbations for a child who has increased symptoms, the first line treatment is always a bronchodilator. The bronchodilator can be delivered as a nebulized solution or through a metered dose inhaler and valved holding chamber. In the emergency room setting, three doses of albuterol combined with ipratropium bromide has been shown to decrease the likelihood of hospital admission in the setting of a moderate to severe asthma exacerbation. If the child’s symptoms continue or do not resolve with a bronchodilator, systemic corticosteroids will be necessary. Early use of systemic corticosteroids decreases the risk for hospitalization for an asthma exacerbation, ameliorates the symptoms, and may shorten the course of the illness. There is an algorithm for the care of acute asthma exacerbations available on p. 55 of the 2007 summary report. Evidence does not support doubling the dose of inhaled corticosteroids in the setting of an asthma exacerbation. Interventions to avoid intubation or treat impending acute respiratory failure include intravenous magnesium and inhaled heliox (please refer to the guideline for dosing). Other possibilities (equivocal recommendation due to insufficient evidence) include intravenous beta-agonist, and noninvasive ventilation. Interventions not recommended are theophylline, antibiotics, aggressive hydrations, chest physiotherapy, mucolytics and sedation. What are the adverse effects associated with each treatment option? Short Acting Beta Agonists (SABA) medications can cause the patient to be jittery and to have tachycardia. High doses can cause nausea and hypokalemia. Locally, Inhaled Corticosteroids (ICS) medications can lead to thrush if not well rinsed off of the mucous membranes. Systemically, at low doses, these medications have been associated with decreased height velocity and a possible decrease in adult height of approximately 1 cm. At high doses, systemic side effects include many of the systemic side effects seen with oral corticosteroids. Multiple anecdotal reports of altered behavior are reported in the literature and in the package insert for Leukotriene receptor antagonists (LTRA). However, large, multicenter studies of children and adults reveal no significant differences between LTRA and placebo in behavioral change. It is possible that the problem is that the reported types of psychiatric and behavior changes are common and LTRA use is common and the relationship suggested by the anecdotes is circumstantial. There are multiple side effects of systemic oral corticosteroids including (but not limited to) cortisol suppression, immunosuppression, decreased bone growth, behavior change, increased appetite, elevated blood pressure and blood sugar. Several large studies evaluated the safety of long-acting beta agonists (LABA). The results of some show an increased risk of severe respiratory events and even death. It is not clear how that risk changes when the medication is given in combination with an ICS, but it may be decreased. All combination agents have a black box warning in the package insert due to these study results. The data for or against LABA in children is limited. There is significant debate in the literature about their use in children. In 2010, the Food and Drug Administration released a statement recommending that children and adolescents only use LABA in combination with an ICS and that they use these medications only if the symptoms cannot be controlled on ICS alone. Long-acting beta agonists are only available in combination in most pharmacies in the United States. Prognosis (or the probability that any child will ""outgrow"" asthma) Asthma can present at any age. Several large birth cohort studies describe “wheezing pheynotypes” that may be useful in predicting the natural history of wheezing/asthma in children. In the Tucson birth cohort, children were classified as having “transient wheeze,” “persistent wheeze,” and “late onset wheeze.” Transient wheeze: children who wheeze only with illness. Wheezing can begin in infancy and peaks at around 2 years. 75% of these children stop wheezing around age 3 years. Future episodes are infrequent. Persistent wheeze/asthma: children who wheeze with illness and outside of illness starting before 3 years old and persist past 6 years old. This cohort is more likely to be allergic. Late onset wheeze/asthma: children who wheeze with illness and outside of illness starting after 6 years old. This cohort of children is also more likely to be allergic. Based upon this study, the Tucson group created an “asthma predictive index”. This has been modified and used widely. This tool has been shown most effective to predict who will not have asthma (negative predictive index). The positive predictive index is low. No studies have found a tool that successfully predicts which children will have asthma later in life. Risk factors for asthma in school age children include positive aeroallergen tests or symptoms, male gender, and tobacco smoke exposure. Children with asthma will continue to have symptoms if they are not well controlled as described above. Risk factors for persistent symptoms include poor compliance with controller medications and repeated exposure to asthma triggers such as allergens and tobacco smoke. Asthma exacerbations leading to an emergency department visit or hospitalization are described in children of every age and children at every level of disease severity. The biggest risk factor for a serious exacerbation is history of a previous exacerbation. Therefore, any child who has received prednisone more than twice in 12 months or who has been to the emergency department or hospital for asthma should be considered high risk for a future exacerbation. Death due to asthma is rare in children. The CDC reports 0.3 deaths per 1000 children under the age of 18 from 2005-2007. Children at risk for death include those with a previous asthma exacerbation leading to respiratory failure, seizure, or loss of consciousness; previous exacerbations with rapid deterioration; food-associated asthma exacerbation, psychosocial factors including failure to perceive symptoms or severity, noncompliance, depression, and dysfunctional family unit; and demographics such as inner-city residence and race/ethnicity. Long-term complications include loss of lung function; recurrent, severe, exacerbations; and even death. Risk factors for progression of the disease are not entirely clear. Children with a history of severe asthma exacerbations are at risk for future exacerbations. Asthma is the most common acquired, chronic disease of childhood. Prevalence is rising. As of 2011, the CDC reported asthma prevalence in children to be 9.6%. In children under the age of 18, asthma is more common in boys than girls (11.3% versus 7.9%), non-Hispanic black children versus non-Hispanic white children (17.0% versus 8.5%), and poor versus not poor (13.5% versus 8.3%). The etiology of asthma is unclear. Most theories include a double hit phenomenon with predisposing genetics and exposures triggering inflammatory cascades. It is likely that there is genetic predisposition and triggering exposures such as upper respiratory illnesses, allergens, airway irritants, such as tobacco smoke and pollution, and stress. Airway inflammation consists of increased inflammatory cells such as lymphocytes, macrophages, mast cells and eosinophils. Bronchial and lung biopsies of school age children show increased eosinophils and lymphocytes (See Figure 1). In children with allergic inflammation, the degranulation of eosinophils and mast cells causes acute airway swelling. Chronic inflammation is also IgE-mediated and includes processes involving increased numbers of mast cells and eosinophils, increased levels of cytokines such as IL-4 and IL-13, and impaired regulation of inflammation. In children with non-allergic inflammation, the etiology of the inflammation is not clear. Increased mucous production further drives inflammation and leads to airway obstruction and atelectasis. Increased inflammation and mucous plugging causes hypoxemia due to ventilation/perfusion mismatch. Bronchial hyperreactivity (bronchospasm) is most likely due to inflammation since bronchial hyperreactivity decreases when airway inflammation decreases. Bronchial hyperreactivity can be partially relieved by inhaled beta-agonists which lead to muscle relaxation. Reponse to beta-agonists is a key component in the diagnosis of asthma. Children over age 6 and beyond may develop airway muscle hypertrophy. Over time, persistent airway inflammation can lead to airway remodeling and decline in lung function. What are the triggers for asthma symptoms and exacerbations? Many children have more than one trigger for asthma. Triggers may include: Exposure to environmental allergens in sensitized individuals. Common allergens include: Alternaria (a mold), dust mites, cockroach, mice, animals (cats, dogs, horses), grasses, trees, weeds, and other molds. Air pollutants including tobacco smoke, particulate matter, and ozone. Noxious exposure such as inhalants, fumes, and even strong smells for some children. Weather changes are often reported by families as a trigger although studies do not confirm this. Physical activity may cause an asthma exacerbation. Nuts, shellfish, insect venom and medications are common triggers. The reaction of each child to an allergen will be unique and may not include any respiratory symptoms. However, some children with asthma have severe respiratory manifestations when exposed to allergens to which they are sensitized. For example, children with nut allergies may be at risk for more severe asthma exacerbations than children without nut allergies. Several viral infections are linked to exacerbations; the most common are rhinovirus, respiratory syncytial virus and human metapneumovirus. Laughing, crying, and anxiety/stress can trigger asthma exacerbation. Other diagnoses that may complicate asthma (comorbidities) What complications might you expect from the disease? Long-term complications can include loss of lung function, recurrent, severe, exacerbations, and even death. Risk factors for progression of the disease are not entirely clear. Children with history of severe asthma exacerbations are at risk for future exacerbations. Other risks for severe exacerbations and death are listed in the national guidelines for asthma management. They include severe airway obstruction, frequent SABA use (more than 3 refills in 12 months), patients and families frightened by asthma, demographic factors such as race/ethnicity, lower socioeconomic status and psychosocial factors such as depression, denial, dysfunctional family units and noncompliance. Death due to asthma is rare in children. The CDC reports 0.3 deaths per 1000 children under the age of 18 from 2005-2007. Children at risk for death include those with a previous asthma exacerbation leading to respiratory failure, seizure, or loss of consciousness; previous exacerbations with rapid deterioration; food-associated asthma exacerbation; psychosocial factors including failure to perceive symptoms or severity, noncompliance, depression, and dysfunctional family unit; and demographics such as inner-city residence and race/ethnicity. Long-term complications can include loss of lung function; recurrent, severe, exacerbations; and even death. Risk factors for progression of the disease are not entirely clear. Children with a history of severe asthma exacerbations are at risk for future exacerbations. Are additional laboratory studies available; even some that are not widely available? Exercise induced bronchospasm testing can be done on a treadmill. There are specific criteria for conducting these tests that are available from the American Thoracic Society. Some have employed stair stepping and outdoor running applying heart rate criteria from the American Thoracic Society. Methacholine challenge: Methacholine is an inhaled agent that causes acute bronchospasm in patients with asthma at doses below 8mg/ml of inhaled methacholine. Other agents include histamine and cold air. Tests can be performed in a pulmonary function laboratory and should be supervised by a specialist. Guidelines are provided listed by the American Thoracic Society. Exhaled Nitric Oxide may be useful. Its use for ongoing management is unclear. Several review articles listed below detail use of exhaled nitric oxide in adults and children. Asthma cannot be prevented. The genetics of asthma are complicated. There are probably genetic factors that predispose children and adults to asthma, many linked to allergy. There may also be epigenetic factors, for example, if the child is born with a certain gene, environmental factors such as allergen exposure or possibly early infectious exposure or disease may affect the way the gene is expressed. At this point, it is not possible to avoid environmental factors because it is not clear which genes or combination of genes are affected or how to test for them.

(A review article of studies evaluating the diagnosis and treatment of asthma in preschool children.) Ongoing controversies regarding etiology, diagnosis, treatment According to the national guidelines, asthma can be diagnosed in any child who meets the criteria for diagnosis. The risk for chronic asthma symptoms beyond the age of 6 years is discussed in the outcomes section above. However, children under 4 years old who wheeze only with illness and who do not have any symptoms in between their respiratory illnesses are a difficult population to diagnose and to treat. The diagnosis of asthma is difficult because although the children respond to asthma medications (short acting beta-agonists), the risk for chronic, long-term symptoms or even symptoms between illnesses is unclear. Studies looking at the kind of inflammation seen in these patients show variable results and suggest that the pathophysiology in this population may be different. Several studies recently have investigated the best way to treat children ages 2-4 who wheeze with illness. Unfortunately, the treatment is not yet clear. Children who have a positive asthma predictive index (see outcomes above), and who have had severe episodes requiring hospitalization, may benefit from low-dose, daily inhaled corticosteroids. Exercise induced bronchospasm (EIB) or exercise induced asthma: recurrent symptoms of airway obstruction with exercise that improve with albuterol is a form of asthma. The question in the literature is whether or not EIB would be classified as persistent asthma. The literature suggests that children who report symptoms with exercise only will usually reveal more frequent symptoms if appropriately interviewed. These studies suggest that EIB is most likely a symptom of persistent asthma. Primary care pediatricians report significant numbers of children with EIB alone in their practices. Future studies are needed to evaluate EIB and clearly define the relationship between EIB and persistent asthma. Guidelines for diagnosis and treatment from the American Thoracic Society can be found at: http://www.atsjournals.org/doi/pdf/10.1164/rccm.201303-0437ST. Reactive Airway Disease or “RAD” is descriptive and used frequently. Many providers report that they use RAD in children where the diagnosis of asthma is unclear or when the family is not ready for the diagnosis. RAD is a separate diagnosis under the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD 10). The problem with treating RAD as an alternate diagnosis in the text of the chart or in the diagnosis section of a chart is that RAD is confusing for families and caregivers who do not know what it means or how to treat it. Therefore, if the diagnosis of asthma is unclear, other diagnoses such as “wheeze”, “cough”, or “viral pneumonia” can be used as alternate diagnoses if the provider does not believe that the diagnosis is asthma. The treatment of wheeze, cough, or other symptoms in these children should also be clear to the families. Copyright © 2017, 2013 Decision Support in Medicine, LLC. All rights reserved.

cf6fc2ad-cff1-44d4-b155-33c99f3c4fc2,"People with overweight or obesity are more likely to experience asthma or wheezing. Now a new study finds that fat deposits may appear in the airway walls of the lung. Fat may be able to alter the structure of the airways. Fat can get into the airway walls of the lungs and alter their structure, which may be the cause of wheezing, asthma, or both, a suggests. People with overweight or obesity are more likely to experience asthma or wheezing, but scientists weren’t exactly sure why. The study published this month in European Respiratory Journal suggests that fat deposits could have similar effects of artery plaque, which can clog vessels and cause cardiac events. A team based in Australia found that fat can accumulate in the airway walls, particularly in people with overweight or obesity. They believe this could be why those with overweight or obesity have a higher risk for asthma. The researchers examined postmortem samples of lungs from 52 people. Of them, 16 died of asthma, 15 didn’t have asthma, and 21 had asthma but died from other causes. The scientists inserted dyes into the lung tissue and examined the structures of 1,373 airways, then correlated the fatty tissue with the body mass index (BMI) of each individual. The amount of fat increased in line with BMI, they found. Fat may alter the structure of the airways, and may lead to inflammation in the lungs, they also noted. , PhD, co-author and associate professor at the University of Western Australia in Perth, says that research has suggested the link between higher weight and asthma could be a result of pressure from excess weight on the lungs, or it could be due to a general increase in inflammation. “We’ve found that excess fat accumulates in the airway walls where it takes up space and seems to increase inflammation within the lungs. We think this is causing a thickening of the airways that limits the flow of air in and out of the lungs, and that could at least partly explain an increase in asthma symptoms,” he said. The team was most surprised that the amount of “fat” in the airways was related to wall thickness, Noble says. This is a common feature in diseases like asthma. “From this we speculated that airway-associated fat may contribute to the increased severity of disease in individuals who have asthma and are also overweight,” he added. Fat cells are known to be pro-inflammatory, so excess weight likely causes systemic inflammation, Noble explains. The study didn’t provide enough data to explain exactly how fat gets into the lungs. “Fat will distribute throughout the body in spaces that can accommodate increased fat mass,” Noble told Healthline. “Poor diet and lack of energy expenditure with exercise avoidance likely contributes to airway-associated fat, as it does in other biological tissues. Our study suggests that if you are overweight, you are more likely to have fat in the airway wall.” But it may not be that simple, as some people who don’t have overweight or obesity can have fat around their organs, Noble adds. The researchers plan to study their results further, and want to know whether weight loss can reverse respiratory symptoms. , chief medical officer at the American Lung Association, who wasn’t involved with the research, says the study is an “important first step” in correlating the appearance of increased fat deposits in the airways with the presence and severity of asthma in those who have overweight or obesity as well as asthma. More research needs to be done using other techniques to measure fatty tissue in the lungs and how it correlates in people who are living with asthma, Rizzo says. The medical community knows that airway responsiveness in people with obesity and asthma compared with people who don’t have those conditions. That may be because chemicals known as adipokines are elevated in the former. Weight may play a role in asthma independently as well, Rizzo says. “Further evidence for the relationship between obesity and asthma is being seen in the actual makeup of the airway walls with evidence of fat deposits,” Rizzo added. But that doesn’t solely explain the relationship between obesity and asthma. “It is now recognized that there is obesity associated with early onset allergic type asthma as well as obesity that occurs in late-onset nonallergic asthma,” he added. is a lung disease that causes scarred, stiff tissue within the lungs.

This form of ventilatory failure is most typically the result of an exacerbation of asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), chronic medical conditions with high prevalence. Less commonly, it can result from exacerbations of less prevalent lung diseases or an acute injury to the airway as occurs with an inhalation injury. Acute obstructive lung disease causes an increase in the resistance to airflow during exhalation and, depending on the disorder, inhalation. The obstruction of expiratory airflow increases the work of breathing required to ensure maintenance of adequate ventilation. Expiration, normally a passive recoiling of the elastic lungs, may require the use of respiratory muscles to drive airflow past the obstruction. As expiratory flow is limited and gas is trapped in the lungs (dynamic hyperinflation), increased lung volumes increase the load on respiratory muscles during inspiration as well. Inability to sustain the increased work of breathing can result in respiratory failure. Respiratory failure from acute obstructive disease can itself be life-threatening, leading to respiratory arrest without prompt recognition, treatment and supportive care. This condition can also pose a threat to other organ systems, namely via circulatory collapse from dynamic hyperinflation of the lungs. Additionally, respiratory failure in the setting of obstructive lung disease may be the result of another underlying process that worsens obstruction and/or increases the load on the respiratory system, such as pneumonia. These conditions require diagnosis and treatment concurrent with management of the acute obstructive lung disease. Fatigue (from increased work of breathing and sleep disturbance) Hypoxemia (mild, responsive to oxygen supplementation) Assess need for and provide adequate ventilatory support The patient with acute obstructive lung disease is at risk of rapid clinical deterioration and respiratory arrest. Early recognition of distress and initiation of ventilatory support is essential. Bedside assessment revealing hypoxemia, severe distress (eg, tachypnea > 30), greatly increased work of breathing (eg, accessory muscle use, climbing pulsus paradoxus), or patient fatigue (eg, somnolence, falling pulsus paradoxus) are signs that positive-pressure ventilatory support is likely to be beneficial. Support the circulation. Air trapping resulting from expiratory flow obstruction (intrinsic positive end-expiratory pressure – PEEP) increases intrathoracic pressures and impedes venous return to the heart. Positive-pressure ventilation can greatly exacerbate this hyperinflation and may lead to cardiovascular collapse. Resuscitation to ensure adequate circulating volume and allowing adequate time for full exhalation (minimizing intrinsic PEEP) decreases this risk. Bronchodilation. Concurrent with supportive care, relief of the expiratory flow limitation is essential. Inhaled beta-agonists and corticosteroids are the primary therapies, but other therapies may be added for more severe obstruction. Identify and treat triggers. Acute obstructive disease most often occurs in patients with chronic underlying airway disease (asthma, COPD). However, triggers for acute worsening (eg, pneumonia, medications) that have specific therapies should be investigated and treated if present. Avoid, identify, and treat complications. Respiratory failure and the critical care it requires places patients at risk for complications. Cardiac events, acute kidney injury, delirium, and secondary infection are some of the more common complications. The following signs may be suggestive of pending respiratory failure, and positive-pressure ventilation should be considered: Non-invasive positive-pressure ventilation is considered the standard of care for patients with an acute exacerbation of COPD, and should be used when no contraindications are present. Despite less robust data supporting the use of non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) in asthma, this therapy is commonly used in practice. Both continuous and bi-level positive airway pressure support have been utilized successfully. Endotracheal intubation should be considered if contraindications to non-invasive ventilation (including hemodynamic instability or arrest, severe encephalopathy, anatomical facial anomalies, and inability to protect the airway from secretions) are not present. Additionally, the transition to invasive ventilation should be made if non-invasive ventilation fails to improve the clinical factors described above in a relatively short period of time (30 minutes or less). Regardless of the mode of ventilation, the clinician should avoid overventilation. High respiratory rates and/or tidal volumes increase the risk of hyperinflation and may cause life-threatening alkalosis as the carbon dioxide is rapidly lowered in a patient with a chronic compensatory metabolic alkalosis. Patients suffering from an acute obstructive lung disease have often been ill for days to weeks, and whole body depletion of salt and water is common. Paired with positive-pressure ventilation that exacerbated lung hyperinflation, patients are at risk for diminished venous return and cardiovascular collapse due to low cardiac output. Keys to early management include: resuscitation with intravenous fluids (normal saline) to ensure adequate urine output Patients with severe disease placed on positive-pressure ventilation may require large volumes of resuscitation fluid (> 5 liters) to ensure adequate perfusion. Many patients with acute obstructive lung disease will improve quickly with bronchodilator therapy. For this reason, early initiation of this therapy targeting the underlying disease is imperative. The complexity of care for patients with respiratory failure from obstructive lung disease necessitates a systematic approach. This will help ensure that goals of therapy are met and that alternate or complicating processes are identified and treated. Patients should be re-assessed frequently, and a non-affirmatory answer to a question below likely requires adjustment of the management plan: Is the patient’s ability to oxygenate and ventilate adequate? Does the patient have adequate circulating volume? Does therapy minimize air-trapping and hyperinflation? Is therapy for obstructive lung disease adequate? Have beta-agonists been administered in adequate doses? Have other therapies used in severe cases been considered? Is there an underlying cause and is it being treated? Have exacerbating exposures/ingestions/medications been stopped? Are there sufficient data to support this diagnosis? Is the patient being treated in a manner that will minimize and help recognize known complications? Are sedatives and analgesics adequately titrated to my goals? Is the patient on appropriate prophylactic therapy? A compelling medical history typically makes acute obstructive lung disease a leading candidate for the cause of respiratory failure. Acute onset of symptoms consistent with obstructive lung disease, particularly in a patient with a past history of asthma or COPD, should raise clinical suspicion. Exposure to a common exacerbant or severe inhalation exposure also increases the likelihood of acute obstructive lung disease. Examination helps the physician both confirm the presence of airflow obstruction (wheezing, diminished airflow) and assess the severity of respiratory distress (vital sign abnormalities, use of accessory muscle, mental state). For the patient presenting with impending respiratory failure, history and examination are often sufficient for diagnosis. Less severe presentations may benefit from an objective measure of airflow to confirm the suspected diagnosis. Peak flow measurements showing a decrease of > 20% from baseline suggest acute obstruction (with decrease of > 50% suggestive of severe exacerbation) in patients with asthma. This test is not nearly as sensitive in patients with COPD, who may develop respiratory failure with much smaller incremental change from baseline. Arterial blood gas perturbations may reflect the severity of the patient’s condition as well. Patients with classic asthma physiology tend to have normal arterial pCO at baseline and develop a mild respiratory alkalosis (decrease in pCO) in the early phase of an exacerbation. Elevated or even normal pCO levels may indicate respiratory muscle fatigue and impending respiratory failure. Patients with COPD may have elevated baseline arterial pCO, which must be considered when interpreting the blood gas in the acute setting. It should be noted that a normal blood gas DOES NOT indicate that the patient does not need support or that the patient is not at risk for respiratory failure. Clinical observation and assessment indicating impending respiratory failure almost always precede perturbations in the blood gas (which report that failure has already occurred). Physical examination suggesting that respiratory failure is imminent should be acted upon without awaiting results of the arterial blood gas. A chest X-ray is almost always performed in this clinical setting. This test may support the diagnosis (large lung volumes, flattened diaphragms), but much of its utility is in evaluating for an etiology of exacerbation (eg, pneumonia), alternative diagnoses (eg, congestive heart failure), or the complications of severe obstructive lung disease (eg, pneumothorax). The patient’s history and physical examination are often sufficient to make the diagnosis, and objective testing (peak flow, spirometry and arterial blood gas) serves only to confirm the diagnosis or determine the severity of the physiologic abnormalities. Several other disease processes can present with acute onset of worsening shortness of breath with cough and wheeze, and evaluation for these alternative diagnoses is important. Elevated cardiac filling pressures can lead to airway edema and alveolar flooding (pulmonary edema), which can present very similarly to acute obstructive lung disease (dyspnea and wheezing). It is appropriate to evaluate patients at risk for cardiovascular disease for congestive heart failure or myocardial ischemia. Obstruction of the large upper airway (oropharynx, trachea) or abnormal movement of the vocal cords can mimic the obstruction of medium to small airways characteristic of obstructive lung disease. Clues to this diagnosis include high-pitched inspiratory sounds heard anteriorly over the neck (stridor). If the patient requires intubation, the endotracheal tube often bypasses the upper airway lesion and eliminates the physiologic obstruction completely, helping differentiate upper airway obstruction from obstructive lung disease. Ideally upper airway obstruction as a cause of obstructive lung disease is identified before intubation is required. Chronic lung diseases such as organizing pneumonia, interstitial pneumonias, or bronchiolitis may present acutely and should be considered, although the degree of actually obstruction is variable and often minimal in these disorders. Respiratory failure due to thromboembolic disease may present similarly to acute obstructive lung disease. Some data support a high incidence of pulmonary embolism in acute exacerbation of COPD specifically, but the literature is inconclusive. The patient’s history and physical examination are often sufficient to make the diagnosis, and objective testing (peak flow, spirometry, arterial blood gas) serves only to confirm the diagnosis or determine the severity of the physiologic abnormalities. Cardiac evaluation is appropriate in patients at risk and should be done early in the patient presentation. In addition to history and physical examination, a chest X-ray, electrocardiogram, cardiac enzymes, and echocardiography are commonly performed tests. Failure to respond to treatment should prompt consideration of alternative diagnoses and additional diagnostic testing, including imaging and/or visualization of the upper airway as well as high-resolution imaging of the chest. Non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (first line for COPD, less experience in use for asthma) Intubation and mechanical ventilation (as needed) ▪ Goal of ventilation is to rest the respiratory muscles to allow time for the underlying disease process to be reversed. ▪ Increase expiratory time and avoid lung hyperinflation. ▪ Reducing gas trapping avoids impeded venous return (with cardiovascular collapse when extreme) and risk of pneumothorax. ▪ Low respiratory rate helps achieve longer expiratory time. ▪ High inspiratory flow rate with square wave form (for assist control ventilation) ▪ Tidal volumes of 5 to 7 ml/kg of ideal body weight ▪ Permissive hypercapnea (maintaining acceptable serum pH) to achieve above goals Volume requirement may be large (> 5 liters), particularly for patients receiving positive-pressure ventilation. 2.5 mg nebulized every 20 minutes (or less frequently) OR 4-8 puffs from metered-dose inhaler through spacer every 20 minutes (or less frequently) 500 mcg nebulized every 20 minutes (or less frequently, up to 3 doses) OR 8 puffs from metered-dose inhaler through spacer every 20 minutes (or less frequently) For patients with more severe disease: Methylprednisolone 60-125 mg IV push every 6 to 12 hours for the first few days Most patients with acute obstructive lung disease will demonstrate improvement with initial therapy with inhaled bronchodilators. Patients requiring high levels of care initially or rapid escalation of care likely have: Severe obstructive lung disease that will take additional time to improve A pathologic process other than or in addition to obstructive lung disease (pneumonia, CHF) Developed respiratory muscle fatigue or end-organ dysfunction that requires support after improvement in the obstructive lung disease Patients who fail to respond to initial therapy should be evaluated for alternative causes of respiratory distress or an additional process that is driving the acute obstruction (pneumonia, medication). Patients in respiratory failure have a load on the respiratory system that exceeds their ability to perform the work of breathing. Exacerbations of both asthma and COPD have often started days to weeks prior to seeking medical attention. This prolonged depletion of respiratory reserve may require a prolonged recovery and duration of ventilatory support (days) even if the obstruction is rapidly relieved. Some patients have truly difficult-to-treat obstructive lung disease. These patients may require: Deep sedation and possibly paralysis to achieve goals of ventilation Use of adjuvant bronchodilators (ipratropium, magnesium sulfate) Use of heliox to improve airflow and aid distal delivery of bronchodilator medications Prolonged period of support to allow improvement of obstructive lung disease (accordingly, may require tracheostomy) The vast majority of patients with acute obstructive lung disease will demonstrate improvement with inhaled bronchodilators and will continue to improve over subsequent days. The mortality rate from asthma is low but not rare, which is unfortunate given the preventable and treatable nature of asthma. Mortality for a given COPD exacerbation is greater than asthma but also quite low. However, the disease prevalence of COPD is high and the exacerbations are frequent, and COPD is the fourth leading cause of death in the United States. Failure to respond to treatment should prompt consideration of alternative diagnoses and additional diagnostic testing, including imaging and/or visualization of the upper airway, high-resolution imaging of the chest, evaluation for pulmonary embolism, and evaluation for cardiac pathology. Many exacerbations of obstructive lung disease are avoidable, and all patients admitted to the hospital should undergo counseling prior to discharge to minimize recurrent exacerbations. These should include discharge planning to ensure: Continued abstinence from smoking or engagement with a smoking cessation plan Identification of triggers and teaching regarding trigger avoidance Appropriate technique during use of all inhaled medications Immunization against respiratory pathogens (S. pneumoniae and influenza) Appropriate ambulatory follow-up for management of chronic disease Ambulatory follow-up should confirm or assess for: Review of symptoms and signs of obstructive lung disease Immunization against respiratory pathogens (S. pneumoniae and influenza) Obstructive lung disease is present when expiratory airflow is limited by increased airways resistance, often with associated decreased lung elastic recoil as in emphysema. The prototype of the former mechanism is asthma, where airway inflammation and smooth muscle hypertrophy decrease airway caliber, while the latter is characterized by emphysematous destruction of lung parenchyma. Individual patients may demonstrate one or both of these mechanisms. The airway hyper-reactivity characterized by asthma is reversible, and thus respiratory distress from acute obstructive lung disease of this sort is often the result of acute airway narrowing and significant change in the physiologic properties of the respiratory system. This is in contrast to respiratory failure from COPD/emphysema, where the physiologic change (increased obstruction or increased load on the system) is small but sufficient to overwhelm an individual with poor pulmonary reserve, resulting in respiratory failure. Obstructive lung disease has a high prevalence in the population, and exacerbations are common. For this reason the clinical and financial burden of acute respiratory failure from obstructive lung disease is large. Asthma affects over 22 million people in the United States, leading to 14.7 million outpatient visits, 1.8 million emergency department visits, almost 500,000 hospital admissions, and approximately 4000 deaths annually. Almost 15 million people in the United States carry a diagnosis of COPD (including chronic bronchitis and emphysema), which almost certainly understates the true prevalence. COPD is estimated to be responsible for over 125,000 deaths annually in the United States. Admission to the hospital with asthma is associated with a favorable prognosis, with approximately 0.5% mortality. However, progression to respiratory failure requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation, which occurs in about 4% of admissions, increases the mortality to almost 7%, underscoring the importance of early recognition and treatment of acute asthma exacerbation. Admission for an acute exacerbation of COPD carries a mortality of about 2 to 5%, a rate that increases to over 25% for patients requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation.

Coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19), caused by SARS-CoV-2, follows a biphasic pattern of illness that likely results from the combination of an early viral response phase and an inflammatory second phase. Most clinical presentations are mild, and the typical pattern of covid-19 more resembles an influenza-like illness—which includes fever, cough, malaise, myalgia, headache, and taste and smell disturbance—rather than severe pneumonia (although emerging evidence about long term consequences is yet to be understood in detail). In this review, we provide a broad update on the emerging understanding of SARS-CoV-2 pathophysiology, including virology, transmission dynamics, and the immune response to the virus. Any of the mechanisms and assumptions discussed in the article and in our understanding of covid-19 may be revised as further evidence emerges. SARS-CoV-2 is an enveloped β-coronavirus, with a genetic sequence very similar to SARS-CoV-1 (80%) and bat coronavirus RaTG13 (96.2%). The viral envelope is coated by spike (S) glycoprotein, envelope (E), and membrane (M) proteins (). Host cell binding and entry are mediated by the S protein. The first step in infection is virus binding to a host cell through its target receptor. The S1 sub-unit of the S protein contains the receptor binding domain that binds to the peptidase domain of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE 2). In SARS-CoV-2 the S2 sub-unit is highly preserved and is considered a potential antiviral target. The virus structure and replication cycle are described in . (1) The virus binds to ACE 2 as the host target cell receptor in synergy with the host’s transmembrane serine protease 2 (cell surface protein), which is principally expressed in the airway epithelial cells and vascular endothelial cells. This leads to membrane fusion and releases the viral genome into the host cytoplasm (2). Stages (3-7) show the remaining steps of viral replication, leading to viral assembly, maturation, and virus release Coronaviruses have the capacity for proofreading during replication, and therefore mutation rates are lower than in other RNA viruses. As SARS-CoV-2 has spread globally it has, like other viruses, accumulated some mutations in the viral genome, which contains geographic signatures. Researchers have examined these mutations to study virus characterisation and understand epidemiology and transmission patterns. In general, the mutations have not been attributed to phenotypic changes affecting viral transmissibility or pathogenicity. The G614 variant in the S protein has been postulated to increase infectivity and transmissibility of the virus. Higher viral loads were reported in clinical samples with virus containing G614 than previously circulating variant D614, although no association was made with severity of illness as measured by hospitalisation outcomes. These findings have yet to be confirmed with regards to natural infection. Why is SARS-CoV-2 more infectious than SARS-CoV-1? SARS-CoV-2 has a higher reproductive number (R) than SARS-CoV-1, indicating much more efficient spread. Several characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 may help explain this enhanced transmission. While both SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 preferentially interact with the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE 2) receptor, SARS-CoV-2 has structural differences in its surface proteins that enable stronger binding to the ACE 2 receptor and greater efficiency at invading host cells. SARS-CoV-2 also has greater affinity (or bonding) for the upper respiratory tract and conjunctiva, thus can infect the upper respiratory tract and can conduct airways more easily. Viral load dynamics and duration of infectiousness Viral load kinetics could also explain some of the differences between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-1. In the respiratory tract, peak SARS-CoV-2 load is observed at the time of symptom onset or in the first week of illness, with subsequent decline thereafter, which indicates the highest infectiousness potential just before or within the first five days of symptom onset (). In contrast, in SARS-CoV-1 the highest viral loads were detected in the upper respiratory tract in the second week of illness, which explains its minimal contagiousness in the first week after symptom onset, enabling early case detection in the community. After the initial exposure, patients typically develop symptoms within 5-6 days (incubation period). SARS-CoV-2 generates a diverse range of clinical manifestations, ranging from mild infection to severe disease accompanied by high mortality. In patients with mild infection, initial host immune response is capable of controlling the infection. In severe disease, excessive immune response leads to organ damage, intensive care admission, or death. The viral load peaks in the first week of infection, declines thereafter gradually, while the antibody response gradually increases and is often detectable by day 14 (figure adapted with permission from https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S009286742030475X; https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanres/article/PIIS2213-2600(20)30230-7/fulltext) Quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) technology can detect viral SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the upper respiratory tract for a mean of 17 days (maximum 83 days) after symptom onset. However, detection of viral RNA by qRT-PCR does not necessarily equate to infectiousness, and viral culture from PCR positive upper respiratory tract samples has been rarely positive beyond nine days of illness. This corresponds to what is known about transmission based on contact tracing studies, which is that transmission capacity is maximal in the first week of illness, and that transmission after this period has not been documented. Severely ill or immune-compromised patients may have relatively prolonged virus shedding, and some patients may have intermittent RNA shedding; however, low level results close to the detection limit may not constitute infectious viral particles. While asymptomatic individuals (those with no symptoms throughout the infection) can transmit the infection, their relative degree of infectiousness seems to be limited. People with mild symptoms (paucisymptomatic) and those whose symptom have not yet appeared still carry large amounts of virus in the upper respiratory tract, which might contribute to the easy and rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2. Symptomatic and pre-symptomatic transmission (one to two days before symptom onset) is likely to play a greater role in the spread of SARS-CoV-2. A combination of preventive measures, such as physical distancing and testing, tracing, and self-isolation, continue to be needed. Like other coronaviruses, the primary mechanism of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is via infected respiratory droplets, with viral infection occurring by direct or indirect contact with nasal, conjunctival, or oral mucosa, when respiratory particles are inhaled or deposited on these mucous membranes. Target host receptors are found mainly in the human respiratory tract epithelium, including the oropharynx and upper airway. The conjunctiva and gastrointestinal tracts are also susceptible to infection and may serve as transmission portals. Transmission risk depends on factors such as contact pattern, environment, infectiousness of the host, and socioeconomic factors, as described elsewhere. Most transmission occurs through close range contact (such as 15 minutes face to face and within 2 m), and spread is especially efficient within households and through gatherings of family and friends. Household secondary attack rates (the proportion of susceptible individuals who become infected within a group of susceptible contacts with a primary case) ranges from 4% to 35%. Sleeping in the same room as, or being a spouse of an infected individual increases the risk of infection, but isolation of the infected person away from the family is related to lower risk of infection. Other activities identified as high risk include dining in close proximity with the infected person, sharing food, and taking part in group activities The risk of infection substantially increases in enclosed environments compared with outdoor settings. For example, a systematic review of transmission clusters found that most superspreading events occurred indoors. Aerosol transmission can still factor during prolonged stay in crowded, poorly ventilated indoor settings (meaning transmission could occur at a distance >2 m). The role of faecal shedding in SARS-CoV-2 transmission and the extent of fomite (through inanimate surfaces) transmission also remain to be fully understood. Both SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-1 remain viable for many days on smooth surfaces (stainless steel, plastic, glass) and at lower temperature and humidity (eg, air conditioned environments). Thus, transferring infection from contaminated surfaces to the mucosa of eyes, nose, and mouth via unwashed hands is a possible route of transmission. This route of transmission may contribute especially in facilities with communal areas, with increased likelihood of environmental contamination. However, both SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 are readily inactivated by commonly used disinfectants, emphasising the potential value of surface cleaning and handwashing. SARS-CoV-2 RNA has been found in stool samples and RNA shedding often persists for longer than in respiratory samples; however, virus isolation has rarely been successful from the stool. No published reports describe faecal-oral transmission. In SARS-CoV-1, faecal-oral transmission was not considered to occur in most circumstances; but, one explosive outbreak was attributed to aerosolisation and spread of the virus across an apartment block via a faulty sewage system. It remains to be seen if similar transmission may occur with SARS-CoV-2. SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE 2, the host target cell receptor. Active replication and release of the virus in the lung cells lead to non-specific symptoms such as fever, myalgia, headache, and respiratory symptoms. In an experimental hamster model, the virus causes transient damage to the cells in the olfactory epithelium, leading to olfactory dysfunction, which may explain temporary loss of taste and smell commonly seen in covid-19. The distribution of ACE 2 receptors in different tissues may explain the sites of infection and patient symptoms. For example, the ACE 2 receptor is found on the epithelium of other organs such as the intestine and endothelial cells in the kidney and blood vessels, which may explain gastrointestinal symptoms and cardiovascular complications. Lymphocytic endotheliitis has been observed in postmortem pathology examination of the lung, heart, kidney, and liver as well as liver cell necrosis and myocardial infarction in patients who died of covid-19. These findings indicate that the virus directly affects many organs, as was seen in SARS-CoV-1 and influenzae. Much remains unknown. Are the pathological changes in the respiratory tract or endothelial dysfunction the result of direct viral infection, cytokine dysregulation, coagulopathy, or are they multifactorial? And does direct viral invasion or coagulopathy directly contribute to some of the ischaemic complications such as ischaemic infarcts? These and more, will require further work to elucidate. After viral entry, the initial inflammatory response attracts virus-specific T cells to the site of infection, where the infected cells are eliminated before the virus spreads, leading to recovery in most people. In patients who develop severe disease, SARS-CoV-2 elicits an aberrant host immune response. For example, postmortem histology of lung tissues of patients who died of covid-19 have confirmed the inflammatory nature of the injury, with features of bilateral diffuse alveolar damage, hyaline-membrane formation, interstitial mononuclear inflammatory infiltrates, and desquamation consistent with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and is similar to the lung pathology seen in severe Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). A distinctive feature of covid-19 is the presence of mucus plugs with fibrinous exudate in the respiratory tract, which may explain the severity of covid-19 even in young adults. This is potentially caused by the overproduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines that accumulate in the lungs, eventually damaging the lung parenchyma. Some patients also experience septic shock and multi-organ dysfunction. For example, the cardiovascular system is often involved early in covid-19 disease and is reflected in the release of highly sensitive troponin and natriuretic peptides. Consistent with the clinical context of coagulopathy, focal intra-alveolar haemorrhage and presence of platelet-fibrin thrombi in small arterial vessels is also seen. Cytokines normally mediate and regulate immunity, inflammation, and haematopoiesis; however, further exacerbation of immune reaction and accumulation of cytokines in other organs in some patients may cause extensive tissue damage, or a cytokine release syndrome (cytokine storm), resulting in capillary leak, thrombus formation, and organ dysfunction. Mechanisms underlying the diverse clinical outcomes Clinical outcomes are influenced by host factors such as older age, male sex, and underlying medical conditions, as well as factors related to the virus (such as viral load kinetics), host-immune response, and potential cross-reactive immune memory from previous exposure to seasonal coronaviruses (). Risk factors associated with the development of severe disease, admission to intensive care unit, and mortality Sex-related differences in immune response have been reported, revealing that men had higher plasma innate immune cytokines and chemokines at baseline than women. In contrast, women had notably more robust T cell activation than men, and among male participants T cell activation declined with age, which was sustained among female patients. These findings suggest that adaptive immune response may be important in defining the clinical outcome as older age and male sex is associated with increased risk of severe disease and mortality. Increased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines correlate with severe pneumonia and increased ground glass opacities within the lungs. In people with severe illness, increased plasma concentrations of inflammatory cytokines and biomarkers were observed compared with people with non-severe illness. Emerging evidence suggests a correlation between viral dynamics, the severity of illness, and disease outcome. Longitudinal characteristics of immune response show a correlation between the severity of illness, viral load, and IFN- α, IFN-γ, and TNF-α response. In the same study many interferons, cytokines, and chemokines were elevated early in disease for patients who had severe disease and higher viral loads. This emphasises that viral load may drive these cytokines and the possible pathological roles associated with the host defence factors. This is in keeping with the pathogenesis of influenza, SARS, and MERS whereby prolonged viral shedding was also associated with severity of illness. Given the substantial role of the immune response in determining clinical outcomes, several immunosuppressive therapies aimed at limiting immune-mediated damage are currently in various phases of development (). Immune response to the virus and its role in protection Covid-19 leads to an antibody response to a range of viral proteins, but the spike (S) protein and nucleocapsid are those most often used in serological diagnosis. Few antibodies are detectable in the first four days of illness, but patients progressively develop them, with most achieving a detectable response after four weeks. A wide range of virus-neutralising antibodies have been reported, and emerging evidence suggests that these may correlate with severity but wane over time. The duration and protectivity of antibody and T cell responses remain to be defined through studies with longer follow-up. CD-4 T cell responses to endemic human coronaviruses appear to manifest cross-reactivity with SARS-CoV-2, but their role in protection remains unclear. Further understanding of the pathogenesis for SARS-CoV-2 will be vital in developing therapeutics, vaccines, and supportive care modalities in the treatment of covid-19. More data are needed to understand the determinants of healthy versus dysfunctional response and immune markers for protection and the severity of disease. Neutralising antibodies are potential correlates of protection, but other protective antibody mechanisms may exist. Similarly, the protective role of T cell immunity and duration of both antibody and T cell responses and the correlates of protection need to be defined. In addition, we need optimal testing systems and technologies to support and inform early detection and clinical management of infection. Greater understanding is needed regarding the long term consequences following acute illness and multisystem inflammatory disease, especially in children. How would you describe SARS-CoV-2 transmission routes and ways to prevent infection? How would you describe to a patient why cough, anosmia, and fever occur in covid-19? What is the role of the cytokine storm and how could it inform the development of therapeutics, vaccines, and supportive care modalities? What is the window period when patients are most infectious? Why do some patients develop severe disease while others, especially children, remain mildly symptomatic or do not develop symptoms? What are the determinants of healthy versus dysfunctional response, and the biomarkers to define immune correlates of protection and disease severity for the effective triage of patients? What is the protective role of T cell immunity and duration of both antibody and T cell responses, and how would you define the correlates of protection?

What is Asthma and How Is it Diagnosed and Treated? : Exercise induced asthma is asthma that occurs after the start of exercise. It typically happens in the first 15 minutes of exercise. It's caused, we believe, by drying of the airways. Typically, we think of exercise induced asthma often is uncontrolled asthma, so there's many people that have asthma that's uncontrolled. Then it's just worsened or exacerbated by exercise. There's also patients where they only have exercise induced asthma. They start exercising and they start having symptoms. Typically it's in the first couple of minutes to 15 minutes of exercising. The individual will start feeling chest tightness, like difficulty breathing in and out. Whatever they're doing, they feel like they're not able to do it the best that they can. The difference between exercise induced asthma and just exertional shortness of breath is that exercise induced asthma often persists. 10-15 minutes later, the individual is still coughing, wheezing, having difficulty breathing until they use their albuterol rescue medications. They use their albuterol, they instantly feel better. A response to the rescue medication or albuterol also is very important to show that you have exercise induced asthma. There is exercise testing you can do to verify exercise-induced asthma. Meaning, that you can bring someone in, you can do exercise testing on them, and then repeat a spirometry and do other physiological testing to verify the diagnosis. The most important part of exercise induced asthma is warming up. There's about a 15 minute window where if you do a light warm up, as you start to exercise more, the airways open up naturally. The second thing is that you can use your albuterol or your rescue inhaler prior to exercise. Two puffs 30 minutes before you're exercising will also help treat asthma before it happens. You're in the middle of exercising an hour or two later and you're having symptoms, you can repeat the use of the albuterol. Want to use this on your website?

c186e662-17b5-491e-9fa4-8ed7fd43516c,"Not currently logged in Many patients lack an understanding of what ‘control’ means Despite the global advances made in the treatment for asthma, many studies have shown that asthma remains uncontrolled for a large proportion of patients, when assessed according to international guidelines. A comprehensive market research study has recently been conducted among patients across Asia, in order to try to understand patient perceptions of asthma control and confirms that 50% of patients are uncontrolled. Because patients lack an understanding of what control means, many patients considerably overestimate the extent to which they are successfully managing their condition. Asthma is a global health problem affecting over 300 million people worldwide, most of them children. Although the prevalence of asthma is slightly lower in Asia than in Europe, in certain parts of Southeast Asia and the Western Pacific Region, 107 million people are said to be sufferers and this number appears to be on the rise. The treatment of asthma presents a considerable economic cost: not just directly in terms of hospitalisation, medical treatment and healthcare resources, but also indirectly from time lost from work, absenteeism from work or school, and even premature death. In 2006, annual per patient direct cost of treatment ranged from USD108 to USD1,010 and constituted about 13% of the per capita GDP of countries in the Asia-Pacific. The cost of uncontrolled asthma has been estimated to be 50% more than that of the controlled disease. If countries want to rein in the burden of caring for asthma patients, better disease management is critical. Pharmaceutical company Mundipharma specialises in respiratory disease. One of its key aims is to find better solutions in asthma. Using the knowledge that despite advances in the treatment of asthma, many patients are still uncontrolled, it wanted to understand the patient attitudes and perceptions which might be driving this issue and so in 2012 it undertook the largest European market research study of adult asthma patients. The initiative was called REALISE - REcognise Asthma and LInk to Symptoms and Experience. In 2015, as it began to notice a rising trend of uncontrolled asthma in Asia, it asked pharmaceutical market research specialist Research Partnership to conduct a similar study in China, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Korea, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore and Taiwan. REALISE Asia was conducted online among 2,467 18-50 year-old adults suffering from asthma and sought to understand patients' perception of asthma control and attitudes toward treatment. The respondents were drawn from a large online panel of people living in Asia, and selected based on whether or not they suffered from asthma and met certain data quality checks. In order to ensure that the survey design was relevant to local audiences in each market, a working group consisting of physicians and respiratory specialists were called upon to review the questionnaire and ensure it took account of the local context. A field test of the questionnaire was also carried out with ten respondents per country. The results were published in the Journal of Asthma and Allergy in late 2015. It is worth bearing in mind that this survey was conducted online, using a large internet panel to recruit people suffering with asthma. Compared to other Asian studies utilising face-to-face or phone interviews, the lower average age and smaller female representation of respondents reflect the younger, male-predominant online population who undertook this survey. Therefore, the respondents in this study are probably more likely to be users of the internet and social media than the general Asian population. Consequently, this group may also have had better access to information about asthma management than the general population. However, despite these methodological considerations, the findings still shine a light on patient perceptions of asthma management. Knowledge of asthma control and inhaler medication remains low The survey found that 89% of patients believe they have their asthma under control and 81% think their level of asthma is not serious. Yet, using their reported symptoms as a means of measuring their actual asthma control, it was found that half of patients currently have uncontrolled asthma. Consequently, 40% of patients' perception does not match the GINA (Global Initiative for Asthma) defined control level. Worryingly, 38% of patients said they had visited the emergency department in the past year and 33.1% reported having been hospitalised for asthma in the past year. Over three-quarters required one or more courses of antibiotics to treat health problems related to their asthma and almost three-quarters had one or more course of corticosteroids. Two-thirds had to miss work because of their asthma. When asked about their view of asthma control around two-thirds said it meant managing attacks, either by controlling them with medical help, reducing the number of attacks, preventing attacks through medicine or avoidance of triggers. A quarter saw it as an absence of or minimal symptoms. These findings highlight the fact that asthma management in Asia is crisis-related rather than preventative. Patients define asthma control as being able to manage or relieve the exacerbations or attacks instead of preventing them. This was seen in the way they understood the concept of asthma control and reflected in their medication usage - reliever users outnumbered controller users by 2 to 1. There appears to be a disparity around the definition and understanding of the word control and more work needs to be done around the language of asthma to enable patients to understand what control means. The perception of control needs to shift from relief to prevention. One problem area seems to be with regards to the use of inhalers. Patients are required to use controller inhalers regularly in order to prevent an attack. Relief inhalers are used once an attack is underway. Yet many patients can't identify which of their inhalers is for controlling their asthma. The study revealed that only 20% could identify their medication. Patients are reluctant to use their inhalers because either they find them a nuisance or they don't want to be viewed by others as being 'sick'. Addressing some of these issues, around both inhaler use and inhaler perceptions, could help to improve treatment adherence and therefore improve disease management. Patients who did correctly identify their inhaler medication and had used it demonstrated better asthma control. An opportunity also exists to better educate asthma patients. In this study, a large majority (90%) were found to actively seek information on managing their condition, using mostly online sources (43%) and healthcare professionals (38%), but their knowledge of asthma control and inhaler medication remains low. Healthcare professionals are well placed to help patients with disease management and are a trusted source, according to patients completing this study. The internet also provides a great opportunity to augment the delivery of information through channels such as search engines, health-related websites and health forums. Social media channels remain a much under-utilised resource - a quick scan of the term 'asthma' and 'asthma inhaler use' in YouTube returns no results in the top 100 videos from pharmaceutical companies. Clearer information about what control is and should look like using language which is meaningful to patients could be presented using these types of channels in order to help bring about a change in patient perception and ultimately, behaviour.

Many competitive athletes have , but they don’t let it get in the way of living a full life or pursuing their dreams. National Jewish Health patient and professional freestyle skier is one of those people. Jake nearly died at birth due to severe asthma. As a child, Jake worked with doctors in the National Jewish Health to keep his asthma in control. As an adult, he now sees , who gave him a plan for his asthma. With Dr. Beuther’s help, Jake learned how to take his asthma seriously and manage his condition before it began to manage him. ""Never say you can't do something because of your asthma. Don't let it get you down."" - Jake Cohn Jake offers the following tips to help you manage your asthma in the cold winter weather. Temperature changes can be a shock to your lungs, so plan accordingly if you’re traveling from one climate to another Your lungs like warm, damp air, not cold, dry air; a humidifier in your home can make breathing more comfortable When going outside, wear a face mask and keep your face covered Breathe through your nose, not your mouth – the nasal passages warm the air and the tiny hairs in your nose help to get rid of irritants Ask your doctor and pharmacy about a 90-day supply of , that way you’ll always have enough on hand Get a every year and Take your regularly prescribed medication – it will help to prevent asthma flares If you can feel yourself getting sick, take some time out to nurse your body back to health. Asthma specialists at National Jewish Health can help you live a better life. Why? Because they understand that asthma and asthma treatment isn’t a one-size-fits-all approach. Because each person is different, so is his or her asthma. Jake recommends the following when it comes to asthma care: , as they are proactive not reactive; asthma care is more than just treating the symptoms, it’s about learning what causes them and how to prevent them in the future Once you find a doctor who is a good fit for you, stick with them so they can get to know you and your asthma patterns With the proper team and treatment on your side, you can achieve your goals just like Jake and other competitive athletes Don’t fall into the trap of thinking you can “tough it out” with your asthma. If you’re coughing all day long or are ignoring like excessive congestion or mucus, you could be making your health worse. The longer you ignore symptoms, the harder they can be to treat.

3761582a-5634-40a6-9653-4103f71c5be6,"It is common for athletes to have some breathing difficulties during or after the physical exertion of sports or other athletic events. There are several causes of these symptoms, but poorly managed asthma is the leading reason for this to occur, with up to a quarter of all athletes exhibiting signs of asthma. Exercise-induced asthma is characterized by inflammation and onset of asthma symptoms associated with high-intensity exercise. It is important that this is diagnosed when signs present to prevent severe complications but, when managed adequately, should not inhibit the ability or participation of the athlete in sport. Exercise-induced asthma presents shortly after the initiation of intensive physical exercise and involves inflammation and narrowing of the airways. This leads to the presentation of asthma symptoms such as difficulty breathing and wheezing. This type of asthma affects almost all people that suffer from asthma, but can also present in individuals that do not otherwise note symptoms of the condition. The cause of exercise-induced asthma can vary. It may be associated with the loss of heat or water from the body, or the inhalation of cold, dry air through the mouth and into the lungs. It is important that athletes and sports trainers are able to recognize the signs and symptoms of asthma, to initiate improved management techniques and overall outcomes. Diagnosis of exercise-induced asthma is usually made upon a description of the symptoms following an attack related to physical activity. Individuals usually report symptoms of shortness of breath, chest tightness, coughing, wheezing or decreased performances that commence shortly after the initiation of intense exercise. Exercise induced asthma also causes a reduction in the function of the lungs as a result of constriction of the bronchi induced by physical exercise. Spirometry testing shows that individuals with exercise-induced asthma experience a reduction in the volume of air that can be exhaled from the lungs in one second, referred to as the forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1). High levels of steroids put asthma patients at greater risk of serious side-effects Children with asthma having fewer attacks amid the coronavirus pandemic, study says Higher consumption of meat linked with increased wheezing in children Well-controlled asthma usually involves methods to reduce inflammation in the airways and the resulting symptoms, to allow the individual to participate in physical and sporting activities without inhibition. The specific management plan will depend on the unique needs of the individual. For example, an elite athlete requires a treatment that will effectively control symptoms and prevent progression, without impacting on their immediate sporting performance. Most athletes will require both a controller and a reliever medication to manage their asthma. The controller medication is used to reduce inflammation in the airways over the long term, reducing the risk of flare-ups. The reliever medication is used when symptoms are present to provide short-term relief of symptoms, reducing the constriction of the airways and allowing them to breathe It is important that athletes are constantly monitoring for early signs of asthma worsening, to allow them to react promptly and maintain control of the condition. Some athletes may only require reliever medications for intermittent symptoms and a “step up” approach to can be used to help prevent symptoms for athletes that notice the frequency of symptoms is increasing. Take precautions in cold weather (e.g. cover mouth and nose) Use a bronchodilator inhaler medication shortly before exercise When these techniques are implemented in combination with preventative pharmacological techniques to reduce inflammation in the airways, most athletes can continue to participate in exercise activities. http://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/dec/28/asthma-elite-athletes-study-swimmers-cyclist-eid http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1250269/ http://www.healthline.com/health-slideshow/famous-athletes-with-asthma http://www.webmd.boots.com/asthma/features/athletes-guide-exercise-induced-asthma Last Updated: Aug 23, 2018 Yolanda graduated with a Bachelor of Pharmacy at the University of South Australia and has experience working in both Australia and Italy.

5dcacc76-9fab-4fbe-acb9-7a091a1cbf36,"ARDS, acute respiratory failure, mechanical ventilation A medical emergency that can develop rapidly over hours to days. Happens when there is inability of the cardiopulmonary system to provide adequate oxygenation and/or CO2 removal to meet tissue needs. What is the ""general rule"" for ABGs in a patient with respiratory failure? CO2 greater than 50 and oxygen less than 50. pH is also less than 7.35. What do you have to remember about your patient with COPD who is in acute respiratory failure? COPD patients can live ""normally"" with higher levels of CO2 and lower levels of oxygen. For instance, a pt. with COPD can have a CO2 level of 50 and an oxygen level of 84 and that is their ""normal"" because they are have chronic respiratory failure just like pt. with C-spine injury or pt. with ALS. What is the normal CO2 (carbon dioxide/bicarb/HCO3) level? (90% of CO2 exists in the blood as bicarb, therefor your CO2 level is really a measure of your blood bicarb level). Defined as a deterioration in the gas exchange function of the lung that has developed insidiously or has persisted for a long period after an episode of acute respiratory failure. Absent of acute symptoms and the presence of chronic respiratory acidosis. What are the two causes of chronic respiratory failure and why? COPD and neuromuscular disease such as Guilliane Barre, myasthenia gravis, polio, and spinal cord injury. These disorders cause a dysfunction of the chest wall. What can cause failure of oxygenation or ventilation and further cause acute respiratory failure? -Decreased respiratory drive--> narcotics, anesthesia, sedatives-Dysfunction of chest wall--> neuromuscular disorders-Dysfunction of the lung parenchyma-->alveoli of the lungs (COPD, asbestosis, atelectatsis)Others include: asthma, CHF, pulmonary edema, ARDS, near drowning, CVA, IICP, PE, pleural effusion, pneumothorax, fx ribs (lungs can't expand), morbid obesity (chest wall is difficult to move) What is the main hallmark symptom of acute respiratory failure? What are the symptoms of acute respiratory failure? Dyspnea, tachypnea, nasal flaring, grunting, pursed lips, orthopnea, hypoxemia, hypercarbia, accessory muscle use. HARAT: hypoxemia-->anxiety, restlessness, agitation, tachycardia Somnolence (sleepiness), lethargy, sedation, flushing, slight drop in BP, coma as CO2 increases because it is sedating and flushing from the vasodilation. Which of these patients does the nurse recognize is at highest risk for acute respiratory failure? A. 40 yo female, smoker, taking oral contraceptivesB. 22 yo male, paraplegicC. 50 yo male, post hemicolectomy, receiving PCAD. 79 yo female with rapid atrial fibrillation, receiving heparin therapyC: Because the patient is post-op, he may experience pain that may worsen with taking deep breaths. The PCA can cause his RR to decrease which puts him at further risk for respiratory failure. Anyone post-op is at high risk for resp. failure! Impaired function of CNS (C-spine injury, drug OD, hemorrhage, sleep apnea), neuromuscular dysfunction (SCI, ALS), musculoskeletal dysfunction (chest trauma, malnutrition), pulmonary dysfunction (CF, asthma) Pneumonia, ARDS, heart failure, COPD, PE, restrictive lung diseases. True or false: Patients post-op from thoracic surgery or abdominal surgery are at a very high risk for developing acute respiratory failure? Why or why not? True. During this period of post-op, acute respiratory failure may be caused by the effects of anesthetics, analgesics and sedative agents, which may depress respirations or enhance the effects of opioids and lead to hypoventilation. Pain may also interfere with coughing & deep breathing. The nurse notices that her patient is experiencing dyspnea and tachypnea with increased depth and then an increased rate. She suspects acute respiratory failure. What is her priority action for this patient? What is usually the cause of acute respiratory failure in a patient post-op thoracic or abdominal surgery? Ventilation-perfusion mismatch is the usual cause of respiratory failure after major abdominal, cardiac or thoracic surgery. What is Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) and what are the characteristics? A severe form of acute lung injury characterized by a sudden and progressive pulmonary edema, increasing bilateral infiltrates on chest x-ray, PCWP of less than 18mmHg, hypoxemia unresponsive to oxygen supplementation regardless of the amount of PEEP, and the absence of an elevated left atrial pressure. After an acute traumatic event such as direct injury to the lungs like prolonged smoke inhalation, or indirect injury to the lungs such as shock. Non-pulmonary MODS (multiple organ dysfunction), often with sepsis. Mortality rate is very high at 36-44%!!! What are some signs and symptoms of respiratory failure? Accessory muscle use, initial hypertension then hypotension, if respiratory arrest there is 4 minutes until brain damage and 6 minutes until brain death, ** Shock, severe trauma, sepsis/SIRS (systemic inflammatory response syndrome), penumonia, acute pancreatitis, aspiration, PE (especially fat or amniotic fluid), drug ingestion/OD, hematologic disorders (DIC), multiple/massive blood transfusions-->TRALI (transfusion related acute lung injury), major surgery (bypass/cardio-pulmonary surgery). -Hypoxemia: despite supplemental oxygen and regardless of the amount of PEEP-Reduced lung compliance: damage type II pneumocytes which produce surfactant.-Bilateral infiltrates: on CXR (""white out"" or ground glass appearance Restlessness, tachycardia, tachypnea/extreme dyspnea & SOB, accessory muscle use, intercostal and substernal retractions, increased WOB, diaphoresis, grunting respiration, cyanosis. -Injury reduces normal blood flow to lungs-Platelets aggregate-Platelets release substances: histamine, serotonin, and bradykinin that inflame and damage the alveolar capillary membrane-The inflammatory substances above, especially histamine, increases capillary permeability which allows fluid to shift into interstitial spaces-As capillary permeability increases, proteins and more fluid leak out-This increases interstitial osmotic pressure and results in pulmonary edema-Because of the pulmonary edema, alveoli fill with fluid causing decreased blood flow and damage surfactant production.-It interferes with further surfactant production and without surfactant, alveoli collapse causing impaired gas exchange.-Patients RR increases but the sufficient oxygen cannot cross alveolar capillary membrane because of the damage-Carbon dioxide crosses more easily and is lost with every exhalation: O2 and CO2 levels decrease.-Pulmonary edema worsens and the inflammation leads to fibrosis which further impedes gas exchange.-The end result is hypoxemia leading to METABOLIC ACIDOSIS. A: Assault to te pulmonary systemR: Respiratory distressD: Decreased lung complianceS: Severe respiratory failure #1: TREAT UNDERLYING CAUSE-Mechanical ventilation-Hemodynamic support-Inotropics such as Norepinephrine (vasopressor) to vasoconstrictor blood vessels to help raise blood pressure (in shock)-Fluid balance-Nutrition support-Abx if needed-Dialysis if needed r/t decreased renal perfusion (increased waste in blood=decreased blood flow to kidneys=kidney failure), metabolic acidosis and fluid overload -Pulmonary fibrosis-Pulmonary artery hypertension-Right heart failure-MODS*Remember, ARDS frequently occurs as a complication of sepsis and SIRS as well as other morbidities.* What are the types of non-invasive positive pressure ventilation? In what circumstances should the nurse avoid giving a patient CPAP or BiPAP? Avoid in respiratory or cardiac arrest, somnolence, copious (abundant) secretions. Inflates lung by exerting positive pressure on the airway, pushes air in, forces the alveoli to expand during inspiration. What are the hemodynamic effects that both invasive and non-invasive positive pressure ventilation has on the body? Decreased venous return causes decreased BP, decreased cardiac output. What are the simple differences between CPAP and BiPAP? CPAP can be worn at home and BiPAP must me worn at the hospital. Describe the ventilatory mode Assist Control (AC). Internal positive pressure ventilation that has a set FiO2, set tidal volume (based on body weight), set breaths which the patient can trigger the ventilator with spontaneous breaths between mandatory breaths-also called ""breathing over the vent"" - when this happens the RR may increase from the set RR, but the tidal volume with stay the same as what the vent is set on. True or false: endotracheal intubation or tracheostomy is usually necessary to use positive-pressure ventilators. What are the three types of invasive positive-pressure ventilators and how are they classified? Pressure-cycled ventilatorVolume-cycled ventilatorHigh-Frequency Oscillator (really a mode of ventilation)**These types of positive pressure vents are classified by the method of ending the inspiratory phase of respiration. Describe a Pressure-Cycled positive pressure ventilator. This type of positive pressure vent delivers a flow of air (inspiration) until it reaches a preset pressure and then cycles off, and expiration occurs passively.*Limitations: volume or air or oxygen can change when patient's airway resistance or compliance changes therefore the tidal volume may be inconstant and may compromise ventilation so its only used for short-term. Describe a Volume-Cycled positive pressure ventilator. This type of positive pressure vent delivers a preset amount of air with each inspiration, once the preset volume is delivered to the patient, the vent cycles off and exhalation occurs passively. This allows a relatively constant, consistent adequate amount of oxygen with each breath despite varying airway pressures. *This is most commonly used because of the consistent amount of pressure delivered. Describe the ventilator mode High-Frequency Oscillator. This mode can deliver high respiratory rates that are accompanied by very low tidal volumes and high airway. Can get up to 300BPM in which you would just document that ""patient has positive chest wiggle."" What kind of patients are candidates for noninvasive positive pressure vents like CPAP and BiPAP? -COPD-Sleep apnea-Acute/Chronic Respiratory Failure-Acute Pulmonary Edema What lab is extremely important to check before your patient gets intubated and why? Potassium! Must check potassium before intubation because Succinylcholine is given to relax respiratory muscles prior to intubation and this made can raise potassium..Therefore, check your patients potassium level before giving Succinylcholine--if their potassium level is high or on the verge of being high, you don't want to give this med, you can get a different med ordered. In order to use CPAP, the patient must be able to do what? Patient must be able to breathe indecently in order to use this kind of ventilation. Continuous Positive Airway Pressure provides positive pressure to the airways throughout the respiratory cycle. It can be used as adjunct to mechanical ventilation. The positive pressure us used with a leak-proof mask to keep the alveoli open, thereby preventing respiratory failure. What is BiPAP and what patients is it mostly used for? Bilevel Positive Airway Pressure offers independent control of inspiratory and expiratory pressures while providing pressure support ventilation. Each inspiration can be initiated either by the patient or by the machine if it is programmed with a backup rate which ensures that the patient receives a set number of breaths per minute.*BiPAP is mostly used for patients who require ventilatory assistance at night (severe COPD/sleep apnea) This type of ventilatory mode is used to assist spontaneous breathing in a ventilated patient. The patient triggers the ventilator-the vent delivers a flow up to a preset limit depending on the desired minute volume, the patient continues breath for as long as they wish, and the flow is cycled off when a certain peak inspiratory flow (usually 25%) has been reached. Do tidal volumes vary in Pressure Support Ventilation? What happens to the pressure when patient gets stronger with this mode? Tidal volumes with this vent mode may vary just as they do with normal breathing. Pressure decreases as patient gets stronger. How does Pressure Regulated Volume Control (PRVC) and Adaptive Pressure Ventilation (APV) work? Volume is controlled by the ventilator and the pressure is regulated, set tidal volume delivered-but pressure is adjusted from breath to breath based on changes in airway resistance and compliance and WOB.*For example, if volume is too low, pressure will increase on next breath. If pressure is too high, the pressure decreases on the next breath.* How does PEEP (Positive End Expiratory Pressure) work? This vent mode holds end of expiration and hold alveoli open to allow more time and surface area for oxygen diffusion.*The idea of PEEP is similar to blowing up a balloon and not letting it completely deflate before blowing it back up again--think about how the alveoli are forced open for a longer time with PEEP to allow for more oxygen diffusion.* PEEP is especially useful for severe hypoxemia (atelectasis and ARDS) to keep alveoli open because alveoli are closed with ARDS r/t surfactant damage and collapsed with atelectasis. If patient is on 100% oxygen, using PEEP can help decrease what? PEEP can decrease the % of oxygen that patients needs, especially if it's a really high percentage like 100% oxygen. This mode can cause hypotension and decreased cardiac output. Although all usual modes of ventilation can be used for weaning, which are the most common that are used? This weaning mode allows the patient to breathe spontaneously while applying positive pressure throughout the respiratory cycle to keep the alveoli open and promote oxygenation.*CPAP is often used in conjunction with PSV for weaning* The nurse should assess for what when patient is on a CPAP/PSV wean? Nurse should assess for...-Tachypnea-Tachycardia-Reduced tidal volumes-Decreasing oxygen saturations-Increasing carbon dioxide levels What are some complications of mechanical ventilation? -Impaired communication r/t intubation-Bucking/fighting the vent: Happens when patient attempts to breathe out during ventilator's mechanical inspiratory phase or when there is an increased abdominal muscle effort from patient.-Barotrauma: Excessive positive pressure can cause lung damage which may result in a spontaneous pneumothorax-Volutrauma: Excessive tidal volumes can cause lung damage-Infection: (VAP!!) Report high temp or change in color or odor of sputum to physician for follow up-Atelectasis: Clear patient's secretions-GI complications: Usually on Protonix to decrease risk of stress ulcers)-Immobility: Can lead to DVTS-make sure your patient has SCDs that work!!-Tracheoesophageal fistula-Aspiration Describe the mode SIMV (Synchronized Intermittent Mandatory Ventilation) that is sometimes used for weaning? SIMV has set mandatory breaths but between breaths the patient can breath spontaneously and it helps with strengthening and reconditioning. -Suctioning/clearing the airway: if patient is coughing, if you can hear secretions, if high pressure alarm goes off.-Position: A client in respiratory failure should be at semi-fowlers (30-45 degrees_)-Percussion PT if available with specialty beds-VAP prevention How should patient in respiratory failure be positioned during suctioning? Excessive ventilation can cause what? Underventilation can cause what? Excessive ventilation: pO2 high (resp alkalosis)Underventilation: pCO2 high (resp acidosis) How can you as the nurse prevent Ventilator Associated Pneumonia (VAP)? ZAP the VAP by proper hand washing, HOB elevated 30 degrees, oral care q4-6h, tooth brush q8-12h, moisturize lips, verify feeding tube placement with CXR, change ventilator circuits if visibly soiled, intubation with tube to facilitate subglottic secretion removal, ""bundle"" to prevent VAP. The Ventilator Bundle contains four components, elevation of the head of the bed to 30-45 degrees, daily 'sedation vacation' and daily assessment of readiness to extubate, peptic ulcer disease prophylaxis, and deep venous thrombosis prophylaxis. What is the purpose of sedation for patients on a vent? To decrease oxygen demand and promote compliance with ventilator. -Versed-Propofol/Diprivan-Lorazepam/Ativan-Dexmedetomidine/Precedex What is a sedation vacation and how often is it performed? Sedation is turned off daily (usually in the morning) and the patient is assessed to see if we can extubate. What is the reversal agent for benzodiazepine overdose? It is this color because it has lipids present in the solution. What medications can be added to sedation if patient is experiencing pain? True or false: Sedation may be given via OGT if the patient has a functional gut. True. But sedation via OGT with a functional gut can only be given in acute situations What is the mechanism of action of a neuromuscular blockade? Blocks the effects of acetycholine at the myoneural junction to reduce oxygen demand. Patient cannot contract any muscles including the diaphragm (they can't breath on their own). What are some paralyzing agents/drugs that are given? -Vecuronium (Norcuron)-Atracurium (Tracrium)-Rocuromium (Zemeron) What is the proper nursing action before administering a paralyzing agent? Give the patient sedation (versed, proposal) before giving the paralytic agent because although all of their muscles are paralyzed, they still have sensation and can feel pain, and may become overly anxious. If patient is having pain, can also give analgesic. How does the nurse monitor a patient who is paralyzed from a drug that she administered? BIS monitoring-BiSpectral brain wave analysis, the higher the number, the more awake the patient is. 100%=most awake. What are some additional interventions for respiratory failure? Hypothermia to decrease oxygen demands on the body.Pharmacologic management.Assessing/teaching to prevent recurrence or exacerbation. What devices are necessary to provide nutritional support via enteral feedings for your vented patient? Tubing, x-ray to verify placement, irrigation set, feeding ""jevity"".Different devices include-Dobhoff-NG-J-tube-PEG tube**PPN can go thru peripheral line**TPN needs central line What devices are necessary to provide nutritional support via parenteral feedings for your vented patient? IV (PICC/Central line), saline flushes**PPN can go thru peripheral line**TPN needs central line What are the requirements that patient must have to consider beginning their wean? -Afebrile-Clear CXR- -25cm pressure inspiratory-Able to clear secretions on their own-H/H stable-Pt needs equal or less than 50% FiO2 (if they need anything higher, they cannot begin wean) -VS q15min-Emotional support, hold patients hand-Elevate HOB Increase in tempHyper or hypotensionTachycardiaOverly anxiousLow oxygen saturations (low pulse ox) What is an appropriate drug of choice to promote comfort during terminal wean? How does nursing care continute with terminal wean? Still give mouth care, turn patient, don't change a painful dressing if patient is on a terminal wean--whats the point? YOU WANT TO MAKE PATIENT COMFORTABLE. The mechanical ventilator high pressure alarm sounds continuously. What should the nurse do? The vents low pressure alarm is going off, what should the nurse check? Check to see if there are any air leaks in the tubing. A patient has been receiving mechanical ventilation for three days, he opens his eyes to commands and assists vent. Do you think he is ready to begin weaning? Yes because he is assisting the vent and breathing on his own, he is awake and alert because he obeys command. Your patient has been on a vent for three days, is awake and oriented and on an FiO2 of 80%. Do you think he is ready to begin weaning? No, because he is still on an FiO2 greater than 50%. If FiO2 is greater than 50% patient is not a candidate to begin weaning off vent. Your patient has been on a vent for a few days, is on AC, 100% and 15 PEEP. Are they ready for wean? No!! In order to initiate wean, PEEP must be 5 or less and FiO2 must be less than 50%. This patient still has a ways to go. Your patient has been on a vent for three days because of an acute MI. Are they ready for wean after three days? No because the MI was acute-it will take a longer time for pt. to be stable. A client who has had a lung resection is receiving mechanical ventilation and intravenous vecuronium (Norcuron). What additional medication can the nurse anticipate administering? Lorazepam.

This chapter will discuss the clinical syndromes involving the respiratory tract and the lung parenchyma that occur in relation to the direct irritant or other toxic effects of the gas. Syndromes resulting from secondary allergic or immune-mediated responses to inhaled toxic agents, such as occupational asthma and hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP), will not be discussed. Symptoms and signs of irritant gas inhalation injury vary and can occur immediately after exposure or have a delayed reaction, producing injury anywhere along the respiratory tract, from the nares to the alveoli. Injuries to the nasopharynx and larynx are generally more immediate, as these areas are most susceptible to both thermal injury and the highest concentrations of the irritant, especially the water-soluble agents. Injury to the tracheobronchial tree can result in airway edema, bronchorrhea, and bronchoconstriction a few hours following exposure. As a result, exposure may lead to inflammatory changes, including tracheitis, bronchitis, bronchospasm or bronchiolitis. Injuries to the epithelium and the capillary-endothelial interface in the distal airways and alveoli are associated with increased permeability, presenting with delayed clinical sequelae, such as interstitial edema, diffuse alveolar damage, or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The extent of injury is influenced by the intensity of the exposure, solubility of the gas, chemical reactivity and toxicity, as well as particle size. Host factors which have been reported to contribute to the extent of injury include age, use of respiratory protection, as well as co-morbid conditions. In general, immediate removal of the patient and any rescue personnel from the exposure is of primary importance, but cannot always be readily achieved without risks. Injury or death in first responders is a considerable problem that must be avoided by vigilant attention, preparation, and appropriate personal protections. In terms of managing the victim exposed to irritants, protecting the airway is of utmost priority. If uncertainty exists, proceeding with intubation is recommended. Management of ensuing hypoxemia will most likely be necessary for patients with significant exposures. For those patients who develop acute lung injury (ALI) or ARDS, management principles are similar to those with ALI/ARDS from other causes. This includes lung protective ventilation strategies and optimal fluid balance, though specific supporting data is limited for such recommendations. If bronchoconstriction/bronchospasm is present, bronchodilators (albuterol, loevosalbutamol, or racemic epinephrine in normal saline) have been recommended to relieve airway obstruction. Following inhalation injury, continued airway clearance with both pharmacologic agents and mechanical methods are essential. Mucolytics, such as N-acetylcysteine (NAC) and aerosolized heparin, can be used and have been proposed to decrease lung injury, although controlled trials are pending. The role of other specific treatment strategies, including the role of glucocorticoids, will be discussed below with each irritant agent. In cases of toxic inhalation gas exposures, special care must be taken to assure that first responders and healthcare providers are protected from primary and secondary exposures during rescue efforts. In general, with the exception of hydrogen cyanide, there are no specific diagnostic tests to detect for inhalation of most toxic agents. Diagnosis is based on exposure history and symptoms, knowledge of the environmental risks and testing of the exposure areas. The standard for confirming a diagnosis of inhalation injury is via direct airway examination with fiberoptic bronchoscopy. Findings on bronchoscopic evaluation include, but are not limited to: carbonaeceous deposits, erythema, edema, bronchorrhea, mucosal sloughing, necrosis, and bronchial obstruction. Evidence of lung parenchymal involvement can also be evaluated with high resolution computed tomography (HRCT), although limitations include optimal timing and interpretation in the setting of normal bronchoscopy. Findings of ground glass opacification with or without consolidations and interstitial markings on HRCT can be used to complement bronchoscopy findings and assist in determining the severity of the inhalation injury. Pulmonary hemorrhage is reportedly unusual as a presentation of irritant gas inhalation injury and should raise suspicion of other disorders. Source: At room temperatures, chlorine is a greenish-yellow gas and has a strong pungent odor. Because chlorine is denser than air, it tends to settle in low lying areas. Its odor threshold for detection by exposure victims is below its toxic level and serves as a warning of its presence that may be helpful. Chlorine species are highly reactive and intensely irritating. Exposures can occur from unintentional industrial exposures, including accidental release during transport, during water purification, inhalation from swimming pool-related accidents and inhalation using household cleaning products. Toxicity: Tissue injury may result from exposure to chlorine and its metabolites – hydrochloric acid (HCl), hypochlorous acid (HOCl), and resulting oxygen free radicals. Chlorine is a highly water-soluble compound that when dissolved in water on the mucosal surfaces form hydrochloric and hypochlorous acids, as follows: Hydrochloric acid is highly water-soluble and consequently primarily affects the epithelia of the ocular conjunctivae and upper respiratory mucous membranes. Acute symptoms include lacrimation, as well as nasal and mucous membranes irritation. The acute symptoms may be followed by hoarseness, cough, a choking sensation, chest pain and dyspnea. Pulmonary edema is the major lower airway finding associated with chlorine toxicity and clinically can lead to hypoxia and respiratory failure. Intense bronchospasm as well as cell necrosis also can result. The onset of pulmonary edema can be minutes or hours following exposure, depending upon severity. Treatment: The initial approach to toxic chlorine exposure is to remove the individual from the hazardous environment immediately if at all possible. Given the density of chlorine, it is important to remove the patient from the environment in which the exposure occurred and remove clothing that might be saturated with the gas. Bedrest has been recommended for moderate-to-severe exposure because increased activity reportedly may quicken the onset of pulmonary edema. Use of bronchodilators has been recommended for consideration in treating associated bronchospasm. Secondary bacterial infection risks should also be considered. Treatment of chlorine gas inhalation injuries with corticosteroids is controversial and is supported by several animal studies and case reports, but no human clinical comparative study. In the absence of complications, the adverse effects of chlorine inhalation injury generally resolve in 3 to 5 days. Source: Phosgene is a very commonly used industrial chemical compound in the production of dyes, pesticides and plastics. Toxicity: Phosgene has relatively low water solubility and therefore tends to spare the nose and upper airway. The main clinical toxic effects are more distant in the respiratory bronchioles and alveoli. When phosgene interacts with water, hydrochloric acid is released, leading to damage of the alveolar-capillary interface and subsequent pulmonary edema. At low-level exposures, toxic effects are commonly mild cough and dyspnea coupled with chest discomfort. At higher concentrations, a more severe cough with laryngospasm and possible pulmonary edema may occur. Episodes of sudden death have resulted from very intense exposures of phosgene which may have been due to severe laryngospasm. Symptoms are normally apparent within several hours following phosgene exposure. Treatment: Similar to chlorine exposure, pulmonary edema is the most serious symptoms of phosgene toxicity. Bedrest has been recommended to help reduce the risk of pulmonary edema following an exposure. Pulmonary edema following phosgene inhalation is not due to hypervolemia, thus, diuretics are considered contraindicated. Respiratory failure is a risk, and, anticipating deterioration, there should be a low threshold for intubation. Alternative treatments with pentoxifylline, steroids, NSAIDs and intra-tracheally administered N-acetylcysteine have been shown to mitigate lung injury in some animal models, though human clinical trial data is limited regarding the effectiveness of these agents in phosgene exposure. Source: The farming industry is the main consumer of ammonia, using approximately one third of all ammonia produced in the U.S. as components of fertilizer and animal feed. Ammonia is also used in the production of pharmaceuticals, explosives, pesticides, textiles, flame-retardants, plastics, paper and petroleum products, rubber and cyanide. Ammonia is also found in many common household cleaning products. Ammonia is released in gas phase with the combustion of many of the compounds listed above, leading to high risk for substantial inhalation exposure. Toxicity: Because ammonia is highly water-soluble, it is well absorbed by the upper respiratory tract mucosa. However, ammonia is somewhat unique in having a propensity to affect both the upper and lower airways proximally and distally. Ammonia forms ammonium hydroxide, a potent alkali that can lead to tissue necrosis of lower airways. Symptomatically, ammonia exposure can present with bronchospasm, acute lung injury, increased pulmonary secretions and cough. Treatment: Management of toxic exposure to ammonia is largely supportive. Medical therapy is directed towards management of hypoxia, bronchospasm, acute lung injury, hypovolemia and burns of the skin and eyes. Source: Sulfur dioxide is a chemical compound commonly released through the burning of rubber products and the combustion of coal, oil and cooking fuel. Toxicity: Sulfur dioxide is very irritating to the airway mucosa and eyes even at low concentrations. It can lead to the destruction of ciliated mucosa that can predispose patients to secondary pulmonary bacterial infection. High concentration sulfur dioxide exposures may be fatal with both lower and upper airway injury and can lead to diffuse pulmonary edema. Treatment: Management of toxic exposure to sulfur dioxide is largely supportive, with airway and ventilatory support. Source: Various occupations can predispose patients to exposures, including arc welders, firefighters, military and aerospace personnel, and those working with explosives. Nitrogen dioxide toxicity is also observed in conditions where NO is formed from non-combustible sources, such as in silo fillers, where nitrogen dioxide is a by-product of anaerobic fermentation of crops. Toxicity: Several mechanisms are involved in NO induced lung toxicity. NO is converted to NO, HNO (nitric acid), and HNO (nitrous acid) in distal airways and is toxic to ciliated airway cells and surrounding pneumocytes. Free radicals in the terminal bronchioles following exposure lead to protein oxidation, lipid peroxidation and subsequent cell membrane damage. Toxic NO exposure also alters macrophage and immune function with an increased susceptibility to infection. Clinically evident injury is usually delayed at onset for up to 72 hours. Treatment: The primary treatment of nitrous dioxide induced respiratory illness is supportive therapy directed at correction of hypoxemia, respiratory failure, and secondary infection. High-dose corticosteroids have been used in the treatment of pulmonary manifestations but supportive data is only anecdotal. Source: Hydrogen sulfide (both a chemical irritant and an asphyxiant) is present largely in industrial processes, including petroleum refining, tanning, mining, wood-pulp processing, rayon manufacturing, sugar-beet processing, and hot-asphalt paving. Toxicity occurs at the industrial level from oil drilling, wastewater treatment, and natural gas field leaks. Hydrogen sulfide also occurs in nature from organic decomposition of sulfur compounds, hence the name, “swamp gas” or “sewer gas.” However, physicians should be aware that the mixture of household products can also produce this toxic gas, leading to potential inhalation injury. Toxicity: The major route of exposure and toxicity of hydrogen sulfide is via inhalation. It is a colorless, flammable, highly toxic, and slightly heavier than air gas that can accumulate in enclosed, poorly-ventilated, and low-lying areas. The strong “rotten egg” odor of the gas is not a reliable warning sign for toxicity due to olfactory fatigue at high concentrations or continuous low concentrations. Exposure at low concentrations (50ppm) can immediately affect the nose, throat, and lower respiratory tract, causing bronchial or lung parenchymal hemorrhage. Higher concentrations can cause immediate or delayed effects (up to 72 hours) with bronchitis and pulmonary edema. Treatment: Management is generally supportive with immediate removal of the patient from the environment, high flow 100% oxygen, and early recognition for intubation in severe cases. Additional medications include inhalation of amyl nitrite with injections of 3% sodium nitrite (to induce methemoglobinemia) and aerosolized bronchodilators for bronchospasm. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy may be utilized as well, as oxygen promotes sulfide metabolism. Chemical compounds that impair oxygen exchange at the cellular level are commonly referred to as asphyxiants. Common compounds in this group include carbon monoxide and hydrogen cyanide. Source: Carbon monoxide is formed when organic compounds burn incompletely. The most common sources are motor vehicle exhaust, smoke from fires, engine fumes and non-electric heaters. Carbon monoxide poisoning is often associated with malfunctioning or obstructed exhaust systems. Toxicity: Carbon monoxide causes adverse effects in humans by combining with hemoglobin to form carboxyhemoglobin (HbCO) in the blood, which cannot adequately transport oxygen. Carbon monoxide is rapidly transported across the alveolar membrane and preferentially binds with hemoglobin in place of oxygen and shifts the hemoglobin-oxygen dissociation curve to the left, further impairing oxygen unloading at the tissue level. The reduced oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood, leads to tissue hypoxia. Additionally, myoglobin and mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase may also be to be adversely affected by carbon monoxide poisoning. Treatment: The treatment for carbon monoxide poisoning is high-dose oxygen. If poisoning is severe a hyperbaric pressure chamber may be used to give even higher doses of oxygen, and reduce the carboxyhemoglobin levels. Source: Hydrogen cyanide is released from combustion of a number of products, including polyurethane, plastics, furniture and mattresses, as well as the burning of wool, silk and carpets. Hydrogen cyanide poisoning most commonly occurs in the face of smoke inhalation injury, often concurrently with carbon monoxide poisoning. In such settings, the red blood cell cyanide level has been reported to correlate more closely with mortality than the carbon monoxide level during co-exposures. Hydrogen cyanide exposures also occur following industrial accidents and intentional exposures (military and terrorism). Toxicity: The primary effect of cyanide poisoning consists of the impairment of oxidative phosphorylation, a process whereby oxygen is utilized for the production of essential cellular energy sources in the form of ATP (adenosine triphosphate). A necessary part of this process is transfer of electrons from NADH (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, supplied via the Kreb’s Cycle) to oxygen via a series of electron carriers. This is catalyzed by the cytochrome oxidase enzyme system in the mitochondria, and the impairment arises from the inhibition by cyanide of cytochrome oxidase a3. A number of other complex interactions of cyanide have also been implicated in its toxic pathophysiology. Treatment: Both hydroxocobalamine or a combination of nitrite/sodium thiosulfate are approved for treatment of cyanide poisoning in the United States. Hydroxocobalamine is rapidly becoming the treatment of choice in most cases, and is approved for use in suspected cyanide (not yet confirmed) poisoning situations. In the setting of smoke inhalation injury, hydroxocobalamin may be a better alternative if there are concerns for carboxyhemoglobin level elevations that cause the formation of methemoglobinemia by nitrite treatment to be contraindicated. Source: Nitrogen mustard is a vesicant blistering agent that has been used as a military weapon throughout the 20th century. Large stockpiles of nitrogen mustard still exist. Toxicity: Nitrogen mustard can be absorbed quickly through the skin, mucous membranes and respiratory tract. Nitrogen mustard causes epithelial layer sloughing of the proximal airways and more distal lower airways. Clinically mustard exposures present with dyspnea and wheezing from the pulmonary standpoint. Symptoms are often delayed for hours to days after initial exposure, but subclinical changes occur earlier. Secondary infection is common following acute mustard inhalation exposure and may be further exacerbated by systemic immune-compromise from bone-marrow suppression following high-dose exposures. Chronic stricture formation may develop months to years after exposure. Whether obstructive or other late sequelae occur from mustard exposure is controversial. Treatment: Treatment is supportive, with a low threshold for intubation and ventilatory support following acute exposure. The role of steroids is unclear. Chronic strictures have been treated with recurrent dilation and stent placement as needed. Patients should be monitoring and followed up based on the individual gas exposure and whether or not there is a specific treatment or antidote. Otherwise, treatment is primarily supportive and patients should be observed closely for resolution of the primary presenting symptoms and signs. Depending on the exposure, it is important to watch out for late pulmonary sequelae, which may manifest clinically between 10 to 14 days after initial exposure. For instance, patients exposed to ammonia, nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide may subsequently develop bronchiolitis obliterans (BO). In some of these cases, the BO is initially accompanied by – but may be followed by – the appearance of organizing pneumonia (BOOP) which may be diffuse and present as ARDS. Although these syndromes can resolve completely, some may progress to late pulmonary fibrosis. Inhalation of toxic gases leads to injury through a variety of mechanisms. Commonly, inhalation of irritant gases causes inflammation of the airway when gas particles dissolve in the respiratory mucosa, causing acidic or alkaline free radical release. Toxic inhalants may be directly toxic to the respiratory tract (including such gases as ammonia, nitrogen dioxide and sulfur dioxide), which induce a response resulting in systemic inflammatory damage, or can cause asphyxiation through displacement of oxygen or oxygen utilization (cyanide, carbon monoxide). The extent of exposure and subsequent effects depend on several factors, including the concentration of toxin in the atmosphere, the duration of exposure and particle size. The concentration-time product may not be linearly related to damage effects. Particle size is an important factor because it determines whether the agent will penetrate the respiratory tract and where it will be deposited. More water-soluble gases (ammonia, chlorine, sulfur dioxide and hydrogen chloride) are rapidly absorbed in the upper airway, causing mucosal membrane irritation that can immediately alert individuals to the exposure and potentially facilitate recognition (possibly reducing subsequent exposure). Less soluble gases (nitrogen oxides, phosgene, ozone) may not dissolve until they are well into the distal airways and thus, result in more prolonged exposure prior to recognition. The deeper penetrating gases are less likely to produce the warning signs of a toxic exposure, resulting in severe bronchiolitis, and symptoms may not develop until a considerable post exposure lag-time (often 12 hours or more). A common pathologic finding of distal airway injury from these gases is diffuse alveolar damage, clinically manifested as ARDS. Due to lack of consistent diagnostic methods, the incidence of inhalation injury from all chemical irritants is not readily available. Treatment is mainly supportive; however, early detection of signs and symptoms may decrease the risk of long-term pulmonary sequelae. In cases of severe burn injury, mortality is increased when there is involvement of inhalation injury. In addition, studies have shown that mortality rises when there is concomitant inhalation injury and pneumonia present compared to inhalation injury alone. Although empiric treatment with antibiotics is not routinely recommended, evaluating for early signs of infection is essential. A majority of the patients with mild to moderate irritant exposure have a self-limited course with full recovery seen within 48 to 72 hours. Most patients do not show spirometry changes and do not report significantly decreased quality of life. Rare long term pulmonary sequelae, often associated with severe exposure, include tracheal stenosis, bronchiectasis, bronchiolitis obliterans, and interstitial fibrosis. The severity of the airway and lung parenchymal injury depends on the extent of exposure, type of irritant, and host factors, most notably age. “Medical Management Guidelines for Hydrogen Sulfide”.

4586450d-e4e1-4a32-be05-a24ddcce4180,"» » Respiratory Failure in Pregnancy (ARDS [acute respiratory distress syndrome] during pregnancy; ALI [acute lung injury] during pregnancy; Ventilatory failure during pregnancy; Severe pneumonia during pregnancy; pulmonary embolus [PE] during pregnancy; Amniotic fluid embolus) ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome) during pregnancy Pregnancy imposes a significant challenge to management of the patient with respiratory failure, and providers must consider both maternal and fetal well-being at all stages of care. An understanding of the normal physiologic circulatory and respiratory changes of pregnancy is critical in approaching the critically ill pregnant patient. There are 2 main types of respiratory failure encountered during pregnancy: ventilatory failure (due to severe asthma, PE, circulatory shock, or neuromuscular disorders) and hypoxemic (due to pneumonia, aspiration, heart failure, ALI/ARDS, or amniotic fluid embolus). Special considerations of oxygen delivery to the fetus (determined by maternal cardiac output, hemoglobin, and oxygen saturation) and oxygen consumption (driven by metabolic demands of both mother and fetus, and significantly increased during labor or cesarean birth) factor into decision-making in this population. The critical care team caring for a pregnant patient must include the obstetrician and neonatologist, and should have a detailed plan regarding fetal monitoring, labor monitoring, acceptable pharmacotherapy during pregnancy, and contingency plans if delivery is imminent. This section will provide an approach to the pregnant patient with hypoxemic or ventilatory failure. Hypoxemia — often mild in ventilatory failure, profound if hypoxemic failure CO2 retention — often underrecognized since the normal PCO2 in pregnancy = 30 mmHg. A POC2 of 40, especially when the respiratory rate is high, indicates respiratory failure during pregnancy. PE: detected by perfusion lung scan, ventilation-perfusion (VQ) scan, or chest computed tomography (CT) Pulmonary edema, due to either increased hydrostatic pressure or increased capillary leak (Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3 and Figure 4) Unload work of breathing / Minimize oxygen consumption Aggressively bronchodilate patients who manifest severe airflow obstruction You expect a rapid (2 – 12 hour) improvement in maternal condition If there is no significant improvement after 30-60 minutes of NIV, INTUBATE. Non-invasive ventilation may be especially effective for 2 conditions: Cardiogenic / high-pressure pulmonary edema, including beta-agonist-induced pulmonary edema Non-invasive ventilation has a high rate of failure for pneumonia or ALI. Intubation is indicated for refractory hypoxemia, ongoing high work of breathing, airway obstruction, or shock. Intubation is more complicated in pregnancy (see Emergency Management below), but can be done safely and rapidly by experienced personnel. Maintain adequate maternal cardiac output, as oxygen delivery to the fetus is proportional to cardiac output. The physiologic response to pregnancy is a 50% increase in maternal cardiac output by full term. Inadequate maternal cardiac output can have drastic consequences for the fetus. The fetal environment is hypoxic at baseline, and adapts with a high fetal cardiac output and fetal hemoglobin to maximally extract oxygen. It is generally accepted that a higher maternal oxygen saturation (>95%, corresponding to PaO2 > 67) is favorable to optimize maternal oxygen delivery to the placenta. Fetus and placenta increase resting oxygen consumption by 20%, and may double O2 consumption in the setting of active labor and delivery. Minimizing oxygen consumption by ventilatory support — invasive or non-invasive — as well as tocolysis or anesthesia (for labor) can have an important effect on maternal (and thus fetal) oxygenation. Involve maternal medicine experts immediately and establish a plan for fetal monitoring if appropriate based on gestational age. If appropriate based on fetal age, consideration of the timing and route of delivery must be entertained. Diagnose and treat the underlying cause of respiratory failure. Pregnancy diminishes the oxygen reserve. Pregnant patients will desaturate more quickly and may be more difficult to pre-oxygenate given their lower O2 reserve, higher resting O2 consumption, and reliance on a high minute ventilation at baseline. A rapid sequence induction with cricoid pressure and orotracheal intubation is generally recommended. Anesthetists should be alert to the increased risk of aspiration due to impaired gastric emptying in the gravid patient. Given the propensity to desaturate, if a difficult airway is anticipated, awake intubation with adequate topical anesthesia is recommended. Patients with severe airflow obstruction should be given maximal bronchodilator therapy along with parenteral corticosteroids to improve bronchoconstriction. Non-invasive ventilation can be considered for pregnant patients with a high work of breathing provided the following: Oxygen deficit is modest (FiO2 < 60% to maintain SaO2 > 95%) Patient’s condition is expected to improve rapidly (< 24 hours) Patient does not require transfer (ie, for imaging studies or to another healthcare facility) The best evidence for NIV is for hypercapneic ventilatory failure (asthma, emphysema) or for cardiogenic pulmonary edema without active ischemia. If the patient shows no reduction in work of breathing after a 30- to 60-minute trial of NIV, patient should be intubated and mechanically ventilated. Achieve adequate sedation and analgesia to tolerate the endotracheal tube, achieve ventilator synchrony, and minimize oxygen consumption / CO2 production. If the patient meets ALI criteria (acute onset; bilateral; PaO2/FiO2 < 300; not due to elevated left atrial pressure), low-stretch ventilation has been shown to reduce mortality. Initial Vt 6 ml / kg IDEAL BODY WEIGHT= 45.5 kg + 2.3 kg for each inch over 5 feet in a woman. This formula does not change for pregnant vs non-pregnant status. Modest maternal hypercapnea (PaCO2 < 60 mmHg) may be tolerated in order to achieve low-stretch ventilation if the biophysical profile of the fetus remains reassuring, given the rationale that follows. The effects of hypercapnea on the human fetus are not known. Data abstracted from animal studies with gradual rise in PaCO2 (analogous to that observed with low-stretch ventilation) found no significant change in uterine blood flow up to maternal PaCO2 of 60 mmHg, but uterine blood flow decreased as maternal PaCO2 rose above 60. Fetal PCO2 would be expected to be higher than maternal PaCO2, and thus there exists risk for fetal acidosis, increased intracranial pressure, and a rightward shift in the O2-Hb dissociation curve. It is unclear whether bicarbonate infusion adequately crosses the placental barrier to buffer fetal pH. PEEP — positive end-expiratory pressure — is an effective modality to increase functional residual capacity and thus oxygen reserve. PEEP improves oxygenation in alveolar flooding processes. However, PEEP can diminish venous return to the right ventricle, causing inadequate cardiac output and potentially hypotension or decreased oxygen saturation via venous admixture. If the patient becomes hypotensive or hypoxemic or develops signs of hypoperfusion while being mechanically ventilated, ensure adequate circulating volume and consider lowering the PEEP until an intravenous volume challenge is given. PEEP may then be reinitiated at the higher level. Ensure adequate perfusion, titrating to blood pressure (MAP > 65), urine output, mentation (as appropriate), pH / lactate, SVO2, and fetal monitoring (as appropriate). Intubation and sedation often result in hypotension, given the blunting of the patient’s endogenous catecholamine secretion and by uncovering a relative hypovolemia with the institution of positive pressure ventilation / PEEP. Vasoactive support as necessary tailored to the patient’s condition Vasoconstrictive agents: norepinephrine, vasopressin, dopamine, or phenylephrine if in septic or vasodilatory shock with a wide pulse pressure Ionotrope support (dobutamine or milrinone) if patient has ventricular failure (CHF, right ventricular failure with PE) ICU monitoring with fetal monitoring if appropriate by gestational age Ensure mother’s airway, breathing, and circulation If CPR is necessary, recommend left lateral tilt to keep gravid uterus from impairing venous return Fetal monitoring if appropriate for gestational age All medications should be considered in the context of pregnancy. Specify the type of respiratory failure — hypoxemic vs. ventilatory failure — using the following tests. History: asthma, heart disease, cystic fibrosis, sickle cell anemia, immunocompromise? Normal during pregnancy = pH 7.37 / PaCO2 30 mmHg / PaO2 70 mmHg If intubated, ABG within 30 minutes to ensure adequate oxygenation and ventilation Chest X-ray (CXR): shield abdomen, though radiation exposure with a plain film is minimal Is there alveolar flooding? If yes: pneumonia, cardiogenic edema, or permeability edema? If edema, presence of an enlarged cardiac silhouette, a wide vascular pedicle, or pleural effusion(s) suggests increased hydrostatic (cardiogenic) pressure. If no or minimal airspace disease, consider asthma / airflow obstruction, pulmonary embolism, or (with history) sickle cell disease. Septic shock, especially before volume resuscitation, can also be a cause for ventilatory failure despite a normal or near-normal initial CXR. Infectious workup if any signs of pneumonia, sepsis, or if endemic virus in season Nasal swab for influenza subtypes, +/- other viruses Urine antigen testing for Streptococcus pneumoniae and Legionella Consider echocardiogram if new murmur or signs suggesting heart failure Lower extremity Dopplers are specific but less sensitive during pregnancy given the possibility of pelvic vein clot origin If CXR is relatively normal, a normal perfusion lung scan can obviate need for further testing with the lowest dose of radiation to mother and fetus. Adding ventilation scans to the perfusion scan increases the radiation exposure slightly, but improves ability to find isolated perfusion deficits. Chest CT scan with shielding of the abdomen has an excellent diagnostic ability but does expose the mother to significant radiation to her breast tissue, which has been cited as an increased risk for breast cancer. Nonetheless, chest CT is considered an acceptable risk for a pregnant patient suspected of having PE. Due to the mother’s high cardiac output, timing of the injection bolus may be problematic and can lead to suboptimal studies. It is recommended to discuss the case with the radiologist prior to scan. Hemodynamic monitoring with a central venous catheter may be helpful for patients with hypoxemic respiratory failure. There is no evidence to support a pulmonary artery catheter over a standard central venous catheter. In a normal term pregnancy, right heart catheterization reveals: Decreased systemic and pulmonary vascular resistance, and colloid oncotic pressure Unchanged central venous pressure (CVP), pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP), and mean arterial pressure Central venous O2 saturation (SVO2), an indicator of adequate oxygen delivery, is expected to be normal or high in uncomplicated pregnancy (> 65%). Peak vs. plateau pressure can indicate airflow obstruction (higher delta between peak and plateau) compared to a process flooding the lungs (high plateau). Expiratory pressure tracing can also indicate auto-PEEP, when patients with airflow obstruction / asthma have inadequate time to exhale their tidal volume. Waveform monitoring can also confirm adherence to low-stretch ventilation parameters and gauge a patient’s synchrony with the ventilator. In a normal term pregnancy, right heart catheterization reveals: Decreased systemic vascular resistance (SVR) and pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR), and colloid oncotic pressure Unchanged central venous pressure (CVP), pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP), and mean arterial pressure (MAP). Central venous O2 saturation is normal or high in uncomplicated pregnancy (> 65%). Chest x-rays in pregnant women without pulmonary disease will be normal or show slightly reduced lung volumes. In comparison, Figure 1 demonstrates the radiograph of a woman with severe ARDS from a viral pneumonia, and Figure 3 demonstrates a woman with hypoxemic respiratory failure from an amniotic fluid embolism. Respiratory failure is present if the patient is unable to perform the work of breathing comfortably. Respiratory failure can be present even if the arterial blood gas is underwhelming, as the work of breathing may be excessive. There is a very broad differential causing respiratory failure, as discussed above. In addition, rarer conditions that may affect pregnant patients and may mimic ALI / ARDS or CHF include: Cardiac valvular disease (especially mitral stenosis) presenting with hydrostatic pulmonary edema Alveolar hemorrhage, typically observed in patients with connective tissue disease and pulmonary vasculitis Pneumocystis pneumonia caused by P. jiroveci in patients with compromised T-cell immunity (HIV, organ transplant recipients on anti-rejection medications) Fungal pneumonia such as blastomycosis in endemic areas such as the US Upper Midwest or coccidioidomycosis in the Southwest, or zoonoses (babesiosis) in the appropriate location Cryptogenic organizing pneumonia presenting in an acute fashion Tests that may be helpful to distinguish these entities from pulmonary edema caused by CHF or ALI include echocardiography, bronchoalveolar lavage with cell count and differential, pathology review for hemosiderin-laden macrophages or eosinophilic matter, or serologic tests. For patients with respiratory failure and a clear CXR, in addition to asthma or embolism of clot or amniotic material, one should consider: Neuromuscular disease (myasthenia gravis, multiple sclerosis, post-poliomyelitis syndrome, or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis Problems with respiratory drive (obstructive sleep apnea, obesity hypoventilation syndrome, narcotic and/or benzodiazepine use, or central apneas) Paradoxical vocal cord dysfunction, which frequently coexists in patients with asthma, but is distinguished from asthma by inspiratory stridor, squaring off of the inspiratory loop on pulmonary function tests, and abnormal abduction of the vocal cords on inspiration (seen on direct laryngoscopy) All patients should have basic laboratory testing, chest X-ray, infectious workup and consideration of an echocardiogram if critically ill. Bronchoscopy is reserved for patients who do not have an obvious source for ALI, whose basic microbiologic investigation (including tracheal aspirate) is unrevealing, or for whom there is suspicion of either an atypical pathogen (PCP, fungal pneumonia), a subacute course (COP, HP), or an underlying idiopathic lung condition (AEP, COP, HP, alveolar hemorrhage). Surgical lung biopsy tends not to change treatment in the majority of critically ill patients with respiratory failure, but is occasionally considered. Risks include persistent air leak / pneumothorax, worsening of respiratory failure, especially during single-lung ventilation, and circulatory compromise with general anesthesia. Infectious disease consultation may be helpful when unusual pathogens are entertained. Treatment is specific to the type of respiratory failure, and is largely supportive. Bronchodilators (albuterol, +/- anticholinergic if COPD) Corticosteroids — parenteral until an improvement in airflow is noted Leukotriene modifiers have some data to support their use in critically ill asthmatic patients. Non-invasive ventilation (CPAP or BiPAP) to decrease work of breathing. This is best achieved by working with the patient to ensure a comfortable mask fit and allowing the patient to acclimate to the interface before increasing the pressure. For a patient in severe distress, typical target settings would be either CPAP 10 – 13 cm H2O, or BiPAP of 15-18 / 8 – 12. Anxiolysis and pain control: the sensations of dyspnea and bronchoconstriction are profoundly uncomfortable and exacerbate dynamic hyperinflation by prompting the patient to hyperventilate. The goal is slow, deep respirations with adequate time to exhale, and judicious use of morphine or a low-dose benzodiazepine may help achieve this. Mechanical ventilation: if the patient is unable to ventilate successfully with CPAP/BiPAP, she should be intubated and ventilated, with careful attention to limiting inspiratory time and allowing maximal time to exhale. For Assist Control Volume Control ventilation, the goal is to allow ventilation while bronchodilator therapy takes effect, and to keep the patient from becoming dangerously hyperinflated (auto-PEEP). Minimize I-time with normal or high flow rate and a steep or even square waveform. Peak pressure is less important an endpoint than plateau pressure, which will indicate auto-PEEP. Provide adequate PEEP to counterbalance the high positive pleural pressure (auto-PEEP) and prevent an early “choke point” or airway collapse. In general, the extrinsic PEEP should be set to be within 2 cm H2O of the measured auto-PEEP. Ensure adequate sedation – young asthmatics are typically quite strong and have a huge drive and thus may require very high levels of sedative and analgesic to achieve synchrony with the ventilator. Neuromuscular blockade with cisatracurium, in addition to analgosedation, is sometimes required. An alternative strategy is to allow large slow breaths on pressure support (Rate 6 – 8, tidal volume 800 mL – 1.2 L) if the patient is breathing spontaneously and not paralyzed. PEEP recommendations are unchanged — matching extrinsic to intrinsic PEEP — in this mode. Moderate permissive hypercapnea (allowing the PCO2 to rise to 60 mm Hg) appears to be tolerated by the fetus. See discussion above. If respiratory workload remains very high, consider delivery as this will decrease CO2 production / ventilatory workload. If a clot has been documented or clinical suspicion is high, initiate heparin therapy. Low-molecular-weight heparins are approved for use in pregnancy and may have a favorable risk profile (lower risk of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia and decreased osteoporosis) but heparin is generally recommended during the acute ICU setting while making decisions about possible delivery or need for invasive procedures. Goal PTT is 1.5 – 2 times baseline PTT. Unload work of breathing with non-invasive or invasive mechanic ventilation as dictated by patient status. Support circulation with adequate circulating volume and / or vasoactive or inotropic support as necessary. Consider alternative therapies (thrombolysis, embolectomy) if the patient is in shock despite heparin. Temporary vena caval interruption devices may be considered but are more technically challenging in a pregnant patient and require some radiation dosing to the midabdomen, so are not routine. Support ventilation with non-invasive ventilation (preferred if not in shock) or invasive mechanical ventilation if necessary. If intubating, maintain Vt < 9 ml/kg IBW to decrease risk of ventilator-induced lung injury. Adequate PEEP and oxygen to maintain PaO2 > 67 mm Hg or SaO2 > 95% Ventilation can usually be achieved with assist control volume control ventilation, but consider pressure control if patient is highly dyssynchronous or pressure support if oxygenation is not critical and circulation is intact. Afterload reduce: hydralazine is first line, with amlodipine as second line. Avoid ACE inhibitors and angiotensin-receptor blockers given their potential fetal complications. If refractory, consider delivery as this will decrease the circulating volume, improve colloid oncotic pressure, diminish edema formation, and decrease metabolic demand. If delivering, careful discussion with anesthesia as general anesthesia may be poorly tolerated with impaired circulation. Support oxygenation and ventilation with mechanical ventilation. Recommend low-stretch ventilation parameters: initial tidal volume 6 ml/kg IDEAL body weight — not adjusted for pregnancy — and plateau pressure <= 30 cm H2O. Permissive hypercapnea tolerated to a PCO2 of approximately 60 mmHg; above this level, would liberalize tidal volume to prevent further hypercapnea Discuss a delivery plan and / or tocolysis plan with maternal fetal medicine with a focus on limiting maternal oxygen consumption. If patient is in shock, fluid and vasoactive support as with non-pregnant patients If patient is not in shock, seek the lowest filling pressures to maintain adequate circulation. In the ARDSnetwork Fluid and Catheter Treatment Trial, subjects who had aggressive diuresis to keep overall I/O status matched or up to 1 L negative over the first 5 days in the ICU had a reduced time on the ventilator and in the ICU compared to those with a liberal fluid strategy, without increases in renal failure or shock. Sedation goals are unchanged from the nonpregnant state: sedate and provide analgesia to allow tolerance of low-stretch ventilation; titrate sedation using a validated sedation scale such as the RASS; and interrupt sedation to assess ongoing needs for sedation on a daily basis once the patient has no contraindication to interruption. If respiratory workload and oxygen deficit remain high, consider delivery as this will decrease O2 consumption and CO2 production. Treatment is specific to the type of respiratory failure. Parenteral corticosteroids (mg/kg dose of Solu-medrol or equivalent) x 2-3 doses to saturate the glucocorticoid receptor and then can change to daily prednisone, approximately mg/kg Inhaled beta-agonist therapy, nebulized or via MDI, at least every 4 hours Inhaled anticholinergic therapy, nebulized or via MDI, every 4 – 6 hours Treat any precipitating factor (removal from allergens, antibiotics if a pulmonary infection is suspected). Consider leukotriene modifier therapy, and continue this therapy if patient already uses leukotriene modifiers. Consider magnesium sulfate, IV or nebulized, for a patient with severe asthma (FEV1 < 35% predicted) or if the exacerbation is very severe. Weight-based bolus and infusion of heparin targeted to PTT 1.5 – 2 times baseline PTT Consider thrombolysis (tPA or alteplase, 100 mg over 2 hours, then resume heparin) if patient is in shock due to PE. Supportive care as discussed in the relevant chapter on PE Diuresis once not in shock: loop diuretics dosed to renal function Afterload reduction with hydralazine +/- amlodipine Consider beta-blockade if not in an acutely decompensated heart failure exacerbation. Supportive care with analgosedation as described above and diuresis once not in shock For severe, refractory cases of maternal ventilatory failure, consultation should take place with maternal-fetal medicine, anesthesia, and neonatology regarding the possible need for urgent delivery or pregnancy termination. The fetus exerts an additional ventilatory demand on the mother that can be alleviated with delivery, but even cesarean births with general anesthesia temporarily increase oxygen consumption. After deep sedation, consider muscle relaxation / paralysis to obliterate patient effort and minimize CO2 production. Extracorporeal support (ECMO or ECCO2R) is an option in the most refractory cases. If due to a valvular problem, consultation with cardiovascular surgery and/or interventional cardiology may be helpful. Cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) has similar maternal complications as in the nonpregnant population, but fetal outcomes are reported to be suboptimal. Intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) has also been reported in pregnancy, and may complement CPB in that it provides pulsatile flow. Ventricular assist devices have been reported in pregnancy as a bridge to delivery and/or heart transplantation. As in nonpregnant patients, there are a number of options to improve refractory hypoxemia, including: Muscle relaxation / paralysis once patient is adequately sedated Inhaled nitric oxide (iNO) or inhaled prostaglandin (Flolan) to selectively vasodilate ventilating alveoli Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) or short-term cardiopulmonary bypass Unlike nonpregnant patients, prone positioning is not recommended in pregnancy. Respiratory failure due to airflow obstruction (asthma, COPD) Asthma is typically responsive to therapy, and many patients will have an excellent quality of life in between asthma exacerbations. Patients should follow up with a pulmonologist to monitor symptoms and response to treatment, and to review and remove precipitants where possible. Peripartum cardiomyopathy can worsen with subsequent pregnancies and in the post-partum period, so patients should be followed closely with a cardiologist. Valvular disease may also worsen over time, and should be followed by cardiology. Survivors can expect significant functional disability — reduced 6-minute walk time, more difficulty with independent acts of daily living — at one year even though lung function usually returns to normal. Approximately half of survivors return to work at one year after ARDS, and the majority of young patients return to work within 5 years. Most patients will require some form of rehabilitative therapy –physical and occupational — to improve their functional capacity following ARDS. Mimics of ARDS are relatively rare in pregnancy, but may be more common in patients with pre-existing autoimmune disease (alveolar hemorrhage) or in patients with immunodeficiency like HIV (Pneumocystis pneumonia). If neither of these conditions is present, consider a more broad differential for hypoxemic respiratory failure beyond ARDS when: The case is more subacute than acute (cryptogenic organizing pneumonia) There is no clear precipitant of ALI/ARDS (sepsis, pneumonia, aspiration, pancreatitis, trauma, blood transfusion) The case has unusual features, such as hematuria (pulmonary-renal syndromes like Goodpasture’s syndrome or ANCA-associated vasculitis); unusual travel (eosinophilic pneumonia); history of exposure to organic compounds or birds (hypersensitivity pneumonia); unusual rashes or arthralgias (babesiosis coexistent with Lyme disease or autoimmune disease with rapidly progressive interstitial lung disease) Testing for these may include serologic testing for autoimmune disease, expanded microbiologic testing (thin blood smears for parasites; bronchoalveolar lavage for PCP), or lung biopsy (video-assisted) to obtain the diagnosis. Respiratory failure due to airflow obstruction (asthma,COPD) Patients should follow up with a pulmonologist to monitor symptoms and response to treatment, potential complications, and to review and remove precipitants where possible. Peripartum cardiomyopathy can worsen with subsequent pregnancies and in the post-partum period, so patients should be followed closely by a cardiologist. Valvular disease may also worsen over time, and should be followed by cardiology. Most patients will require some form of rehabilitative therapy –physical and occupational — to improve their functional capacity following ARDS. Follow-up with a pulmonologist is recommended early in the recovery as patients regain lung function. This can also be helpful for providing the patient with anticipatory guidance about what to expect following ALI/ARDS. Airway inflammation and variable narrowing of the airway lumen are the pathologic hallmarks of asthma. Inflammatory cells are generally those that participate in allergic reactions, including mast cells, eosinophils, basophils, Th2 lymphocytes, natural killer cells, and members of the innate immune system such as dendritic cells. Chronic inflammation promotes thickening and edema of the airway epithelium and smooth muscle hyperplasia, which narrows the airway lumen. Bronchoconstriction due to smooth muscle contraction further narrows the airway lumen, causing significant airflow obstruction and potentially dynamic hyperinflation, where the air cannot effectively exit portions of the lungs. The increased minute ventilation that is normal in pregnancy may superimpose a larger burden on a patient with moderate to severe airflow obstruction at baseline. Airway mechanics and thus flow measurements during pregnancy do not change appreciably compared to the non-pregnant state. Airway hyperresponsiveness (as measured by a methacholine challenge, or bronchoprovocation study) was found to improve slightly during pregnancy in one small study. In general, bronchoprovocation testing is not recommended in pregnancy. Hydrostatic pressure within the pulmonary capillaries increases due to elevated LVEDP (left ventricular end-diastolic pressure) or elevated LAP (left atrial pressure). Elevated hydrostatic pressure drives fluid out of the vessels and into the pulmonary interstitium, overcoming lymphatic drainage (leading to pleural effusion), and then into alveolar space (pulmonary edema). In pregnancy, a few specific forms of cardiogenic edema are occasionally observed: Tocolytic-associated pulmonary edema, which is presumed to be secondary to fluid overload and/or cardiac toxicity superimposed on the reduced colloid oncotic pressure of pregnancy. This generally resolves within 24 hours of withholding the beta-agonist. Pre-existent heart disease that is worsened by the increased circulating volume, high metabolic demand, and diminished colloid oncotic pressure of pregnancy. The most common entities in this category are: In non-cardiogenic or increased permeability edema, hydrostatic pressure is normal but the barrier itself is leaky. The pulmonary-capillary barrier consists of both endothelium (vessel) and epithelium (respiratory lining), and both have defects in ARDS. Many specific molecular mechanisms contribute to vascular and epithelial barrier dysfunction, including: Biomechanical (shear stress) toxicities from repetitive opening and closing of flooded or collapsed airspaces Oxygen fractions over 60% have been show to damage healthy lung tissue. The degree to which oxygen toxicity contributes injury to the already-injured lung is not clear. Increased permeability allows protein-rich fluid to leak into the alveolar airspace. In response to injury, alveolar type II cells proliferate but remain functionally impaired. Regenerating type II cells have abnormal fluid/ion transport. Regenerating type II cells do not produce adequate surfactant. Inadequate surfactant production favors alveolar collapse and makes it more difficult to recruit partially flooded airspaces. Flooded and collapsed airspaces decrease the number of effective gas exchange units, which then increases the shunt fraction (the fraction of blood that shunts through the lungs without becoming oxygenated). Severe hypoxemia causes global hypoxic vasoconstriction, which in turn significantly elevates pulmonary vascular resistance. If the RV is failing (as viewed on echocardiogram or evidenced by a low central venous saturation), the combination of profound shunt and venous admixture due to high oxygen extraction will exacerbate the patient’s hypoxemia. The pathophysiology of venous thromboembolic disease (VTE) is unchanged compared to the non-pregnant state, but the hormonal milieu of pregnancy and the tendency for increased venous stasis due to relative pelvic obstruction can increase the risk for VTE. Amniotic fluid embolism (AFE) and air embolism happen most commonly during active labor and delivery (Figure 3 and Figure 4). Either AFE or air embolism can precipitate respiratory failure, hypoxemia, hemodynamic instability, or even maternal death. The mechanism by which fetal / amniotic material or air crosses into the maternal circulation seems to require open uterine or cervical veins, lack of integrity of fetal membranes, and a gradient favoring flow from the amnion to the maternal circulation. These conditions are met during vaginal or cesarean delivery. The relative contribution of mechanical obstruction of the pulmonary circulation versus a generalized reaction to a foreign circulating substance (anaphylactoid response, with cardiotoxicity) is debated. Many practitioners espouse a biphasic model of pathophysiology in AFE, where phase I is dominated by right ventricular failure and high PVR (with clear lungs and hypotension), followed by a left ventricular failure and high pulmonary permeability (dominated by severe hypoxemia, and frequently complicated by coagulopathy / DIC). Respiratory insufficiency is among the leading causes of ICU admission for pre-partum pregnant patients, and accounts for up to 30% of maternal deaths. Asthma is the most common pulmonary disorder during pregnancy, and may occur in up to 8% of pregnant women. In one cohort of asthma during pregnancy, approximately one third of the cohort had stable asthma, one third worsened, and one third improved during pregnancy. The course of asthma during one pregnancy seems to predict the likely course for subsequent pregnancies. Between 20% and 30% of women with asthma will have an acute exacerbation during pregnancy. Cardiac disease complicates approximately 4% of pregnancies. Cardiac disease accounts for approximately 15% of obstetric ICU admissions However, cardiac entities inflict a high maternal morbidity, and may account for up to 50% of maternal deaths in the ICU. ALI/ARDS in pregnancy has been estimated to complicate 1 in 1,500 to 1 in 7,000 deliveries in the United States, for an estimated incidence of 16 to 70 cases per 100,000 population. Notable epidemics such as pandemic H1N1 influenza in 2009 seem to have inflicted a higher burden on pregnant patients relative to the overall population. In Australia and New Zealand, pregnant women had a 7-fold higher risk of being critically ill with H1N1 compared to non-pregnant women of child-bearing age, and the relative risk climbed to 13-fold after 20 weeks’ gestation. Previous influenza pandemics had been reported to extract a higher mortality in pregnancy. PE is common in pregnancy, complicating up to 0.05% to 0.1% of pregnancies. PE is currently the leading cause of maternal death in the US. Amniotic fluid embolism is rare — 1 in 21,000 deliveries in one population-based study — but may be fatal. Historic reports describe a maternal mortality of 26% to 61%. Most practitioners believe the historic data reflect only the most severe cases, and it is likely that milder cases of AFE often go unrecognized. Prognosis for both mother and fetus depends on the clinical entity and case-specific features. Critical illness during pregnancy is associated with a 200-fold increase in maternal mortality ratio compared to the overall US mortality ratio of 12 deaths per 100,000 live births. One multicenter survey reported a maternal mortality of 14% and neonatal mortality of 11% for pregnant women in respiratory failure requiring intubation. Maternal complications: one prospective cohort of women with asthma enrolled in their first trimester found that 36% of women had at least one severe exacerbation during pregnancy. Severe exacerbations were defined as requiring a change in medication and/or unscheduled contact with health care (emergency visit, ED visit, or hospitalization). Increasing asthma severity was associated with an increased rate of exacerbations. The majority (62%) of severe asthmatic patients at baseline had at least one severe exacerbation during pregnancy. Hospitalizations were more common during pregnancy than prepregnancy. Perinatal complications: poorly controlled asthma is associated with increased perinatal mortality, pre-eclampsia, very low birth weight infants, and preterm delivery compared to pregnancies in non-asthmatic women. Cardiac disease associated with pregnancy accounts for a large fraction of obstetric ICU deaths. The following characteristics have been identified as associated with high risk for maternal or fetal complications. Multiple risks are more than additive. Pulmonary hypertension (PA systolic > 50% pressure) Severe aortic stenosis (valve area < 1 cm2 or velocity > 4 m/s) Severe or symptomatic aortic or mitral regurgitation (NYHA Class III – IV) Dilated cardiomyopathies carry a risk of arrhythmia, heart failure, stroke, and death, especially when LVEF < 40% or NYHA Class is > II. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathies carry the risk of sudden cardiac death. Infants born to mothers with pre-existing cardiomyopathies reportedly have higher complication rates, including low birth weight and prematurity. In non-pregnant patients, the mortality for patients with ARDS ranges from 28% to 40%. Mortality is generally better in younger patients. The mortality among pregnant women in the 2009 H1N1 outbreak was 11% in the largest registry. Perinatal mortality is significantly higher when mothers have ARDS. Acute PE presenting with hemodynamic instability or shock has a very high mortality, reportedly as high as 65%. In-hospital mortality for acute PE in one registry of unselected adult patients was 3%, with a significantly increased risk of subsequent mortality. The 5-year cumulative mortality for the cohort was 35%, and 40% of deaths were classified as cardiovascular. PE remains the most commonly reported cause of maternal death in the US according to the CDC. In a Spanish registry of acute VTE (DVT and PE), there were no maternal deaths among 72 pregnant patients diagnosed with DVT or PE, though bleeding risk was increased. AFE is reported to carry high maternal and fetal mortality rates. Special considerations for nursing and allied health professionals.

ed747d23-837a-4a57-bef4-7ebd1269d51d,"» » Hypoxemia and hypercapnea are the key gas exchange abnormalities associated with respiratory disease. “Hypoxemia” denotes a blood oxygen concentration or partial pressure of oxygen (PaO) below normal. “Hypoxia” also signifies low oxygen levels, but is not restricted to the blood. “Hypercapnea” denotes a high partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO). Both pulmonary and extrapulmonary disorders cause hypoxemia. Examples include pneumonia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), acute respiratory distress syndrome/acute lung injury (ARDS/ALI) and congestive heart failure (CHF). Untreated hypoxemia jeopardizes the heart and brain. Cardiac manifestations include arrhythmias, congestive heart failure, and myocardial infarction. Central nervous system manifestations include altered consciousness and seizures. Complications are more common with severe hypoxemia. Oxygen supplementation is generally needed when the PaO is below 55-60 mmHg or the oxygen saturation (SaO) is below 88-90%. Oxygen can be supplemented noninvasively, for example by nasal cannulae or face mask. For severe hypoxemia, high flow and non-rebreather systems may be used. The most hypoxemic patients may require oxygen delivery under positive pressure, either noninvasively with a face or nasal mask or invasively via an endotracheal tube. Close monitoring is needed to ensure treatment response. Acute hypercapnea signifies increased risk or presence of respiratory failure. The normal PaCO is 40 mmHg. Slight increases in the PaCO rapidly stimulate ventilation, returning the PaCO to normal. Causes of hypercapnea include primary ventilatory failure, manifested by a decreased alveolar ventilation (V), or an inadequate ventilatory response to stresses such as increased COproduction (VCO) or increased dead space (V). Acute hypercapnea causes a respiratory acidosis, manifested by a decreased blood pH. When hypercapnea is chronic, the kidneys retain HCO, raising the serum HCO concentration and mitigating the pH drop. An arterial blood gas (ABG) is the most common test used to diagnose hypercapnea. High clinical suspicion is necessary. Clinical manifestations that should raise suspicion include dyspnea, abnormal breathing patterns (e.g. accessory respiratory muscle use, rapid shallow breathing) and altered mental status. Ventilatory support may be needed if acute hypercapnea is not corrected promptly. Worsening symptoms, lack of therapeutic response and a pH persistently below 7.30, signal the need for ventilatory support. Both noninvasive and invasive mechanical ventilation can be used to treat hypercapnea. Several factors influence the decision to initiate support, including the severity of hypercapnea, pH, clinical trajectory and clinician judgment. Almost any pulmonary or cardiac disease can cause hypoxemia and hypercapnea. Signs and symptoms tend to reflect the underlying disease. Prominent lung disorders include pneumonia, ARDS/ALI, asthma, chest trauma, aspiration and pulmonary embolism. Nonpulmonary examples include congestive heart failure (CHF), strokes (e.g. involving the brain stem respiratory centers), drug overdoses (e.g. respiratory depressants such as narcotics) and intra-abdominal disasters which may impede diaphragm function (such as abdominal compartment syndrome). Hypoxemia is difficult to detect without tools such as arterial blood gases (ABGs) and pulse oximetry. Cyanosis may be evident in patients with relatively severe hypoxemia, for example those with an SaO in the low to mid 80s or less. Cyanosis is difficult to appreciate in patients with less severe hypoxemia. Pulse oximetry is useful for the detection of hypoxemia, although hemodynamic instability may preclude accurate measurement. ABG testing is an alternative and more precise way to measure hypoxemia and is essential to detecting hypercapnea. Both hypoxemia and hypercapnea cause a variety of non-specific physiological responses that vary from patient to patient. Autonomic stress responses include tachypnea, tachycardia, hypertension and diaphoresis. Bradycardia and hypotension are ominous signs that occur as respiratory failure progresses. Signs of respiratory distress include orthopnea and accessory respiratory muscle use. Respiratory paradox – a pattern characterized by inward movement of the abdomen during inspiration – strongly suggests diaphragm fatigue or failure. With complete respiratory failure, the respiratory rate slows and becomes irregular before ceasing. Physical exam findings offer clues to the underlying disease. Key pulmonary signs include dullness to percussion, wheezes, rhonchi, and crackles. The brain and heart are particularly vulnerable to hypoxemia and hypercapnea. Neurological manifestations include anxiety, agitation, delirium, confusion, headache (particularly with hypercapnea), visual alterations, seizures and altered consciousness (ranging from hypervigilance to somnolence and coma). Cardiac manifestations include CHF, arrhythmias and myocardial infarction. Inadequate oxygen delivery can lead to anaerobic metabolism and lactic acidosis, resulting in dysfunction and failure of several organs, including the brain, heart, kidney and liver. Basic diagnostic tests such as chest radiographs and computed tomography (CT) scans may provide crucial information necessary to diagnose the cause of hypoxemia and hypercapnea. Key features of the management of hypoxemia and hypercapnea include providing supplemental oxygen, ventilatory support and treating the precipitating disorder. The method chosen to supplement oxygen depends on the severity of hypoxemia. Low flow nasal cannulae suffice for mild hypoxemia. Anywhere from 0.5 to 6 L/M can be used, although nasal mucosal irritation limits tolerance of higher flows. Nasal cannulae are comfortable and easy to use. Each L/M has been estimated to provide 2-3% more oxygen. However, in practice, the fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO) is difficult to regulate because the amount of oxygen supplied is fixed while total ventilation is not. When patients hypoventilate, relatively less ambient air is inhaled compared to oxygen, increasing the FiO. With hyperventilation, more ambient air is inhaled, decreasing the FiO. The inability to control the FiOcan cause problems in patients predisposed to hypercapnea. For example, some patients with advanced COPD develop severe COretention when given too much oxygen. A variety of mechanisms contribute to hypercapnea, including a depressed respiratory drive, increased dead space and increased dissolved CO(i.e. the Haldane effect). Venturi mask oxygen delivery systems control the FiOmore effectively by mixing fixed ratios of ambient air and oxygen before inhalation. Theoretically, high flow systems allow an FiOup to 100%; in practice, however, entrainment of ambient air limits the FiOto 60-70%. Disadvantages of face mask systems include patient discomfort; difficulty with talking, eating, and drinking, and difficulty clearing secretions. High-flow humidified nasal oxygen is a recent innovation used to treat severe hypoxemia and is a reasonable alternative to face mask approaches. Flows as high as 50 L/M, along with a relatively tight seal around the nose, allow high FiOdelivery. Because oxygen enters through the nose, patients may be able to talk, drink and eat. High flows may also create modest positive pressure within the respiratory system, with advantages similar to those associated with low continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). Positive pressure plays a key role in the treatment of severe hypoxemia and can be delivered noninvasively by nasal or face mask or invasively through an endotracheal tube (ETT). Noninvasive approaches are especially useful for treating diseases subject to quick reversal, such as CHF. Appropriate candidates must be hemodynamically stable and able to maintain a patent airway. Positive pressure can be delivered as a single pressure (CPAP) or with pressures that alternate during inhalation and exhalation (i.e. noninvasive positive pressure ventilation or NIPPV). CPAP and NIPPV employ a relatively snug mask applied over the nose or nose and mouth. Those covering both the nose and mouth are generally more reliable and preferred in emergencies. A snug (not tight) fit limits the amount of ambient air entrained, allowing a higher FiO. For patients with CHF, positive pressure decreases preload and afterload. Positive pressure also optimizes oxygen transfer across edematous alveoli and reverses or ameliorates atelectasis. For CHF patients without hypercapnea, CPAP is generally as effective as NIPPV. Patients who are not candidates for noninvasive ventilation should be intubated. An ETT provides the means to deliver positive pressure ventilation and easy access to remove airway secretions. Because the system is closed, the FiOcan be titrated precisely from 21-100%. Higher levels of positive pressure can be provided compared to noninvasive systems. As with noninvasive ventilation, positive pressure can be provided in both inhalation and exhalation and has similar benefits. Positive pressure provided during exhalation (positive end-expiratory pressure or PEEP) is especially important in ARDS/ALI. Common PEEP levels range from 5 to more than 20 cm HO in those with severe hypoxemia. PEEP generally allows a decrease in the FiO, mitigating the risk of oxygen toxicity, which is a particular concern when the FiOis greater than 60%. A variety of algorithms have been used to guide management in hypoxemic respiratory failure. A prominent example is that employed by the ARDSnet investigators, which titrates FiOand PEEP based on the patient’s PaOor SaO. Patients with severe hypoxemia may require additional interventions to support oxygenation. Sedation and occasionally neuromuscular blockade may decrease the amount of oxygen required. Diuresis may improve gas exchange in those with pulmonary edema. Prone positioning may improve ventilation and perfusion matching and prove helpful in centers with appropriate expertise. Recruitment maneuvers, which temporarily employ higher distending pressures and tidal volumes, may recruit atelectatic lung and improve oxygenation. Inhaled vasodilators such as nitric oxide may improve oxygenation and play a temporizing role in those who cannot be oxygenated otherwise. Alternative mechanical ventilation approaches may be tried in refractory patients. Examples include prolonging inspiratory time and employing modes such as airway pressure release ventilation (APRV) and high frequency oscillation ventilation (HFOV). Thus far, none of these approaches have proven superior to traditional modalities. Finally, there is growing interest in the use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) in refractory patients, although data supporting this approach remain controversial. Addressing the underlying cause of hypercapnea is fundamental to successful treatment. For example, patients with asthma and COPD require systemic corticosteroids and bronchodilators. Those who have overdosed on narcotics may need naloxone. Patients with persistent or worsening acute hypercapnea need positive pressure ventilation. Noninvasive approaches are optimal for patients who are awake, hemodynamically stable and able to clear and protect their airways. Others, including those nearing respiratory arrest, require intubation. NIPPV has become first line therapy in patients with COPD presenting with acute or acute on chronic hypercapnea. Appropriate candidates must be awake, hemodynamically stable, and able to clear secretions and protect their airway. In comparison to invasive approaches, NIPPV improves survival, decreases duration of mechanical ventilation, and is associated with fewer complications such as ventilator associated pneumonia. A face mask fit over the mouth and nose is the most commonly employed noninvasive interface. Nasal masks can be used too, but face masks are more reliable and should generally be used first. When the patient stabilizes, a switch to nasal ventilation may improve comfort. Masks should be snug but not tight. Those that are too tight are uncomfortable and can cause pressure ulcerations. Masks can be removed intermittently in stable patients, allowing talking, eating, and administration of medications. Not all hypercapneic patients are appropriate for NIPPV. Indications for intubation include hemodynamic instability, poor mental status, inability to protect the airway, copious secretions, a weak cough, and apnea or near-apnea. Patients unable to tolerate even brief periods off the ventilator and those who deteriorate on therapy should generally be intubated. Finally, patients requiring particularly high pressures are likely to be uncomfortable and experience unacceptable leaks, necessitating intubation. When indicated, intubation should be performed promptly to minimize the risk of respiratory arrest. Waiting until the last moment exposes patients to an unnecessary risk of clinical deterioration and complications associated with emergency airway placement. Most patients should be intubated with an oral endotracheal tube (ETT), typically an 8.0 mm ETT in men and a 7.5 mm ETT in women. Intubation should be performed by clinicians with appropriate training in airway management. The principles of ventilatory support are similar to those used in NIPPV, the exception being that an ETT is used as an interface. The ETT allows effective control of the patient’s secretions. In general, higher driving pressures can be provided through an ETT than a face mask. A variety of mechanical ventilators can be used for both noninvasive and invasive ventilation. Regardless of the device chosen, settings need to be adjusted carefully to meet the needs of individual patients. Factors to consider include minute ventilation (V) requirements, the patient’s gender and height, the presence or absence of a respiratory drive, the target PaCOand the nature of the underlying disease. Patients are generally managed noninvasively by setting inspiratory and expiratory pressures titrated to support spontaneous efforts. In patients with obstructive lung disease, expiratory pressure may prevent airway closure and mitigate the effects of intrinsic PEEP. Inspiratory pressure supports the patient’s inspiratory efforts. In patients at risk for hyperinflation, pressures that are too high must be avoided. In contrast, higher pressures may be necessary in patients with poor respiratory system compliance, for example those with morbid obesity. A spontaneous mode of ventilation, without a set respiratory rate, is appropriate for most patients with an intact respiratory drive. In spontaneous modes, breaths are initiated in response to patient effort. In contrast, intermittent timed breaths may be required if the patient’s drive is impaired. The pressures tolerated by individual patients vary and may be limited by leaks between the patient and mask. Ongoing clinical assessment is mandatory to ensure the patient is stable and does not need intubation. Serial ABGs may be needed to titrate ventilator settings and to help identify failing patients who need intubation. Patients requiring intubation are generally sicker and may require sedatives that impair the respiratory drive. When complete rest is desired, or the patient’s drive or ability to initate breaths is in doubt, a minimum Vshould be set, using the “assist-control” (A/C) mode. In A/C, a set tidal volume and backup respiratory rate are used. Tidal volumes can be set directly using the “volume cycle” approach or indirectly using “pressure control.” A Vof 5-6 liters per minute is considered normal in those without lung disease. Taller patients and men generally require larger tidal volumes than shorter females. Vrequirements may rise with increased COproduction (reflecting the patient’s metabolic rate) and increased dead space (V) (reflecting ventilatory efficiency). Fever and overfeeding can increase COproduction; Vcan increase in the setting of several diseases, such as COPD, pneumonia, and pulmonary embolism. A higher Vmay be necessary to achieve a normal PaCOin patients with increased COproduction or increased V. In many patients, attempts to decrease the PaCOto “normal” (40 mmHg) may be unnecessary, unsafe or both. In patients with chronic hypercapnea, excessively aggressive attempts to lower the PaCOwill result in a metabolic alkalosis (termed a post hypercapneic metabolic alkalosis) due to residual HCOretention. As a rule, aiming to bring the PaCOdown to a level which allows a pH greater than 7.30 should suffice. In particularly severe cases of obstructive lung disease, it may be necessary to tolerate significant hypercapnea (i.e. “permissive hypercapnea”) to avoid dynamic hyperinflation, which can cause barotrauma and hemodynamic instability. Hypercapnea is generally well tolerated by most patients as long as oxygenation is adequate, with the possible exception of those with heart failure and those at risk of increased intracranial pressure. Because hypercapnea imposes a significant respiratory drive in most patients, heavy sedation and even neuromuscular blockade may be required to suppress ventilatory efforts. Patients with obstructive lung disease should be carefully monitored for signs of dynamic hyperinflation. Although no single parameter can be relied upon entirely, measurements of plateau pressures and intrinsic PEEP are often useful. The plateau pressure – measured with the expiratory port closed during a brief breath hold at end inhalation – correlates well with the elastic recoil pressure of the respiratory system. In most patients, keeping the plateau pressure below 30 cm HO, which can often be achieved by decreasing the respiratory rate and/or tidal volume, mitigates the risk of barotrauma and hemodynamic collapse. Intrinsic PEEP (PEEPi) can be identified by showing that expiration is incomplete before the next breath begins (termed expiratory flow limitation). The presence of PEEPi is suggested by the finding of incomplete exhalation on either physical exam (audible exhalation continues until inhalation begins), or by inspection of the expiratory waveform on the ventilator (seeing expiratory flow at end-expiration). These findings suggest dynamic hyperinflation, but only when active exhalation is excluded, which can be detected easily by visual or palpable findings on abdominal exam. PEEPi is difficult to measure precisely in spontaneously breathing patients and those with mucus plugging. To quantify the actual PEEPi pressure present in the lung at end exhalation, airway pressure is measured under no flow conditions at end exhalation. This requires – and can be measured accurately by – using the expiratory pause button on the mechanical ventilator. This occludes the exhalation valve exactly at inhalation onset, and since inhalation is prevented, the downstream alveolar pressure quickly equilibrates with the proximal airway (displayed on the pressure vs time curve). Like the expiratory flow assessment, this also can only be measured reliably when the patient is passively ventilated, since any spontaneous efforts will effect the pressure and flow measurements. If PEEPi is identified and clinically important (e.g. associated with shock or elevated plateau pressures), this should prompt efforts to lengthen exhalation time. This can be achieved by decreasing the Vby lowering the set respiratory rate and tidal volume. Decreasing the rate allows more exhalation time between breaths; decreasing the tidal volume lowers the amount of air to be exhaled. Finally, increasing inspiratory flow rates may allow more time for exhalation, although the impact on hyperinflation may not be as effective as approaches that decrease the V. As the patient improves, more aggressive ventilation – if needed – would likely be better tolerated. Acute hypoxemia and hypercapnea are life-threatening and demand prompt management. The first priority is to recognize their presence. All patients with acute lung disease or disease affecting the lung (e.g. CHF) require assessment of gas exchange. An evaluation is also essential in patients with findings associated with gas exchange abnormalities, particularly abnormal vital signs and altered mental status. Pulse oximetry is non-invasive and should be performed routinely in those at risk for hypoxemia. Patients who are unstable, for example those in intensive care units, merit continuous oximetry. Patients with poor perfusion may not generate a useful signal. Dark skinned and jaundiced patients may have falsely elevated pulse oximetry readings. ABGs are necessary to more precisely define the severity of hypoxemia and to detect hypercapnea. An ABG also should be checked when patients are critically ill or when there is reason to doubt the accuracy of pulse oximetry. Oxygen supplementation is necessary for patients with an oxygen saturation less than 88-90% or a PaO less than 55-60 mmHg on ambient air. In some patients, for example those who are pregnant and those with heart disease, strokes, and pulmonary hypertension, it may be helpful to initiate oxygen supplementation for more mild hypoxemia. For mild hypoxemia, a low flow nasal cannula may be sufficient to achieve adequate blood oxygen concentrations. A venturi mask should be used for patients requiring more precise oxygen titration, particularly when hyperoxia-induced hypercapnea is a concern, for example in patients with severe COPD. Patients with more severe hypoxemia require alternative approaches, including high flow face masks, non-rebreather masks, or high flow nasal cannulae. NIPPV or CPAP are reasonable approaches in patients with readily reversible disorders such as CHF. Intubation should be performed in patients who are hemodynamically unstable or unable to protect their airways and those whose hypoxemia remains uncorrected with noninvasive management. The detection of acute hypercapnea suggests the need for ventilatory support. As a rule, assistance is needed when hypercapnea is persistent or worsens despite treatment. However, not all patients with hypercapnea require ventilatory support. For example, patients with acute asthma may present with hypercapnea that responds promptly to steroids and bronchodilators. Moreover, some patients with severe respiratory distress may present with a normal or low PaCO and need support if their disease process is not readily reversible. NIPPV is first line therapy in patients who are alert, hemodynamically stable, and able to protect their airways. Unstable patients, those unable to clear or protect their airways, those with depressed mental status, and those with apnea or near apnea, require intubation. Ventilatory support should be provided to meet the patient’s V requirements. However, patients with particularly severe lung disease, particularly those with severe obstructive disease, may need a lower minute ventilation to avoid ventilator-induced lung damage. Fortunately, hypercapnea that persists following intubation is generally well tolerated if patients are well oxygenated. Patients with mild hypoxemia often can be managed outside the ICU. Patients with more severe hypoxemia and those requiring any form of ventilatory support are best served in an ICU or an equivalent site that can provide close observation and prompt interventions if needed. Patients requiring monitoring of their gas exchange include those with lung disease and respiratory symptoms as well as patients with unexplained, nonspecific findings, including change in mental status, severe vital sign abnormalities and lactic acidosis. Pulse oximetry should be used for screening and monitoring in patients at risk of hypoxemia. Continuous oximetry should be used in unstable patients; in general, continuous oximetry is standard in patients admitted to the ICU. An ABG should be performed in patients at risk for hypercapnea and in any patient in whom pulse oximetry may be unreliable. Oxygen supplementation should be provided to all patients with an SaO less than 88-90% or a PaO less than 55-60 mmHg on ambient air. A low flow of oxygen by nasal cannula, generally in the range of 1-4 liters per minute, is sufficient for most patients with mild hypoxemia. Oxygen by Venturi mask should be provided to patients requiring more precise titration of oxygen than can be provided by low flow nasal cannulae. High flow oxygen by face mask or high flow nasal cannulae should be provided for more severe hypoxemia. Noninvasive positive pressure, using CPAP or NIPPV, can be used to treat hypoxemia and hypercapnea in appropriately selected patients with more severe hypoxemia, as long as they are hemodynamically stable, alert, and able to protect their airway, assuming the underlying disease is readily reversible. Intubation is required for patients with severe hypoxemia and hypercapnea who are not candidates for or who fail attempts to use noninvasive approaches. Intubation should always be performed in a timely manner to avoid emergencies. Hypercapnea may have to be tolerated in some intubated patients with severe obstructive lung disease because excessive efforts to ventilate may subject patients to ventilator induced lung injury and hemodynamic instability. For both hypoxemia and hypercapnea, treatment of the underlying disease process is crucial. Patients with mild hypoxemia requiring low flow oxygen supplementation can be managed on an acute care ward. ICU admission is needed for all patients requiring intubation and is advisable for many or most requiring NIPPV. Non-specific symptoms and signs may be the first clue to hypoxemia. An evaluation is warranted in any patient complaining of dyspnea and should be considered in patients with wide ranging symptoms, including anxiety, headache, cough, and chest pain. Screening for hypoxemia is indicated in any patient with abnormal vital signs (i.e. heart rate, respiratory rate, blood pressure) and findings suggesting impaired gas exchange, including altered mental status, orthopnea, accessory muscle use and inability to speak in full sentences. Hypoxemia is difficult to detect on exam unless severe. Central cyanosis is generally not detectable unless the SaO is below the mid to low 80s. Peripheral cyanosis is a common manifestation of vasoconstriction and an unreliable sign of hypoxemia. Pulse oximetry is a widely available, useful tool for detecting hypoxemia. Probes can be applied over finger tips, the nose, ears and forehead. The SaO is derived by the wavelength of light reflected transcutaneously. The “pulse ox” (SpO2) generally correlates well with the SaO as long as perfusion is adequate to detect a pulse. Certain conditions decrease the reliability of pulse oximetry. The pulse of patients in shock and those with peripheral vascular disease may be too weak to generate a reliable signal. The relationship between the SpO and the SaO can vary from patient to patient, making it prudent to check an ABG to confirm correlation, particularly in seriously ill patients. In dark skinned and jaundiced patients, the SpO tends to be slightly higher – for example, an average of four percentage points in Black patients – for any given PaO or SaO, potentially creating a false sense of security. Certain toxic and metabolic abnormalities can shift the oxygen desaturation curve, altering the relationship between the oxygen saturation and PaO. Thus, even if the SpO reliably reflects the SaO, the correlation with the PaO may be altered. For example, carbon monoxide poisoning increases hemoglobin’s avidity for oxygen, which can lead to a high SpO and SaO even when the PaO is low. Alkalemia also increases hemoglobin oxygen avidity, similarly leading to a high oxygen saturation for any given PaO. In contrast, in the setting of acidosis, hemoglobin becomes less avid, decreasing the SaO for any given PaO. The definitive diagnosis of hypoxemia requires an arterial blood gas, which directly measures the PaO and SaO. For critically ill patients requiring frequent ABGs, it may be helpful to insert an arterial catheter (“a-line”), usually placed into the radial, axillary or femoral arteries. The severity of hypoxemia can be quantified by several techniques. The measured PaO and SaO should always be assessed in the context of the amount of supplemental oxygen given. A PaO2 or SaO2 reported without knowing how much supplemental oxygen was given is largely meaningless. The most commonly used indices of severity are the A-a Ogradient, PaO/FiO ratio and oxygenation index. The “A-a Ogradient” or “A-a O difference” is the most time honored approach to describing the severity of hypoxemia, with a higher gradient denoting more severe hypoxemia. The A-a Ogradient describes the difference between the partial pressure of oxygen in the alveoli (PAO) and partial pressure of oxygen in the arterial blood (PaO). The alveolar gas equation is used to calculate the PAO: where P equals the barometric pressure (760 mmHg at sea level), the PH0 the water vapor pressure (47 mmHg at 37C), and the R the respiratory quotient, typically 0.8. The P should be adjusted to reflect local barometric pressure, a significant issue for patients managed at higher altitudes. The A-a Ogradient equals the difference between the PaO obtained by the ABG subtracted from the calculated PAO (PAO – PaO). The gradient rises normally with age according to the following formula: The gradient also tends to increase when higher levels of oxygen supplementation is given, particularly in the setting of shunt. In patients managed noninvasively, uncertainty about the true FiO adds imprecision to the calculation of the A-a O gradient. The PaO/FiO ratio (P/F ratio) is commonly used to describe severity of hypoxemia, particularly in the setting of suspected ARDS/ALI. The ratio is calculated by dividing the PaO by the FiO. Normal individuals with a PaO of 100 mmHg on ambient air (FiO approximately 21%) have a P/F ratio of (100/0.21) or 476. A patient with a PaO of 60 mmHg on an FiO of 100% would have a P/F ratio of 60, indicating severe hypoxemia. An acutely ill patient with bilateral infiltrates on chest radiograph in the absence of CHF and a P/F ratio less than or equal to 200 meets the diagnostic criteria for ARDS. A similar patient with a P/F ratio less than or equal to 300 meets the criteria for ALI. As with the A-a O gradient, uncertainty about the FiO undermines the reliability of the P/F ratio. If an ABG is unavailable, the SaO/FiO may substitute for the P/F ratio. The P/F ratio and A-a O gradient share an important limitation by failing to account for the impact positive pressure ventilation has on the PaO. To illustrate this, consider a patient with a PaO of 100 mmHg on an FiO of 50% and 5 cmHO of PEEP and another patient with the same PaO on the same FiO and 20 cmHO of PEEP. Both patients have the same P/F ratio (200) even though the second patient’s hypoxemia is clearly more severe. The oxygenation index (OI) provides an alternate approach to describing the severity of hypoxemia, taking positive pressure into account as follows: The mean airway pressure is easily measured on modern ventilators and correlates directly with 1) the amount of PEEP applied and 2) the amount of pressure applied and time spent during inspiration. A higher OI denotes more severe hypoxemia. Although used less commonly in adults than the P/F ratio, the OI provides a useful comparison between mechanically ventilated patients requiring different amounts of positive pressure. The OI is sometimes used to identify patients with particularly severe hypoxemia who may need special treatment, such as extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). Diagnosis and assessment of severity of hypercapnea There is no simple, reliable way to measure PaCO noninvasively. Transcutaneous CO monitoring is uncommonly used and not validated for use in acute respiratory failure. An increase in the serum HCO may suggest the presence of hypercapnea and chronic respiratory acidosis. However, only an ABG can confirm hypercapnea and distinguish between a chronic respiratory acidosis and metabolic alkalosis. As a rule, acute hypercapnea should raise concern that a patient has developed or is at risk of developing ventilatory failure. However, the PaCO needs to be interpreted in the context of the patient’s underlying condition. A normal or low PaCO may be seen in many of the same conditions associated with hypercapnea, particularly when respiratory distress stimulates hyperventilation, for example in status asthmaticus. Patients may progress to hypercapnea if the underlying disorder persists or worsens; a single normal or low PaCO may warrant follow up in patients who fail to improve. In contrast, a single high PaCO does not necessarily indicate a need for ventilatory assistance if definitive treatment has not been started. A follow up ABG is strongly suggested to document improvement. In patients with severe respiratory distress, it is reasonable to make a presumptive clinical diagnosis of ventilatory failure if an ABG is not available. Signs suggesting hypercapnea include alterations in mental status (particularly somnolence); inability to speak in full sentences; and shallow, ineffective respiratory efforts. While an ABG may be useful to identify or confirm hypercapnea, initiation of ventilatory support should not be delayed just because hypercapnea has not been documented, particularly if suspicion is high. Similarly, it may be reasonable to forgo an ABG if it will not change the decision to initiate ventilatory support. In contrast, some patients may be at risk for hypercapnea and not manifest any signs of respiratory distress. This is particularly common among patients with impaired respiratory drives, including obesity hypoventilation disorder, brain stem strokes, narcotic use or abuse, and when supplemental oxygen is given to patients with COPD flares. In these patients, hypercapnea revealed on the ABG may be the only evidence available that the patient has respiratory failure. The implications of hypercapnea depend on severity and acuity. Hypercapnea causes a respiratory acidosis which is buffered by the serum HCO concentration. Acute elevations in the PaCO cause a more significant drop in serum pH than chronic elevations. When hypercapnea is chronic, the kidneys retain HCO, mitigating the drop in pH. When respiratory acidosis is acute, the serum HCO rises by approximately 1 meq/L for every 10 mmHg rise in the PaCO. When the respiratory acidosis is chronic, the HCO rises by approximately 3.5 meq/L for every 10 mmHg rise in the PaCO. In complex disorders, for example when patients have concurrent metabolic acidoses or alkaloses, or acute on chronic respiratory failure, the relationship between the PaCO and HCO is less predictable. The diagnostic approach to hypoxemia and hypercapnea includes 1) documenting the presence of gas exchange abnormalities and 2) identifying the cause. Hypoxemia and hypercapnea should be suspected in all patients with diseases and conditions affecting the lungs, either directly or indirectly. Gas exchange abnormalities should also be suspected in any patient with a dangerous or life threatening condition who presents with worrisome signs and symptoms, including shortness of breath, hypertension or hypotension, tachycardia or bradycardia, and tachypnea or bradypnea. Physical exam findings that should raise suspicion for hypoxemia and hypercapnea include central cyanosis, inability to speak in full sentences, orthopnea, alterations in mental status, heart murmurs and gallops, distended neck veins, peripheral edema, and abnormalities on lung exam such as dullness to percussion, wheezes, rhonchi and rales. Pulse oximetry and ABGs are the two most important tests used to identify hypoxemia and hypercapnea. Pulse oximetry should be performed on all patients at risk for hypoxemia, assuming equipment is available. If there is reason to believe that the oxygen saturation identified on the pulse oximeter (SpO) is inaccurate, an ABG should be performed. Reasons for inaccuracy include poor perfusion (e.g. due to shock or peripheral vascular disease), dark pigment or jaundice, exposure to carbon monoxide and the presence of acid-base disorders. ABGs are helpful to document the severity of hypoxemia, allowing calculation of the A-a O gradient, the PaO/FiO ratio and the oxygenation index. ABGs are essential to diagnose the presence of hypercapnea and to define the nature of acid-base disorders. An organized approach is needed to diagnose the underlying cause of hypoxemia and hypercapnea. A thorough history as well as a physical exam looking for evidence of both acute and chronic cardiac and pulmonary disorders are essential. The components of the physical exam required varies by patient and should be directed by a differential diagnosis built on the basis of the patient’s presentation. Key physical exam findings include: Vital signs: looking for abnormal temperature, heart rate, respiratory rate, blood pressure. HEENT: looking for jugular venous distention, papilledema. Respiratory: evaluating ability to speak in full sentences, presence of orthopnea, use of accessory muscles, respiratory pattern (e.g. shallow or irregular breathing); visualizing the chest; percussing (listening for dullness or hyperresonance); and auscultating (listening for adventitial lung sounds such as wheezes, rhonchi and crackles). Cardiac: listening for murmurs, a loud P2 and gallops. Abdomen: looking for respiratory paradox, underlying liver disease and evidence of abdominal compartment syndrome. Extremities: looking for evidence of edema, signs of deep venous thrombosis and clubbing (note peripheral cyanosis is not a reliable sign of hypoxemia in the absence of central cyanosis). Neurological: Evaluating for altered mental status and focal deficits. Directed laboratory testing hinges on the differential diagnosis generated by the history and physical exam. In addition to pulse oximetry and ABGs, common laboratory and imaging tests include the following: Complete blood count: looking for evidence of infection and anemia. Chemistries: looking for abnormalities in the serum HCO. Chest radiograph: PA and lateral if possible, although a portable AP may be necessary in patients too sick to travel to the radiology department. Chest CT: a standard CT may help identify subtle findings such as faint infiltrates, small pneumothoraces and pleural effusions not visible on routine chest radiographs. CT pulmonary angiograms are used to diagnose pulmonary embolism. High resolution chest CTs are useful for characterizing many lung disorders, such as interstitial lung disease and bronchiectasis. Ultrasound:thoracic ultrasound is useful to identify pleural effusions and is increasingly being used to identify parenchymal consolidation. Doppler ultrasound: helpful for identifying deep venous thromboses in the extremities. Echocardiogram: when CHF, tamponade or right ventricular dysfunction is a concern. Bronchoscopy: may be necessary acutely to diagnose and treat acute airway obstruction, for example due to mucous plugs, tumors or foreign body aspirations. A bronchoscopy can also be useful to obtain cultures and biopsy material. Surgical lung biopsy: useful to diagnose lung infections, malignancies and interstitial lung disease. V/Q scanning: used to diagnose pulmonary embolism but employed less frequently than CT pulmonary angiograms; may still be useful when there is a contraindication to intravenous contrast. Can also provide evidence for anatomic shunt when organs other than the lungs accumulate tracer on perfusion scan. PaO: 100 mmHg (may vary with altitude and by patient age) Hypoxemia is caused by six mechanisms occurring alone or together: shunt, ventilation-perfusion (V/Q) mismatch, diffusion impairment, hypoventilation, low mixed venous oxygen saturation (SvO2) and inadequate oxygen availability. Shunting occurs when deoxygenated blood returns to the systemic circulation without being exposed to oxygen. Shunt is identified by the failure to normalize the PaO with 100% oxygen, a feature not shared by other causes of hypoxemia. The following equation describes the severity of shunting: where Q/Q represents the shunt fraction, CcO the oxygen content of the end-capillary blood, CaO the oxygen content of the systemic arterial blood and CvO the oxygen content of the mixed venous blood. The PAO, calculated by the alveolar gas equation, is used to estimate the CcO. The CaOand CvO are calculated using measurements of the oxygen content of the arterial and mixed venous blood respectively. There are two types of shunt: physiologic and anatomic. Physiological shunts occur when alveolar units are so diseased that oxygen cannot be transported into the pulmonary capillaries. Causes include filling of the alveoli with edema or debris or collapse of an entire lobe or lung. Prominent examples include ARDS and atelectasis caused by a central mucous plug. Anatomic shunts imply that deoxygenated blood returns to the systemic circulation without passing through the alveolar-capillary unit. Anatomic shunts are cardiac or pulmonary in nature. With cardiac shunts, deoxygenated blood passes immediately from the right to the left side of the heart without passing through the lungs. Examples include a patent foramen ovale and atrial or ventricular septal defects. With pulmonary shunts, deoxygenated blood passes through the lung without exposure to the alveolar-capillary gas exchange units. An example is a pulmonary arteriovenous malformation, as seen in hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia. Anatomic shunts can be identified with imaging modalities. The most commonly used is an echocardiogram using intravenous injections of agitated saline which employs tiny air bubbles to provide contrast. In patients without anatomic shunts, contrast is seen on the right but does not pass to the left side of the heart. In patients with cardiac shunts, contrast passes immediately from the right to the left side of the heart through anatomic defects. In patients with pulmonary anatomic shunts, passage from the right side to the left is delayed by several heart beats as contrast passes through the pulmonary circulation. In patients with physiologic shunts, contrast fails to pass from the right to the left side because the bubbles are trapped in the pulmonary microvasculature. V/Q mismatch is one of the most common causes of hypoxemia and occurs when deoxygenated blood passes through lung units with low ventilation relative to perfusion. Alveolar-capillary units with low V/Q ratios have insufficient oxygen to saturate the deoxygenated blood passing through. As a result, poorly oxygenated blood returns to the systemic circulation. Unlike shunt, oxygen supplementation can override low V/Q by repleting oxygen in poorly ventilated units, reversing hypoxemia. V/Q mismatch is associated with many lung diseases, including pneumonia, COPD, and asthma. Even in patients with diseases dominated by physiological shunts, such as ARDS/ALI, at least some lung regions may be characterized by low V/Q and respond to oxygen supplementation. However, in the most diseased areas, the V/Q ratio approaches zero, resulting in physiological shunt, unresponsive to oxygen. Diffusion impairment results from an impediment of oxygen transfer from the alveolus to the pulmonary capillary. When diffusion is normal, deoxygenated blood quickly acquires oxygen during transit through the pulmonary capillary. When diffusion is impaired, transport of oxygen into the blood is delayed, so that additional time is needed for oxygenation. Delayed oxygen transfer may not be physiologically important as long as blood is saturated before leaving the pulmonary capillary. However, problems arise when transit time through the pulmonary capillary decreases because there may be insufficient time available to oxygenate the blood. This may happen, for example, when cardiac output increases with exercise. Disorders which can impair diffusion include interstitial lung disease, CHF and pneumocystis pneumonia. Hypoventilation causes hypoxemia as a result of hypercapnea. According to the aveolar gas equation, the PAO is inversely proportional to the PaCO, falling as the PaCO rises: No increase in the A-a O gradient occurs with hypoventilation, because the PAO and PaO fall in parallel. If an increased A-a O gradient occurs in the setting of hypercapnea, another mechanism in addition to hypoventilation must be contributing to hypoxemia. Causes of hypercapnea-induced hypoxemia include narcotic overdose and diseases associated with neuromuscular weakness, such as myasthenia gravis, acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (Guillain-Barre syndrome) and spinal cord injury. Low oxygen mixed venous oxygen saturation (low SvO) Decreases in the SvO are associated with increased oxygen utilization, depressed cardiac output and anemia. A low SvO rarely causes hypoxemia by itself. However, a low SvO can can exacerbate other causes of hypoxemia. For example, in the setting of shunt, a lower SvO means that the deoxygenated blood returning to the systemic circulation will be even more poorly oxygenated, worsening systemic hypoxemia. Hypoxemia may respond at least partially to interventions that address the low SvO. Examples include decreasing oxygen utilization (e.g. by controlling fever), increasing cardiac output (e.g. giving inotropes to patients with systolic dysfunction) and transfusing for anemia. Although not really a pathophysiological mechanism per se, it is helpful to consider inadequate oxygen availability as a factor that may contribute to hypoxemia. The alveolar gas equation indicates that a low P or low FiO can cause a low PAO. High altitudes are associated with a lower P and consequently, a lower PAO, all else being equal. A low FiO can occur when patients are not getting sufficient oxygen, for example in the setting of equipment malfunction or entrainment of ambient air into noninvasive supplementation systems. Inadequate FiO should always be considered in patients with unexplained hypoxemia and in those who remain hypoxemic despite supplementation. The PaCO is determined by CO production and ventilation: where K is a constant, VCO represents CO production and V alveolar ventilation. V cannot be readily measured and can be substituted as follows: where V represents the exhaled minute ventilation and V the dead space ventilation (regions of the lung that are ventilated but not perfused). Hypercapnea can result from increased VCO, increased Vor decreased V. In patients who can increase their V to compensate, an increased VCO or increased V should not cause hypercapnea. Hypercapnea can often be attributed to a failure to increase the V sufficiently to compensate for other stresses. In normal individuals, the VCO is determined by the basal metabolic rate. Factors which increase the VCO include fever, hyperthyroidism, overfeeding and increased muscle activity. In normal individuals, the V is largely fixed and accounted for by the anatomic dead space, made up of portions of the airways that do not participate in gas exchange, such as the trachea and bronchi. In the setting of shallow breathing, often seen with respiratory muscle fatigue, the V may become a larger fraction of the patient’s tidal volume (V/V), making ventilation less efficient. In the context of pulmonary disease, V is increased by a physiological component consisting of alveolar-capillary units with insufficient or no perfusion despite ventilation (i.e. areas of high V/Q or wasted ventilation). Many diseases increase physiological V, the classic being pulmonary embolism. Two factors contributing to hypercapnea include 1) a primary decrease in the V or 2) the failure of the V to increase sufficiently to meet the demands imposed by an elevated VCO or increased V. This can best be thought of as a state of imbalance between respiratory sytem load and respiratory muscle capacity. Causes of an inadequate V can be divided into three categories: 1) disorders that result in depressed neuromuscular capability; 2) disorders associated with an increased ventilatory load; and 3) disorders associated with impaired gas exchange at the level of the alveoli (see Table I). Steroid myopathy, polymyositis, sepsis, electrolyte imbalance (e.g. hypokalemia, hypophosphatemia), fatigue, diaphragm dysfunction associated with hyperinflation Fever, hyperthyroidism, overfeeding, increased work of breathing Chest wall deformity, scoliosis, abdominal compartment syndrome, pleural effusions, pulmonary edema, pneumonia, ARDS/ALI Problems on several levels can undermine ventilatory capacity. Central nervous system disorders can depress respiratory drive. Spinal cord injury and disease, damage to peripheral nerves and disease of the neuromuscular junction can undermine signaling to the respiratory muscles. Several diseases can cause primary muscle weakness and predispose patients to muscle fatigue. Finally, hypoventilation may occur due to inadequate ventilation at the level of the lungs, for example due to airway obstruction. The two factors that contribute most significantly to the respiratory workload are the airway resistance (R) and respiratory system elastance (E). Factors that increase the work load compromise the ventilatory response and can predispose patients to hypercapnea. The R is determined by the force (denoted as pressure generated in cmHO) divided by flow (measured in liters per second). The normal Ris low and contributes little to the work of breathing. However, a substantial increase in Rincreases the force needed to generate flow, which can significantly increase work of breathing in patients with diseases such as asthma and COPD. Respiratory system compliance (C) is the inverse of the elastic recoil pressure, or E: Respiratory system compliance (C) is determined by the change in lung volume (i.e. the tidal volume or V) divided by the change in elastic recoil pressure of the respiratory system (i.e. the end inspiratory pressure minus the end expiratory pressure): C = V/(End-inspiratory pressure – End-expiratory pressure) The C is determined by two components, the lung compliance (C) and the chest wall compliance (C): It is generally difficult to isolate the contribution of C from that of C, which would require measurement of pleural pressures, something that is not done routinely. However, features of the patient’s clinical presentation should help distinguish between the two. C is denoted in mL/cmHO. The normal C is approximately 50 ml/cmHO. Normally, relatively little force is needed to overcome elastic recoil pressure and inflate the lungs. A variety of processes can decrease the C (e.g. pulmonary edema, ARDS/ALI, pneumonia) and C (e.g. abdominal compartment syndrome, large pleural effusions). Either can decrease the C and increase the work of breathing and risk of hypercapnea. In summary, ventilatory failure and hypercapnea are largely the result of imbalance between ventilatory capacity and ventilatory load, with some contribution from inadequate alveolar ventilation. Prevention or treatment of hypercapnea requires interventions to increase ventilatory capacity and to decrease the ventilatory load. Examples of interventions to improve ventilatory capacity include reversing the respiratory depressant effects of narcotics, repleting phosphate in patients with hypophosphatemia, and providing ventilatory support to rest patients with respiratory muscle fatigue. Interventions which can decrease ventilatory load include diuretics to improve C in patients with CHF and bronchodilators to decrease R in asthma. The epidemiology of hypoxemia and hypercapnea parallel the epidemiology of disorders of the lungs, heart and other organ systems which lead to gas exchange abnormalities.

Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a potentially life-threatening injury to the lungs. by a severe inflammatory response in your body when there is a severe infection or after trauma. This inflammation causes fluid to leak into the lungs, which makes it extremely difficult to breathe and decreases the amount of oxygen going into the bloodstream. The lack of oxygen can harm the brain, kidneys, and other internal organs. Acute respiratory distress syndrome can progress rapidly, be unpredictable and can cause death. Treatment and recovery for acute respiratory distress syndrome can take weeks to months. What are the signs and symptoms of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)? Most people who develop ARDS are already in the hospital because of another disease or injury. Fluid buildup in the lungs can cause the lungs to become stiff and sometimes scarred. Stiff or scarred lungs make it difficult to breathe because it takes more work to breath. Fluid in the air sacks also makes it harder for oxygen to get into the blood. The most common are , rapid breathing and rapid heartbeat. Other symptoms of acute respiratory distress syndrome can include cough with or without mucus, blue lips or fingernails, chest pain during breathing, extreme fatigue and low blood pressure. A variety of tests are used to and rule out other conditions. A shows if there is fluid or pneumonia in one or both lungs. Blood cultures determine if there is an infection in the blood and can indicate the source of acute respiratory distress syndrome. An measures how much oxygen and carbon dioxide are in the blood to show how well the lungs are working. A sputum sample is tested to help determine the cause of infection. (Sputum or phlegm is a gooey substance that is coughed up when there is an infection in the lungs or airways.) A provides detailed images of the heart, lungs and abdomen and identifies possible sources of acute respiratory distress syndrome. and echocardiogram can rule out certain heart conditions that can be mistaken for ARDS. How is acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) treated? include supplemental oxygen, a ventilator and medication. Supplemental oxygen ensures that the blood and body have enough oxygen to function properly. A mechanical ventilator supports the extra work it takes to breathe. Medication or other interventions treat the underlying cause of ARDS. Sometimes, an extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) machine may be used to oxygenate the blood outside the body while the body fights the infection or trauma and repairs itself. Sedation is often used to prevent anxiety caused from being on these machines. Other treatments can include laying the patient on their stomach to help the lungs work better. Sometimes a feeding tube is placed to ensure the body is getting proper nutrition. Treatment can take days to weeks depending on the severity of the infection. After the patient is taken off of the ventilator, pulmonary rehabilitation can help rebuild strength. Patients can sometimes develop post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and sleep problems after being in an intensive care unit for a long time. Emotional support can be helpful in dealing with anxiety, stress and depression that are common with severe illness and prolonged hospital stays.

d4b8c254-4c1a-4fd2-8261-4afcef564920,"— — Acute respiratory failure occurs when fluid builds up in the air sacs in your lungs. When that happens, your lungs can’t release oxygen into your blood. In turn, your organs can’t get enough oxygen-rich blood to function. You can also develop acute respiratory failure if your lungs can’t remove carbon dioxide from your blood. Respiratory failure happens when the capillaries, or tiny blood vessels, surrounding your air sacs can’t properly exchange carbon dioxide for oxygen. The condition can be acute or chronic. With acute respiratory failure, you experience immediate symptoms from not having enough oxygen in your body. In most cases, this failure may lead to death if it’s not treated quickly. The two types of acute and respiratory failure are hypoxemic and hypercapnic. Both conditions can trigger serious complications and the conditions often coexist. Hypoxemic respiratory failure means that you don’t have enough oxygen in your blood, but your levels of carbon dioxide are close to normal. respiratory failure means that there’s too much carbon dioxide in your blood, and near normal or not enough oxygen in your blood. What are the symptoms of acute respiratory failure? The symptoms of acute respiratory failure depend on its underlying cause and the levels of carbon dioxide and oxygen in your blood. People with a high carbon dioxide level may experience: in the skin, fingertips, or lips People with acute failure of the lungs and low oxygen levels may experience: Acute respiratory failure has several different causes: When something lodges in your throat, you may have trouble getting enough oxygen into your lungs. Obstruction can also occur in people with or when an exacerbation causes the airways to become narrow. An injury that impairs or compromises your respiratory system can adversely affect the amount of oxygen in your blood. For instance, an injury to the or can immediately affect your breathing. The brain tells the lungs to breathe. If the brain can’t relay messages due to injury or damage, the lungs can’t continue to function properly. An injury to the or can also hamper the breathing process. These injuries can impair your ability to inhale enough oxygen into your lungs. (ARDS) is a serious condition characterized by low oxygen in the blood. ARDS affects you if you already have an underlying health problem such as: lung injuries caused by inhalation of smoke or chemical products It can occur while you’re in the hospital being treated for your underlying condition. If you or drink too much , you can impair brain function and hinder your ability to breathe in or exhale. Inhaling toxic chemicals, smoke, or fumes can also cause acute respiratory failure. These chemicals may injure or damage the tissues of your lungs, including the air sacs and capillaries. A occurs when your brain experiences tissue death or damage on one or both sides of the brain. Often, it affects only one side. Although stroke does present some , such as slurred speech or confusion, it typically occurs quickly. If you have a stroke, you may lose your ability to breathe properly. Infections are a common cause of respiratory distress. in particular, may cause respiratory failure, even in the absence of ARDS. According to the , in some cases pneumonia affects all five lobes of the lungs. You may be at risk for acute respiratory failure if you: have a family history of respiratory disease or conditions have chronic (long-term) respiratory problems, such as , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), or asthma Acute respiratory failure requires immediate medical attention. You may receive oxygen to help you breathe and to prevent tissue death in your organs and brain. After your doctor stabilizes you, he or she will take certain steps to diagnose your condition, such as: ask you questions about your family or personal health history check your body’s oxygen and carbon dioxide levels level with a device and an arterial order a to look for abnormalities in your lungs Treatment usually addresses any underlying conditions you may have. Your doctor will then treat your respiratory failure with a variety of options. Your doctor may prescribe pain medications or other medicines to help you breathe better. If you can breathe adequately on your own and your hypoxemia is mild, you may from an oxygen tank to help you breathe better. Portable air tanks are available if your condition requires one. If you can’t breathe adequately on your own, your doctor may insert a into your mouth or nose, and connect the tube to a ventilator to help you breathe. If you require prolonged ventilator support, an operation that creates an artificial airway in the windpipe called a may be necessary. You may receive oxygen via an oxygen tank or ventilator to help you breathe better. You may see improvement in your lung function if you get appropriate treatment for your underlying condition. You may also require pulmonary rehabilitation, which includes exercise therapy, education, and counseling. Acute respiratory failure can cause long-term damage to your lungs. It’s important to seek emergency medical care if you’re experiencing the symptoms of respiratory failure. — — Chronic respiratory failure is an ongoing condition that develops over time.

21668f8b-7199-4458-b4d7-610361af0678,"— The is responsible for the exchange of carbon dioxide and oxygen in the human body. This system also helps remove metabolic waste products and keep pH levels in check. The major parts of the respiratory system include the upper respiratory tract and the lower respiratory tract. In this article, we’ll explore all there is to know about the human respiratory system, including the parts and functions, as well as common conditions that can affect it. The entire respiratory system contains two tracts: the upper respiratory tract and the lower respiratory tract. As the names imply, the upper respiratory tract consists of everything above the vocal folds, and the lower respiratory tract includes everything below the vocal folds. These two tracts work together to perform respiration, or the process of exchanging carbon dioxide and oxygen between your body and the atmosphere. From the nose to the lungs, the various elements of the respiratory tract play equally different but important roles in the entire process of respiration. The upper respiratory tract begins with the sinuses and nasal cavity, both of which are in the area behind the nose. The is the area directly behind the nose that allows outside air into the body. As the air comes through the nose, it encounters cilia lining the nasal cavity. These cilia help trap and dispose of any foreign particles. The are air spaces behind the front of your skull that are located on either side of the nose and along the forehead. The sinuses help to regulate air temperature as you breathe. In addition to entering through the nasal cavity, air can also enter through the mouth. Once air enters the body, it flows into the lower portion of the upper respiratory system with the pharynx and larynx. The , or throat, allows for the passage of air from the nasal cavity or mouth to the larynx and trachea. The , or voice box, contains the vocal folds that are necessary for us to speak and make sounds. After air enters the larynx, it continues down into the lower respiratory tract, which begins with the trachea. The , or windpipe, is the passage that allows air to flow directly to the lungs. This tube is very rigid and is composed of multiple . Anything that causes the trachea to narrow, such as inflammation or obstruction, will restrict oxygen flow to the lungs. The primary function of the lungs is to exchange oxygen for carbon dioxide. When we breathe, the lungs inhale oxygen and exhale carbon dioxide. In the , the trachea branches off into two , or tubes, that lead into each lung. These bronchi then continue to branch off into smaller . Finally, these bronchioles end in , or air sacks, that are responsible for the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide. Carbon dioxide and oxygen are exchanged in the alveoli through the following steps: The heart pumps deoxygenated blood to the lungs. This deoxygenated blood contains carbon dioxide, which is a by-product of our everyday cellular metabolism. Once the deoxygenated blood reaches the alveoli, it releases the carbon dioxide in exchange for oxygen. The blood is now oxygenated. The oxygenated blood then travels from the lungs back to the heart, where it’s released back into the circulatory system. Along with the exchange of minerals in the kidneys, this exchange of carbon dioxide in the lungs is also responsible for helping to maintain the of the blood. Bacteria, viruses, and even autoimmune conditions can cause illnesses of the respiratory system. Some respiratory illnesses and conditions only affect the upper tract, while others primarily affect the lower tract. There are multiple types of , including food allergies, seasonal allergies, and even skin allergies, that can affect the upper respiratory tract. Some allergies cause mild symptoms, such as runny nose, congestion, or itchy throat. More serious allergies can lead to anaphylaxis and closing of the airways. The is an upper respiratory tract infection that can be triggered by over 200 viruses. Symptoms of the common cold include runny or stuffy nose, congestion, pressure in the sinuses, sore throat, and more. is a condition that happens when the larynx or vocal cords become inflamed. This condition can be caused by irritation, infection, or overuse. The most common symptoms are losing your voice and throat irritation. Also known as a sore throat, is inflammation of the pharynx caused by bacterial or viral infections. A sore, scratchy, dry throat is the primary symptom of pharyngitis. This may also be accompanied by cold or flu symptoms such as runny nose, coughing, or wheezing. can be both acute and chronic. This condition is characterized by swollen, inflamed membranes in the nasal cavity and sinuses. Symptoms include congestion, sinus pressure, mucus drainage, and more. is a chronic inflammatory condition that affects the airways. This inflammation causes the airways to narrow, which in turn causes difficulty breathing. Asthma symptoms may include shortness of breath, coughing, and wheezing. If these symptoms become severe enough, they can become an asthma attack. is a condition characterized by inflammation of the bronchial tubes. Symptoms of this condition usually feel like cold symptoms at first, and then turn into a mucus-producing cough. Bronchitis can be either acute (less than 10 days) or chronic (several weeks and recurring). is an umbrella term for a group of chronic, progressive lung diseases, the most common being bronchitis and emphysema. Over time, these conditions can lead to the deterioration of the airways and lungs. If not treated, they can cause other chronic respiratory illnesses. Symptoms of COPD include: is a condition that damages the alveoli of the lungs and causes a decrease in the amount of circulating oxygen. Emphysema is a chronic, untreatable condition. The most common symptoms are exhaustion, weight loss, and increased heart rate. is a type of cancer located in the lungs. Lung cancer differs depending on where the cancer is located, such as in the alveoli or airways. Symptoms of lung cancer include shortness of breath and wheezing, accompanied by chest pain, lingering cough with blood, and unexplained weight loss. is an infection that causes the alveoli to become inflamed with pus and fluid. , or severe acute respiratory syndrome, and both cause pneumonia-like symptoms, which are both caused by the coronavirus. This family of has been linked to other severe respiratory infections. If left untreated, pneumonia can be fatal. Symptoms include shortness of breath, chest pain, coughing with mucus, and more. There are other conditions and illnesses that can affect the respiratory system, but the most common conditions are listed above. Treatment for respiratory conditions differs depending on the type of illness. Bacterial infections that lead to respiratory conditions require for treatment. Antibiotics can be taken as pills, capsules, or liquids. When you take antibiotics, they’re effective immediately. Even if you begin to feel better, you should always take the full course of antibiotics prescribed to you. Unlike bacterial infections, there’s generally no treatment for respiratory diseases. Instead, you must wait for your body to fight off the viral infection on its own. Over-the-counter (OTC) medications can provide some relief from symptoms and allow your body to rest. The common cold and viral laryngitis, pharyngitis, sinusitis, bronchitis, or pneumonia can take upward of multiple weeks to fully recover from. Some respiratory system conditions are chronic and untreatable. For these conditions, the focus is on managing the symptoms of the illness. OTC allergy medications can help reduce symptoms. an inhaler and lifestyle changes can help reduce symptoms and flare-ups. treatments involve medications and machines that can help the lungs breathe easier. surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy are all treatment options. If you’re experiencing any of the symptoms of bacterial, viral, or chronic respiratory infections, visit your doctor. They can check for signs in your nose and mouth, listen for sounds in your airways, and run multiple to determine if you have any kind of respiratory illness. The human respiratory system is responsible for helping provide oxygen to cells, remove carbon dioxide from the body, and balance the pH of the blood. The upper respiratory tract and the lower respiratory tract both play a crucial role in the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide. When viruses and bacteria enter the body, they can cause illnesses and conditions that lead to inflammation of the respiratory tracts.

Retrieved Jan 23 2021 from https://www.thefreelibrary.com/Improving+ventilation+in+children+using+bilevel+positive+airway...-a021114460 Noninvasive positive pressure ventilation by way of a mask, commonly known as BiPAP, has become a widely used procedure to support patients with respiratory failure, both in the chronic and the acute settings. Currently, this mode of ventilation has been extended to the pediatric population. This article focuses on the use of BiPAP in pediatric patients. Its purpose, potential situations for use, mode of functioning, and nursing implications will be discussed. Until recently, options for mechanical ventilation for children with chronic respiratory problems included negative pressure ventilation or positive pressure ventilation through an artificial airway (Padman, Lawless, & Von Nesson, 1994) (see Figure 1). The first method, negative pressure ventilation, was a commonly utilized, noninvasive technique, dating back to the 1830s (Hill, 1997). An example of this is the iron lung, which was common during polio epidemics (Hill, 1993; Pierson, 1997). The use of noninvasive ventilation sharply declined, and in the 1950s it was replaced by positive pressure ventilation using an endotracheal tube (Hill, 1997). This mode provided more effective ventilation of acutely ill patients, as evidenced by lower mortality rates (Hill, 1993; Pierson, 1997). Presently, the trend is again reversing; noninvasive positive pressure ventilation is becoming a more widely used procedure to support patients with respiratory failure both in the chronic and the acute settings (Hill, 1997; Pierson, 1997; Teague, 1997). In the past decade, this method of ventilation has been extended to the pediatric population. [Figure 1 ILLUSTRATION OMITTED] Defining Noninvasive Positive Pressure Ventilation The term ""noninvasive ventilation"" refers to a method of achieving alveolar ventilation without endotracheal intubation or other invasive respiratory techniques, such as tracheotomy (Hill, 1993). The term ""noninvasive positive pressure ventilation"" (NPPV) was defined as the ""application of positive pressure via the upper respiratory tract for the purpose of augmenting alveolar ventilation"" (American Respiratory Care Foundation [ARCF], 1997, p. 364). There are different modalities of NPPV. These include: (a) CPAP - continuous positive airway pressure, (b) IPPB - intermittent positive pressure breathing, and (c) BiPAP - bilevel positive airway pressure. CPAP provides a constant flow of positive pressure to prevent collapse of alveoli. IPPB is a type of CPAP that is used for an intermittent purpose to deliver aerosol medications. BiPAP differs from the previous two in that it provides constant positive pressure at two different pressure settings: one for inspiration and one for expiration. How BiPAP Works In the healthy child, normal spontaneous breaths inflate alveoli in the lungs to maintain adequate gas exchange. In the patient with a compromised respiratory system, alveoli may not be adequately inflated due to weakened respiratory muscles, weakened respiratory drive, airway obstruction, injury to lung tissue, or underdeveloped lungs. Alveolar hypoventilation leads to hypoxia and hypercarbia (Teague & Fortenberry, 1995). There are various approaches to help improve one's respiratory status. Positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) and continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) are both used in children with poor ventilation and oxygenation (Bolton & Kline, 1994). In the patient with altered respiratory status, alveoli may close at the end of expiration and may not reopen with the next inspiration (Bolton & Kline, 1994). Both PEEP and CPAP provide pressure to keep alveoli open; PEEP is pressure at the end of expiration and CPAP is pressure applied continuously. Both work by increasing one's functional residual capacity, which is the volume of air in the lungs at the end of expiration. A larger number of open alveoli increases the surface area available for gas exchange. Work of breathing is decreased because less work is necessary to reinflate the collapsed alveoli. PEEP is administered by a ventilator, while CPAP can be used in the spontaneously breathing patient (see Figure 2). [Figure 2 ILLUSTRATION OMITTED] Likewise, the addition of pressure at the beginning of inspiration provides additional pressure support ventilation. Pressure support ventilation (PSV) is a way of assisting the work of inspiration. Inspiration is supported by positive pressure, which increases tidal volume and minute ventilation (Padman, Nadkarni, Von Nesson & Goodill, 1994). More areas of alveoli are prevented from collapsing (Joris, Sottiaux, Chiche, Desaive, & Lamy, 1997). Additionally, pressure support is thought to decrease the work of breathing by resting accessory muscle use (Akingbola, Servant, Custer, & Palmisano 1993) (see Table 1). Table 1. Results of Pressure Support * Increase tidal volume * Increase minute ventilation * Decreases accesory muscle use * Decreases work of breathing BiPAP works by combining the benefits of PSV and CPAP, and keeps the lungs open during the entire respiratory cycle (Joris et al., 1997). Inspiratory pressure causes lung inflation and may be adjusted by way of the IPAP (inspiratory positive airway pressure) controls on the BiPAP. Expiratory pressure prevents alveolar collapse and is delivered by the EPAP (expiratory positive airway pressure) controls on the BiPAP (see Figure 3). Rate or frequency of cycling between IPAP and EPAP may also be controlled with a range from 6 to 30 cycles per minute (Strumpf, Carlisle, Millman, Smith, & Hill, 1990). The amount of time spent in IPAP (10%- 90%) may also be regulated (Akingbola et al., 1993). BiPAP is available in two modes. In the spontaneous mode, the IPAP and the EPAP are set, and the patient triggers inspiration and expiration. In the spontaneous timed mode, back-up breaths are delivered when the patient's rate of breathing falls below a preset level (Strumpf et al., 1990). There is also the less used timed mode in which inspiratory time and rate are completely controlled by the machine. [Figure 3 ILLUSTRATION OMITTED] Basically, as the patient initiates a breath, the machine imposes a preset inspiratory pressure or IPAP. Pressure in the ventilator then drops to a preset expiratory pressure or EPAP. This is done in synchrony with the patient's breathing pattern (Akingbola et al., 1993). Typically the respiratory therapist begins by selecting the appropriate expiratory pressure for the child, for example, an EPAP of 5-6 cm [H.SUB.2]0. Inspiratory pressure is then added at 10-12 cm [H.SUB.2]0 and titrated upward accordingly. Pressures of 12 of IPAP and 6 of EPAP indicate that a pressure support of about 6 cm is being delivered. A rate of 6 to 30 cycles may be delivered according to the child's status. Reduced dyspnea, decreased respiratory rate, decreased use of accessory muscles, improved blood gas values, and synchronization with the BiPAP ventilator would indicate effective ventilation. Naturally, agitation, increased confusion, hemodynamic instability, worsened oxygenation, or difficulty clearing secretions would serve as indicators that BiPAP is not effective. Alternative treatment should be sought (ARCF, 1997). The type of ventilator designed exclusively for delivery of NPPV is called the pressure target ventilator. Although several devices are available for NPPV (including volume targeted ventilators), the majority of published research regarding pediatrics describe experiences with the BiPAP system (Teague & Fortenberry, 1995). BiPAP systems are mainly available as contoured nasal or oral masks attached to a ventilation system. The masks are secured to the patient using a headband or similar attachment device (see Figures 4, 5, and 6). Humidified oxygen may be added into a mask side port (Teague, 1997). Although alarms are not built into every ventilator, they may easily be added. [Figures 4-6 ILLUSTRATION OMITTED] Factors in the Decision to Choose NPPV Several factors contribute to the clinician's decision to choose NPPV over traditional ventilation methods. The first factor stems from the recognition that chronic respiratory conditions are becoming more prevalent in the pediatric population. There is a growing population of children surviving lung injury induced by extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and high frequency ventilation who require long periods of ventilatory support by way of tracheotomy or intubation (Teague & Fortenberry, 1995). While ventilation of these patients has been successful, there are medical and psychological problems that may develop with prolonged tracheotomy (Waldhorn, 1992). NPPV use during the recovery phase of lung injury may serve to avoid the complications of tracheotomy (Teague & Fortenberry, 1995). Since BiPAP is usually used nocturnally, the functions of speaking and eating are preserved (Padman, Nadkarni, et al., 1994). Likewise, although endotracheal intubation extends life by improving respiratory status, several complications are associated with it. These include aspiration and laryngeal or tracheal injury. In addition, pneumonia and sinusitis contribute to increased hospital stays and increased mortality (Brochard, 1996; Padman, Lawless, et al., 1994). Heavy sedation and restraint to prevent accidental extubation may be required (Brochard, 1996; Fortenberry, Del Toro, Jefferson, Evey, & Haase, 1995). The presence of the endotracheal tube itself may contribute to post-extubation respiratory distress (Brochard, 1996). These factors contribute to a longer and more complicated hospital course. The high cost associated with prolonged stay for assisted ventilation in intensive care may be spared by use of BiPAP, since it can be used at home or outside of the ICU. Padman, Lawless, and colleagues (1994) and Padman, Nadkarni, and associates (1994) have shown successful use of BiPAP outside of the hospital intensive care unit. BiPAP may be a more appropriate choice of ventilatory support for children with conditions, if they were intubated, where extubation may prove to be unlikely (Brochard, 1996). An example is the child with cystic fibrosis or severe muscular dystrophy (Padman, Nadkarni, et al., 1994). Additionally, consideration should be given to the use of BiPAP rather than intubation and invasive ventilation in patients with severe chronic neurological dysfunction and terminal disease processes such as HIV and cancer (Brochard, 1996). Additional issues exist in that these latter children have increased vulnerability to infection due to their immunocompromised state (Akingbola et al., 1993). Potential alternatives to lessen these issues may be the use of negative pressure ventilation; however this method poses many limitations, including the large size of the tank and altered patient mobility. Additionally, it may contribute to apnea and upper airway obstruction (Padman, Lawless, et al., 1994). Potential Uses for BiPAP There are several pediatric conditions in which BiPAP has potential use as a method of ventilation. The following section analyzes current literature and past practice to form conclusions regarding usage of BiPAP in pediatric patients. Respiratory problems will be divided into chronic and acute disorders. Chronic respiratory distress. NPPV is usually applied nocturnally for 6 to 10 hours to patients with chronic respiratory problems. There are three theories regarding how improvement in daytime gas exchange occurs: (a) tired respiratory muscles are rested and restored; (b) there is improvement of lung compliance; and (c) there is reversal of the diminished respiratory center's sensitivity to carbon dioxide, thought to cause gradual hypoventilation (Hill, 1993). BiPAP has possible use in the child with central hypoventilation syndrome (CHS). Children with this syndrome demonstrate abnormal breathing patterns with symptoms of cyanosis, apnea, and hypopnea. Etiology is linked to a lack of sensitivity of central chemoreceptors to carbon dioxide, resulting in abnormal responses to hypercapnia and hypoxia (Pia Villa et al., 1997; Teague, 1997). A recent study demonstrated successful use of NPPV in a 4-month-old child with CHS. In this child's case, nocturnal use of BiPAP improved all of her symptoms, including hypercapnia and hypoxia and tracheotomy was avoided (Pia Villa et al., 1997). This report on the use of BiPAP in infants with central hypoventilation syndrome is an isolated one; more controlled studies are necessary before recommendations can be made (Teague, 1997). In adults, BiPAP has improved symptoms of hypoventilation and hypercarbia experienced in those with progressive neuromuscular and restrictive wall disorders, such as muscular dystrophy, post polio syndrome, multiple sclerosis, tuberculosis, and kyphoscoliosis (Hill, 1993; Teague, 1997; Waldhorn, 1992). Use of BiPAP may enhance ventilation by resting chronically fatigued muscles (Waldhorn, 1992). Padman, Lawless, and colleagues (1994) were able to demonstrate decreases in hospital days, respiratory rate, heart rate, and serum bicarbonates and improved arterial blood gases in patients with varied restrictive disorders, including spinal muscle atrophy, cystic fibrosis, spinal cord injury, and muscular dystrophy. Currently, patients with spinal muscle atrophy and similar degenerative muscle disorders are using BiPAP as part of their pulmonary management upon discharge from the hospital. Use in chronic obstructive airway disease (COAD), such as cystic fibrosis, has also been demonstrated. Muscle fatigue associated with inadequate nutrition is thought to contribute to failure in children with COAD (Teague, 1997). ""BiPAP could be used to 'unload' the inspiratory muscles, and thereby, raise minute ventilation in those patients whose respiratory effort is limited by muscle fatigue"" (Teague, 1997, p. 417). Muscle energy expenditure and work of breathing would, in theory, be decreased. This effect was evidenced in 1994, when Padman, Nadkarni, and associates (1994) studied the effects of BiPAP on seven children with cystic fibrosis. Blood gas values improved and in five patients, BiPAP maintained their stability until transplantation. Use of NPPV in children with bronchopulmonary dysplasia may be limited in view of the fact that high peak inspiratory pressures are required in this type of disease. Most of the ventilators currently available would not have the ability to meet the high inspiratory pressure demand of this population (Teague, 1997). Nocturnal obstructive hypoventilation (NOH) is seen in children with morbid obesity, Down syndrome, craniofaciai anomalies, and congenital abnormality of the larynx and trachea, all which contribute to upper airway obstruction. NOH may result in severe hypoventilation due to partial upper airway narrowing. Treatment includes several stages of surgery to improve the upper airway. NPPV has potential use to reduce airway occlusions and improve gas exchange in the phase before surgical correction is complete. However, only preliminary studies exist and more controlled study is needed (Teague, 1997). Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is characterized by ""symptoms ranging from obstructive apnea with mild hypoxemia to prolonged episodes of obstructive hypopnea with hypercarbia"" (Teague, 1997, p. 415). Adenotonsillectomy often cures OSA in children. Due to its potential to assist inspiratory effort and relieve inspiratory muscle fatigue thought to cause OSA, BiPAP may also be beneficial in these children (Teague, 1997). It was successfully utilized in children with respiratory compromise post adenotonsillectomy (Rosen, Muckle, Mahowald, Goding, & Ullevig, 1994). BiPAP can be used for these children both in the hospital and at home. Children with chronic respiratory failure using nocturnal NPPV should be seen by their caregiver every 2-4 months (Teague, 1997). Rationale for this is based on the fact that children with progressive neuromuscular diseases may have gradually increasing Pa[CO.sub.2] values, which may be treated with adjustments in IPAP (Hill, 1997). Follow-up visits should include monitoring of growth, swallowing, muscle strength, pulmonary function, and arterial blood gas values (Teague, 1997). Acute respiratory distress. NPPV could potentially be used in the relief of acute respiratory distress in children. While several reports of the success of NPPV in preventing intubation in adults exist, fewer are available in regards to children (Teague, 1997). In 1993, Akingbola and associates reported the successful use of NPPV in two children with atelectasis and pulmonary edema. Fortenberry and colleagues (1995) demonstrated decreased respiratory rates and improved gas exchange in children with mild to modest hypoxemic respiratory distress following treatment with nasal BiPAP. In acute respiratory distress, there is a reduction in a person's functional residual capacity, which causes a ventilation-perfusion mismatch resulting in hypoxemia. Control of this type of distress is managed with interventions that increase lung volume (Akingbola et al., 1993). Additionally, some of the improvement seen in BiPAP may be attributed to ""support for respiratory muscles or (due to) the stenting of upper airways or large bronchi"" (Fortenberry et al., 1995, p. 1061). There is potential for BiPAP to be used in facilitating the weaning process from mechanical ventilation (Sassoon, 1995). Nasal masks could be considered for use in patients immediately post-extubation, especially if there is residual muscle weakness (Fortenberry et al., 1995). Currently, at A.I. DuPont Hospital for Children, NPPV is used in these situations in eligible patients, along with close monitoring in the intensive care unit. Status asthmaticus may be characterized by severe hypoxemia and respiratory muscle fatigue (Teague, 1997). BiPAP has been successfully used for treatment of adults with exacerbation of asthma (Meduri, Cook, Turner, Cohen, & Leeper, 1996). At this time, routine use of NPPV in children with acute asthma is not recommended until further studies are available (Teague, 1997). Although studies exist confirming the successful use of NPPV in the acutely ill population, ""most studies of NPPV have actually excluded patients who need immediate intubation"" (Wunderink & Hill, 1997, p. 395). This is obviously due to lack of time in an emergency situation to consider a less utilized, less validated technique. Contraindications to BiPAP McGarry (1992) argues against the use of BiPAP in cases in which the patient is on the verge of being intubated or recently extubated. He believes that patients enduring acute distress on BiPAP will be unable to protect their airway and are, therefore, more prone to gastric insufflation, vomiting, and aspiration, leading to respiratory arrest. Hill (1997) contends that aspiration, although possible, is an infrequent complication seen more often in patients with previously impaired airway protection ability. Severe hypoxemia is most likely not amenable to treatment with BiPAP. Reasons for failure to control hypoventilation may be attributed to conditions requiring a higher peak pressure (greater than 25 cm [H.SUB.2]0) than the BiPAP is able to deliver (McGarry, 1992; Padman, Lawless, et al., 1994). Exclusion criteria for use of BiPAP in children in acute distress include excessive airway secretions, inability to protect one's airway, and inability to cooperate (Teague, 1997; Turner, 1997). Choanal stenosis with nasopharyngeal airway occlusion and severe laryngomalacia are examples of conditions that would absolutely preclude NPPV use (Teague, 1997). Nursing Implications As with any therapy, nurses must be aware of potential complications and side effects (see Tables 2 and 3). Common complications regarding use of the mask include excoriation at the points of skin contact and acneiform rashes (Hill, 1997). Application of protective barriers such as duoderm and use of antibiotic creams may solve these issues (Hill, 1997; Turner, 1997). Alternating between different types of masks may also ameliorate skin problems. Eye irritation related to the mask or air is comforted with lubricating drops, and nasal burning or dryness is eased with increased humidification (Hill, 1997). Table 2. Pros and Cons of BiPAP Positive Negative Speech function preserved Pressure sores, discomfort Increased mobility Rashes Swallowing function preserved Nasal dryness, irritation Fosters independence Eye irritation Portability of ventilator Air leaks Decreased costs Possible aspiration Table 3. Strategies for Successful Use of BiPAP in Children * Explain the therapy to the family and child * Select proper mask size * Avoid very tight mask fit * Monitor and make appropriate adjustments in fit and ventilator settings * Use protective barriers for skin * Use humidification, nasal decongestants * Allow breaks in wearing time if possible Poor mask fit contributes to skin and eye irritation. It also may be responsible for leaks around the mask. A leak is acceptable as long as it does not alter the ventilator's capability to cycle from expiration to inspiration and back again (Turner, 1997). Caution is advised in adjusting the mask too tightly to avoid leaks (Hill, 1997). A better approach is to apply various size masks on the child to find the best fit (Hill, 1997). Following application of the mask, careful adjustment of alarms for sensitivity in changes facilitates monitoring for leaks (Turner, 1997). Nasal masks are the more usual mode of use, but oronasal masks are also available. Use of oronasal masks increases the chance of aspiration; masks should be made of a see-through plastic and used with much caution (Fortenberry et al., 1995). Special preparation of the child and family combined with a clinician experienced in the use of BiPAP ensures a greater chance of success. The mask is more easily tolerated if it is placed on the child at low pressure settings (5-6 cm [H.SUB.2]0 inspiratory pressure and 6-10 cm [H.sub.2]0 expiratory pressure). Once synchronization with ventilation is achieved, pressures may be titrated to higher levels (Teague, 1997). Gastric distension is a rare complication. None of the 28 children using BiPAP experienced gastric distension and a nasogastric tube was unnecessary (Fortenberry et al., 1995). Although flatulence has been reported, it has not been described as intolerable (Hill, 1997). Another potential complication is the rebreathing of carbon dioxide, which could potentially result in increased work of breathing (Lofaso et al., 1995). There is a nonrebreathing valve available to prevent this. Lofaso and associates (1995) compared the BiPAP ventilator with its normal exhalation valve to a BiPAP with a nonrebreathing isolation valve. Results revealed that use of BiPAP without the nonrebreathing valve increases work of breathing and minute ventilation (Lofaso et al., 1995). Conclusions Although use of BiPAP in the pediatric population continues to grow, there is a need for more prospective controlled trials to confirm the capabilities of the technique (Fortenberry et al., 1995). Research must focus on data to compare success rates, costs, and outcomes of BiPAP to standard therapies (Hill, 1997). Additionally, more reports of the types and acuity of conditions, and location of use would enhance knowledge regarding BiPAP. There is a need for more controlled randomized studies to determine the ability of BiPAP to slow worsening lung function and manage acute exacerbations (Padman, Lawless, et al., 1994). Indeed, a most challenging task is to distinguish those situations in which BiPAP may be superior to traditional therapy (Teague, 1997).

d6cae4d7-8b68-4360-a421-78f9b1c11ca1,"» Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) also known as, adult respiratory distress syndrome (previously non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema) is a syndrome of acute respiratory failure characterized by bilateral diffuse alveolar infiltrates on chest radiography and resulting hypoxemia. ARDS begins with an injury that results in an inflammatory cascade with resulting vascular permeability and pulmonary edema. Loss of aerated lung tissue subsequently leads to hypoxemia and ventilation-perfusion abnormalities. All these factors contribute to decreased lung compliance. Uncontrolled ARDS can progress to an irreversible fibro-proliferative phase characterized by fibrosis of the lung parenchyma. II. Diagnostic Confirmation: Are you sure your patient has acute respiratory distress syndrome? ARDS is diagnosed when there is an acute onset of bilateral infiltrates on chest radiography, a normal pulmonary artery wedge pressure and absence of clinical evidence of left atrial hypertension, along with presence of impaired gas exchange with a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of = 300. This disease usually starts with symptoms beginning within one week of an injury or insult to the body and can only be declared as ARDS if cardiogenic pulmonary edema, fluid overload, and any other cause of the acute respiratory failure can be excluded. ARDS can be divided into mild (PaO2/FiO2 is >200 mmHg, but =300 mmHg), moderate (PaO2/FiO2 is >100 mmHg, but =200 mmHg) and severe (PaO2/FiO2 is =100 mmHg) on ventilators setting that include PEEP = 5cm H2O. Symptoms of ARDS usually present within hours to days of a clinical insult. The majority of patients who develop ARDS are already being managed for a probable cause that could either be a life threatening infection or trauma. However, the differential is quite extensive with drug reaction, transfusion reaction, and fume inhalation injury representing just a few of the causes. In general, common complaints include shortness of breath or difficulty breathing, rapid breathing, difficulty in catching breath leading to inability to complete sentences, palpitations due to tachycardia, cough, and chest pain. Additionally, as a result of decreased perfusion the patient may develop confusion, altered level of consciousness, profuse sweating, and fatigability. The onset and duration of symptoms generally varies depending on the predisposing factors; for example, in cases of transfusion symptoms appear around 6-8 hours after the completion of the transfusion. Detailed history should be taken to identify septic conditions specifically with a presentation of fever, abdominal pain or any focus of infection. Exposure to blood products or any drug overdose has to be investigated. Patients should also be asked about the content, quantity and duration of exposure to toxic fumes, smoke and alcohol. In the United States, around 190,000 cases of ARDS are diagnosed per year. ARDS has a number of predisposing factors including: cigarette smoking, tuberculosis, radiation exposure, chronic alcohol abuse, stroke patients with impaired gag reflex, near drowning patients, and obesity. It has been shown to be more common in people who smoke or live near factories/industries or in highly polluted and congested cities, and in people living at high altitudes. African-Americans are known to have lower chances of getting the disease than Hispanics and Caucasians. Advancing age and female sex also seem to enhance the risk of ARDS, particularly after an inciting event. Genetic association has also been identified which may contribute to ARDS. There are a number of risk factors contributing to ARDS. Sepsis and pneumonia are by far the most common causes. Other important risk factors include drug abuse, aspiration, and severe trauma (especially bilateral lung contusions). Lung transplantation, blood and fluid transfusions have also been well described as causes of ARDS. Drugs that have been implicated as a cause include: aspirin, opioids, cocaine, phenothiazines, tricyclic antidepressants, amiodarone, nitrofurantoin, protamine, and other chemotherapeutic agents. Less common causes include pancreatitis, cardiopulmonary bypass surgery, disseminated intravascular coagulation, head injury, near drowning, toxic gas exposure, chemical exposure including chlorine and ammonia, and tick-born relapsing fever. Some of the details discussed earlier are being reviewed again to formulate a pattern of history to be inquired during the evaluation of the patient with ARDS. We should ask if patient suffered from a physical trauma including near drowning or any kind of toxic inhalation. It is important to inquire if the patient has a previous history of recurrent aspiration or stroke. We should also ask questions related to history of cancer or recent chemotherapeutic exposure. Question regarding any blood products exposure is necessary. Any hospital admission following infections or septic injury has to be excluded. Inquiring about any major surgeries including cardiothoracic or abdominal are imperative. C. History Part 3: Competing diagnoses that can mimic acute respiratory distress syndrome. Several pulmonary conditions can mimic ARDS and can be difficult to differentiate Illnesses that resemble ARDS include: Cardiogenic pulmonary edema (evidence of cardiac distress such as myocardial infarction and impaired ejection fraction) Diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (confirmed by the detection of hemosiderin-laden macrophages on bronchoalveolar lavage) Idiopathic acute eosinophilic pneumonia (unusually high number of eosinophils in the BAL) Cryptogenic organizing pneumonia (CT scan and surgical lung biopsy needed for diagnosis) Acute interstitial pneumonia (with no known underlying etiology) Goodpasture’s syndrome (pulmonary hemorrhage with progressive glomerulonephritis) Malignancy (acute leukemia or lymphoma or lymphangitic spread of solid tumors) Post-obstructive pulmonary edema (often happens after removal of an upper airway obstruction). Physical exam findings include dyspnea, cyanosis and bilateral rales on auscultation. Respiratory distress is usually appreciable. Other important physical exam findings include tachypnea, tachycardia and use of accessory muscles of respiration. Cough and chest tenderness have also been described. Signs of the underlying cause will also be present such as fever due to infection, or confusion from delirium or drug overdose. Cardiogenic pulmonary edema is differentiated by S3 and elevated neck veins on physical examination. Chronic Interstitial lung disease usually presents with a prolonged illness, diffuse Velcro rales, and digital clubbing. Patients suffering from idiopathic acute eosinophilic pneumonia have an acute febrile illness with non-productive cough and dyspnea in most cases. Malignancies can present with symptoms of night sweats, significant weight loss, and malaise. If a patient has frank hemoptysis, hematuria, pale skin and shortness of breath, Goodpasture’s disease has to be considered. 1. What laboratory studies (if any) should be ordered to help establish the diagnosis? How should the results be interpreted? A number of diagnostic, laboratory, and imaging tests may be done to diagnose ARDS. These include sputum culture (to identify underlying infection), Arterial blood gas, complete blood count (CBC – anemia can be revealed in settings of trauma or hemolysis), and blood culture B-type natriuretic peptide (less than 100pg/ml in a patient with bilateral infiltrates and dyspnea is highly indicative of ARDS). An echocardiogram can accompany this test to rule out cardiac disease with more confidence. 2. What imaging studies (if any) should be ordered to help establish the diagnosis? How should the results be interpreted? Chest X-ray (bilateral pulmonary infiltrates which start as patchy and asymmetrical, diffuse whiteout appearances, and show areas of consolidation in the lung. Chest computed tomography (CT) scan could help, whether done without contrast, or with contrast (to rule out pulmonary embolism as the cause of dyspnea). BAL can also be useful in the diagnosis such as in cases of infection, alveolar- hemorrhage or interstitial pneumonia. Lung biopsy is reserved for selected patients that have an undiagnosed underlying diagnosis even after performing the above procedures. F. Over-utilized or “wasted” diagnostic tests associated with this diagnosis. Pulmonary artery catheterization is also unnecessary in several cases. Most current therapies for ARDS falls into two categories; supportive therapies (including mechanical ventilation), and those measures done to recruit alveoli. ARDS patients can be severely hypoxemic and most of them eventually require intubation and mechanical ventilator support. Low tidal volume approach (4-6mL/kg) should be always used due to mortality benefit when compared to larger tidal volume ventilation (12mL/kg of ideal body weight). It is important to recognize that high positive end expiratory pressure can be damaging, thus should be monitored and kept less than 30 cm of water. Patient overall fluid balance should be carefully obtained. A daily goal of net fluid even or slightly negative should be attempted. Since infections are the most common cause of ARDS, a combination of antimicrobials is generally started and then tapered based on results of cultures and sensitivities. Other care measures must be followed for all intubated patients which include sedation and intermittent sedation withdrawal, oral hygiene, eye care, aspiration precautions, frequent suctioning, head of the bed elevation, pain management, nutritional support, blood glucose control, gastrointestinal (GI) prophylaxis, blood transfusions, preventing nosocomial infections, sequential compression devices and chemical prophylaxis to prevent deep venous thrombosis. Measures to recruit none affected, typically less effective, parts of the lungs such as the basis were studied, prone positioning found to significantly decreased mortality, and thus should be used when possible. Patients may present to the hospital in a very critical condition due to severe ARDS. The primary goal for these patients is to improve oxygenation. Stabilization of vital signs is an important first step. The most important step is to provide supplemental oxygenation preferably through noninvasive ventilation tactics. It can be administered through a Venti, or 100% non-rebreather mask to maintain PaO2 above 60 mmHg. If patient is not improving, immediate assistance must be provided for noninvasive ventilation or endotracheal tube mechanical ventilation. ARDS patients tend to suffer from systemic failure. It is necessary to maintain adequate fluid resuscitation and mean arterial pressures for organ perfusion. Oxygen saturation monitoring and urine output charting has to be done cautiously. Antibiotics in ARDS patients are often started empirically to prevent deterioration of the condition. Once the patient’s vital signs are normalized, the focus should be towards identifying the cause of ARDS and treating accordingly. Periodic evaluations should be performed to document improvement or worsening of patient’s condition. On a physical exam, physician should observe breathing pattern, extremities for pallor, and patient’s heart rate and blood pressure and the ventilation details. Additional breath sounds (wheeze, rhonchi, and crepitations) can help guide the treatment. Fever can give clues to underlying infection. Care must be taken to prevent secondary infections from endotracheal intubation, urinary catheters and dependent skin areas. Sudden pallor, expected bleeding or bruising and hemodynamic instability must be monitored to help in identifying coagulation problems and preventing the patient from declining to disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Patients with ARDS are likely to undergo systemic complications including hematologic, renal, liver, and gastrointestinal. Hemodynamic stability, oxygenation, and acid–base monitoring is vital to guide management strategies. C. Laboratory Tests to Monitor Response To, and Adjustments in, Management. Initially arterial blood gas analysis should be performed daily. This can be discontinued once the patient has been weaned off mechanical ventilation or if stable on mechanical ventilation. CBC and chemistry panel should be performed daily. Fluid electrolyte and serum creatinine levels should be checked daily to make sure systemic function is normal. Blood culture can be done after antibiotic therapy is initiated. Daily chest films are important for patients on mechanical support. All these tests can guide a physician about improvement or worsening of patient’s condition. No long-term monitoring is needed in patients who survive ARDS. In case of continued SOB, during rehabilitation phase, physical activity must be restricted for some time. Strict aspiration precautions should be taken. Pulmonary function tests can be periodically checked. Corticosteroids may be given for prolonged periods in certain cases. Beta agonists can be prescribed to improve shortness of breath. Long-term fluid management is very important. Thus, regular visits to the primary physician for check-ups are important. E. Common Pitfalls and Side-Effects of Management. Most commonly, pitfalls during treatment of ARDS are ventilator based issues. These include ventilator associated lung injury and barotrauma. Barotrauma refers to alveolar rupture due to excessively high pressure exposure that can lead to pneumothorax, subcutaneous emphysema, and loss of aerated tissue, ventilator associated infections and barotrauma. Mechanical ventilation has also been known to be associated with GI bleeding due to stress ulcers and increased intracranial pressure. ARDS induced alveolar damage can lead to loss of oxygen transfusion surface, loss of surfactant production leading to collapse, and pulmonary hypertension over a period of time. Side effects of fluid reduction management during ARDS include organ hypoperfusion, reduced renal clearance, and dehydration. Fluid levels should be monitored carefully. Long term uses of corticosteroids and antibiotics have side effects of their own. Misuse of antibiotics can lead to the rise of resistant strains with increased morbidity. Clostridium difficile colitis is a well-known complication of antibiotic use. Prolonged hospital stay (associated with nosocomial infections), lack of movement during sedation/paralysis (can slow blood flow leading to an increased chance of deep vein thrombosis), and increased gastric pH (associated with stress ulcers) can all lead to several different complications. In patients with renal insufficiency and ARDS, a severely negative fluid balance leads to renal failure. A minor complication of mechanical ventilation is slight respiratory acidosis that becomes important in patients with renal failure or concomitant metabolic acidosis. Dialysis or hemofiltration may be considered in some patients who have acute renal failure to achieve the goal of negative fluid balance. Liver failure can be an initiating event in ARDS, or can ensue as part of multiorgan damage consecutively. There will be no change in standard management, although ventilator settings should be closely adjusted as high PEEP could lead to detrimental outcomes in patients with severe CHF. D. Coronary Artery Disease or Peripheral Vascular Disease. Some fast spreading cancers and tumors such as leukemia and lymphomas may mimic the symptoms of ARDS, and have been shown to be an underlying cause of ARDS. The treatment in this scenario will be to provide the same respiratory symptomatic support while trying to cure the concomitant cancer. A number of cancer drugs have also been implicated in causing respiratory distress, mainly: cytarabine, recombinant IL-2, gemcitabine, vinblastine, mitomycin, methotrexate, dacarbazine, and granulocyte colony stimulating factor. Stopping the implicated drug is also recommended in these cases. G. Immunosuppression (HIV, chronic steroids, etc.). Patients with GI disease such as ulcers or acid reflux or nutritional deficiencies will need to be managed differently. Corticosteroids should not be used as they will aggravate the underlying ulcer. A nutrition consult should be obtained especially when patients with ARDS are intubated. A number of issues have to be watched for patients of ARDS on mechanical ventilation. It is imperative to give a detailed description regarding the primary etiology that led to ARDS in a particular patient. Blood gases and electrolytes are to be monitored routinely as they help prevent from sudden circulatory collapse and unexpected changes in the ventilation. Equipment failure and displacement of tube must be considered in case of respiratory failure. Obstruction by secretions, blood, kinking of the tube or a foreign body must also be considered as the possibilities. Positive pressure ventilation for more than 48 hours is a risk factor for GI bleeding so it should be discussed. Positive pressure ventilation (PPV) increases intracranial pressure and can also lead to spontaneous pneumothorax and Barotrauma. High PEEP may impair cardiac output leading to hypotension therefore the staff must be briefed before signing out. Patients with ARDS usually require a patient to spend around 3-4 weeks in the hospital with 2-3 weeks in ICU care. This may vary based on the severity of symptoms. Patients with ADS can either be discharged to their home or to rehabilitation center. A patient with ARDS will be ready for discharge when his or her oxygen saturation level has improved without ventilator support and appears stable to be sent home. The underlying cause (e.g., sepsis, trauma, infection, drug overdose, etc.) must also be cured to prevent a recurrence following discharge. If a patient does not improve and ends up needing tracheostomy and peg tube placement, he or she should be transferred for rehabilitation in nursing home. Patients with stable ventilatory support should also be discharged to rehabilitation centers. 1. When should clinic follow up be arranged and with whom. Patients should be advised to return for a follow-up visit to the hospital about 5-7 days after discharge. Follow-up visits and scheduling must be discussed with a responsible family member as well as the patient. Survivors should be advised to visit the pulmonologist at 3 to 6 months after discharge. 2. What tests should be conducted prior to discharge to enable best clinic first visit. CBC, arterial blood gas, serum electrolyte and creatinine levels should all be done before the patient is discharged to ensure improvement. Pulse oximetry should be done the day a patient is discharged. 3. What tests should be ordered as an outpatient prior to, or on the day of, the clinic visit. Fluid and electrolyte levels, CBC, and pulmonary function tests should be done prior to the initial visit. Spirometry and pulse oximetry can also be performed. Recovery of the patient’s post ARDS decides his or her transfer from the hospital to home or to the Rehabilitation department. Some patients might have milder symptoms and recover enough to go home directly after hospital discharge. Others stay on a prolonged period on mechanical support, requiring physical rehabilitation after weaning off of the ventilator. Deconditioned patients also need rehabilitation centers prior to going home. These patients can be sent to a skilled nursing facility, nursing home, or long-term acute care hospitals. Severely ill patients require LTAC facility as SNF would not suffice their need. Patients who recover from ARDS are likely to develop a number of complications post discharge namely physical disabilities, anxiety, depression, and neurocognitive impairment, pervasive memories of critical care and behavior disturbances for the care giver. Most patients who develop ARDS do not die from respiratory failure, but rather from complications of a prolonged stay in the intensive care unit such as nosocomial infections or multiple organ dysfunction. Mortality estimates 26-58 %. The long-term morbidity and mortality depends on a number of causes. Pre-existing organ dysfunction from chronic liver disease, chronic alcohol abuse, sepsis or immunosuppression has been linked to increased mortality from ARDS. Surgical and trauma patients have better chances of survival. Elderly patients are known to have worse outcomes. But overall, mortality has decreased with improvements in general care and ventilatory techniques. Patients with ARDS should be advised a few lifestyle changes. Physical activity should be restricted. Smoking, drugs and alcohol counseling should be given and their use must be discouraged. Exposure to toxic chemicals or fumes should be avoided. Healthy diet should be given as many people develop nutritional deficiencies after prolonged hospitalization and families should also be counseled to provide necessary support. Patient should be advised to strictly adhere to the treatment plan advised by the doctor. B. Appropriate Prophylaxis and Other Measures to Prevent Readmission. During hospitalization, prophylactic measures should be taken to avoid stress ulcers and pressure sores which can be achieved by using H2 blockers or Proton Pump Inhibitors and frequent change of position of the patient respectively. Nutritional consult is imperative to restabilize the nutritional imbalances. Deep venous thrombosis, an important adverse effect of lengthy stay in bed has to be prevented by heparin, lovenox, and/or sequential compression device. Care must be taken to protect from ventilator associated injury and to avoid nosocomial infections by maintaining adequate oral hygiene and removal of urinary catheter as soon as it is not required. On discharge the patient is advised to avoid exposure to toxic fumes and chemical agents strictly. Physiotherapy is an essential tool for prophylaxis. Influenza and pneumococcal vaccines should also be given before discharge.

Nevertheless, in the hospital setting it is not that simple to accomplish frequent prone positioning as it needs manpower, yet given mortality benefit this needs to be considered in every ARDS patient.

be9feb58-e954-4104-866a-22c602ff8a27,"Provides a mechanism for transporting oxygen from the air into the blood and for removing carbon dioxide from the blood.Oxygen is essential for cell metabolism.Carbon dioxide is a waste material resulting from cell metabolism and it influences the acid-base balance in body fluids Air first enters the nasal passages passing over the conchae or turbinates where its warmed and moistened. Foreign materials are filtered out but the mucous secretions and hairs. Opening off the nasal cavity are small canals in the skull bones called paranasal sinuses. The presence of these hollow sinus' reduce the weight of facial bones and adds resonance to the voice (frontal, ethmoid, sphenoid and maxillary)Respiratory mucosa consists of pseudo stratified ciliated columnar epithelium which trap foreign particles and sweet the mucous and debris up and out of the respiratory tract.Air flows through the nasopharynx and larynx into the trachea. Opening off the nasopharynx are the 2 eustachian tubes which connect to he middle ear cavity.The pharynx is where the nasopharynx and oropharynx join and is the point of separation of the esophagus and tracheaWhen air is expired through the larynx the true vocal cords vibrate and produce a sound of the voice. At the lower end of the trachea, inhaled air goes into the right and left primary bronchus. The right bronchus is larger and straighter and therefor is more likely the destination for any aspirated material.Hilium - where the bronchus enters the lung.Major or primary bronchus then branches into many smaller bronchi then into bronchiolesAir in the bronchioles then flows into the alveolar ducts and alveoli which resemble a cluster or grapes. they are formed by a single layer of simple squamous epithelium which promotes the diffusion of gas into the blood which is the endpoint for inspired air.Surfactant is the substance that coats the inside of the alveoli and is used to reduce surface tension, facilitate inspiration and prevent total collapse of the alveoli during expiration. The lungs are cone shaped structures positioned on either side of the heart. The mediastinum is the region in the centre of the chest which contains the heart, the major blood vessels, the esophagus and the trachea.Right lung has 3 lobes, left lung has 2 lobesEach lung is covered by its own double walled sac called the pleural membrane. The visceral pleura is the outside and then doubles back and forms the inside parietal pleura. The pleural fluid provides lubrication during respiratory movements. Consists of ribs, vertebrae, sternum and provides a rigid protective wall for the lungs. First 7 ribs are true ribs and last 3 are considered false ribs and are connected to the 7th rib. the last 2 ribs are called floating ribs. Between the ribs are the intercostal muscles which move the thoracic structures during ventilation Air always moves from high pressure to an area of low pressure.As the size of the thoracic cavity decreases the pressure inside the cavity increases (boyles law) Measures of ventilatory capacity in that they measure air moving in and our of the lungs with normal or forced inspiration and expiration. These volumes will change with disease process and are helpful in monitoring a patients progress or response to treatment. Is the volume of air remaining in the lungs after maximal expiration. This air continues to provide gas exchange and maintains partial inflation of the lungs.1200ml. Represents the maximal amount of air that cane moved in and out of the lungs. It can be altered by lung disease, size of the thorax, amount of blood in the lungs or body position4600ml Referes to passageway or areas where gas exchange cannot take place is then the first space that is filled by newly inspired air Amount of air entering the lungs with each normal breath500ml Maximal amount of air that can be inhaled in excess of normal quiet inspiration3000ml Maximal volume of air expired following a passive expiration1100ml Total volume of air in the lungs after maximal inspiration5800ml Primary control centres are located in the medulla and the pons.Inspiratory centre in the medulla controls the basic rhythm by stimulating the phrenic nerves to the diapgrahm and the intercostal nerves to the external costal muscles.The rate and depth of breathing set by the medulla can be modified by a number of factors: depression of the CNS (drugs), activity of the hypothalamus which prevents excessive lung expansion.Chemical factors are the most important in respiratory control. Chemoreceptors sense changes in the levels of carbon dioxide, hydrogen ions and oxygen in then blood or cerebrospinal fluid. when fluid accumulates in the alveoli or interstitial tissue diffusion (particularly of oxygen) is greatly impaired.An auto regulatory mechanism in the lungs can adjust ventilation and blood flow in an attempt to produce a good match(ex. if Po2 is low because of poor ventilation in an area vasoconstriction occurs in the pulmonary arterioles shunting blood to other areas of the lungs where ventilation may be better. If airflow is good the pulmonary arterioles dilate to maximize gas exchange. Only about 1% of oxygen is dissolved in plasma because oxygen is relatively insoluble in water.The dissolved form of gas is that which diffuses from the alveolar air int the blood in the pulmonary capillary and also diffuses into the interstitial fluid and the cells during the process of internal respiration.Most oxygen is transported reversible bound to hemoglobin by the iron molecules called oxyhemoglobin. When all 4 heme molecules in hemoglobin have taken up oxygen the hemoglobin is termed fully saturated. Spirometry-pulmonary function testing is used to test pulmonary volumes measuring volumes and airflow times.Arterial blood gas determinations are used to check oxygen, carbon dioxide and bicarbonate levels as well as serum pHOximetry measures o2 saturationExercise tolerance testing is useful in patients with chronic pulmonary disease for diagnosis and monitoring of the patients progressRadiography may be helpful in evaluating tumors or infections such as pneumonia or TBBronchoscopy may be used in performing a biopsy or in checking for the site of a lesion or bleedingCulture and sensitivity tests on exudates from the upper respiratory tract or sputum specimens can identify pathogens and assist in determining appropriate therapy. Sneezing - a reflex response to irritation in the upper respiratory tract and assists in removing the irritant, It is associated with inflammation or foreign material in the nasal passagesCoughing - may result from irritation cause by a nasal discharge dripping int o the oropharynx or from inflammation or foreign material in the lower respiratory tract or from inhaled irritants such as tobacco smoke. Cough reflex is controlled by a centre in the medulla and consists of coordinated actions that inspire air and then close the glottis and vocal cords.Sputum or mucoid discharge from the respiratory tract may have significant characteristics depending on the abnormality causing it. Normal secretions are relatively clear, thin and colourless or cream colour.-yellow-green cloudy and thick mucous are often indicative of a bacterial infection-rusty or dark coloured sputum is usually a sign of pneumococcal pneumonia-very large amounts of purulent sputum with foul odour may be associated with bronchiectasis-thick, tenacious mucus may occur in patients with asthma or cystic fibrosis. Blood tinged secretions may result from a chronic cough and irritation that causes rupture of superficial capillaries, may also be a sign of TB or tumor.-hemoptysis is blood tinged frothy sputum that is usually assoc with pulmonary edema.Breathing patterns may be altered with respiratory disease-eupnea is a normal rate of breathing-Kussamaul respiration are deep rapid resp. typical for acidosis or may follow strenuous exercise-laboured resp. or prolonged inspiration or expiration times are often associated with obstruction of airways-wheezing or whistling sounds indicate an obstruction in the small airways-stridor is a high pitched crowing noise that is usually indicative of an upper airway obstruction.Breath Sounds - rhonchi and rales are abnormal sounds resulting from air mixing with excessive secretions in the lungs-rales are light bubbly or crackling sounds assoc. with serous secretions-rhonchi are deeper or harsher sounds from thicker mucous-absence of breath sounds indicated non aeration or collapse of the lungs (atelectasis)Dyspnea is a subjective feeling of discomfort that occurs when a person feels unable to inhale enough air. May be manifested with breathlessness or sob either with exertion or at rest.-severe dyspnea may be accompanied by flaring of the nostrils, use of accessory respiratory muscles or retracting of the muscles between or above the ribs.-orthopnea is dyspnea that occurs when the person is lying down. Pulmonary congestion develops as more blood pools in the lungs when the person lies down and also as the abdominal contents push upwards against the lungs. Raising the upper part of the body with pillows often facilitates breathing in persons with respiratory or cardiovascular disorders-paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea is a sudden acute type of dyspnea common in patients with left sided heart failure. During sleep body fluid is redistributed leading to pulmonary edema and the individual wakes up gasping for air and coughing.Cyanosis is the bluish colouring of the skin and mucous membranes caused by large amounts of unoxygenated hemoglobin in bloodPleural pain results from inflammation or infection of the parietal pleura. It is a cyclic pain that increases as the inflamed membrane is stretched with inspiration or coughingFriction Rub may be heart, a soft sound produced as rough, inflammated or scarred pleural move against each otherClubbed digits results from chronic hypoxia assoc. with respiratory or cardiovascular disease characterized by painless, firm, fibrotic enlargement at the end of the digit.Changes in arterial blood gasses-hypoxemia is inadequate oxygen in blood-hypercapnea is increased carbon dioxide in bloodSevere dyspnea indicative of respiratory distress - flaring of nostrils, use of accessory muscles and retraction of muscle between or above the ribsOrthopnea - occurs when lying down, usually caused by pulmonary congestion Decongestants - vasoconstrictor the nasal mucosa and reduce edemaExpectorants - thin respiratory secretions for easier removalAntitussives - reduce the cough reflexAntihistamines - block the H1 receptors to reduce allergic responseAnalgesics - reduces painAntimicrobials - prophylaxis and treatment of infection (sputum culture and sensitivity)Bronchodilators - stimulate beta 2 adrenergic receptors to open bronchiolesGlucocorticoids - anti-inflammatory and antiallergenic -avoid inhaling irritants and maintain good ventilation-current immunizations-humidify air-moderate exercise-breathing and coughing-chest physiotherapy-oxygen-thoracentesis (remove excess fluid from the pleural cavity to prevent atelectasis)-tracheotomy (incision into the trachea below the larynx to permit air intake) -Caused by a viral infection of the upper respiratory tract. Most common pathogen is rhinovirus but there are more than 200 possible causative agents making it difficult for an individual to develop sufficient immunity to avoid all colds-spread through respiratory droplets which are either directly inhaled or spread by secretions on hands or contaminated objects such as tissues.-highly contagious because the virus is shed in large numbers from the infected nasal mucosa during the first few days of the infection and can survive several hours outside the body.-signs of a cold are nasal congestion and copious watery discharge, mouth breathing and voice tone changes, sore throat, headache, fever, malaise, couch.-treatment is symptomatic -secondary bacterial infections may occur (sinusitis, otitis media, tracheaitis) and will require antibiotic treatment. Usually caused by streptococcus invading inflamed and necrotic mucous membranes. A purulent exudate forms and systemic signs such as fever develops. Usually a bacterial infection secondary to a cold or allergy that has obstructed the drainage of the paranasal sinuses into the nasal cavity. Common causative organisms are pneumococci, streptococci, and hemophillus influenza .As exudate accumulates pressure builds up in the sinus cavity causing pain in the facial bones (confused with headache or toothache).Decongestants and analgesics are recommended until the sinus are draining well and a course of antibiotics often necessary to eradicate the infection totally.Analgesics for headache and pain Common viral infections particularly found in children.Causative organism includes parainfluenza and adenovirus. Infection usually begins as URI with nasal congestion and cough . the larynx and subglottic area become inflamed with swelling and exudate leading to obstruction and a barking croupy cough, hoarse voice and inspiratory stridor.Cool moistured air from the humidifier or shower or croup tent often relieves the obstruction.Infection is usually self limiting and full recovery occurs in 3 days. An acute infection usually caused by bacterial organism Haemophilus influenza type b. common in children aged 3-7 years.infection causes swelling of the larynx, supraglottic area and epiglottis.onset is rapid, fever and sore throat develop and the child refuses to swallow.Drooling of saliva is present, child will sit in the tripod position, inspiratory stridor. Child will appear anxious and pale and struggles to breath.Swelling of the larynx, supraglottic area and epiglottis may obstruct airway and spasms of larynx is common if the area is touched with an instrumentTreatment consists of oxygen and antimicrobial therapy with intubation if necessary. Viral infection that affects both the upper and lower respiratory tractsType A (most prevalent) Type B, Type C. These viruses mutate constantly preventing effective immune defences for prolonged time periods.Differs from common cold d/t the acute, sudden onset with fever, marked fatigue and aching body pains. May also cause viral pneumonia. Mild case of influenza may be complicated by secondary bacterial pneumonia commonly deaths in flu epidemics result from pneumoniaTreatment is symptomatic and supportive unless bacterial infection occurs. Antiviral drugs if taken in the first 2 days may reduce symptoms and duration.Incubation period is 1-4 days.Prevention - respiratory hygiene and vaccinations are recommended Caused by Group A b-hemolytic streptococcus. Incubation period usually 1-2 daysSymptoms usually begin with sore throat, fever, chills, vomitting, abdominal pain and malaise occur as well. STRAWBERRY tongue is caused by the exotoxin produced by the bacteria. A fine rash on the chest, neck, groin and thighs are often characteristic.Treated usually with antibiotics. Common infection is children aged 2-12 months and is caused by the respiratory syncytial virus.Transmitted directly by oral droplet and occurs more often in winter months.Predisposing factors: familial history of asthma or exposure to cigarette smokeVirus causes necrosis and inflammation in the small bronchi, bronchioles with edema, increased secretions and reflex bronchospasm leading to obstruction of small airways.Signs: wheezing with dyspnea, rapid shallow respirations, cough, rales, chest retractions, fever, malaiseTreatment: supportive and symptomatic with monitoring of blood gases in severe cases. RSV-immunoglobulin serum is a monoclonal antibody that may be administered to reduce the severity of infections (esp in premature infants) May develop as a primary acute infection in the lungs or may be secondary to another respiratory of systemic infection int which tissue resistance is reduced.A risk following any aspiration of inflammation in the lungs when fluid pools of defence mechanisms such as cilia are reduced.Most cases the organisms enter the lungs directly by direct inhalation, resident bacteria spreading along the mucous or aspiration of secretions. Occasionally infection is blood born. Causative agent: viral, bacterial, fungalAnatomical location of infection: throughout the both lungs or consolidated in one lobePathophysiological Changes: changes in interstitial tissue, alveolar septae, alveoliEpidemiological data: nosocomial (hospital acquired) community acquired (occurs within 48 hours) Usually bacterial (caused by streptococcus pneumonia)Community based often in healthy young adultsInfection is localized in one or more lobes: inflammation and vascular congestion d/t exudate forming in the alveoli. Exudate contains fibrin and forms consolidated mass which produces a rusty sputum.Adjacent pleurae frequently involved.Infection may spread to pleural cavity - empyemaManifestations: sudden onset, systemic signs include high fever with chills, fatigue and leukocytosis, dyspnea, tachypnea, tachycardia, pleural pain, rales, productive cough (rust coloured sputum) confusion and disorientationTreatment - involves administration of antibacterial mediations such as penicillin in combination with supporting measures such a fluids, drugs to reduce fever and oxygen.Pneumococcal vaccine recommended for elderly and those at risk ( one time vaccine) Occurs as a diffuse pattern of infection in both lungs most often in the lower lobes.Several species can be the cause of the infection beginning in the bronchial mucosa and spreading into the local alveoli.Pooled secretions in the lungs become infected by organisms draining from the upper passages. the inflammatory exudate forms in the alveoli interfering with oxygen diffusion.Onset tends to be insidious with moderate fever, cough and rales. congestion causes productive cough with purulent sputum usually yellow or green.Sputum culture and sensitivity test indicates the appropriate antibacterial treatment. Caused by gram negative bacteria legionella pneumophilia which thrive in warm moist environments.Microbe is difficult to identify because the organism is found inside pulmonary macrophages and requires a special culture medium.If untreated the infection cases severe congestion and consolidation with necrosis in the lungs and becomes possibly fatal Differs in both causative organism (often viral or mycoplasma)Bacterial**Mycoplasma pneumonia is a small bacterium that lacks a cell wall and is normally found in the upper respiratory tract.Viral**caused by influenza A B adenoviruses or RSVCommon in older children and young adults. It is transmitted by aerosolCharacterized by frequent unproductive cough, hoarseness, sore throat, mild fever, malaise.Infection is usually self limiting and varies greatly in severity. PAP is a type of atypical pneumonia that occurs as an opportunistic and often fatal and those suffering from AIDS. Also causes pneumonia in premature infants.Microbe is inhaled and attaches to the alveolar cells causing necrosis and diffuse interstitial inflammation Disease of poverty and crowding, immunodeficiency, malnutrition, alcoholism, conditions of war, chronic disease, HIV Infection.Infection is caused by mycobacterium tuberculosis which is an acid fast aerobic slow growing bacillus. it primarily infects the lungs but may invade other organs. It is transmitted by droplets from person with active infection and can survive in dried sputum for weeks.Is destroyed by UV light, heat, alcohol, glutaraldehyde, formaldehyde. The normal neutrophil response does not occurPrimary infection: when the organism first enters the lungs it is engulfed by microphages which causes local inflammation. if the cell mediated immunity is inadequate the mycobacteria reproduce and begin to destroy lung tissue. **If cell mediated immunity is adequate: bacilli migrate to lymph nodes creating a granuloma, formation of tubercle, walled off and calcifying. Tubercle may be visible on x-ray, develops a latent infection meaning the individual has been infected and exposed but does not have the disease and is asymptomatic meaning they cannot transmit the disease.Secondary or re-infection with TB - occurs when clients cell mediated immunity is impaired d/t: stress, malnutrition, HIV Infection, age. The mycobacteria begin to reproduce and infect the lung, this is Active tb and can be spread to others.Military or extra pulmonary TB - rapidly progressive form more common in children <5 years old. results in early dissemination of other tissues,if lesions are not found in the lungs its not contagious, common symptoms include: weight loss, failure to thrive or measles.Active TB (primary or secondary) when the organism is multiplying forming large areas of necrosis also known as cavitation. Cavitation promotes spread into other parts of the lungs. Cough, positive sputum and radiograph will show cavitation. Disease in this form is highly infective when there is close personal contact over a period of time.Diagnostic tests - first exposure - indicative by positive tb skin testActive infection - acid fast sputum test, chest x-ray, sputum culture and sensitivityTreatment - long term treatment with a combination of drugs, length of treatment varies from 6-12 months. requires monitoring and treatment is very expensive. A fungal infection common in the midwestern united states where the fungi histoplasma casulatum and its spores can be inhaled on dust particles.A common opportunistic infection and common in those with AIDS.First stage is often asymptomatic that may be followed by second active stage.Second stages involves granuloma formation and necrosis and consolidation in the lungs as well as possible spread to other organs.Signs include cough, marked fatigue, fever, night sweats.Skin test can determine histoplasmosis from TV and the culture can be taken to confirm diagnosis.Treatment- anti fungal agent amphotericin B An inherited genetic disorder (gene located on chromosome 7) The defect in the exocrine gland causes abnormally thick secretions (tenacious mucous)Primary effects are seen in the lungs and pancreas where the sticky mucous obstructs the passages.In the lungs: the mucous obstructs airflow in the bronchioles and small bronchi causing air trapping (atelectasis) with permanent damage occurring in the bronchial walls.the stagnant mucous is a excellent medium for growth of bacteria and infections are common and add to the progression of the disease.Common infections that occur are: pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococcus aureus.Digestive tract - first indication of abnormality in a newborn may be in the meconium ilius. occurs in the small intestine and is blocked by mucous preventing the excretion of meconium shortly after birth.Pancreas - the ducts become blocked leading to deficit in pancreatic enzymes in the intestine leading to malabsorption and malnutrition. The blockage could lead to backup of secretions eventually causing damage to the tissue (islets of langerhans) resulting in DMLiver - bile ducts of the liver may be blocked by vicious mucous preventing bile from reaching the duodenum and interfering with digestion. if obstruction is severe may cause liver damage.Salivary Gland - often mildly affected and secretions have high NaCl and mucus plugs that cause patchy fibrosis of the submaxillary and sublingual glands.Sweat glands - produce sweat that is very high is NaCl content. usually not serious unless excessive sweating occurs and results in an electrolyte imbalance.Reproductive Tract - causes an obstruction of thick mucous in the vas deferens of males or the cervix of females. -Meconium ileus may occur at birth Salty Skin - may lead to sweat testSigns of Malabsorption - steatorrhea (fatty bulky stools) abdominal distension and failure to gain weight > these symptoms indicate a lack of pancreatic enzymes and bile needed to digest foods and amino acidsChronic Cough and Frequent Resp Infections - indicate pulmonary involvement in the child.

Chronic airflow obstruction or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is one of the obstructive lung diseases of poor airflow. Smoking is the main cause of airflow obstruction. The main symptoms of this disease include shortness of breath and cough. Treatment to that particular disease will slow worsening but there is no cure. In most cases we can prevent this disease by reducing exposure to risk factors such as decreasing the rate of smoking and improving the quality of indoor and outdoor air. There are some treatments to reduce the worsening of this disease include quitting smoking, vaccinations, respiratory rehabilitations and steroids.

In the most common sense of the word it is a type of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, The Lancet Respiratory Medicine, Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation, European Respiratory Journal, European Respiratory Review, Influenza and other Respiratory Viruses   Obstructive Lung Disease is a category of respiratory disease characterized by airway obstruction. Many obstructive diseases of the lung result from narrowing of the smaller bronchi and larger bronchioles, often because of excessive contraction of the smooth muscle itself. It is generally characterized by inflamed and easily collapsible airways, obstruction to airflow, problems exhaling and frequent medical clinic visits and hospitalizations. Types of obstructive lung disease include; asthma, bronchiectasis, bronchitis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Journal of Aerosol Medicine and Pulmonary Drug Delivery, COPD: Journal of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease, Journal of Breath Research, Clinics in Chest Medicine, Respiration: international review of thoracic diseases, Seminars in Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine   Obstructive Respiratory Tract Disease is a medical term that encompasses pathological conditions affecting the organs and tissues that make gas exchange possible in higher organisms, and includes conditions of the upper respiratory tract, trachea, bronchi, bronchioles, alveoli, pleura and pleural cavity, and the nerves and muscles of breathing. Respiratory diseases range from mild and self-limiting, such as the common cold, to life-threatening entities like bacterial pneumonia, pulmonary embolism, acute asthma and lung cancer. Related Journals of Obstructive Respiratory Tract Disease Journal of Thoracic Imaging, Experimental Lung Research, Interactive Cardiovascular and Thoracic Surgery, Respiratory Investigation, Pulmonary Medicine, Clinical Respiratory Journal   Chronic Pulmonary Disease also known as chronic obstructive lung disease (COLD), and chronic obstructive airway disease (COAD), is a collection of diseases which make breathing gradually more difficult. Symptoms of COPD include difficulty breathing and cough, in particular coughing up lots of phlegm. It is usually caused by smoking cigarettes, and around half of people who smoke for their whole lives will develop COPD. Air pollution can be another cause, particularly in countries where indoor fires are used without ventilation.

It deals with chest medicine and respiratory medicine in some countries and areas. Pulmonology is considered a branch of internal medicine, and is related to intensive care medicine. Pulmonology often involves managing patients who need life support and mechanical ventilation. Pulmonologists are specially trained in diseases and conditions of the chest, particularly pneumonia, asthma, tuberculosis, emphysema, and complicated chest infections. Clinical Medicine Insights: Circulatory, Respiratory and Pulmonary Medicine, Clinical Pulmonary Medicine, Current Respiratory Medicine Reviews, Clinical Respiratory Journal, Pulmonary Medicine   Infliximab is used for treating the inflammation of Crohn's disease, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, ankylosing spondylitis, and psoriatic arthritis. Infliximab is an antibody administered intravenously that is used for treating several chronic inflammatory diseases. Infliximab works by blocking the effects of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha), a substance made by cells of the body which has an important role in promoting inflammation. Infliximab does not cure Crohn's disease, psoriatic arthritis, or rheumatoid arthritis. Infliximab can retard the destruction of joints by rheumatoid arthritis.

The clinical outcomes are reliant on the level of crumple of the lung on the influenced side. On the off chance that the pneumothorax is huge, it can cause a move of the mediastinum and bargain hemodynamic strength. A pneumothorax can be caused by a limit or entering trunk damage, certain medicinal strategies, or harm from basic lung ailment. Or, on the other hand it might happen for no conspicuous reason. Manifestations more often than exclude sudden trunk torment and shortness of breath. On a few events, a crumpled lung can be an existence debilitating occasion.

Pulmonary Edema may be a condition caused by excess fluid within the lungs. This fluid collects within the various air sacs within the lungs, creating it tough to breathe. This is usually caused by symptom heart disease. once the center isn't ready to pump with efficiency, blood will keep a copy into the veins that take blood through the lungs. As the pressure in these blood vessels will increase, fluid is pushed into the air areas (alveoli) within the lungs. This fluid reduces traditional element movement through the lungs. These 2 factors mix to cause shortness of breath. : Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine, Pulmonary Pharmacology and Therapeutics, Journal of Cardiopulmonary Rehabilitation and Prevention, Journal of Aerosol Medicine and Pulmonary Drug Delivery, COPD: Journal of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease Plasma Neutrophil Gelatinase- Associated Lipocalin (NGAL) in Combination with Procalcitonin (PCT) and MR-Proadrenomedullin (MR-proADM) in the Diagnosis and Prognosis of Sepsis and Sepsis Associated Acute Kidney Injury Neighborhood Influences on Seasonal Influenza Vaccination among Older African Americans in Atlanta, Georgia.

1da10b3b-662f-40c0-9a6b-f1967bca90c0,"» » Pediatric Respiratory Failure – Acute Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure – ARDS Clinical ARDS is characterized by hypoxemic respiratory failure that is refractory and life-threatening. Once thought to be primarily an adult condition, it is now recognized as a syndrome in all age groups. ARDS closely resembles, but should not be confused with Infant Respiratory Distress Syndrome, a condition due to surfactant deficiency in premature infants. Profound hypoxia is the hallmark and the severity at presentation is a predictor of mortality in children. It can be caused by direct injury to the lungs such as a pneumonic infection or inhalation injury, or indirectly from a systemic inflammatory condition such as septic shock or trauma. The most common trigger is infection, notably of the lower respiratory tract. Management is primarily supportive care, mechanical ventilation and treatment of the underlying cause. A low tidal volume ventilator strategy with pressure limited ventilation (6 ml/kg of predicted body weight, aiming for a plateau pressure of <30 cm of water) is the only ventilation strategy shown to improve outcomes to date. High PEEP, lung recruitment maneuvers and prone positioning have been shown to improve oxygenation but not long-term survival. High Frequency Ventilation (HFOV) can be safely employed when a patient is failing conventional ventilation but there is no data to show that it independently improves outcomes. Improvements in ventilator strategy, monitoring devices, fluid and nutritional support, sepsis management and nosocomial preventive measures may have contributed to the recent decline in the pediatric ARDS mortality rate which is now reported as low as 29%. ARDS is a rapidly progressive condition characterized by the acute onset of tachypnea, dyspnea, and hypoxia within 24 to 72 hours of an inciting event. The physical exam typically reveals tachycardia, tachypnea, cyanosis and diffuse rales. The condition rapidly progresses to profound hypoxemia with bilateral pulmonary infiltrates on CXR and almost invariably requires mechanical ventilation. Usually these patients reflect the clinical findings of the inciting illness such as septic shock or trauma. As a consequence, these children will have varying degrees of multi-organ dysfunction or failure including DIC, liver failure, and renal insufficiency. It is not uncommon to need continuous venovenous hemofiltration or dialysis. Patients with ARDS tend to progress through three distinct stages with different clinical, radiographic, and histopathological manifestations. The initial acute or exudative phase occurs during the first week and is characterized by a rapid onset of respiratory failure requiring aggressive mechanical ventilation. During this phase the patients are at risk for ventilator induced lung injury from high inspiratory pressures, high tidal volume, or oxygen toxicity. Ongoing alveolar damage combined with ventilatory pressures and tidal volumes can result in air leak into the chest and mediastinum. The subacute or proliferative phase usually begins after the first week of therapy and is manifested by persistent hypoxemia, progressive hypercarbia due to an increase in alveolar dead space, and further decrease in pulmonary compliance with progression of lung restriction. Secretions become problematic, and air leak and ventilator associated pneumonia are potential complications. The recovery phase follows approximately 2 or more weeks out from onset of the illness and is characterized by the gradual resolution of hypoxemia and radiographic abnormalities, and improved lung compliance. Patients are at risk for complications of prolonged illness and bed rest such as musculoskeletal weakness, nosocomial infections, deep venous thrombosis, and decubitus injury. Gastrointestinal bleeding from stress ulcers also occurs in this phase. Management remains essentially supportive and is aimed at decreasing mortality and morbidity, hastening recovery, and optimizing long-term respiratory and cognitive function. Identification and treatment of the underlying cause is essential to optimize clinical outcome. Early antibiotic therapy is justified because sepsis is often the trigger. Infections should be treated with antibiotics guided by cultures and sensitivities. Removal of any identifiable source of infection is paramount. Prevention or early treatment of nosocomial infections is critical. A “fluid conservative” approach is recommended once the patient is adequately resuscitated and adequate nutrition through the use of enteral feeding is preferred. The prevention of gastrointestinal bleeding and venous thromboembolism is also important. Patients almost invariably require high levels of oxygen, intubation, and mechanical ventilation. Noninvasive ventilatory support can be tried in some instances but should be abandoned quickly for invasive support if there is no improvement. Central venous and arterial access is warranted early in patients at risk and is often times necessary to manage the underlying cause. Central venous and arterial monitoring can be used to monitor hemodynamics and optimize fluid and oxygen delivery. Ventilation management and adjunctive therapies should be directed at correcting hypoxia to minimize brain and other vital organ injury. A volume and pressure limited lung protective ventilator strategy should be used to minimize ventilator induced lung injury. The gold standard for assessment of adequate oxygen delivery and cardiac function remains the pulmonary artery catheter. However, as this technique is rarely utilized due to concerns of the risk/benefit ratio in children and reports in adults of no difference in outcome with care guided by its information, less invasive devices are more frequently applied. Venous saturation monitoring, near infrared spectroscopy and other devices to assess cardiac output and lung water are used in some patients. The impact of these on overall survival has yet to be confirmed. End-tidal CO2 monitoring and information from ventilator assessment of compliance such as pressure-volume loops can guide optimal management. It is important to wean FiO2 as soon as the patient allows. A volume and pressure limited “open-lung” ventilator strategy should be instituted with a tidal volume of 6 mL/kg of predicted body weight, PEEP determined by pressure-volume loops, and limitation of plateau pressures of < 30 cm of water. Ventilated patients will require sedation and some may require the intermittent use of paralytics to facilitate the initial ventilator management. Frequent assessments to minimize the use for paralytics are important to prevent prolonged mental status depression, persistent paralysis and prolonged muscle weakness. Newer modes of ventilator support may provide more patient synchrony and optimize spontaneous breathing. Neurally assisted ventilation interprets the patients respiratory effort to initiate ventilation. Other modes such as airway-pressure release, are also available in various semantic forms, but none of these new and improved modes have been shown to improve outcome. Of note, however, pressure control ventilation, long thought to be the optimal mode in severe lung injury, has never been proven superior to other modes in randomized trials. Assessment of lung injury is often followed by the PaO2/FiO2 ratio, although this parameter provides no information on the degree of ventilator support being applied. The oxygenation index (OI) is another commonly used tool that incorporates the level of ventilator support and is calculated by: (mean airway pressure x FiO2) / PaO2. While no single measurement has been correlated with death, following serial OI levels do give some guide as to the severity of lung injury over time. Historically, OI’s ranging between 20-30 indicate moderately severe disease and levels consistently over 40 have been noted in patients with high mortality. Thus OI levels > 20 often is a point where adjunct therapy such as high frequency ventilation is introduced. Prone positioning is also often applied to select patients. Inhaled nitric oxide can be trialed, especially in patients with any evidence of pulmonary hypertension. While improved oxygenation may occur, neither prone positioning or inhaled nitric oxide have been shown to improve survival in randomized trials. Given the cost of nitric oxide therapy, this treatment should be quickly abandoned if no beneficial effects are noted within a short period. In patients refractory to the “conventional” therapies above, extracorporeal life support (ECLS) provides another adjunct therapy. Veno-venous cannulation is preferred over veno-arterial unless the patient has significant myocardial dysfunction. New miniaturized extracorporeal oxygenators and devices may open up a new paradigm for respiratory failure management and are actually replacing mechanical ventilation in some patients such as those with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or bridging to lung transplant. Whether they will impact the treatment of ARDS remains to be seen. Recommendations below are suggestions during initial ventilation managements: Cuffed ET tubes can be used safely in children and may be necessary to ensure optimal PEEP and TV in patients with poor lung compliance. Target pH 7.25-7.40. Higher PaCO2 levels can be tolerated. Target SaO2 > 87% if the patient is difficult to oxygenate. Lower levels can be tolerated if organ oxygenation appears adequate. Maintain the Hgb >10 gm/dl for patients with severe hypoxemia. The exact level for hemoglobin maintenance between 7-10 gm/dL remains controversial. Keep HOB elevated at least 30 degrees to minimize risk of ventilator acquired pneumonia (VAP). Follow the Oxygenation Index and/or PaO2/FiO2 ratio to monitor progress and adjust therapies. Oxygenation Index = Mean Airway Pressure x FiO2 / PaO2 30-40 without improvement may indicate need for alternative therapies (ECLS) Start broad spectrum antibiotics consistent with the patient’s immune status and community patterns. Initiate aggressive work up to determine the cause of the patient’s ARDS. The American European Consensus Conference Committee defines ARDS as an acute condition with bilateral radiographic infiltrates, a pulmonary-artery wedge pressure less than 18 or the absence of clinical evidence of left atrial hypertension, and a PaO2 / FiO2 ratio less than 200. A CXR, arterial blood gas and in some cases, an echocardiogram are necessary to make this diagnosis. Initial labs should be guided by the history and potential etiologies. A complete blood count and routine bacterial and respiratory viral cultures should be obtained when indicated, to rule out infectious etiologies. An arterial blood gas is necessary to calculate the oxygenation index and PaO2:FiO2 ratio. While some clinicians now advocate less invasive monitoring of oxygenation by arterial saturation:FiO ratio, this approach is not traditional. Use of invasive arterial lines also provides hemodynamic information. Analysis usually reveals an acute respiratory alkalosis with an elevated alveolar-arterial oxygen gradient and severe hypoxemia. Laboratory findings are otherwise nonspecific and depend on the potential etiology, and may include evidence of DIC and lactic acidosis. The chest radiograph may demonstrate focal changes early on in patients with direct pulmonary insult such as an aspiration or may be nonspecific with indirect insults such as sepsis. As the disease progresses, the chest radiograph typically shows diffuse bilateral alveolar infiltrates with prominent air bronchograms. In some cases, mediastinal and intrathoracic air may be visible from air leak caused by barotrauma and lung friability. Thereafter, the characteristic bilateral diffuse alveolar and reticular opacities become evident and may progress to linear opacities and cysts in the presence of evolving fibrosis. Typically the radiographic abnormalities resolve completely over time though in more severe cases, chronic interstitial changes may persist. Additional studies depend on the patient’s history and inciting event. A complete blood count, coagulation studies, and arterial blood gas is likely to reveal a leukocytosis and thrombocytopenia, coagulopathy, and lactic acidosis with sepsis. A serum BNP, echocardiography and pulmonary artery placement or cardiac catheterization may be necessary to exclude heart failure. Pulmonary artery catheter or echocardiogram data may also be useful to assess volume status, ventricular function, cardiac output, and presence and degree of pulmonary hypertension. A serum lipase can be useful to exclude pancreatitis. A spiral chest CT with a CT angiogram may be necessary to exclude pulmonary embolic disease. Consider bronchoscopy if the cause cannot be determined otherwise. Hemosiderin-laden macrophages from bronchoalveolar lavage, in a patient with hypoxia and unexplained drop in hemoglobin is suggestive of diffuse alveolar hemorrhage. An elevated percentage of lipid laden macrophages suggest chronic aspiration. Idiopathic acute eosinophilic pneumonia is distinguished from ARDS by the large number of eosinophils in bronchoalveolar lavage specimens. If the patient meets the above AECC diagnostic criteria, the patient has ARDS. The underlying trigger will also have a diagnosis. Opportunistic infection in an immunocompromised child Flash pulmonary edema following relief of chronic, severe upper airway obstruction Aggressive treatment of the underlying disease and meticulous supportive care are the mainstays of therapy. Many studies have been published in the past 20 years to determine the best management strategies to minimize lung injury, ventilator and ICU days, and mortality. None have proven to be definitive in children. Despite the few excellent collaborative pediatric studies, much of our approach is driven by the findings in adult studies. To date, low tidal volume (<6 ml/kg) pressure limited ventilation is the only method of mechanical ventilation that has been shown to improve survival in ARDS. A recent meta-analysis of over 2,000 individual adult patient data concluded that higher levels of PEEP were associated with improved survival in a subgroup of patients with severe ARDS, but there is no determined level to universally recommend. Inverse I:E ratio ventilation and HFOV both improve oxygenation and intuitively seem more gentle than conventional ventilation but neither strategy has been shown to improve outcomes over conventional support. HFOV has been shown to be safe and unlikely to cause harm and may be associated with a decrease in mortality. HFOV is commonly recommended in patients whose hypoxemia appears to be refractory to conventional ventilation. The major disadvantage of HFOV is the high levels of sedation that is required to tolerate the technique in children outside the newborn period. Prone positioning can be used safely in children and improve oxygenation in patients with severe ARDS, but have not been shown to improve ventilator free days in children. Caregivers should use a preventative strategy to decrease the risk of decubitus if the prone position is applied. Recruitment maneuvers with brief periods of high levels of pressure or PEEP have also been trialed with variable results – some studies find oxygenation benefit and others increased air leak and complications. Inhaled nitric oxide is a potent pulmonary vasodilator that can improve oxygenation. Outcomes though, were not favorable in a recent meta-analysis of adults and children. Corticosteroids come in and out of favor in ARDS. Studies are variable in terms of benefit or risk. Currently, many clinicians advocate low to moderate doses started during the second week of ARDS for a prolonged duration. Surfactant has also been evaluated in pediatric respiratory failure, but no study has found consistent improvement with this therapy. Initially, fluid therapy may need to be aggressive to resuscitate the patient in shock but subsequently fluid restriction should be initiated based on the recent findings from the NHLBI adult trial that showed a restrictive fluid management protocol to reduce ventilator days when compared to a more liberal protocol. When exactly “resuscitation” ends and fluid restriction begins is controversial. Many advocate that by the third day of acute illness, fluid balance should be maintained. Use of diuretics or hemofiltration, in patients with renal insufficiency, is frequent. Currently there is no proof that transfusing hemoglobin levels to super normal levels benefits ARDS patients. Maintaining adequate oxygen carrying capacity is the goal. Targets of a Hgb level >10 g/dL in unstable children are often used. Evidence supports dropping the hemoglobin transfusion threshold to 7 g/dL once profound hypoxia and shock have resolved. A comparison study of hemoglobin targets in children is currently in the planning stage. Nutritional support is vital. Enteral feeds are the preferred method over parenteral nutrition. Nutrient supplementation with immune modulating formulas has not been shown to be effective in improving outcomes. Overfeeding must be avoided, and caloric intake of 50 kcal/kg or even less may be sufficient in the acute phase of illness. Use of metabolic cart analysis of carbon dioxide production and oxygen consumption would be beneficial but these devices have not proven reliable in intubated children. Sedation is unfortunately a standard part of routine care. There is no data to support any specific regime currently. Paralytics should be avoided to prevent long-term muscle weakness. Surprisingly, one recent adult trial showed an increased survival, increased ventilator free days, and less barotrauma and air leak in patients given muscle relaxants in the first 48 hours of care. Tight glucose control in critically ill patients has been advocated. However, more recent evaluation has found a significantly higher risk of hypoglycemia. Hyperglycemia is to be avoided. The use of protocols established to prevent ventilator acquired pneumonia and catheter related blood stream infections should be implemented and meticulously followed. Use of a standardized ventilator management and weaning protocol is recommended to potentially minimize ventilator induced injury and decrease the number of ventilator days. Newer ventilator “support modes” combined with the use of Neuronal Activation Ventilatory Assist (NAVA) allows a variable breathing pattern and has been shown to improve patient-ventilator synchrony, optimize respiratory muscle unloading, and improve patient comfort. CMV guidelines for ALI/ARDS as adapted from NHLBI ARDS Network Set mode to volume assist-control, pressure regulated volume control or similar modes. Set initial tidal volume to 6-8 mL/kg ideal body weight. Set the rate to approximate patients rate but not to exceed 35/min. Optimally, PEEP should be adjusted to a level above the lower inflection point of the patients inspiratory pressure volume curve. Reduce tidal volume by 1 mL/kg every two hours or less until a tidal volume of 4-6 mL/kg is reached and pH and plateau pressure goals are reached. The plateau pressure (PP) is the pressure applied to small airways and alveoli. It is measured during an inspiratory pause on the ventilator. Without lung disease, the peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) is only slightly above the plateau pressure. Increasing peak pressure with no change in plateau pressure is seen with increased airway resistance or high inspiratory gas flow rates. Increased peak and plateau pressure is indicative of a decrease in lung compliance. Check plateau pressure every 4 hours and after every adjustment of PEEP and oxygen. If the plateau pressure is greater than 30, the tidal volume is decreased by 1 mL/kg to a tidal volume of 4 mL/kg or a plateau pressure of less than 30 is reached. In some patients, a tidal volume of 6 cc/kg will still result in over-inflation of normal areas of the lung. Reduction of minute ventilation to decrease lung injury may result in respiratory acidosis from hypercarbia which may not be well tolerated. Permissive hypercapnia has been shown to be well tolerated in many patients even with pH <7.25. Bicarbonate can be used for buffering if needed, especially if the arterial pH is < 7.0 keeping in mind that bicarbonate will result in additional carbon dioxide to be eliminated. Permissive hypercapnia should be used with caution in patients with head injury to avoid excessive cerebral blood flow and in patients who are at high risk for cardiac dysrhythmias if acidosis is severe. Goal oxygen saturation is usually greater than 88% or a PaO2 greater than 50 mmHg, although permissive hypoxemia with lower levels of saturation and paO2 can be safe in many patients if organ perfusion is maintained and delivery adequate. FiO2 less than 0.60 is desired to prevent additional lung toxicity. Patients with an oxygenation index of 15-20, mean airway pressure of >20 cm H2O or center-specific criteria should be considered. Contraindicated in patients with intracranial hypertension and severe airflow obstruction. Optimization of intravascular volume prior to or during initiation of HFOV to counteract the decrease in venous return from the higher intrathoracic pressure is an important management therapy. Frequent adjustment of ventilator and oxygen settings to optimize oxygen delivery and maintain adequate ventilation may be required initially. Subsequent changes often are limited to weaning oxygen to non-toxic levels until improved compliance allows weaning of mean airway pressure and frequency. Chest radiograph is useful to assess endotracheal tube placement, lung inflation and areas of worsened consolidation. Serial evaluations to assess lung inflation, tube and line positions, and identify air leak are performed. Initial amplitude should cause wiggle to hips / upper thighs. One simple rule is to begin amplitude at twice the mean airway pressure and adjust for oxygenation as needed. Maximal levels of amplitude are determined by the amount of bias flow the ventilator can provide. Newer adult oscillator models allow peak amplitudes of 90 cm of water Frequency should be 10-12 Hz for infants, 8-10 Hz for children, and 5-8 for adults. An important factor in the presumed “lung protective” aspect of HFOV is using the highest level of frequency that provides adequate ventilation. Lower frequencies result in larger tidal volume breaths which in turn may exceed dead space ventilation and contribute to lung injury. Adjustments for ventilation with a target pH 7.25-7.35. Should pH fall for a given frequency, increase amplitude 5 cm of water to maximum of 90 cm of water. Adjustments for ventilation with a pH greater than 7.35. Increase frequency by 1-2 Hz to maximum of 15 Hz, then decrease amplitude by 5 cm of water to a minimum of 20 cm HO. Adjustments for ventilation with a pH less than 7.25 Treat metabolic acidosis, relieve pneumothorax or obstructed tube, and recruit. Increase amplitude by 5 cm of water to a maximum of 90 cm of water, then deflate cuff and increase IT to 50 Initial mean airway pressure should be the mean airway pressure CMV + 5 cm H2O maximum of 35 cm H2O Consider recruitment to 35-45 cm H2O for 40-60 seconds (HFO on pause) If oxygenation is less than target, increase mean airway pressure by 5 cm H2O to a maximum of 35 cm H2O Optimize intravascular volume and consider packed red blood cells for a Hgb < 10 g/dL Prone position and consider inhaled nitric oxide, then Increase mean airway pressure by 5 cm H2O to maximum of 45 cm H2O, then If oxygenation is greater than target, decrease FiO2 by 5% to 60%, then Decrease mean airway pressure by 2 cm H2O to a minimum of 20 cm H2O When patient is improving, and you are weaning, do not forget to Wean amplitude to about 20 before transitioning back to CMV Inhaled nitric oxide cannot be recommended as standard therapy for ARDS, but it may be useful as a rescue therapy in a subgroup of patients with refractory hypoxemia and presumed pulmonary hypertension. Treatment with several other less selective vasodilators has also not been shown to be beneficial. Discontinue iNO therapy if patient is unresponsive Increase in the PaO above 20 mmHg or greater than 20% from baseline, with goal PaO greater than 60 mmHg Increase in the oxygen saturation by 10% (if unable to obtain arterial PaO2) Decrease in the pulmonary artery pressure of 20% or more from baseline (ECHO or PA line) Begin weaning FiO by 2-5% every 30 minutes for saturations >92%, PaO >60 mmHg, to a goal FiO of 60% or less. If saturation decrease is greater than 5%, then return to 20 ppm If saturation decrease is les than 5%, then decrease to 5 ppm and monitor for 30 minutes If saturation decrease is greater than 5%, then return to 10 ppm If saturation decrease is less than 5%, then decrease by 1 ppm every hour to off for a saturation decrease less than 5% If patient falls below the success criteria, return to previous settings and try again in 4 hours if no lability If there are no successful weans in 12 hours, hold weaning for 12-24 hours Though there is no benefit to prophylactic steroid therapy several adult studies have demonstrated a possible benefit from low-dose steroid therapy when initiated during the second week before day 14 and continued for a prolonged period. The protocol by Meduri and colleagues presents an attractive therapeutic option, but steroids cannot be recommended as standard therapy at this time. It may, however, be beneficial in the subacute or fibroproliferative phase of the disease. Proponents of the prolonged low-to-moderate-dose corticosteroids emphasize that abrupt withdrawal of therapy should be avoided. Methylprednisolone as IV push every 6 hours and changed to PO dose when oral intake is restored. Prophylactic antibiotics have no role in the management of ARDS. No advantage has yet been demonstrated with the use of immune modulators. There may be a role for surfactant therapy, but several unanswered questions remain including the dose and frequency. Prone positioning can be used safely and results in improved oxygenation in most patients with ARDS. HFOV should be considered in patients with severe ARDS who have failed conventional mechanical ventilation, typically with an FiO2 greater than 60% on >15 cm of water PEEP, a plateau pressure greater than 30 cm of water, and respiratory acidosis. More simply, it should be considered when the OI is >15 and worsening. ECMO may have a role in combination with other modalities mentioned earlier and should be considered early in the course of disease in patients who require sustained high pressure ventilation. Most patients follow a fairly stereotypical course, characterized by severe hypoxemia followed by a prolonged need for mechanical ventilation, but the course of each phase and the overall disease progression is variable. The acute or exudative phase is manifested by the rapid onset of respiratory failure with hypoxemia refractory to treatment with supplemental oxygen. This lasts from several hours to about a week and is followed by the subacute or proliferative phase characterized by persistent hypoxemia and development of hypercarbia. Some patients progress to a fibrotic phase with a clinical course complicated by barotrauma, nosocomial infection, or the development of MOSF. The recovery phase is characterized by the gradual resolution of hypoxemia and improved lung compliance. Approximately one third of patients with ARDS die from the disease. Long-term survivors may show mild abnormalities in pulmonary function and are often asymptomatic unless they progress to the fibrotic phase. ARDS is a diagnosis of exclusion. Every effort should be made to rule other causes of acute hypoxemic respiratory failure before giving the patient the diagnosis of ARDS. Pulmonary function studies, neurodevelopmental evaluation of muscle weakness and Global Health Assessment at three, six, and twelve months following discharge form the hospital. ARDS is characterized by an initial insult that triggers a release of a variety of mediators leading to endothelial injury, increased vascular permeability, and neutrophil recruitment. The histological hallmarks of ARDS are hyaline membranes, flooded alveoli with proteinaceous edema, and infiltrates of polymorphonuclear neutrophils, macrophages and erythrocytes. Proinflammatory mediators are released from alveolar and endothelial cells that perpetuate this cascade and inactivate surfactant. This leads to reduced lung compliance and ventilation perfusion mismatch. In addition, activation of pro-coagulative factors and inhibition of fibrinolysis leads to the development of small vessel thrombosis in the lung which increases dead space ventilation. The combination of the decreased compliance, increased dead space and hypoxemia leads to an increased work of breathing. Eventually the oxygen demands exceed the ability of the lung to oxygenate the blood and hypoxemic respiratory failure takes place. The degree and duration of injury is dependent on the balance between pro- and anti-inflammatory mediators. For overall resolution to occur, the dynamic balance interaction between capillary leak, coagulation and cell function must rebalance and surfactant production restarted. Apoptosis must normalize and pulmonary edema and transcapillary water must be cleared. This begins the second phase of the illness called the subacute or proliferative stage. It is characterized by resolution of pulmonary edema and by proliferation of type II alveolar cells, squamous metaplasia, interstitial infiltration by myofibroblasts, and early deposition of collagen. Unfortunately in some patients, resolution is hampered and they progress to a fibrotic stage characterized by obliteration of normal lung architecture, diffuse fibrosis, and cyst formation. These patients develop permanent abnormalities in respiratory function with a reduced health-related quality of life. Recently, a polymorphism in the gene encoding angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) was linked to the susceptibility and outcome of ARDS. ACE cleaves angiotensin I to form angiotensin II which in turn activates pro-inflammatory mediators and plays an important role in alveolar epithelial cell apoptosis. The incidence, natural history and outcomes have been hampered by the lack of a standardized definition. In 1994 the American European Consensus Committee on ARDS standardized the definition and renamed it acute rather than adult respiratory distress syndrome because it occurs in all age groups. The consensus definition introduced the term acute lung injury (ALI) to differentiate patients with less severe hypoxemia. ALI is defined by a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of < 300 mmHg, and ARDS by a ratio of < 200 mmHg. While the exact occurrence in children remains controversial, it is thought to represent 3-4% of all PICU admissions. Based on population estimates, each year 2500-9000 children in the United States will have acute lung injury contributing to 500-2000 deaths. Reported mortality ranges from 29-50%; however, the trials with a higher percentage included children who had received bone marrow transplants. Excluding these patients would likely result in an overall lower mortality in children. Encouraging recent reports have found improved survival in the current era with mortality rates < 30%. Prognosis depends on underlying medical condition, presence of multisystem organ failure, and severity of illness. The majority of deaths are attributable to sepsis and multi-organ dysfunction rather than primary respiratory causes. The overall mortality ranges from 26 to 50%. The ELSO Registry shows that survival on ECMO varies from 40% to 59% depending on the underlying illness that triggered the ARDS. Younger age, survival beyond the first two weeks, and trauma etiology predict a more favorable outcome. Risk factors predictive of increased mortality include chronic liver disease, immune compromised state, and advanced age. Multivariate logistical regression analysis shows that the initial severity of hypoxia (PaO2/FiO2), the ratio of dead space to tidal volume (Vd/Vt) as assessed by end-tidal CO2 levels, multi-organ dysfunction, and CNS injury were associated with mortality and prolonged ventilation. Failure of pulmonary function to improve during the first week of treatment is a negative prognostic factor. The persistence of neutrophils in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid correlates with death particularly in patients with sepsis induced ARDS. Continued expression of proinflammatory cytokines is also associated with poor outcome. In general, survivors have good recovery with return of nearly normal pulmonary function within 6 to 12 months. Residual impairment of pulmonary mechanics may include mild to moderate obstruction, diffusion and restrictive abnormalities. Quality of life appears to be reduced for at least one year secondary to persistent functional disabilities. Muscle weakness and fatigue largely contribute to these findings. Etiologic factors may relate to: steroid myopathy, critical illness neuropathy, disuse, and weight loss. Neuropsychologic testing may reveal significant deficits in patients who had more severe and protracted hypoxemia. Special considerations for nursing and allied health professionals.

While each of these individual entities occur with very low frequency, identifying these disorders and distinguishing them from more common entities with similar presentations is critical. Often the clinical management of these disorders may be markedly different from competing diagnostic considerations such as pneumonia, ARDS or aspiration. As many of these diseases are often thought of as having primarily a chronic, progressive course, critical care physicians may not necessarily be as familiar with the underlying disorders as their rheumatology or interstitial lung disease (ILD) colleagues. Conversely, rheumatologists or ILD specialists that provide these patients longitudinal outpatient care may not be intimately familiar with the acute, life-threatening presentations that can be associated with these disorders. Patients may present with acute onset (hours, days or weeks) shortness of breath, hypoxemia and pulmonary infiltrates. Indeed, patients may fulfill the American-European Consensus Conference criteria for ARDS; however, patients with acute eosinophilic pneumonia (AEP) or diffuse alveolar hemorrhage (DAH) obviously do not have a pathologic correlation of diffuse alveolar damage (DAD). Similarly, patients with acute interstitial pneumonitis (AIP), an acute exacerbation of ILD (AE-ILD), hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) associated idiopathic pneumonia syndrome (HSCT-IPS) or acute lupus pneumonitis (ALP) may have a pathologic finding of diffuse alveolar damage but are generally not considered to have ARDS due to the pathophysiologic mechanism of their disorder. Patients who present in this fashion may also complain of fever, fatigue, malaise, cough and hemoptysis. as well as the more pronounced features of dyspnea and hypoxemia. Immunologic lung disease as a cause of diffuse alveolar hemorrhage As outlined the in chapter on alveolar hemorrhage syndromes, patients with DAH will have acute onset cough, dyspnea, fever, hypoxemia and patchy alveolar infiltrates. Only 50-67% will have hemoptysis Patients with DAH from immunologic lung disease will be defined by a pathologic lesion of capillaritis. Infectious complications in immunologic lung diseases Infection is an extremely common complication of immunologic lung disease and a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in disorders such as vasculitis, SLE and bone marrow transplantation. Patients may present with routine or atypical clinical presentations and/or routine or atypical organisms (bacterial, viral, fungal, mycobacterial, Nocardia sp, Pneumocystis jiroveci, etc). The importance of assessing for concomitant infection cannot be overemphasized. Infections may commonly be missed due to the overlap of signs and symptoms with disease activity and/or drug toxicity, the immunocompromised nature of the host and the high frequency of co-morbid infections in the setting of other confounding acute and chronic disease processes. To illustrate this point, it should be noted that 13-26% of vasculitis related deaths are secondary to infection, and 50% of patients with acute lupus pneumonitis have a concomitant infection. Many medications used to treat immunologic lung diseases carry their own significant risks of toxicities and adverse side effects. Methotrexate-induced pneumonitis occurs in 2-8% of patients maintained on chronic therapy. Cyclophosphamide has been associated with a sub-acute pneumonitis and pulmonary fibrosis, albeit at very low frequencies (<1%). Moreover, the use of immunosuppressive and cytotoxic agents increases the risk for infectious complications. Regular, protocolized screening for adverse side effects and toxicities of medications such as cyclophosphamide, azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil, methotrexate, TNF antagonists and corticosteroids should be a regular component of the longitudinal care of the immunologic lung disease patient. Immunologic lung diseases as a cause of airways disease Primary connective tissue disorders may present with bronchiectasis and/or bronchiolitis. Asthma is one of the three legs of the classic triad of Churg-Strauss vasculitis (asthma, eosinophilia and vasculitis), and patients will often have severe persistent and/or steroid-dependent asthma. Status asthmaticus is a significant contributor to Churg-Strauss associated morbidity and mortality. Other airway complications that may be seen in the immunologic lung diseases include subglottic, tracheal or bronchial stenosis, bronchomalacia, hemorrhage, and segmental or lobar collapse from airway narrowing/occlusion. Immunologic lung diseases as a cause of pleural disease Pleural disease is extremely common in SLE, affecting 50-70% of patients over the course of their illness. Other immunologic lung diseases may present with pleural effusions, pleuritis and rarely pleural fibrosis. New effusions in the setting of immunologic lung disease require further evaluation as, while they may represent an inflammatory effusion, infection, heart failure and pulmonary embolus are also possibilities. Patients with systemic autoimmune diseases in general, and scleroderma/CREST syndrome in particular, are at increased risk of aspiration events Venous thromboembolic disease presenting as either a pulmonary embolism or deep venous thrombosis is common in autoimmune diseases in general, and in SLE, anti-phospholipid antibody syndrome and Wegener’s Granulomatosis in particular. For example, the Wegener’s Clinical Occurence of Thrombosis study demonstrated a rate of VTE of 7.0/100 persons-years in patients with Wegener’s granulomatosis, a rate comparable to patients with known prior VTE events. While not traditionally thought of as an immunologic lung disease, the high frequency of events and the morbidity and mortality associated with these events elevate VTE as a significant concern in any patient with any underlying autoimmune disease and new chest symptoms. Pulmonary edema/heart failure may occur as a result of an underlying immunologic disease. As such, the heart as well as the lung must be evaluated in a patient with respiratory distress and an underlying autoimmune process. Churg-Strauss vasculitis and Wegener’s granulomatosis in particular may manifest with a cardiomyopathy, coronary arteritis, conduction delay, arrhythmia or other cardiac disorder. SLE more commonly leads to valvular heart disease or pericarditis. As with all critical illness, the initial stabilization of the patient and addressing the “ABCs” are critical first steps. Patients with impending respiratory failure, whether from DAH, AIP, ALP or pneumonia should be placed on ventilatory support. Patients with shock require hemodynamic support with intravenous fluids, blood products and/or vasopressors. Only once the patient has been stabilized can the clinician consider more targeted interventions such as plasma exchange or corticosteroids. That said, rapid implementation of disease-specific therapies, such as plasma exchange for diffuse alveolar hemorrhage from ANCA-associated vasculitis or Goodpasture’s syndrome is critical to achieving a good outcome. Therefore, the ICU clinician caring for these patients should focus not only on optimizing the supportive care elements, but also achieving a rapid and correct diagnosis that permits optimal disease-specific therapy as well. In some instances, life-saving therapies, such as our plasma exchange example above, may need to be initiated based upon a strong clinical suspicion, even as confirmatory diagnostic studies remain pending. The diagnosis of immunologic lung diseases often requires the clinician to integrate clinical, radiologic, laboratory and pathologic information to decide whether or not the preponderance of the evidence supports a diagnosis of a vasculitis, a connective tissue disease, an idiopathic interstitial pneumonia or other entity classified under the immunologic lung disease heading. While the presence of a pre-existing fibrotic lung disease or autoimmune disease is extremely helpful in generating an appropriate differential diagnosis, the absence of a pre-existing disorder does not exclude the possibility of an immunologic lung disease. Clinicians need to recognize when a presentation of pneumonia or ARDS does not follow the expected clinical course. For example, patients ultimately diagnosed with ARDS should have an identified inciting injury such as sepsis, pneumonia, pancreatitis, aspiration or trauma. The absence of an appropriate antecedent history suggests the possibility of an alternative diagnosis, such as an immunologic lung disease, and strong consideration should be given to bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage, additional laboratory studies (e.g. connective tissue disease serologies), and/or additional imaging studies such as high resolution computed tomography of the chest (HRCT). Similarly, patients who present with bilateral radiographic infiltrates but no significant fever, leukocytosis or sputum production cannot be assumed to have “atypical” pneumonia but rather the clinician should recognize that this presentation carries an extended differential diagnosis deserving of further investigation. A comprehensive evaluation of patients with possible immunologic lung disease includes some combination of the following elements as clinical circumstances dictate: Full medication, occupational, social, family, environmental and travel histories. A thorough and detailed physical examination (especially looking for evidence of extra-pulmonary disease). Connective tissue disease serologies (anti-nuclear antibodies, rheumatoid factor, anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibodies, anti-topoisomerase antibodies, anti-SS-A and SS-B antibodies, hepatitis serologies, anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody testing, anti-proteinase-3 and anti-myeloperoxidase ELISA testing, anti-glomerular basement membrane antibodies, anti-phospholipid antibodies). Chest imaging studies (chest radiograph and/or HRCT). Surgical lung biopsy or biopsy of other target organs (sinus, kidney or skin). AIP occurs either as an idiopathic interstitial pneumonia or in the setting of a connective tissue disease such as rheumatoid arthritis. Known causes of ARDS must be excluded to make a diagnosis of AIP (i.e. exclude a precipitating episode of sepsis, pneumonia, aspiration, trauma or pancreatitis). AIP presents with acute-onset hypoxemia and respiratory distress, often preceded by a 1-2 week prodromal illness characterized by fatigue, malaise, low-grade fevers, cough, and dyspnea. Mean age of onset is 40-60 years. Laboratory data is non-specific and chest radiograph demonstrates bilateral airspace disease. HRCT will generally demonstrate bilateral, heterogenous ground glass opacities and/or areas of air space consolidation with or without modest degrees of traction bronchiectasis and/or honeycombing. Should the patient undergo biopsy, histopathology demonstrates an organizing diffuse alveolar damage pattern (DAD). Mortality is greater than 50% and recurrence is common in survivors. Patients with AE-ILD should fulfill the following criteria: (i) a previous or concurrent diagnosis of a fibrosing interstitial pneumonia, (ii) unexplained worsening or development of dyspnea in 30 days or less, (iii) new ground glass or consolidative changes on HRCT imaging superimposed on fibrotic changes, (iv) no evidence of pulmonary infection, and (v) the exclusion of other causes of acute lung injury. AE-ILD was first described in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (AE-IPF), and this remains the most common underlying disease state; however, AE-ILD has been described in patients with connective tissue disease-associated ILD, chronic fibrotic hypersensitivity pneumonitis, drug-induced interstitial lung disease and non-specific interstitial pneumonitis. Patients commonly have new hypoxia or increased oxygen requirements associated with their dyspnea and infiltrates, and patients may report cough, hemoptysis, fatigue, malaise, fever, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, myalgias or other symptoms. Laboratory findings are non-specific. Surgical lung biopsy will commonly demonstrate an organizing diffuse alveolar damage superimposed on an underlying fibrosing interstitial pneumonia, but a minority will have organizing pneumonia that may respond to corticosteroid therapy. In-hospital and 28-day mortality range from 50-70%, and survivors have a relatively poor prognosis. Patients present with acute onset cough, dyspnea, fever, fatigue, malaise and hypoxemia. ALP will not infrequently progress to respiratory failure. ALP may be an initial presentation of SLE in up to 50% of patients and affects 1-4% of patients with SLE. Concomitant infection occurs in 50% of patients. Chest imaging demonstrates patchy alveolar infiltrates and pathology demonstrates DAD. ALP has a reported mortality rate of up to 50%. Bone marrow transplantation associated idiopathic pulmonary syndrome Patients present 1-3 months after bone marrow transplantation with cough, dyspnea, fever, anorexia, fatigue, malaise and hypoxemia. Respiratory failure occurs in 60-80% of patients. Hypoxemic respiratory failure/distress in the clinical context of recent BMT generates the following differential diagnosis: bacterial or fungal infection, cytomegalovirus pneumonitis, alveolar hemorrhage, graft versus host disease/bronchiolitis obliterans and idiopathic pulmonary syndrome. BMT associated idiopathic pulmonary syndrome occurs in both autologous and allogeneic marrow recipients with an incidence of approximately 5-8%. Chest imaging demonstrates patchy alveolar infiltrates and pathology demonstrates DAD. As with ALP, concomitant infection occurs relatively frequently, on the order of 25-50%. Mortality of idiopathic pulmonary syndrome is 50-90%. Patients are commonly young (age 20-50) and present with acute onset (<7 days) dyspnea and hypoxemia, often accompanied by cough, fever, fatigue, malaise and chest pain. The disease progresses rapidly and commonly culminates in respiratory distress/failure. Chest radiographs show bilateral reticular, reticulonodular, and/or alveolar infiltrates, and similarly, HRCT demonstrates bilateral, patchy heterogeneous ground glass attenuation and/or airspace consolidation. While peripheral eosinophilia is often absent at the time of initial presentation (in stark contrast to chronic eosinophilic pneumonia), eosinophilia on bronchoalveolar lavage (>25% eosinophils on differential cell count) is diagnostic of an eosinophilic pneumonia. In those patients who undergo biopsy, histopathology will reveal pathologic eosinophilic pneumonia often accompanied by a superimposed component of DAD. Some cases of acute eosinophilic pneumonia may be due to drugs/medications (e.g. trazodone, venlafaxine, daptomycin). Patients with DAH present with dyspnea and hypoxemia. While hemoptysis, anemia and diffuse alveolar infiltrates are considered the “classic triad” of DAH, only 2/3 of patients will complain of hemoptysis, and anemia is a non-specific finding in the critically-ill patient population. The diagnosis of diffuse alveolar hemorrhage is made at the time of bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage. Aliquots of saline are serially instilled and withdrawn with the bronchoscope in wedge position. The diagnosis of DAH is made if and when the serial lavage fluid demonstrates a hemorrhagic return that does not clear or paradoxically worsens with serial lavage. The differential diagnosis of DAH includes those entities characterized by a pathologic lesion of capillaritis (ANCA-associated vasculitis – Wegener’s granulomatosis (WG), microscopic polyangiitis (MPA), Churg-Strauss vasculitis (CSV) and idiopathic pauci-immune pulmonary capillaritis (IPIPC); immune complex mediated diseases – Goodpasture’s syndrome (GS), Henoch-Schonlein purpura (HSP), post-streptococcal disease and cryoglobulinemia; secondary vasculitis – SLE, anti-phospholipid antibody syndrome; and drug-induced disease), and those characterized by bland hemorrhage (coagulopathy, mitral stenosis, idiopathic pulmonary hemosiderosis). See section entitled “DAH syndromes” for a further discussion of DAH and the pulmonary vasculitides. The combination of DAH with a concomitant finding of glomerulonephritis is diagnostic of a “pulmonary-renal syndrome” and narrows the differential to small vessel vasculitis (WG, MPA, CSV, IPIPC), Goodpasture’s syndrome, cryoglobulinemia and post-streptococcal disease. A cross-specialty, multi-disciplinary approach involving pulmonologists, rheumatologists, pharmacists and critical care physicians is recommended for the management of these complex diseases and their equally complex treatment regimens. Patients will demonstrate a broad range of disease severity and often will have multiple and heterogeneous manifestations and/or co-morbidities of the underlying autoimmune or idiopathic disease process. Moreover, aggressive and/or prolonged immunosuppression titrated to the disease severity may be associated with significant adverse effects and requires close and careful longitudinal monitoring, ideally with one or more practitioners experienced in the administration and monitoring of these agents. Patients with AIP are treated with supportive care. While it remains unclear whether or not corticosteroids provide significant benefit, most clinicians attempt a trial of therapy with high dose, intravenous corticosteroids (60-250 mg intravenous methylprednisolone every 6 hours for 3 days that is then tapered as dictated by clinical response). Patients with positive clinical responses are generally treated with prolonged courses of oral corticosteroids and/or cytotoxic steroid-sparing agents such as azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil or cyclophosphamide. Patients generally receive broad-spectrum anti-microbial therapy and high dose intravenous corticosteroids (along the lines outlined above); however, it is unclear whether or not this regimen provides significant benefit. In those patients who respond to intravenous corticosteroid therapy, most clinicians recommend transitioning to oral corticosteroids and then introducing a steroid-sparing, cytotoxic agent such as azathioprine or mycophenolate mofetil. A small clinical trial suggested that patients maintained on anti-coagulation might have lower rates of AE-ILD, and this hypothesis is currently being tested in the prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled ACE-IPF clinical trial (Anticoagulant Effectiveness in Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis) sponsored by the National Institutes of Health. Acute lupus pneumonitis is treated with high dose intravenous corticosteroids. Given the high incidence of concomitant infection, patients frequently also receive broad-spectrum anti-microbial therapy. As patients recover from the acute illness, the intravenous steroids are tapered over days/weeks and transitioned to oral corticosteroids with or without the addition of a concomitant cytotoxic, steroid-sparing agent such as azathioprine, methotrexate, cyclophosphamide or mycophenolate mofetil. Intravenous corticosteroids result in rapid improvement. Dosing regimens may vary but, similar to other immunologic lung diseases, therapy with high dose intravenous steroids is recommended. Steroid therapy is then tapered according to the clinical response. Unlike the other immunologic lung diseases, the corticosteroids may be tapered off over approximately 2-8 weeks, and resolution without recurrence is a hallmark of idiopathic AEP. Bone marrow transplantation associated idiopathic pulmonary syndrome At present, corticosteroids initiated at a dose of 2 mg/kg/day (with tapering as dictated by clinical response) and supportive care represent standard therapy. There is interest, however, in exploring a role for TNF antagonists, and the National Institutes of Health/NHLBI is conducting a phase III, prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled study evaluating the effectiveness of etanercept for the treatment of idiopathic pneumonia syndrome following stem cell transplantation Diffuse alveolar hemorrhage is generally classified as a life-threatening disease. As such, those ANCA-associated vasculitides that present with DAH are treated with combination therapy that includes intravenous corticosteriods, plasma exchange and cyclophosphamide. Practically, the corticosteroids and plasma exchange are initiated as early as possible. Plasma exchange is performed for 5-7 days and tailored to clinical response. The initial recommended dose of corticosteroids is 250 mg IV methylprednisolone every 6 hours for 3 days. Intravenous corticosteroid dosage is then carefully de-escalated over a period of 1-2 weeks (e.g. 125 mg IV every 6 hours x 3 days then 60 mg IV every 6 hours x 3-7 days) until patients can safely be transitioned to high dose oral corticosteroids (1 mg/kg/day of prednisone or equivalent). Ultimately, steroid dosage must be tailored to clinical circumstances. The timing of induction therapy with cyclophosphamide remains controversial and at the discretion of the physician providing direct patient care. The risk of adverse side effects and complications associated with the use of cyclophosphamide in critically ill patients must be weighed carefully against the risk of delaying cytotoxic therapy. Additionally, the recently published Rituximab versus Cyclophosphamide for ANCA-associated Vasculitis (RAVE) trial demonstrated that rituximab was as effective as cyclophosphamide in the treatment of patients with major renal disease and alveolar hemorrhage. Therefore, some clinicians will now deploy rituximab in lieu of cyclophosphamide for antibody positive, ANCA-associated vasculitis presenting with alveolar hemorrhage. Finally, activated factor VII has been used in a handful of patients with DAH where the hemorrhage is refractory to intravenous corticosteroids, plasma exchange, cytotoxic therapy and best supportive care with good results at the case report level. Patients found to have an immunologic lung disease or complications thereof benefit from a comprehensive, multi-disciplinary approach to care. Appropriate sub-specialty consultation (rheumatology, pulmonology, immunology and/or nephrology) should be obtained early in the clinical course and comprehensive longitudinal care assured. The disorders characterized under the immunologic lung disease heading all have either an idiopathic or autoimmune etiology. The reader is directed to the specific chapters dealing with each of these disorders within Decision Support to learn more about the pathophysiology underlying each of the individual disorders. The disorders characterized under the immunologic lung disease heading are heterogeneous and have varying epidemiology. The reader is directed to the specific chapters dealing with each of these disorders within Decision Support to learn more about the epidemiology of the individual disorders. Prognosis is determined by the specific pulmonary manifestation and severity of the presentation, the underlying idiopathic or autoimmune disorder and the additional extra-pulmonary manifestations and/or co-morbidities associated with each individual patient presentation. For example, the idiopathic AEP has an excellent prognosis whereas BMT associated idiopathic pulmonary syndrome and AE-IPF have very poor prognoses. Still, the identification of the correct underlying diagnosis and assessing for concomitant infection, providing the best possible supportive care and instituting correct disease-specific therapies, can greatly improve prognosis.

Retrieved Jan 21 2021 from https://www.thefreelibrary.com/Update+in+nonneoplastic+lung+diseases.-a0230152041 Diagnosis of nonneoplastic lung diseases can be challenging for surgical pathologists. Many diseases in this category are rare, and even conditions that are common are not often examined by biopsy. A directed approach to the assessment of a lung biopsy (usually a wedge) for suspected nonneoplastic lung disease begins in the gross room. Because infectious processes are frequently part of the differential diagnosis, tissue for cultures should be sent to the microbiology laboratory, preferably directly from the operating room since contamination is less likely than from the gross room. In pediatric cases, it is essential to fix a portion of fresh tissue in glutaraldehyde for electron microscopic studies. The biopsy specimen should be serially sectioned and submitted in toto. Assessment of the microscopic hematoxylin-eosin sections should be done systematically to include pleura, interstitium, alveolar space and airway, and vessels (arteries, veins, and lymphatics). Attention should also be paid to the location of pathologic findings--whether focal or diffuse, subpleural or central--and differences in severity from lobe to lobe in cases where more than 1 lobe is sampled. By following these principles, most nonneoplastic lung diseases can be adequately diagnosed and pitfalls leading to incorrect diagnoses can be avoided. Keeping abreast of the latest advances in understanding the pathophysiology of nonneoplastic lung disease will also greatly aid in the goal of arriving at a correct diagnosis. Recent discoveries in diseases such as pulmonary alveolar proteinosis, idiopathic pulmonary hemosiderosis, and pulmonary arterial hypertension may impact the diagnosis of these diseases, and new prognostic markers or therapeutic targets identifiable by immunohistochemistry may be requested by clinicians. Also, classification systems of nonneoplastic lung diseases are evolving as we understand more about disease pathophysiology. A new clinical classification system for pulmonary hypertension must be reconciled against our current understanding of the histologic changes that characterize this group of diseases. Asthma classifications based on inflammatory cell make-up are coming into use as well. Finally, revisions to the American Thoracic Society/ European Respiratory Society (ATS/ERS) classification of interstitial lung disease have been published recently, and understanding the features of each diagnostic category of interstitial lung disease is necessary for clinicopathologic correlation. PULMONARY ALVEOLAR PROTEINOSIS Pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (PAP) is a rare disorder of alveolar accumulation of lipoproteinaceous surfactant components. The 3 general categories of PAP, namely congenital, idiopathic, and secondary, have various and possibly overlapping etiologies. Most cases of PAP occur in adults and are idiopathic (90%). In the past decade, major advances in our understanding of the pathophysiology of congenital and idiopathic PAP have been made. Congenital PAP (Surfactant-Deficiency Diseases) Congenital PAP is rare and often involves genetic defects of surfactant proteins or proteins involved in surfactant processing and homeostasis. (1,2) Surfactant, a combination of proteins and phospholipids normally generated and secreted by type II pneumocytes starting in the weeks before birth, lines the alveolar surface of the lungs to reduce surface tension and to prevent alveolar collapse with expiration, and its components are eventually cleared by alveolar macrophages. Clinical history, including family history of pulmonary disease and age at onset of symptoms, may be helpful in directing the diagnostic evaluation and determining the molecular or genetic etiology of congenital PAP. More than 30 different inherited autosomal recessive mutations of the gene encoding surfactant protein (Sp) B have been identified, (2) but the most common mutation is caused by a 2-bp insertion in exon 4 (121ins2), resulting in a frameshift mutation with a premature stop codon and failure of production of mature Sp-B. (1) Surfactant protein B is protective against oxygen-induced lung injury (3) and its deficiency is associated with Sp-A and Sp-C accumulation within type II pneumocytes (4) and in alveolar spaces, (1) through mechanisms which are not entirely clear. These patients also have been shown to have abnormal processing of Sp-C, which further contributes to its accumulation. (5) Alveolar gas exchange is markedly impaired, resulting in severe respiratory distress and death. Compound heterozygotes typically have only a partial Sp-B deficiency, which results in milder symptoms and longer survival. (6) Recently discovered autosomal dominant genetic defects result in an ABCA3 protein that leads to impaired surfactant processing. These genetic defects elucidate an interesting mechanism, which may lead to the clinical and histopathologic features of an early and aggressive form of congenital PAP. (7) The ABCA3 gene encodes a lipid transporter expressed mainly on the limiting membrane of lamellar bodies in type II pneumocytes, the site of surfactant processing and storage. (8) Genetic defects result in reduced or absent surfactant protein expression and characteristic ultrastructural features including abnormal lamellar bodies with eccentric dense cores (Figure 1). Patients have a poor prognosis even with maximal support. Compound heterozygotes may have a better prognosis with later onset of symptoms. (9) Less commonly, various genetic mutations of Sp-C can cause congenital PAP. (10) Surfactant protein C mutations can be inherited in an autosomal dominant manner or can be sporadic, with variable age at onset of clinical symptoms and variable histologic findings. (2) Rare cases of congenital PAP have been shown to be due to defective expression of the common [[beta].sub.c] chain subunit of the granulocyte monocyte-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) receptor, (11) resulting in a functional deficiency of GM-CSF. Idiopathic PAP The most significant recent advance in our understanding of PAP has been the identification of a neutralizing autoantibody to GM-CSF in patients with the idiopathic form of the disease. The involvement of GM-CSF in human PAP was suspected after it was observed that [GM-CSF.sup.-/-] mice developed alveolar accumulations of lipoproteinaceous material and debris, similar to that seen in PAP. (12,13) Deficiency of GM-CSF (Figure 2) was found to result in severely impaired Sp-A and phosphatidylcholine clearance from the lungs, resulting in alveolar phospholipid stasis and accumulation. (14) The catabolism of Sp-A and phosphatidylcholine by alveolar macrophages was impaired, despite increased uptake of these accumulating phospholipids. (15) This functional defect of alveolar macrophages is thought to be due to their immature state because of decreased expression of the transcription factor PU.1, (16) which is important for myeloid cell growth and differentiation. (17,18) Expression of PU.1 in alveolar macrophages is increased by GM-CSF.19 A more recent study has shown that in contrast to other tissue macrophages, alveolar macrophages are unique in their dependence on PU.1 for terminal differentiation, which explains why the effects of anti-GM-CSF in patients with PAP is localized to the lungs. (20) Dysregulation of lipid metabolism and transport in alveolar macrophages has also been found in patients with functional GM-CSF deficiency. (21,22) [FIGURE 1 OMITTED] Secondary (Acquired) PAP The pathophysiology of secondary PAP has not been thoroughly investigated. Environmental exposures may cause alveolar macrophage impairment due to the presence of dusts or crystals, such as in PAP due to silico sis. (11,23-25) Despite the well-known association of PAP with acute and chronic leukemias, (26-29) mechanistic studies are lacking. Functionally defective alveolar macrophages or reduced alveolar macrophage progenitor cells due to cytopenia have been suggested as possible mechanisms. (30) Patients with rare pediatric acute myeloid leukemia have been found to have PAP associated with defective leukemic cell expression of the common [[beta].sub.c] chain and a chains of the GM-CSF receptor. (29) A similar mechanism may explain the development of PAP in an adult with myelodysplastic syndrome who had increased levels of GM-CSF in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid and no GM-CSF autoantibody. (31) [FIGURE 2 OMITTED] Pulmonary alveolar proteinosis associated with the rare autosomal recessive disorder lysinuric protein intolerance, in which there is defective cationic amino acid transport, (32) may be due to common transporter defects resulting in imbalances of arginine and nitric oxide. Alternatively, there may be a defect in bone marrow-derived macrophages, as has been suggested in a case report of recurrent PAP in a patient with lysinuric protein intolerance after heart-lung transplant. (33) Pathologic Features of PAP The pathologic features of PAP are similar, regardless of etiology, because they reflect the common finding of surfactant and phospholipid accumulation in the airspaces. Several serum and BAL fluid markers, which may correlate with disease activity, have been identified in patients with PAP, including the glycoprotein KL-6, (34,35) LDH, (36) IL-10, (37) and the cholesterol metabolite cholestenoic acid. (38) In patients with idiopathic PAP, serum and BAL anti-GM-CSF antibodies are disease-specific and BAL titers may correlate with other serologic, radiologic, and clinical disease parameters. (39) Obtaining BAL fluid for analysis in patients with PAP offers a less invasive adjunct diagnostic tool. The characteristic microscopic finding is that of dense orange-brown globules with sharp green borders in ethanol-fixed, Papanicolaou-stained BAL preparations. (40) The presence of 18 or more of these globules is highly sensitive and specific for PAP. (41) Foamy macrophages and other inflammatory cells are sparse in the background. (42) Although findings on BAL fluid may be characteristic, a wedge lung biopsy is considered the gold standard for diagnosis. Transbronchial biopsy may also yield diagnostic material. In idiopathic PAP, histologic sections show filling of the alveolar airspaces and some small bronchioles by amorphous granular eosinophilic material (Figure 3). Cellular debris, including degenerating alveolar macrophages, sloughed pneumocytes, and cholesterol clefts, is often present, and there may be a regenerative type II pneumocyte hyperplasia. The eosinophilic material is periodic acid-Schiff-positive with diastase digestion, mucicarmine negative, and immunohistochemically positive for surfactant proteins A, B, and C. The alveolar architecture is preserved, with minimal inflammation. Increased interstitial inflammation should prompt suspicion for a superimposed infectious process. Interstitial fibrosis may be present in longstanding disease. Surrounding alveoli may have secondary emphysematous change. (43) In congenital PAP, the intra-alveolar material is often sparse and is immunohistochemically negative for Sp-B in cases due to genetic Sp-B deficiency. In addition, there are signs of impaired alveolarization, such as thickened alveolar interstitial septae, a simplified alveolar pattern, and regenerative hyperplastic type II pneumocytes (1,2) (Figure 4). It should be noted that some cases of congenital PAP may have pathologic findings of desquamative interstitial pneumonitis on transbronchial biopsy, with typical PAP histologic findings only in subpleural areas. (1,44) Cases of secondary PAP due to environmental exposures may show histologic evidence of the causative particles (Figure 5). Electron microscopic analysis of tissue sections and BAL fluid in idiopathic PAP reveals multilamellated tubular myelin-like and fused membrane lamellar bodylike structures, both in the airspaces and within alveolar macrophages. (16,45-47) Crystals and evidence of cell debris can also be identified. In congenital PAP due to Sp-B deficiency, the lamellar bodies may be disorganized (2) and decreased in number, and membranous vesicular debris from Sp-A, Sp-C, and type II pneumocytes may be found between type II cells and their basement membrane. (48) Lamellar bodies in congenital PAP due to ABCA3 deficiency are decreased and have abnormal eccentric dense core bodies with a ""fried-egg"" appearance (7,44) (Figure 1). [FIGURE 3 OMITTED] [FIGURE 4 OMITTED] [FIGURE 5 OMITTED] Treatment of PAP Advances in our understanding of the pathophysiology of PAP are leading to new experimental therapies. Several studies have demonstrated treatment efficacy in the use of subcutaneous (49,50) or aerosolized (51) GM-CSF for patients with idiopathic PAP. Interestingly, the first successful treatment with GM-CSF of a patient with idiopathic PAP (52) occurred before the identification of a neutralizing autoantibody to GM-CSF, when the rationale for administering GM-CSF was based on a suspected GM-CSF defect, as had been shown in mouse models. (16) Although the actual mechanism has not been clearly elucidated, a reduction in the titer of anti-GM-CSF antibodies has been shown. (53,54) Whole lung lavage remains the gold standard for treatment of idiopathic PAP. The mechanism is thought to be both physical removal of the accumulated lipoproteinaceous material, as well as removal of anti-GM-CSF antibodies. (30) Congenital PAP is treated supportively, although whole lung lavage, aerosolized surfactant protein administration, intravenous immunoglobulin G administration, (55) and lung transplantation are possible alternatives. (56) Secondary PAP due to hematologic malignancy typically regresses with successful therapy of the underlying disorder, (28,29) and cases with other etiologies can be treated with whole lung lavage. (57,58) The median duration of response to whole lung lavage is 15 months, (59) although single-institution studies reported that 46% to 62% of patients had sustained improvement after only a single whole lung lavage procedure. (46,60) Disease specific survival at 5 years for patients with idiopathic PAP is 88%. (59) Most case reports from patients with congenital PAP indicate a poor prognosis, with survival measured in days to months. (56,61,62) IDIOPATHIC PULMONARY HEMOSIDEROSIS Idiopathic pulmonary hemosiderosis (IPH) is a rare disease characterized by heavy lungs with aggregates of hemosiderin-laden macrophages due to recurrent diffuse alveolar hemorrhage in the absence of vasculitis or capillaritis and by eventual interstitial fibrosis (Figure 6). Presentation is most often seen in the pediatric age group although adults can also be affected. Although the exact etiologic mechanisms remain unknown, IPH has been linked with certain household pathogenic molds and decreased levels of von Willebrand factor, suggesting an environmental trigger in genetically predisposed individuals. (63) There have also been several case reports of IPH occurring in individuals with celiac disease, (64-66) pointing to a possible autoimmune etiology. Untreated IPH has a poor prognosis, but use of corticosteroids in pediatric and adult patients has greatly improved outcomes, (67-69) also suggesting an immune-mediated aspect to the pathophysiology of this disease. [FIGURE 6 OMITTED] [FIGURE 7 OMITTED] PULMONARY HYPERTENSION Pulmonary hypertension is a clinical diagnosis encompassing a variety of diseases affecting the pulmonary vasculature, many of which have overlapping histologic features. The most recent World Health Organization clinical classification (70,71) defines 5 groups of pulmonary hypertension: (1) arterial, (2) venous, (3) hypoxemia associated, (4) thrombotic-embolic associated, and (5) miscellaneous. The first group includes pulmonary arterial hypertensive conditions previously referred to as both primary (idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension, IPAH) and secondary (familial pulmonary arterial hypertension; associated with pulmonary arterial hypertension, APAH; and persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn, PPH). The use of the term idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension is preferred over primary pulmonary hypertension, (71) as are the more specific terms for the conditions previously referred to as secondary. A limitation of the clinical classification is that it does not incorporate histologic findings seen on biopsy. This is likely because of the lack of concordance between histologic findings and clinical response to therapy. (72) Indeed, although Heath and Edwards developed a pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) grading system, (73) it is applicable only to patients with congenital malformations leading to shunting from left to right side. In other clinical settings, the morphologic features described, such as changes in small arteries (medial hypertrophy, intimal proliferation, concentric intimal fibrosis, necrotizing arteritis) and changes in arterioles (muscularization, plexiform lesions [Figure 7], angiomatoid lesions) are useful in identifying the range of pathologic conditions encountered in IPAH. When tissue is available from all lobes for sampling (eg, explanted lungs and autopsies), the whole range of pathologic changes are often seen in the same patient. Idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension remains mostly a clinical diagnosis because patients with this condition do not typically undergo biopsy. In practice, the different types of PAH (World Health Organization group I) have in common small pulmonary muscular arteriole lesions, as well as similar clinical respiratory symptoms and similar response to therapy. (71) These similarities imply a unifying disease mechanism, a concept that requires further study. Recent studies into a possible disease mechanism have focused on 3 general areas: autoantibodies, endothelial progenitor cells, and pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cells. Pulmonary arterial hypertension in patients with systemic sclerosis (SSc-PAH), which falls into the APAH category, is a major cause of mortality in this population. (74,75) Autoantibodies to fibroblasts have recently been identified in both patients with SSc-PAH and IPAH; the antigenic targets of these autoantibodies include proteins involved in several key cellular pathways, including cytoskeletal function and cellular metabolism. (76) Anti-endothelial cell antibodies have also been described for patients with SSc-PAH and IPAH. (77) Junhui et al (78) showed decreased numbers and activity of endothelial progenitor cells isolated from patients with IPAH, as compared to healthy individuals. These findings suggest that these progenitor cells may be a valid therapeutic target for patients with PAH, and an open-label pilot study in children with PAH has confirmed the safety and efficacy of autologous transplantation of endothelial progenitor cells. (79) Another major area of research has been the study of pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cells and the transforming growth factor [beta] (TGF-[beta]) receptor complex, which is a key regulator of vascular smooth muscle homeostasis. (80) Several mutations in the TGF-[beta] type II superfamily receptor bone morphogenetic protein receptor 2 are known to occur in both FPAH (81,82) and IPAH. (83) ASTHMA Asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease are common obstructive lung diseases with a spectrum of symptoms, and both inflammation and airway remodeling are important factors involved in their pathogenesis. While the basic histopathologic changes associated with remodeling (eg, subepithelial fibrosis, increased smooth muscle content, mucus gland hyperplasia) are widely recognized, there are now new insights into the complex interaction between the various airway components, including cytokine and chemokine release, vascular remodeling and angiogenesis, and the inflammatory response. (84,85) Indeed, studies of noninvasive markers of airway inflammation have recently led to the concept of reclassifying asthma into eosinophilic and noneosinophilic phenotypes, (86) which may help explain the observed differences in prognosis and treatment response in patients with obstructive respiratory disease. A small early study by Wenzel et al (87) determined that a subset of patients who had severe asthma with nearly normal numbers of eosinophils in endobronchial biopsy specimens could be physiologically and clinically distinguished from patients who had severe asthma with increased eosinophils. More recently, Simpson et al used the less invasive technique of induced sputum to define eosinophilic and noneosinophilic asthma and defined 4 subphenotypes: eosinophilic (increased eosinophils only), neutrophilic (increased neutrophils only), mixed inflammatory (increased eosinophils with increased neutrophils), and paucigranulocytic (normal eosinophils with normal neutrophils). (86,88) While noninvasive techniques of assessing the inflammatory process are preferred clinically for a variety of reasons, little is known about the degree to which histopathologic (Figure 8) and pathophysiologic features of airway inflammation and remodeling correspond to noninvasive markers of airway inflammation. More studies are therefore needed to assess the correlations between invasive and noninvasive parameters and clinical outcomes in patients with obstructive pulmonary diseases. Although patients with obstructive symptoms do not often undergo biopsy, some asthma centers are beginning to obtain more of these specimens. When evaluating biopsy specimens from patients with obstructive lung disease, attention should be given to epithelial denudation and metaplasia, basement membrane thickening, smooth muscle hypertrophy, disorganization of elastic fibers, and both intraepithelial and submucosal inflammatory cells, especially eosinophils and neutrophils. A comment regarding the presence or absence of granulomas and vasculitis is also helpful for clinicians. INTERSTITIAL LUNG DISEASE In 2002, the ATS/ERS published a joint statement describing the classification of idiopathic interstitial pneumonia. (89) This classification schema uses an agreed-upon set of histopathologic criteria as a foundation for making a diagnosis, ultimately incorporating radiologic findings as well as the dynamic clinical picture. Several important concepts regarding the histopathologic diagnosis of interstitial pneumonias were clarified in their statement and are discussed below. Bronchiolitis Obliterans Organizing Pneumonia Versus Organizing Pneumonia A longstanding controversy has existed over the use of the term bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia. This term unfortunately incorporates terminology that is histologically inaccurate for the finding of Masson bodies within terminal airways and that is more accurately applied to the submucosal airway fibrosis in the setting of chronic lung transplant rejection (bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome). Also, the term bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia can be confused clinically with the entity of constrictive bronchiolitis or obliterative bronchiolitis. The preferred terminology adopted by the 2002 ATS/ERS for the histologic finding of fibroblastic nodules filling terminal airways and alveoli is ""organizing pneumonia"" (Figure 9) and this correlates with the clinical diagnosis of cryptogenic organizing pneumonia.90 Histologically, organizing pneumonia may or may not have a bronchiolar component and there is preservation of lung architecture. The intraluminal plugs are patchy and are composed of fibroblasts and myofibroblasts in a loose connective tissue with an associated mild interstitial infiltrate of lymphocytes, plasma cells, and histiocytes. The finding of granulomas, abscesses, necrosis, or vasculitis should prompt consideration of alternative diagnoses. Lymphoid Interstitial Pneumonia Lymphoid interstitial pneumonia (LIP) is an interstitial lung disease characterized by diffuse and dense infiltration of alveolar septae by chronic inflammatory cells, including T lymphocytes, plasma cells, and histiocytes, with prominent germinal centers and hyperplasia of the bronchial-associated lymphoid tissue. Many of the reported cases of LIP in the literature are now accepted as being low-grade, B-cell, mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphomas (MALT), and idiopathic LIP is exceedingly rare. (91) Cases of true LIP are often associated with underlying autoimmune or immune-mediated systemic diseases, including pediatric HIV/AIDS (92) (Figure 10) and combined variable immunodeficiency, a primary immunodeficiency characterized by abnormal immunoglobulin production and associated T-cell abnormalities. (93-95) Along the same spectrum as LIP, nodular lymphoid hyperplasia (previously termed lymphoid pseudotumor)--although also historically including cases of B-cell MALT lymphomas--is thought to be a distinct entity based on immunohistologic and molecular studies. (96) Usual Interstitial Pneumonia The most common histologic subtype of chronic interstitial lung disease is usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP), which makes up 47% to 71% of cases. (97) In the absence of an underlying etiology, it is also known as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Usual interstitial pneumonia can occur in a familial pattern or in the setting of connective tissue disease, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, or drug toxicity. Typically, patients present with gradual-onset dyspnea, nonproductive cough, and restrictive pulmonary function tests in their fifth to seventh decade of life. (89) The disease is more common in men, and the median length of survival after diagnosis is 3 years. (89) Computed tomography scans demonstrate basilar and interstitial reticular opacities with traction bronchiectasis, honeycombing, and ground-glass opacities. Occasionally, UIP undergoes acceleration or acute exacerbation with no apparent inciting factor, with a mortality rate as high as 50%. (98) Treatment for UIP is controversial, with corticosteroids and immunosuppressive drugs being the most commonly used agents. The ATS/ERS supports prednisone therapy with azathioprine or cyclophosphamide for at least 6 months. (99) A lung transplant is the best option for patients younger than 70 years and is associated with a 5-year survival rate of 50%. (99) Surgical lung biopsy remains the gold standard for diagnosis of UIP, and sampling at least 2 sites is recommended. (99) Key histologic features, as identified by the ATS/ERS 2002 consensus, include patchy subpleural and baraseptal distribution of remodeled lung architecture with dense fibrosis, frequent honeycombing, and large fibroblastic foci scattered at the edges of dense scars. (89) Temporal and spatial heterogeneity are the hallmarks: temporal variation is represented by young, pale fibroblastic foci adjacent to areas of older, denser pink collagenous fibrosis (Figure 11); spatial variation indicates that these collagenous areas are arranged in islands adjacent to normal parenchyma or areas of honeycombing, which is characterized by groups of dilated air spaces lined by metaplastic bronchiolar epithelium (Figure 12). On the other hand, inconspicuous or absent in UIP are granulomas, eosinophilia, dust deposits, chronic interstitial inflammation, or other interstitial disease processes. (89) The differential diagnosis for UIP also includes fibrosing nonspecific interstitial pneumonia (less architectural distortion), desquamative interstitial pneumonia/respiratory bronchiolitisassociated interstitial lung disease (more intra-alveolar macrophages), chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis with fibrosis (less cellular, with granulomas), organizing pneumonia (intra-alveolar fibrosis) and Langerhans histiocytosis (predominance of peribronchiolar fibrosis and stellate-shaped scars). [FIGURE 8 OMITTED] [FIGURE 9 OMITTED] [FIGURE 10 OMITTED] [FIGURE 11 OMITTED] [FIGURE 12 OMITTED] [FIGURE 13 OMITTED] Despite what is known about the morphologic features of UIP, the pathogenesis of this disease remains elusive. The current hypothesis presumes injury to the alveolar epithelium, followed by inflammatory and fibrotic tissue repair, which fails to abate. The fibroblastic focus appears to play a major role in the progression of this disease and serves as a prognostic marker, with more foci imparting a worse prognosis. (100) Many hypotheses exist regarding the origin of these fibroblasts, including resident pulmonary mesenchymal cells, epithelial cells that have undergone mesenchymal transition, and most recently, bone marrow--derived circulating fibrocytes. (101,102) Patients with IPF have increased numbers of fibrocytes in peripheral blood (103) as well as in scarred areas of lung near fibroblastic foci. (102) Furthermore, recent literature suggests that there may be a differential resistance to apoptosis between fibroblasts and epithelial cells, with fibroblastic foci more resistant and epithelial cells more susceptible to apoptosis. (104) Undoubtedly, the mechanism of disease is complex and requires further investigation to better understand the pathogenesis of and to improve treatment strategies for UIP. Nonspecific Interstitial Pneumonia Nonspecific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP) was originally classified as a provisional entity by the 2002 ATS/ERS classification, pending further studies of the associated clinical characteristics. (89) Travis et al recently reported their findings from such studies and concluded that idiopathic NSIP is a distinct clinical-radiologic-pathologic entity, occurring primarily in middle-aged women who are never smokers, with a 5-year survival rate greater than 80%. (105) Major features of NSIP are its often patchy distribution of uniform interstitial thickening by a cellular or, more often, a fibrosing process (Figure 13). Common features of both subtypes include lymphoid follicles, enlarged air spaces (not microscopic honeycombing), some degree of interstitial inflammation, focal organizing pneumonia, pleural fibrosis, and vascular medial thickening. (105) The major differential diagnosis is usual interstitial pneumonia, which has patchy, lower-lobe predominant fibrosis with temporal heterogeneity. Fibroblastic foci are a prominent feature of UIP, whereas their presence in NSIP is usually inconspicuous. Finding poorly formed granulomas and intraluminal fibrosis is more consistent with hypersensitivity pneumonitis than with NSIP, and prominent intraluminal fibroblastic nodules (Masson bodies) with preserved underlying architecture are more likely to be seen in organizing pneumonia. The pathologic pattern of NSIP is seen in more patients than just those with the distinct clinical-radiologic-patho logic picture of the disease. The histologic NSIP pattern is often seen in lung biopsies of patients with collagen vascular disease--even as an initial presentation--as well as in those of patients with occupational exposures. (106) There may be some differences in the collagen and elastic fiber deposition, which correlate with prognosis, in NSIP associated with fibrosing and collagen vascular disease as compared with cellular NSIP. (107) Therefore, a diagnosis of NSIP from a lung biopsy should prompt efforts to identify an etiology so that proper therapy can be pursued. CONCLUSION Nonneoplastic lung diseases encompass a variety of pathologic entities. Advances in our understanding of several of these entities may affect their diagnosis, management, and treatment. Systematic assessment of microscopic features, in conjunction with clinicoradiologic data, is an important key to a successful diagnosis by the well-informed surgical pathologist.

1f6ca9de-dfc3-4833-9e35-c811f4b70f39,"In terms of gas exchange, what is the terminal portion of the lungs? -very close to pulmonary capillaries-allows good gas exchange/mixture of oxy and deoxy blood What system plays a role in removing particles from interstitial spaces of the lung? -alveoli are not a closed system-these pores allow for air mixing What are the differences between Type I and Type II alveolar cells? -Type 1: 95% of alveoli surface; don't divide; form barrier between air inside and wall component-Type II: 5% of alveoli surface; dividing cells - progenerate Type I and Type II; make pulmonary surfactant What is the function of pulmonary surfactant? What produces it? -helps keep lungs compliant; allows lungs to inflate fully-produced by Type II alveolar cells What do the diaphragm and intercostal muscles do during inspiration? -diaphragm: contracts and moves downward when you inspire-intercostal muscles: contract during inspiration to allow expansion and to allow the sternum to move forward for proper inflation What kind of process is expiration? What does the diaphragm do? -passive process-diaphragm recoils to original position Someone who has trouble breathing will start using extra muscles to breath, what are these muscles? -abdominals-accessory muscles: trapezius, scalenus, sternomastoid -subjective feeling of difficulty breathing-mechanism: stimulation of lung receptors-mechanism: increased sensitivity to changes in ventilations perceived through CNS mechanisms-mechanism: reduced ventilatory capacity or breathing reserve-mechanism: stimulation of neural receptors in the muscle fibers of the intercostals and diaphragm Explain how stimulation of lung receptors can cause dyspnea. (hint: 3 diff receptor types) -there are a few different types of receptors in the lungs-stretch receptors sense bronchoconstriction and can lead to the feeling of SOB-irritant receptors are triggered by cold air, cig smoke, etc.-J receptors sense lung congestion (such as in pneumonia), cause feeling of SOB Explain how increased sensitivity to changes in ventilations perceived through CNS mechanisms can cause dyspnea. -we have 2 different centers in the brain (specifically the medulla)-they are CNS centers that send out impulses for breathing -- a change here could trigger SOB Explain how reduced ventilatory capacity or breathing reserve can cause dyspnea. -this is primarily in COPD pts-everyone has a breathing reserve when they are not active/not using lungs fully-COPD pts have obstructive processes and alveoli are destroyed --> they lose their breathing reserve so they never feel like they take a really full breath Explain how stimulation of neural receptors in muscle fibers of the intercostals and diaphragm can cause dyspnea. -our body has neural receptors constantly sensing if we have low O2 or high CO2-their response to either of these conditions is to hyperventilate --> produces SOB feeling + muscles working harder to breathe maximum amount of air that can be rapidly and forcefully exhaled from the lungs after full inspiration What does forced expiratory volume (FEV1) measure? volume of air expired in the first second, expressed as a percentage of the FVC According to the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, what three different things must be occurring in asthma? -airflow obstruction (relates to bronchoconstriction)-bronchial hyperresponsiveness -underlying inflammation reversible (someone w/an acute episode can be given tx to make bronchoconstriction go away) In Missouri, asthma mortality rates are higher in what race? -immediate hypersensitivities -MUST be exposed to an allergen What is IgE? What does it do? (in hypersensitivity rxn) -principal antibody mediator-when exposed to a trigger, B cells produce IgE secreting plasma cells-multiple exposures = IgE detected in blood What do T-helper (T-lymphocyte) cells do? (in hypersensitivity rxn) -recruit eosinophils-memory -- remember previous exposure = faster rxn second time around What are mast cells? What do they do? (in hypersensitivity rxn) -principal effector cells (driver cell in cascade initiation)-filled with vesicles filled with cytokines -- proinflammatory mediators -allergen exposure = binds IgE and degranulation occurs -- cytokines/mediators released from vesicles What is histamine? What does it do? (in hypersensitivity rxn) -most important mediator-H1 receptor is primary driver of hypersensitivity rxn -- may add heartburn med to Benadryl to get H2 receptor too though-causes smooth muscle contraction and vasodilation (leaky vessels; edema) -- induces bronchoconstriction-increases mucosal edema What do alveolar macrophages do? (in hypersensitivity rxn) -scavengers found in large and small airways-initiate inflammatory cascade -release mediators-not as predominate as eosinophils Histamine, prostaglandins, thromboxanes, leukotrienes, and platelet-activating factor are all what? What are they released from? What do they contribute to? -are all hypersensitivity rxn mediators-released from mast cells-all contribute to bronchospasm -induced by exposure to an allergen-develops within 10-20 minutes of exposure-characterized by an early and late phase rxn What are potential triggers for extrinsic (atopic) asthma? -animal danders-cigarette smoke-sulfite containing foods (dried fruit, beer, wine, shrimp)-dust mites-mold-seasonal outdoor allergens What are the 5 ""steps"" in the early-phase of extrinsic (atopic) asthma? 1. fast onset: within minutes of allergen exposure2. trigger = antigen (allergen)3. release of cytokines: antigen binds IgE coated on mast cell, initiating response; epithelial cells of the airway open up and let mast cells and allergens into the airway; degranulation of mast cells occurs = cytokines/mediators released 4. increase in mucus/edema: goblet cells increase mucus production; histamine makes vessels leaky = edema5. bronchospasm: mediators can directly induce bronchospasm; mediators also attract inflammatory cells (part of late-phase) What are the 4 ""steps"" of late-phase extrinsic (atopic) asthma? 1. recruited cells drive the response: can occur 4-8 hrs after early phase; eosinophils and neutrophils were brought to the area by cytokine mediators2. airway epithelial cells also release eotaxin: eotaxin is an activator of eosinophils -- another way of continuing inflammatory cascade 3. epithelial cell injury occurs as a result of this process and further bronchoconstriction occurs: mucus build-up reduces airflow; edema occurs because of histamine and leaky vessels 4. increased airway responsiveness = prolonged asthma symptoms What makes extrinsic (atopic) asthma so dangerous? (hint: late phase) -late phase can occur 4-8 hrs after early phase -late phase can have worse symptoms = dangerous What is intrinsic asthma? What are potential triggers? -non-allergic asthma-triggers: respiratory tract infections; exercise; stress; laughter; cold air; GERD; medications (aspirin, NSAIDs, beta blockers) How do NSAIDs and aspirin relate to the asthma response? -aspirin and NSAIDs decrease prostaglandins but the other side of the pathway is leukotriene production, so we make more of these -leukotrienes are a common mediator of the asthma response What are special considerations for using beta-blockers in asthma and COPD pts? -there are specific and non-specific beta-blockers-non-specific beta blockers work on beta-2, primarily in the lungs = DO NOT use in asthma patients --> would cause bronchoconstriction; would be okay to use in COPD pts What is the clinical presentation of asthma? What is the primary symptom? -cough-wheezing - primary symptom-dyspnea and chest tightness-tachypnea and tachycardia-hypoxemia -primary symptom of asthma-high pitched whistling-usually heard on expiration but can be heard on inspiration too if bad enough; wheezing can disappear entirely if asthma is very bad -cardiac and respiratory system are working much harder to move air -trying to compensate by breathing faster and working the heart harder What system can asthma patients use on their own to determine how much ""trouble"" they are in? -use peak flow meters in the peak flow zone system-green, yellow, and red zones -calculated off personal best peak flow What 5 components do we look at to determine the stage of asthma? -frequency of symptoms -nighttime awakenings-beta-agonist use (albuterol)-interference with activity-lung function (FEV1 and FEV1/FVC) -rescue medications (short-acting beta agonists and oral corticosteroids)-controller medications (mainstay of therapy is inhaled corticosteroids) -- pt takes these all the time What is an asthma exacerbation? What is a moderate vs severe exacerbation? -event characterized by a change from the pt's previous status-moderate: troublesome to patient and prompt a need for change in tx-severe: require urgent action from MD to prevent hospitalization or death -history of severe exacerbations-greater than or equal to 2 hospitalizations for asthma in the past year-greater than or equal to 3 emergency dept visits for asthma in the past year-using more than 2 canisters per month of short-acting beta agonist (SABA)-current oral steroid use-low socioeconomic status (risk factors b/c of access to tx; often use emergency dept) What 8 symptoms/signs do we consider when evaluating an asthma exacerbation? -breathlessness (when does it occur? at some point they can't get a good breath laying down)-talks in (sentences, phrases, words, can't speak)-alertness (agitation; lethargy = v. bad)-respiratory rate -accessory muscle use-wheeze -pulse/minute-PEFR/peak flow -presence of airflow limitation-usually progressive-associated with enhanced, chronic inflammatory response in the airways and the lungs to noxious particles and gases-exacerbations and comorbidities contribute to overall severity in individual patients What two terms are essentially types of COPD but are no longer used and have NO clinical relevance?

There are several pulmonary manifestations of sickle cell disease: increased airway reactivity, nocturnal oxygen desaturation, thromboembolic disease, acute chest syndrome (ACS), sickle cell chronic lung disease (SCCLD), and pulmonary hypertension. The clinician should be aware of ACS, a form of acute lung injury that is the most common form of acute pulmonary disease in SCD and occurs in almost half of these patients. ACS is a risk factor for early mortality and is the most frequently reported cause of death in SCD patients. Nevertheless, median survival has improved with supportive care, and thus an increasing number of patients with sickle cell chronic lung disease (SCCLD) and pulmonary hypertension present acutely and will require special consideration in the intensive care setting. Patients admitted with vaso-occlusive crises (VOC, sickle cell crisis or pain crisis) can often be considered as presenting with the prodrome of ACS. Severe VOCs may affect many organs and pulmonary involvement can lead to the development of ACS. ACS is defined by the appearance of a new pulmonary infiltrate on CXR, associated with fever and respiratory symptoms such as tachypnea, wheezing, cough and pleuritic chest pain. Underlying conditions predisposing to ACS include infection, embolic phenomena from bone marrow infarction or fat emboli and pulmonary infarction caused by in situ thrombosis. Hypoventilation and splinting due to local pain from rib and sternal infarction can cause atelectasis with hypoxemia and worsen intravascular sickling, increasing the risk of development of ACS. Pulmonary edema resulting from pulmonary vascular permeability caused by excessive hydration, blood transfusions or opiate use may also precipitate ACS. In practice, it may be difficult to distinguish between these conditions in the patient who presents with acute respiratory distress, and several abnormalities may be concurrent. The most common presenting symptoms of ACS are fever, non-productive cough, tachypnea, chest pain and shortness of breath. Arm and leg pain, abdominal pain and rib or sternal pain may also be present. Wheezing is less common but may also be present, especially if the patient has underlying hyperreactive airway disease. Physical exam of the chest may reveal local palpable tenderness of the ribs or sternum and auscultation findings consistent with pulmonary consolidation. Lab findings include leukocytosis, thrombocytopenia or thrombocytosis, anemia, elevated LDH and elevated total and conjugated bilirubin levels. One third of CXRs are normal at admission. Most patients develop lower lobe infiltrates, sometimes bilateral. Pleural effusions are also common, occurring in up to 35% of cases. Worsening infiltrates and hypoxemia (paO2 < 70 mmHg) with widened A-a gradient may be present and suggest impending respiratory failure and possible multi-organ dysfunction. Identify and treat all underlying factors precipitating acute illness. Correct hypoxemia with supplemental oxygen: goal PaO2 > 70 mmHg. Empiric antibiotics: Initiate broad-spectrum antibiotics to treat possible underlying infection Transfusion therapy: Consider simple or exchange transfusion to lower sickled hemoglobin and improve blood oxygen content. Consult hematologist for exchange transfusion therapy. Pain control: Judicious use of opioid and non-narcotic analgesics Bronchodilators: Consider their use in patients with history of asthma or hyperreactive airways. Standard therapy in patients requiring mechanical ventilation. Supportive care: Mainstay of treatment for all patients. Continuous pulse oximetry, cautious hydration, incentive spirometry or aggressive pulmonary toilet for patients requiring mechanical ventilation. Emergency management of a patient with SCD in acute respiratory failure is no different than any other patient presenting with acute respiratory distress. Immediate concern should be the “ABCs.” Establish IV access and institute continuous cardiac and pulse oximetry monitoring. Determine need for emergent airway management and ventilatory support. Search for any rapidly reversible causes (pneumothorax, cardiac tamponade, upper airway foreign body). Consider alternative etiologies for acute respiratory failure: acute coronary syndrome, acute heart failure, arrythmia, cardiac tamponade, PE, etc. ACS is a clinical diagnosis based on the presence of a new pulmonary infiltrate (not due to atelectasis and involving at least one complete lung segment), chest pain, fever, tachypnea, wheezing and cough in a patient with sickle cell disease. Patients with a previous history of ACS are at especially high risk of recurrent ACS. No laboratory or radiographic findings differentiate ACS from other pulmonary manifestations of SCD, such as pneumonia or infarction. Positive blood cultures in the presence of radiographic infiltrate should be treated as an infectious pneumonia until proven otherwise. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) may be helpful when pulmonary fat embolism is suspected as etiology of ACS. A BAL finding of >5% lipid-laden alveolar macrophages is consistent with a diagnosis of pulmonary fat embolism. Diagnosing pulmonary infarction due to thromboembolism in ACS is especially difficult. Typically, there is no evidence of DVT and ventilation-perfusion scans are abnormal at baseline. Furthermore, there is a high risk of promoting further sickling with the administration of IV contrast for more definitive diagnosis. There are multiple etiologies of ACS and identifying a specific cause may be difficult. Vichinsky and colleagues of the National Acute Chest Syndrome Study Group identified the frequency of possible causes of ACS in 538 patients with 671 episodes of ACS across 30 centers (Table I). The differential diagnosis is narrow in a patient with SCD who presents with clinical signs and symptoms consistent with ACS. The diagnostic challenge is to identify a precipitating etiology for ACS, such as infection, infarction or thromboembolism. There are no specific tests to confirm diagnosis of ACS. ACS is a clinical diagnosis based on the presence of a new pulmonary infiltrate (not due to atelectasis and involving at least one complete lung segment), chest pain, fever, tachypnea, wheezing and cough in a patient with sickle cell disease. Additional laboratory and radiographic findings listed above support the diagnosis. Identify and treat all underlying factors precipitating acute illness. Supplemental oxygen — Correct hypoxemia to prevent further sickling. Obtain ABGs as needed: Goal paO2 > 70-100 mmHg. Pulse oximetry may correlate poorly with arterial oxygen tension due to peripheral vasoconstriction and sickling. Empiric Antibiotics — initiate broad-spectrum antibiotics (2nd- or 3rd-generation cephalosporin, add a macrolide) to treat possible underlying infection. Bronchodilators — May be used in patients with wheezing, severe respiratory compromise, clinical or radiographic evidence of hyperinflation or a prior history of asthma or obstructive airways disease. For patients requiring mechanical ventilation, hyperreactive airways may predispose to development of bronchospasm, autoPEEP and dynamic hyperinflation. Bronchodilators may be useful in this setting. Transfusion Therapy – Simple and exchange transfusion may be required to lower fraction of sickled hemoglobin (Hb S < 30%) and to improve oxygen-carrying capacity of blood (goal Hg <10 g/dL and HCT 30). Simple transfusion is indicated in patients with single lobe involvement, mild hypoxemia responsive to low-flow oxygen, worsening anemia and moderate to severe ACS with Hg < 5 g/dL. Exchange transfusion is indicated in patients with multi-lobar infiltrates, refractory hypoxemia, PaO2/FiO2 ratio < 300, rapidly progressive lung involvement or signs of multi-organ involvement including cardiac and neurologic abnormalities. Consult a hematologist if considering an exchange transfusion (a large-bore catheter will be required to perform exchange). IV Fluids – Volume depletion may contribute to and worsen intravascular sickling. Hydration is standard therapy in the management of VOC and ACS; however, aggressive hydration with hypotonic fluids in combination with opioid analgesics may predispose to pulmonary edema. Frequent re-assessment of volume status is required with the goal of achieving a euvolemic state. Maintain euvolemia with D5W or D51/4NS. Pain Control – Judicious use of narcotic analgesics is required to avoid respiratory depression. NSAIDs and acetaminophen should be used to supplement analgesia and as opioid-sparing agents when possible. Supportive Care – Close pulmonary monitoring with continuous pulse oximetry and incentive spirometry are suggested. For patients requiring mechanical ventilation, adequate pulmonary toilet with aggressive suctioning, HOB >30 degrees and chest PT as needed. Hydroxyurea – Reduces sickling by increasing fetal hemoglobin and decreasing relative concentration of Hb S in erythrocytes. Significantly reduces the incidence of ACS, hospitalizations and need for transfusions. This is a well tolerated medication with minimal side effects and has a proven mortality benefit in patients with SCD. There is no evidence supporting its use in the acute setting and this medication should already be part of the outpatient medical regimen, especially in those with severe disease or previous history of ACS. (Use of narcotic and non-narcotic, i.e., opioid-sparing agent, is suggested to promote comfort, pulmonary toilet, incentive spirometry and sedation). Codeine 15-60 mg PO/IV/IM/SC q 4-6 hours (do not exceed 120 mg/d) Acetaminophen 325-650mg PO q4-6 hours (do not exceed 4 gm/day) Oxycodone and acetaminophen (Percocet, Roxicet) 1 tablet PO q4-6 hrs as needed Morphine 2-5 mg IV q 10-30 minutes titrated to pain control (Cover S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Chlamydia pneumoniae. A second- or third-generation cephalosporin in combination with macrolide is suggested.) Cefuroxime 250-500 mg po q12 hours or 750-1500 mg IV/IM q8 hours Simple transfusion of leukocyte-depleted red cells that are negative for sickle cells has been shown to improve oxygenation and decrease new red cell antibody formation. However, simple transfusion may excessively increase hematocrit and blood viscosity, exacerbating vaso-occlusion. Do not raise Hg above 10 g/dL. Consider exchange transfusion in the setting of progressive infiltrates and hypoxemia. Reduction of HbS level to <30% and HCT ~25-30 leads to improvement in majority of cases. Consult hematologist when exchange transfusion is required. Consider in patients not responding to initial therapy. May be used as diagnostic test or therapeutic intervention to clear airway secretions. In pediatric patients, a short course of corticosteroids may reduce the need for blood transfusion and the hospital LOS. However, corticosteriod therapy during VOC is associated with increased rebound attacks. Considered experimental therapy in the management of ACS in refractory cases; no data support routine use in adult patients. May act in part by decreasing sickle cell adhesion to pulmonary endothelium, an effect that may be mediated by down-regulation of VCAM-1 expression in pulmonary endothelial cells exposed to hypoxia. In anecdotal reports, inhaled NO has been effective in patients with severe ACS and clinical trials are ongoing. Inhaled NO is approved for the treatment of neonatal pulmonary hypertension only. Currently not standard of care for management of severe ACS in adults. Should only be considered in the setting of a clinical trial. Among patients with SCD, fat embolism and infection, especially community-acquired pneumonia, commonly precipitates ACS. Older (non-pediatric) patients and those presenting with neurologic signs and symptoms often progress to respiratory failure. With transfusion and bronchodilator therapy, oxygenation improves and with aggressive treatment, most patients with respiratory failure are expected to recover. Other diagnoses to consider when treating acutely ill patients with SCD include pneumonia, fat and bone marrow embolism and venous thromboembolism. Difficult to differentiate isolated infectious pneumonia from ACS since blood and sputum cultures may often be nondiagnostic. Patients with SCD are predisposed to develop pneumonia due to impaired host defense, loss of antibody protection in the setting of auto-splenectomy, altered phagocytic function and defective opsonization. Thus, infection with encapsulated organisms, such as Strep pneumococcus, H. influenzae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Chlamydia pneumoniae, are frequently associated with development of ACS. Bone marrow infarction resulting from microvascular occlusion leads to fat and bone marrow embolism in patients with SCD. Patients frequently have mental status changes, thrombocytopenia, declining HCT and severe hypoxemia. Bronchoscopy with BAL may be helpful to assess fat content in pulmonary macrophages, although it is not diagnostic and is rarely performed. Management generally involves exchange transfusion. Pulmonary infarction in patients with SCD is likely due to microvascular occlusion and subsequent in-situ thrombosis. Patients with HbSC have increased incidence of thrombosis compared with those with HbSS due to increased blood viscosity and hematocrit. Evaluation of potential venous thromboembolism in patients with SCD is similar to evaluation in patients without SCD; however, baseline abnormalities render interpretation of V/Q scans difficult. Administration of hypertonic contrast during pulmonary angiography may also precipitate intravascular sickling. Newer contrast media and high index of suspicion is required to evaluate patients for VTE. Prophylactic anticoagulation is not recommended because of the increased risk of renal and intracranial hemorrhage in patients with HbSS and should only be used when VTE is documented. All patients with SCD and history of ACS should be followed closely by a hematologist in the outpatient setting. Chronic management is aimed at preventing recurrent episodes in patients with history of ACS. Recurrent episodes increase the risk of developing sickle cell chronic lung disease. Sickle cell disease includes a group of hemoglobinopathies resulting from a single amino acid substitution in the beta globin chain. Substitution of valine for glutamic acid at the sixth position in the beta globin chain results in Hb S. A hemoglobin tetramer forms with the folding of two alpha and two beta globin chains; however, it is poorly soluble when deoxygenated. Deoxygenated tetramers polymerize into long sheets of fibers that distort the shape of the red cell and significantly decrease the native deformability of red cells. Vaso-occlusive crises and hemolysis are the clinical hallmarks of HbSS. The polymerization of deoxygenated Hb S is the primary pathophysiologic event causing vaso-occlusive complications. In addition, changes in red cell membrane structure and function, deregulated control of intracellular volume, increased “stickiness” or adherence to vascular endothelium are other mechanisms for vaso-occlusion. The pathogenesis of parenchymal lung infiltrates in ACS is not well understood but can be viewed as a specific form of acute lung injury that progresses to the acute respiratory distress syndrome. Pulmonary infiltrates likely result from multiple processes including atelectasis, infection, fat embolism, thromboembolism and, most commonly, infarction from in situ thrombosis due to intravascular sickling and microvascular occlusion. In addition to Hb S polymerization and red cell sickling, increased expression of adhesion molecules on sickled red cells and pulmonary endothelium, release of inflammatory mediators, interaction of sickled red cells with leukocytes, microvascular thrombosis and endothelial damage may all contribute to microvascular occlusion and tissue infarction. Hypoxia-induced adhesion of sickled red cells to the pulmonary endothelium is mediated by several inflammatory factors (endothelial cell vascular cell adhesion molecule 1, endothelin-1, cell-free hemoglobin and nitric oxide metabolites). In addition, free radical byproducts (F2 isoprostanes) from lipid peroxidation and catabolism have been found in ACS, suggesting that increased oxidative stress may also have a pathogenetic role in the development of ACS. An overview of the presumed pathophysiology of sickle acute lung injury is shown in Figure 1. One in every 650 African Americans is born with SCD and approximately 8% are heterozygous for the sickle cell gene. With an official US Census Bureau estimate of over 35.5 million African Americans in the year 2000, this represents approximately 50,000 patients living with sickle cell anemia. There is an increasing number of adult patients with sickle cell disease, and approximately 35% of the African American population is between the ages of 30 and 54 years. In addition to population growth, however, mortality rates for children with sickle cell anemia have declined markedly due to penicillin prophylaxis, H. influenzae and S. pneumoniae vaccination, improved screening programs for early detection and parental education. The median age of death is now estimated at 42 years for men and 48 years for women. Homozygous variant sickle cell anemia (HbSS) is the most frequently occurring form of sickle cell disease associated with clinical hallmarks of vaso-occlusion and hemolysis. Heterozygous sickle cell trait (HbSC) and sickle hemoglobin-beta thalassemia occur less frequently and are associated with less severe clinical manifestations. Organ dysfunction, including ACS and pulmonary infarction, and sudden death are rare in patients with sickle cell trait except in cases associated with severe dehydration. Pulmonary complications account for a large proportion of illness and death among adults with sickle cell anemia. HbSS genotype carries the highest likelihood for the development of ACS, with an overall incidence of 12.83 patients per 100 patient years. ACS is the second most common cause of hospitalization in patients with SCD and accounts for up to 25% of deaths. In the Cooperative Study of Sickle Cell Disease, 29% of 3,751 patients experienced at least one episode of ACS. Recurrent episodes of ACS are common in patients with at least one prior episode of ACS and are associated with a higher likelihood of developing chronic lung disease and early death. The National Acute Chest Syndrome Study Group identified 538 patients with 671 episodes of ACS. The following outcomes were observed: Nearly half of the patients were initially admitted for another reason, usually pain crisis. When ACS was diagnosed, patients had hypoxia, anemia and progressive multi-lobar pneumonia. Patients 20 years of age or older had more severe courses than their pediatric counterparts. Neurologic events occurred in 11% of patients and nearly half of these patients experienced respiratory failure. Phenotypically matched blood transfusion improved oxygenation, with a 1% rate of alloimmunization. 20% of patients treated with bronchodilators demonstrated clinical improvement. 81% of patients requiring mechanical ventilation recovered. 3% of patients died, and the most common cause of death was pulmonary emboli or infectious bronchopneumonia. Infection was a contributing factor in 56% of all deaths. A specific cause of ACS was identified in 38% of all episodes and 70% of episodes with complete data. Pulmonary fat embolism and 27 different infections were found among the specific causes. Special considerations for nursing and allied health professionals. Vichinsky, E. P., Styles, L.

Veterans at Risk: The Health Effects of Mustard Gas and Lewisite. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/2058. Examination of the Effects of Certain Acute Environmental Exposures on Future Respiratory Health Consequences I have been asked to address two primary issues: Can human exposures to nitrogen mustard gases over relatively brief intervals eventually lead to chronic nonmalignant pulmonary effects? Can such effects be of a degree sufficiently severe to disable them? In both clinical and public health terms these issues can be restructured as follows: 1) Does the occurrence of an acute pulmonary reaction identify an individual at risk for long-term respiratory sequelae? 2) If so, can the probability or degree of damage be predicted from the magnitude of the acute response? 3) What assurance is there that the absence of an acute pulmonary reaction identifies individuals who will not develop long-term sequelae? To begin, it is recognized that little structured study of the mustards has occurred among human populations acutely overexposed. Without attempting to estimate the relative importance of the different respiratory conditions or to estimate the dose levels necessary to cause each, a variety of conditions have been noted. Low dose inhalation exposure of mustard gas has been noted to result in chest tightness while higher doses have resulted in sneezing, lacrimation, rhinorrhea, nasal bleeding, sore throat, hoarseness and cough. The WHO has reported the pulmonary effects in Iranian patients exposed during the Iran-Iraq war., Acute effects included: (2-4 hrs) chest tightness, sneezing, lacri- University of Massachusetts at Lowell.

Examination of the Effects of Certain Acute Environmental Exposures on Future Respiratory Health Consequences."" Institute of Medicine. 1993. Veterans at Risk: The Health Effects of Mustard Gas and Lewisite. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/2058. mation, rhinorrhea, epistaxis, hacking cough; (4-16 hrs) sinus pain, severe epistaxis; (16-24 hrs) severe cough; (24-48 hrs) severe dyspnea, pulmonary edema; (48-72 hrs) bronchopneumonia. Delayed effects measured after two years included: chronic bronchitis, asthma, rhinopharyngitis, tracheobronchitis, laryngitis, recurrent pneumonia and bronchiectasis. In summary, then, overexposure to nitrogen mustards has caused both airway reactions and parenchymal damage with increased risk of pulmonary infection. Since the respiratory conditions described in instances of severe overexposure to nitrogen mustards have been both acute and chronic, there is evidence that some level of exposure to these agents can cause both severe acute and chronic respiratory disease. However, there is little evidence available on the effects of lower level acute exposure and none apparently on brief exposures which are not too excessive. In the absence of follow-up studies that directly address the question, much of the exploration must involve examining indirect evidence from the study of compounds which might behave similarly. In order to evaluate the respiratory health risk associated with repeated brief overexposures at lower levels, review of indirect evidence will focus on examining the link between acute and chronic respiratory responses to such agents. One central difficulty in examining this question is the absence of knowledge about the early stages of environmentally related pulmonary diseases coupled with almost no knowledge on the natural (longitudinal) evolution of the clinical conditions. Thus there is little to guide us in what is the appropriate disease model and what pattern(s) of exposure are relevant to disease etiology. REVIEW OF AGENTS CAUSING ACUTE AND CHRONIC RESPIRATORY EFFECTS The following agents have been selected to illustrate the range of exposure-effect relationships that may be relevant to the effects of the mustards. It will be noted that the agents selected have been shown to result in (to cause) a mix of respiratory conditions: Exposures to irritant gases (chlorine, SO, combustion products); exposures to materials of plant origin (cotton); exposures to chemicals (isocyanates); and exposures to inorganic dusts (silica, beryllium, asbestos). Since chlorine gas is such an irritating substance, there are a number of reports of overexposures with documented acute respiratory effects. ""J. Examination of the Effects of Certain Acute Environmental Exposures on Future Respiratory Health Consequences."" Institute of Medicine. 1993. Veterans at Risk: The Health Effects of Mustard Gas and Lewisite. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/2058. These provide clear evidence of severe acute respiratory damage with intensity commensurate with the exposure level and duration. Several investigators have attempted to follow subjects who have experienced acute symptomatic effects to determine whether these either persist or progress. To date, most of the reports of accidental overexposures suggest that individuals return to normal. A few reports have documented persistent obstructive or restrictive effects in follow-up of 1, 3 and 12 years. In one case report a previously healthy individual suffered onset of irreversible and debilitating asthma following a single overexposure. In all instances there has been an absence of pre-accident health assessments so whatever residual effects are present at from 6 months to 13 years later cannot be attributed to the acute accidental exposure alone. In contrast to these studies of single acute overexposure episodes, there are two populations of workers occupationally exposed to chlorine gas where the importance of accidental gassings has been evaluated. In a cross-sectional study of chlorine gas plant workers, 55 of 139 were reported to have experienced accidental overexposures against a background of less than 1 ppm. Of those overexposed, only three showed significant impairment which might only represent statistical variability in the population. Overall there was, however, evidence of persistent minor airflow abnormalities. In a more detailed study of pulpmill workers, evidence of an effect of gassings was presented. Although several irritant gases were present in the pulpmill, chlorine was the dominant irritant exposure. Overall the pulpmill workers had more symptoms but no pulmonary function differences compared to a control working population. However, those with gassings had all the excess of symptoms and had more airflow obstruction compared with the other pulpmill workers. Evidence of healthy worker selection was also noted as likely to have decreased the strength of the findings. This population had been studied seven years previously by the same investigators. Those workers who had experienced chlorine gassings once or twice during the study interval were compared to the remainder. For those whose gassing resulted in their seeking first-aid assistance at the time, there was evidence that respiratory symptoms and airflow obstruction had progressed when 1988 measures were compared to ones taken in 1981. These effects were present after controlling for cigarette smoking. In summary, there is clear evidence of acute respiratory effects from chlorine exposures which include both acute bronchitis and airway obstruction as well as inflammatory bronchoconstriction (RADS). There is also evidence for a chronic effect from exposure to chlorine. The relationship of acute respiratory effects to chronic ones is also present, ""J. Examination of the Effects of Certain Acute Environmental Exposures on Future Respiratory Health Consequences."" Institute of Medicine. 1993. Veterans at Risk: The Health Effects of Mustard Gas and Lewisite. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/2058. although the evidence is less clear in the absence of continued very low level exposure to chlorine gas independent of the overexposure. In at least one case a single exposure in a previously asymptomatic individual resulted in a debilitating chronic condition. There are no studies that followed individuals acutely overexposed but not acutely symptomatic to determine whether chronic effects were likely to develop. Sulfur dioxide is an agent with irritant potential equal to that of chlorine. Both agents are moderately soluble in water, are likely to result in inflammatory bronchoconstriction with the amount of upper respiratory tract irritation dependent on exposure level. Sulfur dioxide also shows clear evidence of acute respiratory effects related to short exposures. These include evidence of bronchial constriction and chest tightness. Studies of chronic respiratory effects associated with sulfur dioxide exposures have yielded mixed results. However, those which included individual assessment or assignment of SO exposure have demonstrated accelerated loss of pulmonary function overall as well as among those with poorer baseline function. There are, however, some important differences between the two irritants when considering the impact of acute overexposures. As with chlorine, the primary respiratory response seen as a result of accidental overexposure is obstructive and includes both pulmonary function and symptoms of productive cough, wheeze and chest tightness. However, whereas those who experience single accidental exposures to chlorine generally recover most of their pulmonary function losses, those similarly overexposed to sulfur dioxide almost always do not. In three studies where acute overexposed subjects were followed for 4 months to 4 years all but one showed evidence of functional abnormality (predominantly obstructive in nature). In summary then, there is clear evidence that sulfur dioxide can cause acute respiratory effects and it is likely that lower level exposures over time result in chronic obstructive abnormalities. Single overexposure episodes which produce acute respiratory symptoms appear to cause irreversible damage. No follow-up studies of those acutely overexposed but not symptomatic have been reported. A variety of reports have been published where single accidents or episodes have resulted in overexposure to many different irritant ""J. Examination of the Effects of Certain Acute Environmental Exposures on Future Respiratory Health Consequences."" Institute of Medicine. 1993. Veterans at Risk: The Health Effects of Mustard Gas and Lewisite. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/2058. agents. In several of these there has been an attempt to follow-up those who were adversely affected in order to determine the persistence of any immediate abnormalities. Prominent among these has been the examination of firefighters who have been acutely exposed to a variety of combustion products. As might be expected, in a number of the reports only transient pulmonary function changes have occurred. In cases where fires involved polyvinyl chloride, isocyanates or ''plastics"" there was evidence of persistent effects ranging from increased symptoms to progressive fatal asthma. A follow-up of survivors of a subway fire suggested persistence of small airway damage and respiratory symptoms at six months and two years. In 1985 Brooks, et al., described the clinical condition of reactive airways dysfunction syndrome (RADS). The condition is asthma-like but differs from occupational asthma because of an absence of a preceding period for sensitization to occur and the onset of illness after a single overexposure. A single exposure to a glacial acetic acid spill was carefully studied and the relative odds of developing RADS was estimated to be as large as 10 for the highest exposure group. Although no general estimate is available of the probability that RADS will follow from a single high irritant exposure, the number of agents which have been reported is quite varied and includes uranium hexafluoride, hydrazine, heated acids, perchlorethylene and toluene diisocyanate. The severe disability associated with some of these episodes is disturbing. In summary, a number of specific agents as well as poorly described irritant exposures have been shown to cause long-term disability and even death after a single severe overexposure. The suggestion is that any severe exposure to a wide variety of respiratory irritants has a reasonable likelihood of producing serious long-term effects on the respiratory system. The exposure circumstances described in this section did not lead to evaluation of asymptomatic exposed individuals. Therefore, the effects of exposures high enough to cause disability in those who were symptomatic do not directly address the question of chronic effects in the absence of acute illness. In 1956, Schilling published a summary of descriptive studies which elegantly characterized the persisting risk of disease among cotton textile workers. It was Schilling who also was responsible for the development of the symptom score which still best describes the acute symptom complex—ranging from occasional Monday morning chest ""J. Examination of the Effects of Certain Acute Environmental Exposures on Future Respiratory Health Consequences."" Institute of Medicine. 1993. Veterans at Risk: The Health Effects of Mustard Gas and Lewisite. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/2058. tightness to chest tightness persisting throughout the workweek but remitting over a weekend. Ample evidence exists to show  the relationship of acute chest tightness, cough and dyspnea related to cotton dust exposure. The classic Monday morning chest tightness has been shown to be dose related and to increase with increasing duration of employment. Reports of prevalence of the syndrome have varied to levels as high as 50 percent. The relationship of these striking acute symptoms to pulmonary function changes has not been well established. Cotton textile workers do show dust-related cross-shift loss in pulmonary function but the relationship of this change to byssinosis has been variable. As suggested in a recent report on the effects of exposures to endotoxin in cotton dust among human volunteers, this problem may be resolved as better characterization of the actual agent evolves. In the few efforts to examine the persistence of the acute symptoms in affected workers, studies have shown remission in some of those still exposed and persistence among those who have been removed from exposure. To date there remains no consensus for the mechanism of the acute symptoms related to cotton dust exposures. Although the symptoms are similar to asthma for many of those affected, the dose-response relationship and the absence of clear evidence of immunogenesis have led this acute condition to be classified as a pharmacologic bronchoconstriction. The presence of a chronic effect of cotton dust on respiratory health has been debated for a number of years. There is, however, mounting evidence that such effects do occur. Early mortality studies31 which indicated excess respiratory deaths have not always been confirmed. However, the earlier studies were among more highly exposed workers and mortality analysis is generally a very imprecise measure of chronic respiratory disease. A number of studies, both cross-sectional and longitudinal, have examined the effect of cotton textile employment on pulmonary function. Many of the cross-sectional studies have shown lower function in cotton workers, but inconsistent findings have been reported for the relationship of the lower function to duration of employment and current dust exposures. One study did show a relationship to a dust index. The longitudinal studies have consistently shown greater loss of FEV1, among cotton textile workers. In only one of those with under three years follow-up was an association of function loss with duration noted. In the three with five or more years, despite methodologic flaws there was not only lower function in the cotton workers but ""J. Examination of the Effects of Certain Acute Environmental Exposures on Future Respiratory Health Consequences."" Institute of Medicine. 1993. Veterans at Risk: The Health Effects of Mustard Gas and Lewisite. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/2058. lower function in those who reported byssinosis. In the most recent one a relationship to job category and dose was described. Although there remains controversy over the presence of a chronic respiratory effect from cotton dust exposures, the mounting evidence appears to lead to the acceptance of such an effect. If the evidence reviewed is accepted then there is substantial support for a relationship of the acute respiratory syndrome to the various chronic effects. These include the accelerated loss of function among byssinotics, the increased prevalence of chronic bronchitis among byssinotics, and the recent identification of a relationship between cross-shift and five year change in FEV1 in Chinese cotton textile workers. In summary, exposure to cotton dust or components of the dust has been noted to cause 1) acute effects represented by both a disabling acute respiratory syndrome (byssinosis) and a cross-shift decrement in FEV, and 2) chronic effects represented by both accelerated annual decrements in FEV1 and chronic bronchitis. The acute syndrome does not necessarily remit on removal from exposure and there is a growing body of evidence to suggest a relationship between the acute effects and chronic airflow limitation. There is evidence that short-term exposures result in acute effects but none for whether such exposures, with or without an acute response, ultimately lead to chronic effects. These reactive chemical agents have been reported to cause a wide range of nonmalignant respiratory health effects although there are substantial differences in the proportion of the population at risk for each. In 1951, case reports of isocyanate-related pulmonary effects called attention to a new occupational asthma. Sensitization was reported to occur as early as after only one high exposure but onset could also be delayed for a number of years after first exposure. Unlike with high molecular weight agents which cause occupational asthma, however, further study of isocyanate asthma cases showed that measurable IgE and airway hyperreactivity was not invariably an essential feature. The course of isocyanate asthma includes the fact that as many as half of seriously affected workers who leave work do not recover. Although it was not initially expected, continued investigation of the effects of work exposure to isocyanates revealed evidence of a number of respiratory effects other than asthma which were important and a series of epidemiologic studies ensued. There is good evidence that high levels of exposure are associated with chemical bronchitis and, recently, with reactive airway dysfunction syndrome. Independent of asthma or acute response to serious overexposures, ""J. Examination of the Effects of Certain Acute Environmental Exposures on Future Respiratory Health Consequences."" Institute of Medicine. 1993. Veterans at Risk: The Health Effects of Mustard Gas and Lewisite. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/2058. there are well-documented acute and chronic non-specific airway effects from isocyanate exposures. Peters' studied workers exposed to very low levels of TDI. His work demonstrated significant change in FEV1 over the workshift. A three year prospective study of these same workers demonstrated the losses were not just acute; exposed workers experienced accelerated losses over three years and there appeared to be a correlation between the magnitude of cross-workshift change and the accelerated functional loss. My own work provided preliminary information on the relationship of acute and chronic losses to exposure level and that the effects persisted after controlling for cigarette smoking. Epidemiology studies have also provided a preliminary estimate of a no-effect level. Work by Weill and his colleagues, in a prospective study of a new plant confirmed the broad population dose-related effects of chronic TDI exposure while directly accounting for healthy worker selection. Their work raised the possibility that peak exposures might be important not only for asthma but for the non-asthma related chronic losses as well. These epidemiologic studies provided sufficient evidence that TDI was not a problem  for only a small population of sensitized workers, but that the agent was a risk for all TDI workers. Finally no epidemiologic studies have yet examined the importance of the case reports of hypersensitivity pneumonitis as an exposure consequence. As these are being reported with increasing frequency their relative importance as a risk from this chemical exposure is an important priority to determine. In summary, isocyanates (a series of small molecular weight chemical compounds) have been noted to cause 1) several acute conditions: chemical bronchitis, allergic bronchoconstriction (after short-term high exposures as well as following longer-term lower exposures), and to cause large dose-related cross-shift loss in FEV; and 2) chronic respiratory effects including accelerated loss in pulmonary function over several years (suggesting the development of chronic airway limitation) and irreversible asthma. There is also evidence that the acute effects are related to the chronic effects both as asthma that does not remit and as cross-shift loss which is related to the rate of subsequent annual loss. Finally, there is evidence that short-term exposures can cause acute responses that are irreversible and progressive, but there is no evidence, either way, as to whether short-term exposures without acute response result in irreversible respiratory effects. Beryllium exposures have been associated with both acute and chronic pulmonary disease. Both acute and chronic conditions have ""J. Examination of the Effects of Certain Acute Environmental Exposures on Future Respiratory Health Consequences."" Institute of Medicine. 1993. Veterans at Risk: The Health Effects of Mustard Gas and Lewisite. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/2058. been shown to be disabling. Relevant to the questions being considered here is that exposures in one instance as brief as one week and in several instances occurring for less than 10 weeks have resulted in disease certified for inclusion in the Beryllium Registry established at the Massachusetts General Hospital. Silica exposures are generally considered important only for chronic disease. There is, however, the condition of acute silicosis caused by relatively short-term high intensity exposures to very fine silica particulate. Exposures as brief as six months have been associated with acute silicosis. But even in the absence of such severe overexposures and acute clinical disease, there is evidence that even low level exposures not associated with clinical symptoms or chest X-ray abnormality can result in irreversible pathology. Asbestos exposures similarly are noted for causing chronic respiratory illness as well as cancer. Brief high exposures are not recognized to cause respiratory complaints. However, brief exposures (on average less than four years) have been associated with increased respiratory symptoms and decreased vital capacity. For an acute exposure (intense but over only a short interval) to have a causal association with subsequent respiratory disease conditions, must the exposure cause acute irreversible and progressive damage evidence by acute clinical illness or, at minimum, objective changes in lung parameters or severe subjective symptoms? For an acute exposure (intense but over only a short interval) to have a causal association with subsequent respiratory disease conditions, either the exposure must cause acute irreversible (and possibly progressive) damage with or without clinical evidence of the damage, or it must result in or lead to an alteration in individual risk factors which changes the impact of subsequent exposures (e.g., dust exposures, air pollution, cigarette smoking, other environmental agents, respiratory infections). This review of respiratory tract responses to a variety of different types of environmental agents has shown that a range of respiratory effects is possible in response to each of the different types of irritant ""J. Examination of the Effects of Certain Acute Environmental Exposures on Future Respiratory Health Consequences."" Institute of Medicine. 1993. Veterans at Risk: The Health Effects of Mustard Gas and Lewisite. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/2058. exposures. With the exception of effects limited to (non-productive cough, hoarseness), most of these may be grouped together as obstructive lung diseases, a term that includes several different clinical syndromes: (mucus hypersecretion); (characterized by mucus hypersecretion and chronic airflow limitation, largely irreversible); (defined in anatomical terms as an increase in the size of the distal airspaces and destruction of their walls); and a variety of airway reactivity conditions including (acute recurrent episodic reversible airflow limitation with specific airway hypersensitivity), (acquired airway hyperresponsiveness from nonimmunogenic irritant exposures characterized by reversible airflow obstruction and nonspecific airway hypersensitivity), and (reversible airflow limitation without evidence of a hypersensitive subgroup of the population of exposed). As with any set of clinical syndromes, there is a degree of overlap, and classification changes as understanding the underlying mechanism improves. Basically there are no good population data on this condition as in and of itself it is not considered to be a disabling (therefore relevant) condition. The British hypothesis suggests that chronic bronchitis and chronic airflow limitation (by implication, emphysema) are separate parallel disease processes affecting different parts of the respiratory tract. Both were related at least to cigarette smoking and asthma was unrelated to either. The Dutch hypothesis focuses on individual susceptibility, hyperreactive airways, as key in both conditions and independent of cigarette smoking. Follow-up study suggests both are correct. Smokers who develop chronic airflow limitation (a minority) have been shown to have increased airway reactivity while both air pollutants and cigarettes produced accelerated decline in pulmonary function independent of airway reactivity. Both chronic obstructive bronchitis and emphysema have been shown to be related independently to the irritant effects of inhaled airborne dust but not to each other. Similar results are seen in response to chronic exposures to irritant gases or vapors. As in the case of cigarettes, although dose-response relationships have generally been demonstrated to both the level and the intensity of exposure, not all ""J. Examination of the Effects of Certain Acute Environmental Exposures on Future Respiratory Health Consequences."" Institute of Medicine. 1993. Veterans at Risk: The Health Effects of Mustard Gas and Lewisite. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/2058. those exposed to what appear to be comparable levels are affected. This points to a role of individual susceptibility. In turn, the key factor which makes an individual susceptible may well be the capacity of his or her airways to become reactive to inhaled materials. Different patterns of asthmatic reactions have been noted in response to high and low molecular weight agents. The former (proteins, polysaccharides and peptides) produce specific IgE (sometimes IgG) antibodies, generally have a positive immediate skin test to extracts, and produce results in isolated immediate or biphasic (immediate and late) reactions, but generally do not show isolated late reactions. These appear not to differ in mechanism  from  asthma due to common allergens such as house dust. The latter, low molecular weight agents appear to be of two types. Some (e.g., the anhydrides or platinum salts) act as haptens and show asthma patterns similar to the high molecular weight agents. Others, best exemplified by the isocyanates, do not produce IgE in most responders. The asthma associated with isocyanates affects 5-10% of the exposed, and is associated predominantly with a late phase (isolated or part of a biphasic reaction) response to inhalation challenge studies. The asthma persists after removal in many and appears to affect atopic and non-atopic individuals equally. Immunologically active substances can cause occupational asthma in some exposed workers while exposure to nonimmunogenic substances (i.e., irritants) may cause reactive airway dysfunction (RADS) or irritant induced occupational asthma in a wider population. Asthma and airway hyperresponsiveness typically occur together although they are not synonymous, so irritant-induced asthma is not necessarily caused through an acquired airway hyperreactivity mechanism. Documentation of the mechanism, however, would be strongly suggestive. Hyperresponsiveness is an amplification of the normal physiologic response to irritant stimulation. It is a characteristic of asthma, but is not always associated with overt asthma or with respiratory symptoms. It can be an inherent characteristic of the person or an acquired one, and it can be either temporary or permanent. Distribution of hyperresponsiveness in population studies is skewed, possibly bimodal. It has been hypothesized that it may lead to, or may be a predisposing factor in, subsequent chronic obstructive lung disease. This is a candidate for ""J. Examination of the Effects of Certain Acute Environmental Exposures on Future Respiratory Health Consequences."" Institute of Medicine. 1993. Veterans at Risk: The Health Effects of Mustard Gas and Lewisite. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/2058. a biologically plausible mechanism for an acute irritant exposure resulting in a postponed but long-term effect which is chronic in nature. Although not without controversy, this type of environmentally induced asthma is similar to airway reactivity in response to pharmacologic agonists. In this regard, there is a common dose-response relationship with high enough exposures causing reactions in all exposed subjects. Since these reactions are not associated with eosinophilia or nonspecific bronchial hyperreactivity, some argue they should not be considered asthma. Regardless, the causative agents are clearly associated with airway reactions such as those represented by byssinosis and the related chronic effects of exposures to cotton dust (or endotoxin). In both the examination of chronic airflow limitation and the examination of allergic asthma, less effort has been spent on objective characterization of the environmental exposures and more on delineating host factors such as the sensitization status of the individual. The preceding review, however, suggests that many respiratory irritants and toxins affect broad portions of the population. Host factors certainly interact with these agents, but it should be recognized that the following commonly discussed individual risk factors or habits play a more variable role in the non-malignant respiratory diseases than is often recognized. There is little evidence to suggest that gender or race are important risk factors in differentiating the types of respiratory tract responses to the above agents. Age, similarly, is relatively unimportant except for those of increasing age having increasing probability of experiencing a wider variety of irritant exposure events. Atopic status appears to be a risk factor for asthma due to some of the high molecular weight agents but does not appear important for many if not all of the low molecular weight agents. The other respiratory conditions do not seem to be affected by atopic status. Although nonspecific bronchial reactivity is often noted in the majority of patients with occupational asthma, it is not known whether this is a result of the exposure or a predisposing factor. Studies in red cedar asthma suggest that the increased bronchial reactivity is reduced or returns to normal after exposure ceases, suggesting that the reactivity change is a result of the exposure. Similar conclusions might be drawn from a recent study comparing subjects responding to cotton dust (with both byssinotic and non-byssinotic symptoms) and asymptomatic workers, which showed nonspecific bronchial reactivity most prevalent among byssinotics ""J. Examination of the Effects of Certain Acute Environmental Exposures on Future Respiratory Health Consequences."" Institute of Medicine. 1993. Veterans at Risk: The Health Effects of Mustard Gas and Lewisite. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/2058. and least prevalent in the asymptomatic subjects. However, when reactivity was examined without respect to symptoms, cumulative cotton dust level was a significant predictor of reactivity. Kennedy recently addressed the question of whether nonspecific bronchial reactivity was an acquired or inherent feature of respiratory reactions in persons exposed to non-immunogenic irritant agents. She reluctantly concluded that the question remains unanswered, although there is growing evidence that acquired increased bronchial reactivity is of likely importance. Smoking (a personal habit rather than a host factor) is well described as a risk factor for chronic obstructive bronchitis and chronic airflow limitation (or emphysema). Agents that cause these conditions most probably result in effects which are additive to those of cigarette smoking. The fact that all smokers do not experience the same level of risk suggests that smoking, itself, must be interacting with some other host factor in regard to these respiratory outcomes. With respect to asthma, the role of smoking is quite unclear. One hypothesis suggests that increased membrane permeability of smokers allows greater penetration of antigens. However, smoking has not been associated with work-related symptoms among those exposed to such agents as detergent enzymes or colophony while it has been noted to be related instudies of workers exposed to phthalic anhydride and of soy bean workers. In contrast, in studies of those exposed to plicatic acid or to isocyanates, asthma was mostly noted in non-smokers. In this review a variety of materials toxic to the respiratory tract have been examined. The review was not designed to be comprehensive, yet, it was also not unduly selective. In making the selection, agents were included which are commonly considered primarily as acute respiratory irritants, those known to induce extrinsic asthma, those which are related to non-immunogenic bronchial hyperreactivity, those which are most often responsible for slowly developing chronic fibrosis or granulomatous disease, and one which is believed to cause pharmacologic bronchoconstriction. The chronic respiratory effects associated with each of the agents reviewed included several of the general types of chronic respiratory response rather than being limited to only one type of reaction. Now, as a final step in the evaluation of the agents reviewed, an attempt should be made to answer the original three general questions about pulmonary reactions. Does the occurrence of an acute pulmonary reaction identify an individual at risk for long-term respiratory sequelae? Ample evidence ""J. Examination of the Effects of Certain Acute Environmental Exposures on Future Respiratory Health Consequences."" Institute of Medicine. 1993. Veterans at Risk: The Health Effects of Mustard Gas and Lewisite. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/2058. has been provided for all of the agents reviewed that a significant portion of individuals who react acutely to short, high exposures (and even some to short, relatively low exposures) go on to develop a variety of long-term respiratory effects. The agents differ in the probability of long-term adverse outcomes, but none appear to be free of this risk. The literature reviewed does not allow identification of a minimum magnitude of acute response necessary in order for there to be long-term sequelae. If acute pulmonary reactions can identify individuals at risk for long-term sequelae, can the probability or degree of damage be predicted from  the magnitude of the acute response? The second question has generally not been studied. The fact that an association of dose is found with the acute as well as the chronic responses, provides support for the association, but not for a relationship between the of the acute response and the of the chronic response. Only in the case of the non-asthma-like isocyanate effects has the question been directly addressed. Here the acute cross-shift change in FEV has several times been significantly correlated with accelerated decrement in function. This association, however, is not invariant since the highly significant correlations were still under 0.5. Furthermore, the acute symptomatic response has not been a reliable predictor of accelerated functional losses. If the disease model invoked requires the acute exposure to cause acute irreversible damage one might propose that it is likely the magnitude of acute response would predict the magnitude of the chronic. However, if the model invoked is that the acute exposure resulted in or led to an alteration in individual risk factors, then it is quite likely that the magnitude of the acute and chronic responses would be unrelated. What assurance is there that the absence of an acute pulmonary reaction identifies individuals who will not develop long-term sequelae? This may be the most important question to ask and, unfortunately, the one for which no direct evidence could be found. The indirect evidence reported, however, would suggest that it would have to be an unusual disease model which would need to be invoked that could exclude the possible mechanism of change in individual risk factors so that the absence of an acute reaction would eliminate the possibility of a chronic effect related to the acute exposure. 1.

Recently, World War II veterans have come forward to claim compensation for health effects they say were caused by their participation in chemical warfare experiments. In response, the Veterans Administration asked the Institute of Medicine to study the issue. Based on a literature review and personal testimony from more than 250 affected veterans, this new volume discusses in detail the development and chemistry of mustard agents and Lewisite followed by interesting and informative discussions about these substances and their possible connection to a range of health problems, from cancer to reproductive disorders. The volume also offers an often chilling historical examination of the use of volunteers in chemical warfare experiments by the U.S. military—what the then-young soldiers were told prior to the experiments, how they were ""encouraged"" to remain in the program, and how they were treated afterward. This comprehensive and controversial book will be of importance to policymakers and legislators, military and civilian planners, officials at the Department of Veterans Affairs, military historians, and researchers. 3 History and Analysis of Mustard Agent and Lewisite Research Programs in the United States 6 Relationship of Mustard Agent and Lewisite Exposure to Carcinogenesis 7 Nonmalignant Respiratory Effects of Mustard Agents and Lewisite 9 Dermatological Effects of Mustard Agents and Lewisite 10 Other Physiological Effects of Mustard Agents and Lewisite 11 Relationship of Mustard Agent and Lewisite Exposure to Psychological Dysfunction A.

MANNING, M.D. Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center, Lebanon, New Hampshire A more recent article on acute respiratory distress syndrome is available. Abstract Abstract Acute respiratory distress syndrome is the clinical manifestation of severe, acute lung injury. It is characterized by the acute onset of diffuse, bilateral pulmonary infiltrates secondary to noncardiogenic pulmonary edema, refractory hypoxia, and decreased lung compliance. Acute respiratory distress syndrome occurs most frequently in the setting of sepsis, aspiration of gastric contents, trauma, or multiple transfusions. Its complex pathophysiology involves an inciting local or systemic event that initiates pulmonary endothelial and epithelial damage and subsequent increased permeability. Tachypnea, hypoxia, and respiratory alkalosis are typical early clinical manifestations, and they are usually followed by the appearance of diffuse pulmonary infiltrates and respiratory failure within 48 hours. Early identification and treatment of the underlying disorder, along with aggressive supportive care, are essential. Experimental therapies, including those using nitric oxide and surfactant, have not been shown to improve mortality in patients with ARDS, but new therapeutic approaches such as low-volume ventilation have been shown to decrease mortality. Many patients who survive ARDS have permanent, mild to moderate impairment of lung function. Quality of life after hospitalization with ARDS may be poorer than that in similar patients without ARDS. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is characterized by acute lung injury, noncardiogenic pulmonary edema, and severe hypoxia. A common condition with a complex pathophysiology, it frequently occurs in critically ill medical and surgical patients. Since ARDS was first described in 1967, great advances have been made in understanding its pathophysiology. Numerous previous trials of new pharmacologic and ventilatory modalities have failed to demonstrate improvement in mortality rates. However, recent trials using a new “lung protective” approach to mechanical ventilation resulted in significant reductions in mortality rates. Data from these studies represent an encouraging breakthrough in the management of ARDS. Many family physicians care for patients with ARDS, and many patients who survive ARDS receive their post-intensive care unit (ICU) treatment from family physicians. Therefore, a comprehensive understanding of this syndrome is essential. Abstract The most widely used definition of ARDS was published in an American-European Consensus Conference statement in 1994. It described ARDS as a syndrome of inflammation and increased permeability associated with a constellation of clinical, radiologic, and physiologic abnormalities unexplained by elevations in left atrial or pulmonary capillary pressure. Defining diagnostic criteria are outlined in . These criteria are easy to identify clinically and take into account the severity of lung injury. Patients with a partial pressure of arterial oxygen (Pao) to percentage of inspired oxygen (Fio) ratio of 300 or less are considered to have “acute lung injury,” whereas patients with more severe hypoxia (defined as a measured partial pressure of arterial oxygen over the fraction of inspired oxygen [Pao/Fio] ratio of less than 200) are classified as having ARDS. Pulmonary artery wedge pressure ≤ 18 mm Hg or absence of clinical evidence of left atrial hypertension Acute lung injury is present if Pao/Fio ratio is ≤ 300* Acute respiratory distress syndrome is present if Pao/Fio ratio ≤ 200 ARDS = acute respiratory distress syndrome; Pao = partial pressure of arterial oxygen; Fio = percentage of inspired oxygen. *—A normal person breathing room air (Fio = 0.21), whose Pao is approximately 100 mm Hg, would have a Pao/Fio ratio of approximately 500. Pulmonary artery wedge pressure ≤ 18 mm Hg or absence of clinical evidence of left atrial hypertension Acute lung injury is present if Pao/Fio ratio is ≤ 300* Acute respiratory distress syndrome is present if Pao/Fio ratio ≤ 200 ARDS = acute respiratory distress syndrome; Pao = partial pressure of arterial oxygen; Fio = percentage of inspired oxygen. *—A normal person breathing room air (Fio = 0.21), whose Pao is approximately 100 mm Hg, would have a Pao/Fio ratio of approximately 500. Abstract In 1972, a National Institutes of Health panel estimated the incidence of ARDS to be approximately 75 per 100,000 population per year. However, a general agreement now finds that this is an overestimation. In prospective studies, the incidence of ARDS has been reported to range from 1.5 to 8.3 cases per 100,000 population per year. These reports have been criticized for excluding patients with a Pao/Fio ratio greater than 150. Therefore, the incidence may be higher than these figures suggest. Clinical conditions associated with ARDS have been identified . These conditions are divided into two categories: those that cause direct lung injury and those that cause indirect lung injury by activating a systemic inflammatory response. Of the various risk factors, sepsis is associated with the highest risk of progression to ARDS. Aspiration of gastric contents, multiple trauma, multiple blood transfusions, diffuse pneumonia, and disseminated intravascular coagulation are also associated with a high risk of developing ARDS. Certain preexisting conditions, such as chronic lung disease and chronic alcoholism, significantly increase the risk of developing ARDS. ARDS appears to be more common in patients over 65 years of age in patient populations with similar risk factors. However, gender seems to have no effect on the likelihood of developing the syndrome.

Diffuse alveolar damage is divided into exudative and fibroproliferative phases. Although each phase has its own histologic characteristics, there is significant overlap between the two stages , which are clinically indistinguishable. The extent of fibrosis is highly variable among patients. It may be absent in some, while severe fibrosis with honeycombing may develop in others.

(hematoxylin and eosin, X 100) Abstract The exact sequence of events in ARDS is unknown. In response to direct lung injury or a systemic insult such as endotoxin, an increase in pulmonary or circulatory pro-inflammatory cytokines occurs. There may also be perturbations in the pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokine balance. Neutrophils activated by cytokines adhere to the pulmonary capillary endothelial surface and migrate into the interstitial and alveolar spaces. Activated neutrophils secrete cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukins, which increase the inflammatory response. Neutrophils also produce oxygen radicals and proteases that can injure the capillary endothelium and alveolar epithelium. Neutrophil arachidonic acid metabolites can cause alterations in pulmonary vascular auto-regulation and vascular permeability. Epithelial and endothelial damage, in turn, leads to increased permeability and the subsequent influx of protein-rich fluid into the alveolar space. In addition to these structural changes, there is evidence of impaired fibrinolysis in ARDS that leads to capillary thrombosis and microinfarction. However, the principal role of the neutrophil has been questioned. For example, ARDS can develop in neutropenic patients. A variety of inflammatory mediations are also produced by alveolar macrophages. Understanding of the fibroproliferative process is limited. Some patients achieve complete resolution of lung injury before progressing into the fibroproliferative stage, whereas others progress directly to develop fibrosis. The extent of fibrosis may be determined by the severity of the initial injury, ongoing or repetitious lung injury, toxic oxygen effects, and ventilator-associated lung injury. Abstract A progression of clinical findings is present in patients with ARDS. Tachypnea, tachycardia, and respiratory alkalosis usually develop within the first 12 to 24 hours after the inciting event and may precede the appearance of infiltrates on a chest radiograph. The inflammatory process and alveolar flooding lead to severe ventilation-perfusion mismatch and intrapulmonary shunt, which are manifested clinically as severe hypoxia with a decrease in the Pao/Fio ratio. Generally, a marked reduction in lung compliance occurs, which increases the work of breathing. The physiologic dead space increases in ARDS and, to maintain a normal or near-normal partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PCO), patients must increase their minute ventilation. The severe hypoxia, increased dead space, and decreased lung compliance all contribute to the development of respiratory failure. Most patients evolve diffuse alveolar infiltrates and progress to respiratory failure within 48 hours of the onset of symptoms. During the exudative phase, chest radiographs reveal a progression from diffuse interstitial infiltrates to diffuse, fluffy, alveolar opacities . Although ARDS cannot reliably be distinguished from cardiogenic pulmonary edema on radiologic grounds, patients with ARDS often lack cardiomegaly, pleural effusions, and vascular redistribution. Reticular opacities may ensue, suggesting the development of interstitial fibrosis. Anteroposterior chest radiograph of a 50-year-old patient with acute respiratory distress syndrome 12 hours after intubation. Bilateral, diffuse alveolar infiltrates are consistent with pulmonary edema. Note the absence of cardiomegaly and pleural effusions, which are often seen in patients with cardiogenic pulmonary edema.

Bilateral, diffuse alveolar infiltrates are consistent with pulmonary edema. Note the absence of cardiomegaly and pleural effusions, which are often seen in patients with cardiogenic pulmonary edema. Computed tomographic (CT) scans of the chest have led to increased understanding of the structural abnormalities occurring at different stages of ARDS. Bilateral alveolar opacities are seen during the acute phase of ARDS and are more pronounced in the dependent, posterior lung zones. The anterior lung fields are relatively spared, highlighting the heterogeneous distribution of inflammation in the lungs. CT scans can reveal marked improvement in the aeration of the dependent (posterior) lung regions with the application of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) . Bilateral reticular opacities, reduced lung volumes and, occasionally, large bullae are CT findings during the fibroproliferative stage. Four thoracic computed tomographic images at middle level of a supine patient with acute respiratory distress syndrome. Each image represents a different ventilation condition.

Abstract The general principles of nonventilatory supportive care are outlined in . A reported decline in mortality rate in patients with ARDS has been attributed to advances in supportive care. An expeditious search for the underlying cause of ARDS and aggressive early treatment are key components in mortality reduction. Identify early and aggressively treat underlying cause.Minimize potential complications such as nosocomial infections, gastrointestinal bleeding, and thromboembolism.Initiate appropriate nutrition.Maintain appropriate level of sedation to facilitate patient-ventilator synchrony and limit patient discomfort.Limit excessive and prolonged sedation and use of paralytic agents. Set initial tidal volume at 6 mL per kg (based on predicted body weight*).Aim to maintain P at < 30 mm Hg (may require subsequent adjustments of tidal volume).Ensure adequate oxygenation: Pao of 55 to 80 mm Hg or Spo2 of 88 to 95%.Ensure adequate carbon dioxide removal.Minimize oxygen toxicity by maintaining Fio at < 60%Ensure maximal recruitment of alveoli through appropriate levels of PEEP.

Fluid management is controversial. Results from two studies suggest that limiting fluid retention in patients with ARDS leads to less pulmonary edema and decreased mortality. However, most patients with ARDS die from multiple organ failure, and some investigators and clinicians have expressed concern that reducing intravascular volume may impair oxygen delivery to the tissues and increase the risk of developing multiple organ failure. Another component of supportive care is attempting to minimize the development of complications such as nosocomial infection, gastrointestinal bleeding, and thromboembolism. Stress ulcer prophylaxis is indicated in all patients with ARDS, although there is some debate about the preferred agent. The risk of nosocomial infection can be reduced with careful hand washing and the use of full-barrier precautions during the insertion of intravascular devices. Some form of deep venous thrombosis prophylaxis is indicated in most patients with ARDS. All patients with ARDS require nutritional support and, in most instances, enteral administration is preferable. A myriad of trials of experimental agents for the treatment of ARDS have been undertaken. A detailed review of the trials can be found in a recent American-European ARDS consensus statement. Inhaled nitric oxide, a pulmonary vasodilator, is distributed to regions of the lung that are best ventilated and, by increasing the blood flow to those regions, improves ventilation-perfusion matching. When given at concentrations of up to 20 parts per million, nitric oxide has been shown to improve oxygenation. However, two large randomized trials failed to show a significant reduction in the duration of mechanical ventilation or mortality. Corticosteroids and exogenous surfactant treatments have been evaluated because inflammation and alterations in surfactant function are features of ARDS. Methylprednisolone administered before the onset of ARDS or during its early course does not decrease mortality. However, results from a recent, small randomized trial showed significant improvement in mortality when corticosteroid therapy was initiated seven days after the diagnosis was made. Although these results are promising, they are not definitive. A larger randomized trial of methylprednisolone administered during the fibrosing stage of ARDS is currently underway. Administration of surfactant in neonates with infant respiratory distress syndrome has led to improved survival rates. In adults, however, use of surfactant did not improve oxygenation, lessen the duration of mechanical ventilation, or decrease mortality. Improved preparations and modes of administration via bronchoscopy are currently being investigated. In most patients with ARDS, sedation is necessary to facilitate patient-ventilator synchrony and reduce oxygen demand. Occasionally, neuromuscular blocking agents are required to provide effective ventilation but, given the short- and long-term effects of these agents, their use should be limited, and the depth of paralysis should be carefully monitored. The general principles of ventilatory management are outlined in . In the past, many clinicians delivered relatively large tidal volumes and hesitated to use PEEP in patients with ARDS. However, an increased understanding of ventilator-associated lung injury and the results of recent studies have cast doubt on that strategy. In the animal model, overdistention causes acute lung injury and may exacerbate preexisting acute lung injury. Similarly, the cyclic opening and closing of small airways and alveoli may cause injury because of “shear forces.” Given the heterogeneous distribution of lung injury in ARDS, the use of traditional tidal volumes of 10 to 15 mL per kg may overexpand the normal lung areas and cause further lung injury. Results from a recent, large, multicenter randomized trial have shown that, compared with a traditional approach to mechanical ventilation, a strategy aimed at delivering lower tidal volumes and limiting plateau pressure resulted in a 22 percent reduction in mortality(). A smaller study combining low tidal volume ventilation with high PEEP also showed decreased mortality. The use of higher levels of PEEP presumably prevents the end-tidal collapse of alveolar units, which in turn reduces repetitive opening and closing and stress-induced damage to alveoli. Other approaches, such as partial liquid ventilation and high-frequency oscillatory ventilation, have been promising. Prone positioning has been investigated. Placing patients in the prone position can lead to improvements in oxygenation, possibly by reducing edema and atelectasis in the posterior dependent lung zones, thereby improving ventilation-perfusion mismatch. Despite the reports of short-term improvement in oxygenation, a recent randomized, prospective trial failed to show a decrease in mortality with prone ventilation. Abstract In addition to the underlying disorders, morbidity and mortality associated with ARDS may be influenced by the many complications associated with management of the syndrome . Most patients who die from ARDS do so within the first two weeks following diagnosis. Those who survive often have a prolonged course in the ICU. Therefore, long-term supportive care, including tracheostomy, may be necessary.

A recent study comparing trauma and sepsis patients with and without ARDS found a significant reduction in physical function, general health, and mental health in the patients with ARDS. Therefore, ARDS may confer an additional burden of morbidity independent of other co-morbidities. Choose a single article, issue, or full-access subscription.

Pulmonology is related to intensive care medicine which is a branch of medicine that deals with diagnosis and management of life threatening condition such as organ support and invasive monitoring. is a device that contain a substance that enlarge bronchi and bronchioles, decreasing resistance in the respiratory airway and increasing airflow to the lungs to make breathing easier. Bronchodilator may be originated naturally within the body or they may be used for the treatment of breathing difficulties. They are useful in obstructive lung disease such as asthma and in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. is an emergency procedure that combines chest compressions often with artificial ventilation in an effort to manually preserve intact brain function and to restore spontaneous blood circulation and breathing in a person who is in cardiac arrest.  is a general term used to describe progressive lung diseases, which include emphysema, chronic bronchitis, refractory (non-reversible) asthma, and some forms of bronchiectasis. This disease is characterized by increasing breathlessness.   is an acute inflammatory lung trauma which promote to increase pulmonary vascular permeability, increased lung weight and loss of aerated lung tissue. ARDS triggered by various pathologies such as trauma, pneumonia and sepsis. Symptoms include shortness of breath, fast breathing and low oxygen level in the blood. an increase of blood pressure in pulmonary artery, pulmonary vein or pulmonary capillaries leading to shortness of breath, dizziness, fainting, leg swelling and other symptoms. Pulmonary hypertension can be of different types according to which tests are performed to confirm the presence of pulmonary hypertension. is also known as thoracic surgery involved surgical treatment inside the thorax (chest). Different types of cardiac surgery include open heart surgery, heart transplant, coronary artery bypass grafting, minimally invasive surgery etc. Cardiothoracic surgery used for increasing the blood flow through the blocked the artery resulting decreases the chest pain. caused by viruses and bacteria. Bronchitis causes inflammation of an upper respiratory tract infection by viral agents such as influenza, rubeola, rubella, pertussis, herpes simplex virus, rhinovirus, scarlet fever and typhoid fever, H influenzae and S pneumoniae. Bronchiolitis is a viral respiratory disease or inflammation of the bronchial tree and it is primarily caused by respiratory syncytial virus. Other viruses, including parainfluenza viruses, influenza viruses and adenoviruses (as well as occasionally M pneumoniae) are also known to cause bronchiolitis. is a chronic irreversible and ultimately fatal disease characterized by a progressive decline in lung function. The term pulmonary fibrosis means scarring of lung tissue that causes shortness of breath. is a type of sleep study which is used as a diagnostic tool in sleep medicine. The test used for polysomnography is called polysomnogram which is a tool that records the biophysiological changes during sleep in multidisciplinary manner. This test used for the people suffering from circardian rhythm any types of sleep disorder narcolepsy, idiopathic hypersomnia, and periodic limb movement disorder (PLMD), parasomnias, and sleep apnea. is a serious respiratory disease caused by smoking, people who suffer from emphysema have trouble exhaling air from their lung. Alveoli are damaged of a person who suffers from emphysema. It evolves slowly over the year. Over time inner walls alveoli (air sac) become weaken and get rupture. Thus creating larger air spaces instead of small ones resulting reduced surface area of the lungs, in turn, the amount of oxygen reaches to bloodstream become less. is a disease in which abnormal collections of inflammatory cells form granulomas. The disease usually begins in the lungs, skin, or lymph nodes. Less commonly affected are the eyes, liver, heart, and brain. Different organ may have different signs and symptoms. Symptoms like wheezing, cough, shortness of breath or chest pain occur when it affects the lungs. uses high-energy rays to treat disease. Radiotherapy used to treat cancer. It can be given both externally (high-energy x-rays at the affected area using a large machine and internally (radioactive material placed inside the body close to cancerous tissue). is an inflammatory infection in the lung that affects the air sac known as alveoli that are filled with pus or fluid making it difficult to breathe. Pneumonia is caused by numerous factors, such as environmental contaminants and autoimmune diseases, as well as infection. Pneumonia is usually caused by infection with viruses, bacteria or fungi and less commonly by other microorganisms. Signs and symptoms of pneumonia include fever, sweating, shortness of breath and chest pain. is a genetic disorder that affects the lungs, pancreas, liver, kidneys and intestine. Cystic fibrosis is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. It begins when both copies of the gene for the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein get mutated. Sign and symptoms include difficulty in breathing, coughing up mucus, fatty stool, clubbing of fingers and toes. The condition is diagnosed by a sweat test and genetic testing.

The measurement most often used to quantify body fat is the body mass index (BMI), a measurement of weight relative to body surface area. The BMI is easy to calculate (weight in kilograms divided by the height in meters squared), correlates with body fat in most people and has defined risk categories. The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) guidelines use patient BMI to guide the following labels: Morbid Obesity (also known as Extreme or Severe Obesity): 40 kg/mor greater The correlation between BMI and obesity is very good in most middle-aged adults but can be misleading in individuals engaged in weight training with increased muscle mass and in individuals with significant edema. The diagnosis of OSA is based upon the presence of symptoms of disturbed sleep as well as the frequency of respiratory events during sleep (ie, apneas, hypopneas, and respiratory effort related arousals) as measured by polysomnography or portable monitoring. In adults, OSA is confirmed if either of the two conditions exists: 1) There are 15 or more apneas, hypopneas, or respiratory effort-related arousals per hour of sleep (ie, an apnea hypopnea index or respiratory disturbance index ≥15 events per hour) in an asymptomatic patient. 75% or more of the apneas and hypopneas must be obstructive. 2) There are five or more obstructive apneas, obstructive hypopneas, or respiratory effort related arousals per hour of sleep (ie, an apnea hypopnea index or respiratory disturbance index ≥5 events per hour) in a patient with symptoms or signs of disturbed sleep. 75% or more of the apneas and hypopneas must be obstructive. Obesity hypoventilation syndrome (OHS) is defined as the combined presence of obesity and arterial hypercapnea (paCO > 45 mmHg) while awake, in the absence of other causes of hypoventilation. Diagnostic criteria for OHS include the following: 4) Polysomnography revealing sleep hypoventilation with nocturnal hypercapnia with or without obstructive apnea/hypopnea events Patients with OHS may have obstructive sleep apnea (OSA)/hypopnea syndrome with hypercapnia, sleep hypoventilation syndrome, or a combination of sleep-related breathing disorders. An ever-increasing percentage of people in developed countries are obese or overweight. Approximately one third of intensive care unit (ICU) patients are obese and nearly 7% have morbid obesity, frequencies that are predicted to increase as the prevalence of obesity in the general population rises. Understanding the challenges of obesity is quite relevant to the practicing intensivist. Overweight, obesity and extreme obesity are associated with all-cause mortality among the general population. Obesity is associated with multiple comorbid conditions including diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease, hypertension, and cancer. Likewise, physiologic derangements, including a proinflammatory state and insulin resistance, are associated with obesity. These factors, combined with physical limitations and pharmacokinetic alterations, complicate acute illness and may impede the implementation and efficacy of evidence-based interventions in the ICU. Although most studies looking at outcomes of mechanical ventilation in this obese group have found an increased ICU length of stay, a recent meta-analysis showed there is no difference in mortality between obese and nonobese ICU patients. For this reason, it is important that those caring for obese patients in the ICU are not unnecessarily pessimistic in their outlook, despite the known relationship between obesity and ill health. Compared with BMI-matched eucapnic obese persons, OHS patients have increased cardiovascular and respiratory morbidity, higher healthcare utilization, higher likelihood for hospitalization, and a significantly lower postdischarge survival rate. The usual examination can be quite limited in the obese patient. Markers of volume status (neck vein assessment, precordial impulse, distal pulses), chest radiographs, electrocardiograms, blood pressure measurements (appropriate cuff sizing), and even bedside ultrasound can all be limited. As a result, a healthy suspicion for respiratory failure, ventricular dysfunction, and pulmonary hypertension is warranted even in patients with nondescript symptoms such as lethargy. – bedside ultrasound (including estimates of ultrasound collapse point of jugular vein, limited view echocardiography, lung and pleural evaluations) – acute illness (ischemia, infection, or thrombosis) – respiratory depressant effects of alcohol, other sedatives, and opioid analgesia OHS may deteriorate secondary to a concurrent acute illness or to the use of aggravating substances (alcohol or sedatives), so that the patient develops acute hypercapneic respiratory failure (AHRF) with significant hypoxemia, uncompensated respiratory acidosis, mental status changes, and possible coma. Prior studies of OHS patients in ICUs have described at-risk patients as being middle-aged (mid-50s) and morbidly obese (BMI > 40) with daytime hypercapnia, hypoxemia, and acidemia (pH <7.30). Although OHS is more prevalent among OSA patients with higher apnea-hypopnea index (AHI), AHI is not a good predictor of which OHS patients are likely to develop AHRF. External examination should include investigation of the upper airway (apply Mallampati score), neck circumference, and BMI. – Auscultate over the neck for air entry and possible stridor. – Observe respiratory pattern, evaluating for paradoxical breathing, either persistent or periodic. – In the lethargic patient with poor air entry, consider jaw thrust. 3. Support breathing, implementing non-invasive ventilation (NIV) early. NIV is an established treatment for chronic conditions such as OHS and OSA and for acute exacerbations of obstructive pulmonary disease and cardiogenic pulmonary edema. Given the high prevalence of these conditions within the obese population, NIV may be utilized as a first-line therapy in the support of obese patients with respiratory failure. It confers unloading of the respiratory muscles, decreases atelectasis, and addresses sleep-disordered breathing while maintaining an interactive patient. Contraindications to NIV include decompensated shock, active myocardial ischemia or gastrointestinal hemorrhage, intolerance to the mask (claustrophobia or facial trauma), or the inability to adequately protect the airway. Given the additive increased risk of aspiration with obesity, airway reflexes must be carefully evaluated. For the patient experiencing obstructive events without fatigue, CPAP may be utilized. CPAP does not directly augment ventilation independent of maintaining upper airway patency. For most patients with acute respiratory insufficiency, BiPAP will likely be necessary. During BiPAP therapy, an inspiratory positive airway pressure (IPAP) and an expiratory positive airway pressure (EPAP) are independently set and titrated. Tidal volume correlates with the difference between the IPAP and the EPAP. Alveolar ventilation is enhanced by a larger tidal volume assuming that the respiratory rate is constant. Advantages of BiPAP compared to CPAP include a lower mean airway pressure (which may lead to better tolerance of therapy) and better rest of the ventilatory muscles. Most patients require a full face mask for support of acute distress. Nasal devices often yield pressure leak – distressed patients often open their mouth and maintaining mouth closure is difficult when applying higher (rescue) ventilatory pressures. 4. Optimize noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV). Mask leak may be the result of either poor mask fit or an inadequate EPAP/CPAP to splint open the upper airway. Once fit is established, the EPAP/CPAP should be uptitrated to ensure that the chest is rising and falling with inspiratory efforts. Titration of IPAP in BiPAP should be dictated by the adequacy of minute ventilation and carbon dioxide elimination. Patients may become less responsive after NIV, either the result of sleep (as they often present in a sleep-deprived state) or decompensated ventilatory failure. Surveillance of minute ventilation coupled with sequential blood gases or end-tidal carbon dioxide measurements will be necessary to delineate the two conditions. Absence of improvement in arterial blood gases within 2 hours should prompt invasive ventilation. This situation can frequently be complicated by severe hypoxemia and hemodynamic decompensation. To avoid derecruitment, continue noninvasive ventilation until the intubation sequence. Generate a preplanned strategy, including back-up plan. If non-emergent, seek help and carefully plan. Discuss merits of neuromuscular blocking agent (NMBA) There is only a modicum of difference in how the airway is approached between obese and non-obese patients. Studies focusing on obesity as a risk factor for airway problems have reported a wide range of risks. Obesity does not seem to be an independent risk factor for difficult intubation but is one of the several factors that need to be considered as part of an airway evaluation. However, when an obese patient cannot be intubated, maintaining an adequate airway is more likely to be challenging and may lead to a “cannot intubate, cannot ventilate” situation. Risk factors for difficult intubation include: Mallampati score, thyromental distance, cervical spine extension, interincisor distance, upper lip bite test, neck circumference, and BMI. None of these factors has a positive predictive value of greater than 50%, but all have a negative predictive value greater than 95%. If a patient tests positive for any risk factor, there may be a difficulty in intubation. The more risk factors, the more likely the patient is to have a difficult airway and intubation. Patients who test negative for all risk factors are unlikely to have a difficult airway and intubation. When encountering the airway of an obese patient, a high index of suspicion is sensible; the American Society of Anesthesiologists recommends that a preplanned strategy is put in place, including an equipment check and the preparation of a back-up plan. Other challenges contributing to difficult intubation sequences: Excess soft tissue around the neck and in the oropharynx can make mask ventilation difficult or impossible. When bag-mask ventilation is difficult, oxygenation, not intubation, is paramount and may require 3 hands for bag-mask ventilation and oral and nasopharyngeal airways. Adequate preoxygenation is vital and, despite this intervention, obese patients will desaturate more rapidly and recover from hypoxia more slowly than non-obese ones. Additionally, increased intra-abdominal pressure from abdominal adiposity increases the risk of regurgitation and aspiration. An increased neck size can make retrograde wire intubation and emergent surgical airways procedures difficult. Endotracheal tube with stylets, functioning suction, bag-valve device connected to an oxygen source, laryngoscope and blades, oral/nasal airways, and device to detect end-tidal carbon dioxide are essential. The use of adjunctive devices such as flexible bronchoscopes, supraglottic devices, and lightwands requires the acquisition and practice of a specific set of skills. Some individuals prefer using a short or stubby laryngoscope handle when dealing with obese patients. These individuals should also be proficient with at least one alternative method of airways management, such as flexible fiberoptic bronchoscopy, supraglottic devices (LMA, COBRA PLA, Engineered Medical Systems, IN, USA), lightwand, or video laryngosocopy. There are several types of rigid stylets as well as more invasive techniques, such as transtracheal jet ventilation, retrograde wire techniques, and emergent cricothyrotomy. Both the American Society of Anesthesiologists and the UK Difficult Airway Society suggest the laryngeal mask airway as their primary rescue in a “can’t intubate, can’t ventilate” scenario. If successful, some LMAs can then be used as a conduit for a fiberoptic bronchoscope. These masks should only be employed by operators experienced in their use, and there remains a risk of aspiration, large ventilatory leak, and laryngospasm with these devices. Preoxygenation with sitting may help. Positioning obese patients so that the ear is aligned with the sternal notch (the ramp postiion) seemed to facilitate tracheal intubation. Elevation of the upper body with pillows may also improve the view of the larynx and the ability to bag-mask ventilate if a paralyzed technique is used. Consider early central venous access and vasoactive drug availability (especially those to recruit the failing right heart–acute pulmonary resistance changes). Controversy regarding whether hypnotics or NMBA should be given: PRO: Paralysis improves mask ventilation and laryngoscopy. CON: Assisting patient’s respiratory efforts, but if paralyzed and failed intubation, the airway has to be maintained until the intubation completed or patient returns to spontaneous respiration. For patients with refractory hypoxia, ventilatory failure or postoperative respiratory dependence Low tidal volume ventilation (ie, 6cc/kg ideal body weight), a mainstay of treatment for acute lung injury (ALI) and acute respiratory distress syndrome, can be challenging to implement in this population. The landmark trial, performed by the acute respiratory distress syndrome network (ARDSnet), excluded patients who weighed more than 1kg/cm of height. This does not correlate simply with the BMI but is likely to have excluded many obese patients, especially morbidly obese ones. However, a secondary analysis of patients included in ARDSnet trials identified over 200 patients (BMI>30); similar outcome benefits of low tidal volumes were seen in this subgroup. To overcome the pulmonary effects of increased abdominal pressure and reduced respiratory system compliance, higher levels of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) and plateau pressure may be necessary to achieve adequate tidal volume and may not be injurious, as the transpulmonary pressure is not increased. The Lung Open Ventilation study used higher PEEP levels and a plateau pressure of up to 40cmHO with an outcome similar to patients ventilated with the ARDSNet protocol, but obese patients were also excluded. An elevated plateau pressure, reflecting the compliance of the respiratory system (including both lungs and chest wall), may better reflect the weight of the chest wall rather than the presence of alveolar overdistention. Some authors argue that obesity is protective in this manner. We advocate measurement of the plateau pressure in a semi-upright position, and permit some elevated values (ie, up to 35 to 40 cmHO) in the morbidly obese. Although beneficial to those patients with ALI, low tidal volumes are not proven beneficial in other etiologies of respiratory failure and can precipitate further atelectasis, further worsening oxygenation. The potential for development of intrinsic PEEP should always be considered and airflow limitation treated. Obese patients may have asthma, precipitated by low lung volumes and other triggers of airway hyperresponsiveness accompanying obesity. There are limited data regarding other modes of mechanical ventilation such as high-frequency oscillatory ventilation, but this mode provides the benefit of increased mean airway pressure and has been used safely in these patients. Mechanical ventilation in the prone position for severe respiratory failure in the obese poses a “Herculean” task for the ICU team, but it is possible and may be beneficial in refractory cases. An experimental study in eight mechanically ventilated pigs turned from supine to prone showed that oxygenation and pulmonary gas exchange improved significantly. The improvement was more pronounced in the presence of abdominal distention. Data from 10 obese patients without lung injury revealed that changing from supine to prone position during MV leads to improved pulmonary function, increased functional residual capacity (FRC), better lung compliance and oxygenation. There is only one case report on the use of prone position in a morbidly obese patient with ALI. It is important that the position is established by supporting the upper chest and pelvis without compression of the inferior vena cava or femoral veins. The abdomen must hang freely. A substantial number of patients may present with acute hypoxic respiratory failure and no prior diagnosis. If a diagnosis of OHS is suspected, treatment should be started immediately without waiting for confirmation by a sleep study. A sleep study can be performed once the patient’s condition is stable to confirm the diagnosis and to prescribe the appropriate PAP therapy. However, sleep studies in acute care areas have been described. Ventilatory management for respiratory failure should be lung protective and aim at early weaning. Unfortunately, most therapeutic options have not been formally evaluated in obese cohorts. Most ventilatory strategies studied in obesity are derived from studies in obese patients (without lung injury) undergoing bariatric surgery. The tidal volume for the obese patient has to be adjusted to the ideal body weight, not the measured body weight, to prevent the lung from harmful overdistention. This suggests that obese patients with respiratory failure can be ventilated according to the protocol of the ARDS Network study: Vt: 6mL/kg ideal body weight; plateau pressure less than 30cm HO; ventilation mode: assist control; respiratory rate 6 to 35/min (aim to keep pH: 7.3 to 7.45); and oxygenation goal paO 55 to 80mmHg or oxygen saturation 88% to 95%; PEEP: 5 to 24 as specified in the referenced “PEEP table.” It may be difficult to stay within the recommended plateau pressure limits. Overdistention of the lungs is limited by the large thoracic fat masses and the elevated intra-abdominal pressure that may act as a cuirass. Therefore, application of high plateau pressures may be less harmful in obese than in non-obese patients. Obese patients have a great potential for atelectasis. PEEP and lung recruiting ventilatory strategies can open atelectatic lung regions and prevent them from re-collapse. Pelosi et al measured lung volumes and mechanics in nine obese patients (BMI > 40) and nine non-obese patients postoperatively after abdominal surgery. A PEEP of 10 cmHO significantly improved respiratory mechanics and oxygenation in the obese but not in patients with normal weight. In morbidly obese patients, PEEP level up to 15cmHO may be indicated to prevent loss of ventilated lung volume and maintain a normal functional residual capacity. PEEP alone, however, may not always protect the lung from derecruitment. Reinius et al investigated 30 patients (BMI 45±4) undergoing gastric bypass surgery and documented that an intra-operative PEEP of 10 alone did not reduce atelectasis or improve oxygenation. A recruitment maneuver with 55cmHO for 10 seconds without PEEP also had no sustained effect. Only the recruitment maneuver followed by PEEP was effective. These results were confirmed by another group that demonstrated a vital capacity maneuver followed by PEEP 10 to effectively prevent lung atelelectasis and deterioration of oxygenation during and after bariatric surgery. For obese patients the best lung recruitment may be achieved with the vital capacity maneuver (inspiratory pressure of 40cmHO x 15 seconds) repeated every 10 minutes and combined with a PEEP level of 10cmHO. Hypercapneic Respiratory Failure in the Obese Patient Ventilatory Failure: Other conditions that may cause hypoventilation should be considered during patient evaluation. Identify mechanical limitations (kyphoscoliosis or chronic lung disease), neurologic conditions (neuropathies or diaphragm paralysis), central control problems (eg, hypothyroidism) leading to a different diagnosis. Weaning and Liberation from Mechanical Ventilation in the Obese Patient All efforts should be directed at avoiding atelectasis and hypoventilation. Treatment includes adequate analgesia while attempting to avoid oversedation, early mobilization, vigorous pulmonary toilet, and upright positioning. The importance of the simple maneuver of upright or reverse Trendelenburg positioning has been shown to improve respiratory system compliance, closing volume, and, most significantly, oxygenation. Some studies have noted increased ventilator days in obese ICU patients, while others have failed to find an association. However, many of the physiologic changes associated with obesity can affect weaning from mechanical ventilation. Increased blood volume, systolic or diastolic dysfunction, increased chest wall loading, decreased respiratory muscle endurance, elevated intra-abdominal pressure (IAP), upper airway narrowing, and potential alternation in central ventilatory drive may impair the ability to breathe spontaneously. Diminished level of arousal may play a greater role in obese patients, who already may have significant narrowing of the upper airway and low lung volumes. The use of an endotracheal tube may blunt the reflexes of the upper airway and sedation may diminish tone in pharyngeal dilator muscles. All of these features may result in upper airway obstruction after extubation. El Solh and colleagues compared extubation outcomes in 62 consecutive patients with a BMI 35 or higher who were treated immediately after extubation with NIV. Use of NIV was associated with a statistically significant 16% reduction in post-extubation respiratory failure. Rescue NIV given after the development of respiratory failure in the historical controls enabled a minority of these patients to avoid reintubation, with a resultant trend toward a decreased need for reintubation. Obese patients are at higher risk for prolonged weaning and chronic ventilator dependence, and the post-extubation course may be complicated by the presence of sleep apnea. Usual assessments demonstrate elevated PEEP needs, marginal oxygen saturations, and shallow breathing patterns. Clinicians should utilize upright positioning, sedation-sparing strategies, and post-extubation noninvasive ventilation to combat these obstacles. The rate of reintubation post-extubation in severely obese patients has been reported at 8% to 14% among patients undergoing mechanical ventilation for more than 48 hours. NIV has been considered a promising therapy to avert respiratory failure after weaning. One trial of patients had severely obese patients undergo NIV for the first 48 hours immediately post-extubation. NIV was administered using bilevel positive airway pressure mode (BiPAP) initially set at 12 and 4 in a spontaneous mode. Pressure settings increased gradually to the patient’s tolerance with the aim of achieving a respiratory rate (RR) less than 25 and saO greater than 90%. Compared with conventional therapy, the institution of NIV resulted in a 16% absolute risk reduction in the rate of respiratory failure. NIV after extubation may reduce the incidence of reintubation in the obese patient. Early tracheostomy may provide benefits in this patient group. The supine position is harmful for obese patients due to the elevation of IAP. This leads to a reduction in lung volume and consequently hypoxemia. Trendelenburg’s position in obese patients is more dangerous than the supine position. Reductions in PaO may be realized as a byproduct of increased venous return from the lower limbs to the pulmonary circulation, the vigorous pressure of visceral fat masses on the diaphragm with resultant decreases in FRC and generation of atelectasis. For application of central venous catheters, the obese patient should not be positioned in Trendelenburg’s position. If a patient must be placed head down, he or she should be endotracheally intubated and mechanically ventilated, and continuous monitoring is needed. Similarly, intrinsic PEEP has been measured in the flat, recumbent position. Turning into the lateral decubitus position reduced PEEPi (from 4.2 to 2.0). For optimal ventilation the best body positions include semi-erect, reverse Trendelenburg, and the lateral decubitus position because the impact of the panniculus on abdominal pressure and diaphragm function are reduced/minimized. Mechanical loading of the diaphragm by abdominal adipose tissue, viscera, and/or ascites can increase the work of breathing, reducing the likelihood of successful extubation of the patient with marginal respiratory status. Positioning may play a role in optimizing respiratory mechanics. Burns and colleagues showed the effect of reverse Trendelenburg posture on spontaneous breathing in 19 patients with abdominal distention related to obesity, ascites, or intestinal distention. They found that positioning patients in this posture at an angle of 45 degrees was superior to that seen with the head elevation of 45 degrees without Trendelenburg. This position is futher supported by observations in the OR during anesthesia induction. Patients in the reverse Tredelenburg position had the fastest recovery of gas exchange and longest safe apnea time. Intubation and MV with rescue plan and equipment available Check mechanics immediately after intubation, especially if NMBA employed. Treat for reversible airway obstruction if resistance elevated and reasonable clinical suspicion. Early assessment of hemodynamics including early central venous catheterization and echocardiography. Bicarbonate: An elevated serum bicarbonate level due to metabolic compensation of respiratory acidosis is typical in patients with OHS and confirms chronic nature of the hypercapnea. Phamacokinetics are hard to predict in the obese; increased volume of distribution, fat storage, and glomerular filtration rate, combined with alternations in plasma-binding proteins, preclude simple rules of drug dosing. Drugs with a narrow therapeutic window, such as digoxin and theophylline, may confer toxicity when dosed according to total body weight. Reference to published guidelines for individual drugs is recommended; however, one can categorize dosing regimens based on adherence to total body weight, adjusted body weight, ideal body weight, and those that require plasma level monitoring. Obese patients exhibit increased levels of free fatty acids and triglyceride-rich adipose tissues. In critical illness, obese patients cannot use these lipid-energy sources effectively. They catabolize relatively more protein, losing muscle mass, and utilize fat less than patients with normal weight. SCCM and the American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition published guidelines for nutrition support in obese, adult, critically ill patients. They recommend enteral nutrition with permissive underfeeding or hypocaloric feeding for this patient collective. For all patients with BMI > 30, enteral nutrition should not exceed 60% to 70% of target energy requirements or 11 to 14 kcal/kg actual body weight/day, with protein of greater than 2.0 g/kg ABW/day for BMI 30 to 40 and 2.5 g/kg or more ABW/day for BMI greater than 40. Contraindications to high-protein nutrition, such as renal failure and hepatic encephalopathy, must be taken into consideration. Hypocaloric feeding with reduced caloric load, but a high proportion of proteins, may limit hyperglycemia, improve insulin sensitivity, prevent hypercapnea, reduce fluid retention, attenuate hypertriglyceridemia, and minimize muscle catabolism. Weight reduction is a side effect but should never be the primary goal of nutrition during critical illness. Estimating the metabolic needs of the critically ill obese patient is difficult. Direct calculations using indirect calorimetry may be helpful. There is debate whether ideal body weight or actual weight should be used for metabolic formulas such as the Harris Benedict equation. Some investigators have advocated an obesity-adjusted weight with a 25% correction for excess weight above ideal weight: adjusted body weight = (actual weight – IBW) 0.25 + IBW. Congestive heart failure, systolic and diastolic dysfunction Worldwide, at least 1 billion people are overweight or obese, and more than 300 million are obese. The United States is experiencing an epidemic of overweight and obesity. The prevalence of excess weight is increasing rapidly across the country, and close to 65% of the adult population is either overweight or obese. In 2007-8, 32.2% of American men and 35.5% of American women were obese. During the same period, 4.2% of men and 7.3% of women met criteria for morbid obesity. Comparing the periods 1976-1980 with 1999-2000, the prevalence of overweight has increased by 40% and the prevalence of obesity has risen by 110%. In 2008, only one state, Colorado, had an obesity prevalence less than 20%. The magnitude of these numbers and frequent comorbid conditions of obesity guarantee the presence of such patients in the ICU. Global prognosis for the obese critically ill patient Given the association of being overweight or obese with increased all-cause mortality among the general population, one might expect obesity to be a bad prognostic factor for ICU outcomes. However, in critically ill patients, recent evidence suggests that obese and extremely obese patients do not have increased ICU or hospital lengths of stay, and may even have lower mortality rates than normal-weight patients. Other studies have found that obese and extremely obese patients may have longer ICU and hospital lengths of stay, duration of mechanical ventilation, and increased mortality. A recent meta-analysis reported that extremely obese patients had decreased hospital mortality compared with normal-weight patients, but this did not reach statistical significance (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.66-1.04). Additionally, a recent study reported that mortality in critically ill patients who have a BMI 35 or greater was improved among those who received adequate nutrition (energy and protein). Although many would expect obesity to be associated with poor ICU outcomes, current evidence fails to establish this association consistently. Studies have shown a negative or equivocal effect on outcomes, while several studies have even found obesity to be protective. A recent meta-analysis of 14 studies involving more than 15,000 obese patients in medical and surgical ICUs showed no significant difference in ICU mortality rate when compared with normal-weight patients. However, ICU length of stay and duration of mechanical ventilation were increased. In this study, a subgroup analysis of moderately obese patients (BMI > 30, < 40) found an increase in ICU survival rate among these obese patients compared with normal-weight patients (RR 0.86; CI 0.81-0.91, P < 0.001). Special considerations for nursing and allied health professionals. Maintaining skin integrity is problematic in obese patients. Skinfolds lead to accumulation of moisture, accelerating skin breakdown. Limited mobility, difficulty in nurse-assisted turning, decreased vascularity within adipose tissue, and excessive weight all contribute to pressure ulcer risk. Pressure ulcers that begin in skinfolds can go undetected during early stages unless all such regions are examined thoroughly during turning. The physical demands of turning can lead to suboptimal visualization. Turning the morbidly obese patient can present a risk for injury to the patient and staff but can be minimized with proper training, staffing, and equipment. Executing turns with clear roles for each participant can ensure that the details of examination and safety are not neglected in the physical stress of the task. Mobilization and rehabilitation in obese patients may require increased personnel and equipment. Up to four participants may be necessary for turns alone. Over-bed trapeze lifts and specialty beds that can shift to a chair egress mode to shift the burden of supporting weight to the patient may facilitate the gradual return of strength and mobility. Physical therapy staff experienced in the treatment of obese patient are pivotal to help the patient and staff so that transfers and weight bearing can occur safely.

It is the movement of air from the compressor/wall port through the tubing into the handheld apparatus that separates or divides the moisturizing agent or medication into the small particles inhaled. Sometimes oxygen is used instead of air based on an individuals oxygen need. To assess for effective operation of equipment, a visible mist must be present. Common medications are mucolytes (break up and thin mucus) and bronchodilators (short or long acting agents that relax bronchioles) Nebulizer may have mouth piece or a mask may provide better delivery for those unable to maintain a seal around the mouth pieces at all times Nebulized therapy is indicated for individuals having difficulty clearing secretions, reduced vital capacity with ineffective deep breathing with coughing, unsuccessful with use of simpler modalities Key nursing management strategies r/t using small/mini nebulizers Instruct on The purpose of the therapy, medications and additives How to set-up equipment How to breathe during nebulizer therapy -breathe through their mouth taking deep slow breaths -hold breath at end of each inhalation -this increases intrapleural pressure to open collapsed alveoli (result is increased functional residual capacity) Encourages post therapy cough Monitor the effectiveness of therapy (assessing for improvement with s/s which might include BP, P, R, SpO2, listening to lung sounds, cough productive?)Proper equipment cleaning and storage The nurses role associated with the therapy modality involves.... education/instruction and evaluation through patient/family demonstration.

The individual places the spacer mouth piece in the mouth or mask over mouth and nose, presses the canister into the holder to release the medication into the spacer tube/reservoir for the individual to inhale Common problems associated with ineffective use of an inhaler with or without spacer include: Not breathing in quickly enough after pressing the canister, so the medication falls to the bottom of the spacer Not breathing in deeply enough Not holding breath for long enough Taking several puffs without waiting or shaking the inhaler in between Medication released when taking a breath in -Bronchodilator (short and long acting) and some corticosteroids may be delivered in a dry powder formulation -DPI dispense medications as a powder trigger by a quick deep breath DPI NEVER USE A SPACER and as with MDI, a individual should rinse their mouth after using Deep breathing: promotes full expansion of lungs using intercoastal and diaphragm Diaphragmatic breathing: Strengthens diaphragm Pursed lip breathing: Prolonged expiration to bring more air inIncentive Spirometry: prevents atelectasis by opening alveoli; usually perform with 10 repetitions resting between 1 or 2 hours or until lungs remain clear without using the device Chest physiotherapy -postural drainage: performs 2-4 times/day; individual stays in each position 10-15 mins as tolerated for health condition-promotes secretion drainage/removal -percussion and vibration: vibration increases expired air velocity freeing up mucus It is best to administer/take bronchodilators and mucolytics (if ordered) prior to CPT to optimize movement and removal of secretions Sit upright (semi-fowlers at minimum-chair is better but can be accomplished in any position) Correct use Realistic goalsDocument -ability to correctly perform-achievement of goal -tolerance -comparison of assessment findings before and after Increase max inhalation which optimizes exhalation so people with problems with gas retention is helpful, might also help with people who need to take really deep breaths to cough Nursing care considerations: Postural drainageBefore beginning Assessment includes Perform procedure Documentation includes Before beginning -what lobe or lobes are involved-does the patient have any deformities of the chest wall or spine -does the patient have any cardiac disease that would be contradictory or cause a limitation to a position used Assessment includes-Auscultate lungs before and after -inspect sputum (amt, color, viscosity, smell and character) -observe skin color -assess P, R, SpO2 (if oxygen required during therapy) Perform procedure -before meds and at bedtime -administer bronchodilators prior-start with lower lobes moving to upper lobes -cough following each position period -each position should be maintained for 10-15 minutes (or as tolerated).

Oxygen is a medication except in emergency situations is given by prescription. There are subtle indicators for use of oxygen: confusion, restlessness, progressing lethargy, diaphoresis, pallor, tachycardia, tachypnea, low SpO2, hyperventilation. As with any medication, the nurse assesses patient prior, administers with caution and assess the effects of the patient There are some complications associated with oxygen therapy... There are complications associated with oxygen therapy. One such complication is oxygen toxicity: when the concentration of O2 is >50% for longer than a 24 hour period of time. The high concentration of oxygen results in an overproduction of free radicals (cell metabolism by-products) causing pulmonary capillary membrane damage and cell death. Another complication is absorptive atelectasis which occurs when the concentration of O2 is >50% for longer than a 24 hour period of time. At their concentration, the oxygen displaced nitrogen from the alveoli, a gas required to keep them open, the oxygen is absorbed at a rate faster than the nitrogen in the alveoli can be replaced and alveoli collapse Necessary to administer supplemental oxygen at the lowest amount for an acceptable PaO2 level Normally, when CO2 rises in the blood we are stimulated to breathe (that is why we yawn-CO2 goes up and we need more O2). However some patients become insensitive to this. Explain As in COPD where low O2 and high CO2 is normal, and if excessive O2 is given, the stimulus to breathe is reduced and this does not help the situation-although this theory of hypoxic drive is a true phenomena, it only accounts for 10% of the stimulus to breath. Do not provide a constant and precise concentration of oxygen due to mixing with inspired room air Cannula Nasal catheter Mask -simple-partial rebreathing -non-rebreathing Provides a constant and precise concentration of oxygen; is the total of inspired air independent of patients breathing Transtracheal catheter Mask-venturi: most exact amt of oxygen without having an artificial airway-aerosolTracheostomy collar T-pieceFace tent a cylinder or from a piped-in system (as in located on the wall by a patients bedside). A reduction gauge is required to reduce the gasses pressure from the source to a working level and a flow meter regulates the flow. Humidification may be used with some high flow delivery system to prevent drying of mucus membranes within airways Oxygen concentrator, tank, wall port, flow meter with humidifying cup, tubing connector 1-6L; 20-40% oxygen delivery How should we instruct patients to breathe Prongs in the nose the right way Book say behind the heat is okNC can cause irritation of skin-dry nose Two one way valves prevent patient from rebreathing exhaled air 12-15L 80-100% O2 Simple mask-40-60%; 6-8L Allows for delivery of precise concentration of O2Specific prescribed amount The tubes have side ports, that get more narrow depending on the amount desired.

All can lead to respiratory failure due to decreased pump function of respiratory muscles and ineffective cough. May present as acute-on-chronic respiratory failure or failure to wean from mechanical ventilation. In setting of neuromuscular disease, respiratory failure is triggered by progression or exacerbation of the primary disease process or infection. Hypercapnia typically occurs when inspiratory muscle strength is less than 30% predicted. At baseline, patients have rapid shallow breathing pattern. Hemorrhagic – abrupt focal neurologicdeficits with decreased level of consciousness and evolution overhours. May be accompanied by severe headache. After spinal cord injury, paresis/paralysis occurs below level of injury. Progressive neurodegenerative disorder of upper (UMN) and lower motor neurons (LMN)→loss of skeletal muscle strength, including respiratory muscles. Most common presenting symptom (80%) are asymmetric limb weakness, followed by bulbar symptoms (20%); 25% may have early bulbar involvement. Link between ALS and frontotemporal dementia: patients may present with cognitive dysfunction. Autonomic symptoms develop later in disease process. Death is typically due to repeated respiratory infections and progressive respiratory failure. A quarter of acute poliomyelitis cases may be the paralytic form requiring mechanical ventilation. Typically, respiratory function returns to normal, but progressive muscle weakness may occur years later. PPS – symptoms/signs due to neurologic and musculoskeletal features. Develops in 20% to 60% of acute poliomyelitis cases at about 29 years after recovering from acute polio. Mean age of onset is 51 years. Phrenic nerve injury may occur after cardiac surgery (due to cold exposure or nerve stretch), trauma, mediastinal tumors, pleural space infection, forceful neck manipulation. May also be due to motor neuron disease, myelopathy, neuropathy, myopathy. The majority of cases are idiopathic. Acute, idiopathic polyneuritis – usually presents as ascending symmetric paralysis (though 10% may begin in arms). The most prominent symptoms are in the lower extremities. Accompanied by diminished or absent deep tendon reflexes. Often presents with failure to wean from mechanical ventilation. Common in setting of severe sepsis, multisystem organ failure in the surgical or medical intensive care unit. Presents as flaccid paralysis of upper and lower extremities as early as 5 to 7 days after mechanical ventilation. Autoimmune disorder directed at postsynaptic acetylcholine receptors, leading to weakness. Seropositive disease – detectable antibodies to acetylcholine receptor (AChR-Ab) or muscle-specific receptor tyrosine kinase (MuSK-Ab) Rare disorder that results from impaired release of acetylcholine from presynaptic terminals resulting in skeletal muscle weakness. Rare but possibly life-threatening disorder caused by Clostridium botulinum. Toxin ingested through improperly cooked or preserved food, wound contamination, absorption through the gastrointestinal tract. Five types of botulism – foodborne, infant, wound, adult enteric infectious, and inhaled. Strokes in specific locations → predictable effects on respiratory system. May lead to loss of upper airway function, abnormal breathing pattern, decreased diaphragmatic function, loss of automatic or voluntary breathing control. Acute hemispheric stroke → loss of upper airway function and Cheyne-Stokes breathing. Voluntary control of muscles decreased on side of hemiparesis. Small stroke in dorsolateral area of medulla → respiratory arrest and sudden death. Stroke in midbrain may lead to central neurogenic hyperventilation. Stroke in pontomedullary area → apneustic or ataxic breathing pattern. Stroke to descending reticulospinal tract in pons or nucleus of vagus ambiguus may lead to loss of breathing control. Midpontine stroke may lead to “locked-in syndrome” and loss of voluntary breathing control. Oropharyngeal muscle dysfunction → swallowing dysfunction → aspiration → pneumonia. Increased intracranial pressure (ICP) from hemorrhage, vertebrobasilar ischemia or bihemispheric ischemia can present with decreased respiratory drive → hypoventilation → hypercapnia → further increase in ICP. Typically presents with pain at fracture site. Transient paralysis and spinal shock – physiologic loss of all spinal cord function immediately after injury → flaccid paralysis, sensory loss, loss of bowel and bladder control, loss of reflexes, bradycardia and hypotension. High C-spine injury (above C1-C3) → paralysis of all major respiratory muscles (accessory and bulbar muscles spared). Requires continuous ventilatory support. Injury at C3-C5 → weakness or paralysis of diaphragm → need for continuous ventilatory support. Injury below C5 → intercostal and abdominal muscle paralysis but diaphragm spared and chronic ventilatory support often not needed, though may be necessary in acute setting. High and low C-spine injury → expiratory muscle weakness or paralysis → ineffective cough → mucus retention, atelectasis, pneumonia. Contraction of clavicular portion of pectoralis major possible in some spinal cord injury → increased effectiveness of cough. Other pulmonary complications – edema, pneumonia, pulmonary embolism. Cardiovascular complications – spinal shock → bradycardia, hypotension (may be due to neurogenic shock or volume loss from trauma). Other complications – venous thrombosis/pulmonary embolism occur in 50% to 100% of TSCI cases, stress ulcers, ileus, lack of temperature control. UMN signs/symptoms – spasticity, hyperreflexia, bulbar involvement, Babinski sign. LMN signs/symptoms – weakness, atrophy, hyporeflexia, fasciculations. Acute respiratory failure and nocturnal hypoventilation have been presenting features in 1% to 3% of cases. Occurs due to early involvement of phrenic nerve neurons within spinal cord. Onset of respiratory failure is often beginning of rapid decline. Most common symptoms of PPS are fatigue (80%) and progressive, asymmetric weakness in proximal or distal muscle groups that had been affected by initial illness. Pain due to spinal deformities (kyphoscoliosis), degenerative joint disease, joint instability. Slowly progressive respiratory failure typically due to muscle weakness, and partially due to central hypoventilation; results in recurrent aspiration. Dyspnea most pronounced when supine due to repositioning of abdominal contents. Hypoxemia common in bilateral diaphragm paralysis due to atelectas. Hypoxemia and hypercapnia worsen with sleep. Ventilatory failure, pulmonary hypertension and corpulmonale with erythrocytosis may develop. Unilateral diaphragm weakness usually tolerated well in absence of underlying lung disease or other neuromuscular dysfunction. Autonomic dysfunction (65%): cardiac arrhythmia, blood pressure lability, pupillary and gastrointestinal dysfunction, urinary retention. Variable decree of motor weakness (mild paresis → complete paralysis). Facial (60%), oropharyngeal (50%), ocular (15%) involvement may occur. Sensory loss variable (40% to 70%), occasionally accompanied by paresthesias. 70% preceeded by viral (CMV most common) or bacterial ( Campylobacter jejuni most common). 15% to 30% develop respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation for average of 50 to 55 days. Most require tracheostomy. Critical Illness Polyneuropathy and Polyneuromyopathy Acute myopathy often occurs with polyneuropathy. Four categories of CIPNM syndrome: Risk factors – sepsis, multiorgan failure, prolonged use of corticosteroids and neuromuscular blocking agents, persistent hyperglycemia, hyperosmolality, vasopressor support for more than 3 days, bacteremia, dialysis, immobility, use of aminoglycosides, prolonged mechanical ventilation, APACHE III and SOFA scores Typical presentation: fluctuating weakness of involved voluntary muscles; improves with rest or acetylcholinesterase agents. Ocular (blurred vision, diplopia, ptosis), facial (expressionless appearance), neck muscle involvement (difficulty holding up head) is common. Pupils spared. Bulbar symptoms present in 15%: fatigable chewing, dysarthria, dysphagia, aspiration. Limb symptoms: proximal muscle weakness in arms greater than in legs. Respiratory symptoms: myasthenic crisis (impending respiratory failure). One third of patients have respiratory muscle weakness that presents late in disease process. May occur in absence of limb weakness, and may be initial presentation. Precipitating factors include spontaneous infections, tapering immune suppression, medications, surgery. Predictors of postoperative respiratory failure after thymectomy include severe disease with low VC and bulbar symptoms, high levels of AChR-Ab, intraoperative blood loss. Signs of respiratory failure are discussed in General Clinical Features of Respiratory Failure Due to Neuromuscular Disease. Majority present with slow, progressive proximal muscle weakness without significant atrophy. Occasional subacute/acute presentations are more common in LEMS associated with SCLC. Respiratory muscle weakness common. Respiratory failure is uncommon, but may be initial presenting symptom. Cranial nerve symptoms are less common and less severe than in myasthenia gravis. Sensory complaints – low back pain and numbness/parasthesia. Acute onset of bilateral cranial neuropathies – blurred vision, diplopia, nystagmus, ptosis, dysphagia, dysarthria, facial weakness. Respiratory muscle weakness common, especially with type A toxin, characterized by diaphragm paralysis and upper airway compromise. Often requires ventilatory support (average of 58 days with type A toxin). Absence of fever, sensory deficits, change in mental status. Heart rate – normal to bradycardic with normotension Foodborne botulism – onset 12 to 36 hours after ingestion. Wound botulism occurs in puncture wounds, subcutaneous abscesses, deep space infections as well as abrasions, lacerations, open fractures, surgical incisions, closed hematomas. It May be associated with fever and leukocytosis. Subacute presentation with proximal limb and girdle muscle weakness with muscle wasting. Lower extremities usually affected before upper extremities. Poor correlation between total dose of steroids and severity of myopathy. Course can be as short as 2 weeks. Rare with doses less than equivalent of prednisone 10mg/day. Higher doses → higher likelihood of myopathy with more rapid onset. General Management Principles for Respiratory Failure Due to Neuromuscular Disease Indications for mechanical ventilation – severe dyspnea, marked accessory muscle use, inability to handle secretions, hemodynamic instability, refractory hypoxemia, acute respiratory acidosis. Noninvasive ventilation may be tried in the form of positive-pressure ventilation (NIPPV) or negative-pressure ventilation (NPV). These have been shown to attenuate decline in lung function, improve gas exchange and survival. Patients must be awake, have minimal secretions, stable vital signs, and intact upper airway function. Ventilatory support is often necessary when forced vital capacity (FVC) is less than 10 to 15 mL/kg or less than 1 L. Maximum inspiratory pressure (PI) less than 20 to 25 cmHO. Ischemic stroke – the goal is to minimize extent of ischemic injury Decrease intracranial pressure – intubate and hyperventilate, osmotic diuresis Primary assessment – stabilization. Address other life-threatening injuries that may have occurred due to trauma Medical care – continuous vital signs, telemetry, pulse oximetry, frequent neurologic evaluation, admission to intensive care unit DVT prophylaxis – low-molecular-weight heparin with or without pneumatic compression stockings; IVC filter if anticoagulation contraindicated Pain control, avoid pressure ulcers, prophylaxis for stress ulcers, temperature control, occupational and physical therapy Glucocorticoids – debated, but only therapy that may improve outcomes Decompression and stabilization – closed reduction vs surgery Investigational treatments: spinal cord cooling, electrical stimulation, autologous macrophages, thyrotropin-releasing hormone, neuronal growth factors. Abdominal binding with non-elastic straps minimizes dissipation of intrathoracic forces, leading to improved effectiveness of cough. Comprehensive, multidisciplinary management necessary in acute setting as well as long-term Respiratory management – see discussion on General Management Principles. Consider NIPPV if appropriate as it decreases risk of death by 3.1. Use of NIPPV when FVC less than 50% or fall in FVC greater than15% in 3 months: slower decline in lung function and decreased mortality, improves quality and may prolong life. Invasive ventilation may be tried if long-term survival is the goal. Respiratory dysfunction – see section on General Management Principles for Respiratory Failure Due to Neuromuscular Disease. Early NIPPV beneficial – reverses chronic hypoventilation, improves respiratory muscle strength and exercise capacity. Muscle weakness – nonfatiguing exercise can lead to improved strength. Generalized fatigue – energy conservation and exercise program. IVIG may be beneficial but further trials are necessary. Ventilatory support with NIPPV or NP if needed. Total diaphragm paralysis may lead to need for tracheostomy with intermittent or continuous mechanical ventilation. Respiratory failure: See section on General Management Principles for Respiratory Failure Due to Neuromuscular Disease. FVC averages 33 ± 11% predicted at time of intubation Less than 7 days between symptom onset and hospitalization. Consider tracheostomy after 2 weeks if no improvement in pulmonary function. Blood pressure – arterial line placement if severe fluctuations in blood pressure occur: Treat hypotension with IV fluids or phenylephrine. Treat hypertension with short-acting antihypertensives. Pain control – minimize opiate use. Treat with gabapentin, carbamazepine or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory. DVT prophylaxis – subcutaneous fractionated or unfractionated heparin and support stockings. Rehabilitation – Disease-modifying therapy – plasma exchange, IVIG. Critical Illness Polyneuropathy and Polyneuromyopathy Aggressive glucose control decreases incidence by 44%, time to resolution, duration of mechanical ventilation Intensive care unit admission for myasthenia crisis. Monitoring – pulse oximetry FVC should be measured every 2 to 4 hours. Intubation and management of respiratory failure discussed in General Management Principles of Respiratory Failure Due to Neuromuscular Disease. Symptomatic treatments – Acetylcholinesterase agents. Rapid immune-modulating agents – Plasmapheresis, IVIG. Chronic immune-modulating agents – Glucocorticoids. Symptomatic therapy – aimed at increasing amount of acetylcholine available. No further therapy needed if symptomatic improvement achieved. Refer to General Management Principles of Respiratory Failure Due to Neuromuscular Disease. Respiratory management – see discussion on General Management Principles. Individualize head of bed position – maintain cerebral perfusion by not elevating head too much, avoid cardiopulmonary compromise with flat positioning. Primary assessment – evaluate and stabilize airway, breathing, circulation before assessing for neurologic disability. Airway management – one third of patients with cervical injuries require intubation within 24 hours of injury. Chest physiotherapy with aggressive suctioning, reverse hypoxemia. See section on general management for indications for intubation and mechanical ventilation. Reverse hypotension with goal MAP 85 to 90 mmHg. Vasopressors and blood products if needed. Attempt to minimize fluids able to decrease risk of further cord edema. TSCI assumed if spinal pain, altered mental status, or neurologic deficit and spinal movement should be minimized. Imaging is unnecessary if patient denies pain and is awake, alert, not confused or intoxicated, has no spinal tenderness and no other distracting injuries. Delayed intubation in those with bulbar dysfunction → increased risk of pneumonia. Critical Illness Polyneuropathy and Polyneuromyopathy Typically recognized after the patient has been stabilized and weaning from mechanical ventilation is attempted. NIPPV may be attempted first, though PaCO >45 mmHg predicts failure. Plasmapheresis – directly removes AChR-Ab from circulation. Effects typically last 3-4 weeks. IVIG – effects seen in less than a week and typically last about 3 weeks May be associated with transient worsening of symptoms → mechanical ventilation in 10% Intubation and management of respiratory failure discussed in General Management Principles of Respiratory Failure Due to Neuromuscular Disease. Intubation and management of respiratory failure discussed in General Management Principles of Respiratory Failure Due to Neuromuscular Disease. Early intubation with mechanical ventilation decreases mortality. General Diagnostic Testing for Respiratory Failure Due to Neuromuscular Disease Pulmonary function testing (PFT) – restrictive pattern: Decreased forced vital capacity (FVC) due to respiratory muscle weakness and decreased lung/chest wall compliance. Parallels the decline in respiratory muscle function. Decreased total lung capacity (TLC) and functional residual capacity (FRC). Arterial blood gas (ABG) testing – hypoxemia and hypercapnia are late findings: Mechanical ventilation may be indicated prior to development of ABG abnormalities. Hypoxemia due to: microatelectasis, ineffective cough, retained secretions, mucus plugging → ventilation/perfusion mismatch. Hypercapnia does not occur until inspiratory muscle strength <50% predicted. Weak respiratory muscles lead to alveolar hypoventilation. Maximum inspiratory (PI) and expiratory (PE) pressure – measured at airway opening during voluntary contraction against occluded airway: Most sensitive test for respiratory muscle weakness Should be part of routine assessment of patients with neuromuscular disease Non-contrast cat scan (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain: evaluate for hemorrhage, structural pathology that may mimic stroke (subdural hematoma, tumor). It may take 8-24 hours for evidence of stroke to appear on CT. MRI shows evidence of stroke in 30 minutes, superior to CT for brainstem, cerebellar, lacunar strokes. Carotid artery imaging (ultrasound or magnetic resonance angiogram (MRA)). Laboratory evaluation: CBC, cardiac biomarkers, basic metabolic panel, serum glucose, coagulation profile, lipid profile, hypercoagulable workup, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR). Plain X-rays provide rapid evaluation of alignment, fractures, soft tissue swelling. Helical CT – higher sensitivity for spinal fractures. Follow with 2-mm CT of concerning area. MRI – indications in TSCI not yet defined. Provides more detailed imaging of spinal cord, ligaments, intervertebral discs, soft tissue. More sensitive than CT for epidural hematoma. Disadvantages: not 100% sensitive for cord damage in early-stage TSCI, contraindicated in those with foreign metal objects, difficulty monitoring vital signs during test. Should be done in those with high suspicion of TSCI and negative CT Myelography used only when CT and MRI not available. Clinical, electrophysiological (fibrillation potentials), neuropathological evidence of LMN degeneration. Absence of electrophysiological/pathological/radiographic evidence of alternate disease process. Laboratory evaluation – creatine phosphokinase (CPK) may be elevated to 1,000 U/L, may screen for heavy metal exposure if relevant, genetic testing may be considered in setting of strong family history. PFT may be helpful. VC <50% predicted associated with respiratory symptoms, VC <25-30% predicted associated with respiratory failure and death. Progressive decrease in FVC and maximum voluntary ventilation (MVV), progressive increase in RV, decreased maximal inspiratory (MIP) and expiratory pressure (MEP). FVC most specific test to predict survival. TLC and FRC relatively well preserved. Electromyography (EMG) and nerve conduction studies (NCS) not diagnostic but may be helpful and are often part of workup. EMG – diffuse evidence of acute and chronic denervation. NCS – sensory and motor NCS typically normal. Compound motor action potentials (CMAP) may be decreased. Motor unit estimation studies not specific to ALS but demonstrate decreased numbers. Muscle biopsy – nonspecific findings of chronic denervation with reinnervation. No definitive way to distinguish PPS from prior polio. Prior episode of polio with residual motor neuron loss. 15 years since acute onset of polio with neurologic/functional stability. Gradual onset of new weakness and abnormal muscle fatigability for ≥1 year. PFTs – average yearly decrease in FVC about 18.6 ml (1.9%). Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) – may be normal or show mildly increased protein or oligoclonal bands. EMG does not clearly distinguish a history of prior polio from PPS. It helps to exclude other diseases (ALS, radiculopathy, neuropathy, myopathy). Muscle biopsy – non-specific with evidence of chronic denervation, reinnervation, active degeneration. Chest X-ray – unilateral or bilateral elevated hemidiaphragm with associated atelectasis and low lung volumes. Sniff test: fluoroscopic exam of diaphragm during sniff maneuver (90% sensitive for unilateral diaphragm paralysis). Rapid increase in intrapleural pressure during sniff → paradoxical cephalad movement of weak hemidiaphragm Bilateral diaphragm paralysis → 50% decrease in VC in supine position Diaphragmatic ultrasound can be used to assess muscle thickness and transdiaphragmatic pressure (Gold standard) EMG: shows neuropathic or myopathic pattern depending on cause. Absent signal in cord transsection Areflexia: may be present only in lower extremities with hyporeflexia elsewhere. Symptom progression over days-weeks, relative symmetry, sensory findings mild, cranial nerve involvement, recovery starts 2-4 weeks after progression stops, autonomic dysfunction, no fever at presentation, elevated CSF protein, electrodiagnostic studies consistent with GBS. Lumbar puncture and neurophysiology studies should be performed if GBS suspected. Antibody testing: Anti-GQ1b testing used to diagnose Miller Fisher syndrome (GBS variant). Critical Illness Polyneuropathy and Polyneuromyopathy Standardized muscle exam (Medical Research Council) to evaluate for weakness. Incorrect clinical setting, extensive testing not indicated. Nerve conduction studies and EMG (ENMG) typically show axonal polyneuropathy +/- myopathy (i.e., decreased amplitude of CMAP, normal velocity with motor nerve stimulation, spontaneous electrical activity with needle recording). Myopathic pattern: prolonged CMAP, short duration and low amplitude of motor unit potentials with voluntary activation. Physical exam – fatigability with repetitive muscle activity Tensilon (edrophonium) test: should be used if significant ptosis present Tensilon is a short-acting acetylcholinesterase inhibitor. Give 2 mg IV every 60 seconds until result observed (or a total dose of 10 mg) → transient improvement in muscle weakness. Positive test suggests MG, but may be positive in Lambert-Eaton myasthenia syndrome. Muscarinic side effects may occur: most concerning are bradycardia and bronchospasm. Ice pack test can be used in patients with ptosis (80% sensitive in severe ptosis). Neuromuscular transmission increased at lower temperatures. Place ice pack on closed lid for 2 minutes, then remove ice and ptosis should be improved. 80% with generalized MG (60% with ocular) have detectable AChR-Ab. Concentration of antibodies does not correlate with disease severity. AChR-Ab have also been found in Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome and systemic lupus erythematous. MuSK-Ab present in subgroup with higher incidence of bulbar weakness and respiratory failure. 77% will demonstrate 10-15% decreased amplitude of action potential during slow repetitive stimulation. 92% have single-fiber EMG abnormalities (most sensitive test for MG). PFTs: mildly decreased FVC, moderate decrease in MIP, MEP, some improvement after pyridostigmine administration. Usually a clinical diagnosis, which is then confirmed by presence of antibodies and electrodiagnostic tests. Maximal isometric contraction of muscle → temporary restoration of decreased or absent deep tendon reflex. Antibodies against voltage gated calcium channel (VGCC): positive testing is confirmatory in presence of symptoms/signs. High-frequency repetitive nerve stimulation or brief maximal isometric stimulation → increased CMAP. EMG not required but may be helpful for diagnosis. Muscle biopsy: loss of type IIa muscle fibers without inflammation of necrosis. Urinary creatine excretion is increased with corticosteroids and inflammatory myopathies. Decreases with decreased dose of corticosteroids. Characteristic Films in Respiratory Failure Due to Neuromuscular Disease Helpful for assessment of pneumonia, atelectasis, parenchymal lung disease. Small lung volumes seen with inspiratory muscle weakness. Neuroimaging only helpful in ruling out other diseases. MRI usually normal in ALS. Critical Illness Polyneuropathy and Polyneuromyopathy Based on presenting signs, symptoms, and characteristic imaging. Correct clinical picture with improvement in symptoms with decreasing or withdrawal of steroids. TIA, seizure, migraine aura, hypoglycemia, multiple sclerosis, brain tumor, brain abscess, subdural hematoma. Radiation to spinal cord, malignancy, infection/abscess, multiple sclerosis, spinal cord infarction, anterior spinal artery syndrome.

Inflammatory myopathy (dermatomyositis, polymyositis, HIV myopathy), critical illness polyneuropathy. Confirm diagnosis with CSF exam and neurophysiology studies. CSF: elevated protein, few cells (albuminocytologic dissociation) found in 90% after 1 week of symptoms. Neurophysiologic testing helps predict need for mechanical ventilation. Demyelinating pattern: greater need for intubation than axonal or equivocal findings. Critical Illness Polyneuropathy and Polyneuromyopathy Muscles/nerve biopsies not routinely indicated but can confirm diagnosis. Muscle biopsy shows type II muscle fiber atrophy, occasional type I atrophy and necrosis. Demonstration of toxin in blood or wound is diagnostic. Elevated blood pressure should not be treated acutely unless: There is extreme hypertension (SBP <220 mmHg or DBP >110) Heart failure, coronary artery disease, aortic dissection, or end-organ dysfunction Prior to thrombolytic therapy, SBP ≤185 mmHg and DBP ≤110 mmHg for 24 hours Thrombolytic therapy: give only if patient meets criteria for use. Alteplase improves functional outcome when given within 3 hours of symptom onset, increases favorable outcome within 4.5 hours Increased incidence of symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage Full-dose anticoagulation appropriate for – stroke due to cardiogenic embolization, stroke in evolution, crescendo TIA. Should not be used in large infarctions, uncontrolled hypertension, bleeding. Aspirin is effective in early treatment of acute ischemic stroke. Comparable efficacy with decreased risk of hemorrhagic complications when compared to warfarin. DVT prophylaxis: subcutaneous heparin and thigh-high stockings. See General Management Principles, Key management points, and emergency management. See General Management Principles, Key management points for discussion on airway and ventilation management. Aminophylline: reported to improve respiratory muscle strength in ALS. See General Management Principles, Key management points for discussion on airway and ventilation management. Treatment for unilateral disease typically not necessary Surgical plication for significant symptoms or those with pulmonary disease can be helpful Plasma exchange: most effective if started within 7 days of symptom onset, though still provides some improvement when started within 30 days. IVIG: preferable to plasma exchange (easier to administer). Contraindications: low IgA, uncontrolled hypertension, hyperosmolar state. No benefit to plasmapheresis followed by IVIG compared to each therapy alone No benefit to corticosteroids alone. May slow recovery, though when used in combination with IVIG, may hasten recovery (no long-term data). Critical Illness Polyneuropathy and Polyneuromyopathy Guanidine: side effects – bone marrow suppression and renal toxicity limit its use Aminopyridines: prolong nerve terminal membrane depolarization → increased calcium entry → increased acetylcholine release Plasmapheresis: results not as rapid as in myasthenia gravis. Use in combination with oral immunosuppressive agent IVIG → clinical improvement and decrease in VGCC antibodies. Benefits peak at 2-4 weeks Antitoxin: give if clinical suspicion is high and symptoms worsening. Side effects: sensitization, anaphylaxis, serum sickness Aspirin 325 mg within 48 hours followed by 150-325 mg in patients not receiving alteplase, IV heparin, or oral anticoagulants Patients ≤100 kg: 0.09 mg/kg IV bolus over 1 minute followed by 0.81 mg/kg continuous infusion over 60 minutes Patients >100 kg: 9 mg IV bolus over 1 minute followed by 81 mg continuous infusion over 60 minutes Methylprednisolone 30 mg/kg IV followed by 5.4 mg/kg/hr over next 23 hours. Riluzole: antiglutamate drug, 50 mg twice daily. This is the only treatment shown to prolong survival. Plasmapheresis: 250 mL/kg every 2 days for 5 treatments. Early motor recovery and ambulation achieved, decreased number of patients requiring mechanical ventilation, decreased duration of mechanical ventilation. IVIG (0.4 g/kg/day for 5 days) started within 2 weeks may be as effective as plasmapheresis. IVIG: 2 g/kg over 2-5 days. No clear difference in response between IVIG and plasmapheresis. Plasmapheresis onset of action may be faster Other immune-modulating agents. Azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil, cyclosporine, cyclophosphamide, tacrolimus. Acetylcholinesterase agents – Pyridostigmine bromide 30 mg three times a day, titrated up for effect. Guanidine: maximum 1000 mg/day – use with pyridostigmine Dalfampridine: limited use due to side effects (seizures) 3,4-Diaminopyridine: best tolerated, though seizures may occur at high doses Maximum dose: 20 mg four times a day – note not approved in US Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors – Pyridostigmine: best tolerated but only mildly effective IVIG: only randomized trial used 1 g/kg/day for two days Prednisone alone: 1 mg/kg/day until clinical improvement observed (then taper) Or in combination with azathioprine: 50 mg twice a day, then titrate up for clinical improvement to maximum dose of 2-3 mg/kg/day Equine serum heptavalent botulism antitoxin (for children >1 yr, adults) Human-derived botulism immune globulin (for infants <1 yr) Metronidazole 500 mg IV every 8 hours for penicillin allergic Diaphragmatic pacing may be used in high C-spine injuries with intact phrenic nerves. Interferon-beta: may be beneficial in select cases. Immune suppression – should not be used for myasthenic crisis. Response may not be seen for months. Corticosteroids and anticholinesterase agents should only be started after plasmapheresis or IVIG. 30-day mortality rate for ischemic strokes 7.6%, for hemorrhagic strokes 37.5% Of those who survive 30 days, 20% will need institutionalized care Methylprednisolone given within 8 hours of trauma → significant improvement in motor, sensation, and touch DVT prophylaxis should be continued for 3 months after acute event (risk of thromboembolism approaches that of general population after 3 months) Rehospitalization common: 55% in first year, then 37%/year over next 20 years PFTs should be done every 3 months. MIP less negative than -60 cm H O 100% sensitive for survival <18 months Median time from diagnosis to death: 3-5 years; 10% ALS patients may live >10 years PPS – occurs earlier in those with more severe initial disease. It is more likely to occur in those with adolescent/adult polio. A better recovery from the initial illness → increased likelihood of PPS. Example: 80% of phrenic nerve injury after cardiac surgery recovers in 6 months, 90% in one year Diaphragm paralysis due to spinal cord injury may never heal Negative inspiratory force more negative than -40 cmHO 10% may relapse after plasma exchange due to antibody rebound Mortality decreased from 15% in 1970s to 3-4% in 1980s Common complications: pneumonia, recurrent aspiration, pulmonary embolism Prognosis for recovery good, but 85% have residual neurologic sequelae Poor prognosis associated with: older age, lower (<20% of normal) mean CMAP during distal nerve stimulation, need for ventilatory support, rapid progression to severe weakness (<1 week) Critical Illness Polyneuropathy and Polyneuromyopathy CIPNM prolongs duration of mechanical ventilation and increases mortality. Those who survive have prolonged ICU and hospital stay. 68% have complete recovery. 28% have persistent neurologic deficits: absent or reduced deep tendon reflexes, glove and stocking sensory loss, muscle wasting, hyperesthesia, persistent disability with quadriparesis, quadriplegia, or paraplegia. Weaning trials may be attempted when respiratory status is improved MIP more negative than -20 cmH O, MEP >40 cmH O, FVC >10 mL/kg Risk factors for extubation failure: male gender, history of prior myasthenic crisis, atelectasis, duration of mechanical ventilation >10 days Risk factors for reintubation: lower pH, lower FVC, presence of atelectasis, need for BiPAP support Significant but incomplete improvement expected with anticholinergic medications On 6th-10th day of therapy, may observe transient worsening in weakness Thymectomy (with or without thymoma) may improve survival and symptoms Weakness peaks within a few years of symptom onset About 50% of those with only ocular disease will develop generalized disease IVIG typically leads to improvement in weakness for only 4-8 weeks Plasmapheresis does not lead to rapid relief of symptoms and only provides short-term benefit Treatment of SCLC often leads to remission of LEMS Typically, with early hospitalization and intubation if needed, recovery is expected with normal to near-normal functional status Respiratory muscle strength may take months to recover Even when PFTs return to normal, exertional dyspnea and poor exercise tolerance may persist Severe disease – may have prolonged course with hospital complications Predictors of worse long-term health: need for mechanical ventilation and old age Muscle strength improves 3-4 weeks after decreased dose of corticosteroids Eventually resolves completely if corticosteroids are discontinued When Should I Suspect I've Made the Wrong Diagnosis? Presence of vertigo, dysarthria, dysphagia, or diplopia in the absence of other symptoms Tremor, tonic-clonic motor activity, confusion, memory loss, delirium, incontinence Disease course is relapsing and remitting, presence of involuntary movements, ataxia, EMG findings are not diffuse, motor conduction block is present. CSF cell count >10 mm(though may be due to coexisting HIV infection), presence of a sensory level, marked persistent asymmetry of weakness, severe persistent bowel or bladder dysfunction. Critical Illness Polyneuropathy and Polyneuromyopathy Facial muscle weakness, asymmetric findings, pyramidal signs, significantly elevated CPK Presence of muscarinic symptoms (hypersalivation, sweating, increased secretions, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea) and worsening of symptoms with Tensilon test suggest cholinergic crisis. Presence of UMN signs, symptoms that improve with exercise and pupillary involvement all suggest misdiagnosis. Presence or predominance of only ocular, extraocular, oropharyngeal or arm symptoms, asymmetric muscle weakness, preserved deep tendon reflexes. Ascending paralysis, significant autonomic symptoms, sensory findings, elevated CSF protein. Presence of muscle tenderness and myalgias, patient is only on inhaled corticosteroids. CT brain should be done 24 hours after administration of alteplase to exclude hemorrhage. For those with chronic disease, serial physical exam and ABG should be performed to ensure adequate ventilation. Continued physical therapy. Relapses occur in <10% and are treated with plasmapheresis or IVIG. General Pathophysiology for Respiratory Failure Due to Neuromuscular Disease Different functional components of the respiratory system (central nervous system, peripheral nervous system, neuromuscular junction, respiratory muscle, bony thoracic cage, upper and lower airways, lung parenchyma) may be affected depending on area of neuromuscular dysfunction Pharyngeal collapses, sleep apnea/hypopnea → nocturnal hypoventilation → daytime hypercapnia and hypoxemia Decreased tidal volume, poor cough → atelectasis, decreased lung/chest wall compliance → increased work of breathing Aspiration and retained secretions → recurrent pneumonia Decreased ventilatory response to hypoxemia/hypercapnia due to decreased central drive and abnormal mechanics When blood flow falls below 10 mL/100 g/minute, basic cellular function cannot be maintained → cell death Infarcted brain initially pale. Within hours-days, gray matter congested with dilated blood vessels and small petechial hemorrhage. When embolus blocking major vessel lyses, migrates or disperses, may produce edema and hemorrhagic infarction Intracerebral hemorrhage → direct brain damage by compressing surrounding tissue Transsection and hemorrhage rare in nonpenetrating injury Secondary injury: begins after injury and progresses Mechanisms: ischemia, hypoxia, inflammation, edema, apoptosis Clinically presents with neurologic decompensation 8-12 hours after injury Spinal cord edema begins within hours, peaks 3-6 days after injury, decreases after 9th day and is followed by central hemorrhagic necrosis 5-10% familial ALS has mutation encoding copper-zinc dismutase (a free oxygen radical scavenger). Neurons may be more susceptible to oxidative stress and glutamate-induced neurotoxicity. Glutamate is principal excitatory neurotransmitter in brain. Decreased uptake of glutamate → overstimulation of glutamate receptors → increased intracellular calcium → activates proteolytic enzymes → cell death. Denervation followed by aberrant reinnervation along with possible: Susceptibility to aging of reinnervated motor units previously affected Diaphragm: most important muscle of respiration. Innervated by C3-C5 Diaphragmatic paralysis → use of accessory muscles. Risk factors: Viral illness (CMV most common, Epstein-Barr), bacterial illness ( Campylobacter jejuni most common), Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection, influenza vaccination (no solid data), recent surgery, lymphoma Is likely a self-limited autoimmune disease due to an aberrant immune response to bacterial lipopolysaccharides with similar epitopes to myelin sheath or Schwann cell basement membrane 83% have antibodies against GQ1b (ganglioside component of nerve) Critical Illness Polyneuropathy and Polyneuromyopathy Thought to be due to exaggerated response to severe injury causing muscle and nerve injury Systemic and local inflammatory response mediated by: TNF-alpha, IL-1, IL-12, monocytes, macrophages, neutrophils Results in endothelial injury, increased vascular permeability endoneurial edema and decreased blood flow to nerve and muscle Antibody-mediated, T-cell-dependent autoimmune disease. Antibodies directed at proteins in postsynaptic membrane of neuromuscular junction Destruction of acetylcholine receptors causes impaired transmission of neural impulses across neuromuscular junction Antibodies against VGCC → normal calcium flux necessary for acetylcholine release is interrupted. Postsynaptic sensitivity to acetylcholine is normal. Decreased acetylcholine release despite normal acetylcholine vesicle number, presynaptic concentration and postsynaptic receptors. Clostridium botulinum: heterogeneous group of gram-positive, rod-shaped, spore-forming obligate anaerobes that are ubiquitous. In appropriate conditions, spores germinate and become toxin-producing bacilli. Anaerobic or semi-anaerobic environment, low-acidity water, temperature between 77-99 degrees Fahrenheit. Eight types of toxins exist: human disease only caused by three (A, B, E). Some strains denature protein and cause food to appear or taste sour, but others do not Toxin spreads via vascular system and binds to synaptotagmin II (calcium channel) in presynaptic peripheral cholinergic terminals, causing irreversible disruption in stimulation-induced acetylcholine release. Synaptic recovery only occurs with growth of a new synapse (6 months) Corticosteroid receptor likely involved. Effects are prevented with receptor blocker Interfere with insulin-like growth factor-1 signaling causing increased myocyte apoptosis Akt1 (intracellular signaling molecule with protein kinase activity). Glucocorticoids suppress Akt1, causing increased levels of ubiquitin-ligase atrogin-1, which targets muscles and degrades them. 85% ischemic – 25% due to small vessel disease, 2% due to embolism, 50% due to large vessel disease Risk factors: age, African American race, male sex, atrial fibrillation, carotid bruit, history of prior stroke, diabetes, coronary artery disease, hypertension, cigarette smoking, hyperlipidemia Prevalence in Americans over 65 years of age: 40/1,000 Death rate from stroke doubles every 10 years between ages of 55-85 Leading cause of death is venous and pulmonary thromboembolism About 50% are cervical cord injuries → quadriplegia/quadriparesis Causes of TSCI in US: motor vehicle accidents (47%), violence (14%), sports accidents (9%), other (7%) Risk factors for TSCI: 80% male, underlying spinal disease Non-traumatic SCI through to be 3-4 times the number of TSCI Affects males > females prior to age of 65, after which incidence in genders equalizes Peak age of diagnosis: 7th-8th decade, though can be diagnosed as early as 3rd decade Majority of cases sporadic, though 5-10% are familial (autosomal dominant inheritance) 5-year mortality 80%, generally due to respiratory failure Prior to widespread use of oral polio vaccine in 1954, poliomyelitis was most common cause of respiratory failure Sequelae of polio still affect a significant number of people, causing decreased muscle strength and function. PPS: occurs decades after initial illness in 20-30% Neurologic causes: spinal cord transsection, MS, ALS, cervical spondylosis, polio, Guillain-Barré, phrenic nerve dysfunction (compression by tumor, cardiac surgery, trauma, idiopathic, post-viral, radiation therapy) Myopathic causes: Limb-girdle dystrophy, hypo/hyperthyroidism, malnutrition, acid maltase deficiency, connective tissue disease, amyloidosis, idiopathic Incidence of GBS worldwide: 1.1 cases/100,000/year – 1.8 cases/100,000/year. Increases after age of 50 to 1.7 cases/100,000/year – 3.3 cases/100,000/year Critical Illness Polyneuropathy and Polyneuromyopathy Incidence depends on severity of illness, diagnostic criteria used, timing of diagnosis 25-63% in those requiring mechanical ventilation for >7 days Highest incidence (70-100%) occurs in sepsis population Most common disorder of neuromuscular transmission Women of child-bearing age affected two times more than men Thymic tumors present in 10% (usually in older men) Bimodal age distribution (though disease can occur at any age). Early peak 2nd-3rd decade (female predominance). Late peak 6th-8th decade (male predominance) 50% of LEMS cases are associated with malignancy (SCLC and Hodgkin’s lymphoma) Increased incidence of autoimmune disease in both paraneoplastic and non-paraneoplastic LEMS 25% foodborne (usually involving home-canned food, with highest rates in Alaska) 3% wound: incidence increasing due to “black tar heroin” used subcutaneously or intramuscularly Respiratory failure is most common cause of death. Increased risk – elderly, presence of malignancy, negative nitrogen balance prior to starting corticosteroids, inactivity. Factors affecting survival – age, level of injury, neurologic grade Compared to thoracic or lower injuries – C1-C3: 6.6 increased risk of death, C4-C5: 2.5 increased risk of death, C6-C8: 1.5 increased risk of death Increased risk of mortality -severe systemic injury, traumatic brain injury, medical comorbidities Special considerations for nursing and allied health professionals.

Abstract Abstract Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is noncardiogenic pulmonary edema that manifests as rapidly progressive dyspnea, tachypnea, and hypoxemia. Diagnostic criteria include onset within one week of a known insult or new or worsening respiratory symptoms, profound hypoxemia, bilateral pulmonary opacities on radiography, and inability to explain respiratory failure by cardiac failure or fluid overload. ARDS is thought to occur when a pulmonary or extrapulmonary insult causes the release of inflammatory mediators, promoting inflammatory cell accumulation in the alveoli and microcirculation of the lung. Inflammatory cells damage the vascular endothelium and alveolar epithelium, leading to pulmonary edema, hyaline membrane formation, decreased lung compliance, and decreased gas exchange. Most cases are associated with pneumonia or sepsis. ARDS is responsible for one in 10 admissions to intensive care units and one in four mechanical ventilations. In-hospital mortality for patients with severe ARDS ranges from 46% to 60%. ARDS often must be differentiated from pneumonia and congestive heart failure, which typically has signs of fluid overload. Treatment of ARDS is supportive and includes mechanical ventilation, prophylaxis for stress ulcers and venous thromboembolism, nutritional support, and treatment of the underlying injury. Low tidal volume and high positive end-expiratory pressure improve outcomes. Prone positioning is recommended for some moderate and all severe cases. As patients with ARDS improve and the underlying illness resolves, a spontaneous breathing trial is indicated to assess eligibility for ventilator weaning. Patients who survive ARDS are at risk of diminished functional capacity, mental illness, and decreased quality of life; ongoing care by a primary care physician is beneficial for these patients. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a rapidly progressive noncardiogenic pulmonary edema that initially manifests as dyspnea, tachypnea, and hypoxemia, then quickly evolves into respiratory failure. Because roughly one-half of intensive care units (ICUs) in the United States are not staffed with intensivists, many family physicians care for patients with ARDS. In addition, family physicians may take on the role of ICU physicians during times of unprecedented threats to the health care system and severe resource shortages.  Enlarge     Print When mechanical ventilation is required, patients with ARDS should be started at lower tidal volumes (6 mL per kg) instead of at traditional volumes (10 to 15 mL per kg). Randomized controlled trial, Cochrane review, and expert guidelines Higher positive end-expiratory pressure values (12 cm H2O) should be considered for initial mechanical ventilation in patients with ARDS. Prone positioning for 12 to 16 hours per day is recommended for patients with severe ARDS. Prophylaxis for venous thromboembolism should be given to all patients hospitalized with ARDS. Enteral feeding should be initiated if a patient is anticipated to be on a ventilator for 72 hours or more. Spontaneous breathing trials guided by a ventilator liberation (weaning) protocol should be initiated once a patient with ARDS begins to improve. = consistent, good-quality patient-oriented evidence; = inconsistent or limited-quality patient-oriented evidence; = consensus, disease-oriented evidence, usual practice, expert opinion, or case series.

For information about the SORT evidence rating system, go to . The Berlin criteria used for the diagnosis of ARDS in adults. These criteria are based on timing of symptom onset (within one week of known clinical insult or new or worsening respiratory symptoms); bilateral opacities on chest imaging that are not fully explained by effusions, lobar or lung collapse, or nodules; the likely source of pulmonary edema (respiratory failure not fully explained by cardiac failure or fluid overload); and oxygenation as measured by the ratio of partial pressure of arterial oxygen (P) to fraction of inspired oxygen (F). ARDS is classified as mild, moderate, or severe based on the following criteria: Mild: 200 mm Hg < P/F ratio ≤ 300 mm Hg with positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) or continuous positive airway pressure ≥ 5 cm HO. Moderate: 100 mm Hg < P/F ratio ≤ 200 mm Hg with PEEP ≥ 5 cm HO. Severe: P/F ratio ≤ 100 mm Hg with PEEP ≥ 5 cm HO. The Pediatric Acute Lung Injury Consensus Conference criteria for ARDS in children are similar to the Berlin criteria but allow for other measures of oxygenation, and they address preexisting lung and heart disease (see Figure 1 at ). Abstract ARDS progresses through several phases after a direct pulmonary or indirect extrapulmonary insult. In the exudative phase, which may last seven to 10 days, alveolar macrophages secrete mediators that lead to accumulation of inflammatory cells in the lung. This accumulation, in combination with neutrophil and alveolar epithelial cell activation, leads to tissue injury. Inflammatory cells migrate across the vascular endothelial and alveolar epithelial surfaces and proinflammatory mediators and chemokines are released, leading to pathologic vascular permeability, gaps in the alveolar epithelial barrier, and necrosis of types I and II alveolar cells. Intravascular coagulation in the alveolar capillaries leads to micro-thrombi. The end result of these changes is pulmonary edema, loss of surfactant, and deposition of dead cells and debris along the alveoli (hyaline membranes), which decrease pulmonary compliance and make gas exchange difficult. Chest radiography may show changes from air space opacification to coarse reticular opacification during this phase .       Chest radiograph of a patient with acute respiratory distress syndrome. Note the bilateral air space opacification and lack of obvious vascular congestion. Chest radiograph of a patient with acute respiratory distress syndrome. Note the bilateral air space opacification and lack of obvious vascular congestion. The proliferative phase begins the process of lung repair over the next two to three weeks. Anti-inflammatory cytokines deactivate inciting neutrophils, which then undergo apoptosis and phagocytosis. Type II alveolar cells proliferate and differentiate into type I cells, reestablishing the integrity of the epithelial lining. Alveolar ion channels and aquaporins are reexpressed, drawing fluid out of the alveoli and into the pulmonary microcirculation and lung lymphatics. Simultaneously, alveolar cells and macrophages remove debris from the alveoli, and endothelial cells reestablish vascular integrity, allowing the lungs to recover. The fibrotic phase, which does not occur in all patients, is characterized by ongoing inflammation, extensive basement membrane damage, persistent edema, intra-alveolar and interstitial fibrosis, and microvascular damage. Shear forces associated with mechanical ventilation may promote the development of the fibrotic phase, although lung protective ventilation is thought to ameliorate this effect. Progression to the fibrotic phase is associated with prolonged mechanical ventilation and increased mortality. Abstract Most cases of ARDS in adults are associated with pneumonia with or without sepsis (60%) or with nonpulmonary sepsis (16%).

According to a retrospective U.S. study, the estimated incidence of ARDS in 2014 was 193.4 cases per 100,000 people. A prospective Canadian study estimated the incidence to be 27.6 cases per 100,000 patient-years. Another study found that ARDS was responsible for 10% of ICU admissions and 23% of mechanical ventilations. Multiorgan failure causes most ARDS-related deaths. Mild, moderate, and severe cases of ARDS are associated with hospital mortality rates of 27% to 35%, 32% to 40%, and 46% to 60%, respectively, and hospitals with higher ARDS case volume have lower ARDS mortality. Risk factors for mortality include older age, worsening multiorgan dysfunction, and higher Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE II) scores (). However, age and APACHE II scores are not associated with mortality from nonpulmonary causes in patients with ARDS. Abstract Because the presenting symptoms of ARDS are nonspecific, physicians must consider other respiratory, cardiac, infectious, and toxic etiologies . The patient history (e.g., comorbidities, exposures, medications) and physical examination focusing on the respiratory and cardiovascular systems can help narrow the differential diagnosis and determine the optimal course of treatment.  Enlarge     Print Decreased air movement, prolonged expiratory phase Jugular venous distension, peripheral edema, third heart sound Fever, cough, diffuse infiltrates, increased eosinophils on bronchoalveolar lavage Acute onset; exposure to inciting organic antigen, such as those found in bird feathers, molds, and dust Acute onset of dyspnea, pleuritic chest pain; tall and thin body habitus History of suicide attempt, hyperventilation, tachycardia, seizure Fever, tachypnea, tachycardia, elevated or depressed white blood cell count *—Pneumonia and sepsis are leading causes of acute respiratory distress syndrome but may be present in patients who do not meet diagnostic criteria for the syndrome.

In many cases, ARDS must be differentiated from congestive heart failure and pneumonia . Unlike ARDS, congestive heart failure is characterized by fluid overload. Patients may have edema, jugular venous distension, a third heart sound, a significantly elevated brain natriuretic peptide level, and a salutary response to diuretics.

Pneumonia is a leading cause of ARDS, and distinguishing patients with uncomplicated pneumonia from those with ARDS can be a diagnostic challenge. In general, patients with uncomplicated pneumonia have signs of systemic and pulmonary inflammation (e.g., fever, chills, fatigue, sputum production, pleuritic chest pain, localized or multifocal infiltrates), and accompanying hypoxia should respond to oxygen administration. ARDS should be suspected if hypoxia does not resolve with supplemental oxygen.

Although mild cases of ARDS may respond to noninvasive ventilation, most patients require sedation, intubation, and ventilation while the underlying injury is treated. Any ventilator mode may be used, and there are multiple guidelines to inform therapy. The respiratory rate, expiratory time, PEEP, and F may be set according to protocols from the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute’s ARDS Network. Settings should be adjusted to maintain an oxygen saturation of 88% to 95%, an arterial pH of 7.30 to 7.45, and a plateau pressure of no more than 30 cm H2O to avoid barotrauma. Starting with low tidal volumes of 6 mL per kg of predicted body weight is superior to starting with traditional volumes of 10 to 15 mL per kg (number needed to treat to prevent death before discharge and for a patient to breathe independently = 11). Guidelines recommend initiating ventilation with low tidal volumes. However, low volumes are associated with higher partial pressures of arterial carbon dioxide (P), and while some hypercapnia is permissible, P of 50 mm Hg or higher is independently associated with mortality. Patients should be followed closely, and adjustments should be made while balancing the preference for low tidal volumes with the risk of excessive increases in arterial carbon dioxide levels (see videos at and ). Higher PEEP values (12 cm HO or higher) are associated with decreased mortality when compared with values of 5 to 12 cm HO (number needed to treat = 20) and should be used in patients with moderate or severe ARDS. Conservative fluid therapy (limiting fluid intake and considering the use of diuretics and albumin) may have some benefit but is not universally recommended. Prone positioning requires moving a patient from the traditional supine position while maintaining the integrity of the patient-ventilator circuit and all venous, arterial, urinary, and other access lines. Although the process is labor intensive and requires special training and beds, it is thought to improve ventilation-perfusion matching by recruiting more lung and allowing each inspired breath to be more uniformly distributed over a greater surface. Prone positioning is recommended for patients with severe ARDS and for those with moderate ARDS whose P/F ratio is less than 150. When this technique is used, the position should be maintained for at least 12 to 16 hours per day. Recruitment maneuvers are temporary elevations in airway pressures intended to expand collapsed lung and increase the surface available for gas exchange. Guidelines offer mixed recommendations on recruitment maneuvers; the more recent ones recommend against them, taking into account a trial that showed increased 28-day mortality rates among patients who underwent lung recruitment. Inhaled nitric oxide is a pulmonary arterial vasodilator that may improve perfusion in ventilated areas and moderate the harmful inflammatory response that occurs in ARDS. It may have a role in patients with refractory disease before extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is considered. ECMO involves using a venoarterial or venovenous circuit to remove blood from the body, introduce oxygen and remove carbon dioxide, then return the blood to the body. Recent guidelines favor the use of ECMO in patients with severe ARDS. A randomized controlled trial found that mortality rates did not improve with the routine use of ECMO in patients with severe ARDS when compared with rescue use of ECMO in patients who do not respond to mechanical ventilation. Extracorporeal carbon dioxide removal also uses a venoarterial or venovenous circuit, but instead of introducing oxygen to the blood, it removes carbon dioxide. The interest in this modality centers around the hypercapnia sometimes associated with the lung-protective ventilation strategies that use low tidal volumes. Guidelines concur that more research is needed before a recommendation can be made about the use of extracorporeal carbon dioxide removal in ARDS. Pharmacologic options for the treatment of ARDS are limited. Surfactant therapy is not recommended for adults or children after the perinatal period. The role of corticosteroids is controversial. A meta-analysis of older studies, some of which enrolled patients with mild cases of ARDS and did not use lung-protective ventilation strategies, found no mortality benefit with corticosteroids. However, a recent multicenter randomized controlled trial in Spain found that a 10-day course of intravenous dexamethasone was associated with fewer deaths at 60 days and more ventilator-free days. The Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines recommend the use of intravenous hydrocortisone, 200 mg per day, in patients with sepsis who are hemodynamically unstable despite fluid administration and vasopressor therapy. Given the evolving literature, it is reasonable to consult with an intensivist about the use of corticosteroids when caring for a patient with ARDS. Patients with ARDS should receive low-molecular-weight heparin, low-dose unfractionated heparin, or fondaparinux (Arixtra) to prevent venous thromboembolism, unless these agents are contraindicated. Patients with an anticipated ventilation requirement of at least 72 hours should be started on enteral nutrition. These feedings may be trophic (usually 10 to 20 mL per hour or 10 to 20 kcal per hour to maintain gut integrity and prevent mucosal atrophy) or as close to nutritional needs as possible. Stress ulcer prophylaxis should also be given. A randomized controlled trial found that intravenous pantoprazole (Protonix), 40 mg per day, decreased clinically important gastrointestinal bleeding compared with placebo. Abstract Patients with ARDS spend an average of 16 days (standard deviation = 15.8) in the ICU and a total of 26 days (standard deviation = 27.7) in the hospital. Patients with an anticipated ventilation requirement of more than 10 days may benefit from tracheostomy. Early tracheostomy (up to eight days after ICU admission) is associated with fewer ventilator days but not reduced long-term mortality. The American Thoracic Society and American College of Chest Physicians recommend a ventilator liberation protocol (also known as a weaning protocol) for patients who have been on mechanical ventilation for more than 24 hours. As the underlying illness resolves and the patient improves, spontaneous breathing trials are indicated; these protocols can reduce the duration of mechanical ventilation and weaning, and can shorten ICU stays.  outlines a set of criteria that can be used to determine whether patients can be weaned from ventilation.  Enlarge     Print Example Spontaneous Breathing Trial: Eligibility and Weaning Parameters Able to meet oxygen requirement with noninvasive methodsHemodynamically stableMinute ventilation ≤ 15 LPositive end-expiratory pressure ≤ 5 cm HO Airway can be protectedHemodynamically stableNo agitationOxygen saturation ≥ 90%Respiratory frequency to tidal volume ratio ≤ 105Respiratory rate ≤ 35 breaths per minute This is one example of a spontaneous breathing trial and weaning parameters.

Abstract Patients on ventilators should be encouraged to participate in mobilization therapy consisting of range-of-motion or resistance activities, sitting, or standing. It may be necessary to reduce sedation to allow patients to participate. Mobilization therapy is associated with fewer ventilator days and a greater likelihood of being able to walk at hospital discharge. Abstract After discharge from the ICU, patients with ARDS may have a lower quality of life, significant weakness from neuropathy or myopathy, persistent cognitive impairment, and delayed return to work. Psychiatric illness is common after ARDS: 17% to 43% of survivors report depression, 21% to 35% report posttraumatic stress disorder, and 23% to 48% report anxiety. Risk factors for poor physical and psychiatric outcomes include a higher APACHE II score, longer time to resolution of lung and multiorgan dysfunction, the use of systemic corticosteroids, and acquisition of illness in the ICU. Not all of the deleterious health effects of ARDS resolve over time. Although lung function approaches normal at five years, six-minute walking distance, physical function, and quality-of-life measures often remain decreased. Many patients report social isolation and sexual dysfunction, and more than one-half report persistent depression, anxiety, or both. Because the more than 100,000 people who survive ARDS each year are left with a significant burden of illness, it is imperative that primary care physicians initiate, coordinate, and monitor continuing services for these patients. Physicians should assess functional status at hospital follow-up and subsequent visits, ensuring that a multidimensional health care team (e.g., physical and occupational therapists, rehabilitation and home health care nurses, subspecialists) is used to promote optimal health and function. Primary care physicians should screen for mental health disorders and treat or refer patients as needed. Abstract ARDS is less common in children and less likely to lead to death. The estimated incidence in children is 2.0 to 12.8 cases per 100,000 person-years, and the estimated mortality rate is 18% to 27%. Risk factors in children are similar to those in adults, including direct and indirect lung injury. Viral respiratory infection is the most common cause of ARDS in children; drowning is also a consideration. Treatment recommendations for children with ARDS are similar to those for adults. The recommended tidal volume is 5 to 8 mL per kg of predicted body weight (3 to 6 mL per kg in those with poor pulmonary compliance) and should be at or below the physiologic tidal volume for age and weight. Recommended PEEP values for children are 10 to 15 cm HO for severe ARDS, and higher as needed if the plateau pressure allows. The plateau pressure should be kept at or below 28 cm HO but may be allowed to reach 32 cm HO for those with reduced compliance. Recruitment maneuvers are recommended in severe cases. High-frequency oscillatory ventilation can be considered for children whose plateau pressures rise above 28 cm HO when reduced chest wall compliance is not a factor. The arterial pH may be allowed to go as low as 7.15 in conjunction with a lung-protective ventilation strategy that incorporates low tidal volumes. As with adults, children with ARDS should be evaluated daily to determine if they are eligible for ventilator weaning. Abstract Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARSCoV-2), is a known cause of ARDS. Clinical guidelines for ARDS care in the setting of COVID-19 have been published by the World Health Organization, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Society of Critical Care Medicine and the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine, and the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD). A full review of COVID-19 and related care is beyond the scope of this article; readers are referred to these guidelines for up-to-date information. In addition to these guidelines, free information on COVID-19 is available from at and Essential Evidence Plus at http://www.essentialevidenceplus.com/content/eee/904. In a series of 24 patients with confirmed COVID-19 in Seattle-area ICUs, 18 required mechanical ventilation and met the criteria for moderate to severe ARDS. Initial F requirements were high, and treatment was similar to that for ARDS without COVID-19. Five patients were treated with prone positioning and seven with neuromuscular blockade. Some patients required vasopressors, but unlike typical treatment for ARDS, some received hydroxychloroquine (Plaquenil), lopinavir/ritonavir (Kaletra), or the investigational antiviral agent remdesivir. None of the patients received glucocorticoids. Of the 18 patients who required mechanical ventilation, nine died by the end of the data collection period, five remained hospitalized, and four had been discharged. The DoD emphasizes early recognition of respiratory failure and the use of high-flow nasal cannulas instead of bilevel positive airway pressure in patients who are amenable to noninvasive management. DoD guidelines recommend the use of full personal protective equipment when intubating a patient with ARDS because of the risk of aerosolization and exposure to SARS-CoV-2. They recommend the ARDS Network’s protocol for PEEP and tidal volume settings, and prone positioning for patients who cannot be adequately ventilated in the supine position. The DoD guidelines do not recommend routine neuromuscular blockade or use of inhaled nitric oxide. Venovenous ECMO is an option for patients with refractory hypoxemia. The World Health Organization likewise recommends early recognition, personal protection during intubation, and low tidal volumes. It encourages plateau pressures less than 30 cm HO, prone positioning, conservative fluid management, higher PEEP values, and avoidance of routine neuromuscular blockade. The Surviving Sepsis Campaign makes similar recommendations: the use of high-flow nasal cannulas over noninvasive positive pressure ventilation in patients with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure, low tidal volumes in those requiring mechanical ventilation, plateau pressures less than 30 cm HO, higher (greater than 10 cm HO) vs. lower PEEP values, a conservative fluid strategy, prone positioning and consideration of neuromuscular blockade for patients with moderate to severe ARDS, and consideration of inhaled pulmonary vasodilators and recruitment maneuvers. ECMO is recommended for patients with refractory hypoxemia. This article updates previous articles on this topic by the , and by .

Introduction Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), the 4th leading cause of death worldwide [1], is characterized by persistent airflow obstruction. Conservative estimates suggest that approximately 30 million people in India currently suffer from COPD [2, 3], which in turn represents the prevalence of the devastating disease and socioeconomic burden. Tobacco smoking is the main risk factor for development of COPD. Other environmental exposures including biomass smoke and air pollution also contribute to the pathogenesis of COPD [4-7]. Tobacco smoke induced COPD is predominant among men in India [8]. The global initiative for chronic obstructive lung disease (GOLD) defines COPD as a ""common, preventable and treatable disease characterized by persistent respiratory symptoms and airflow limitation due to airway and/or alveolar abnormalities usually caused by significant exposure to noxious particles or gases"" [3, 9]. Clinically COPD is diagnosed as a persistent airflow obstruction determined by the ratio of postbronchodilator forced expiratory volume in 1 second/forced vital capacity ([FEV.sub.1]/FVC) of <70% and an [FEV.sub.1] of <80% [3]. Altered host defense mechanism is a hallmark of COPD that is characterized by local as well as systemic alterations of chemokine and cytokine regulation. It is suggested that the inflammatory process originates in the airways and lung parenchyma in COPD which then spills over into the systemic circulation [10-13]. However, correlation between lung inflammation and systemic inflammation as well as the corresponding cytokine balance in COPD has not been consistently observed [14, 15]. It is also considered that the systemic inflammation in COPD might be primarily driven by tobacco smoking as observed in case of cardiovascular diseases [10, 16]. Several proinflammatory cytokines, T-cell cytokines, growth factors, chemokines, and anti-inflammatory cytokines have been implicated in COPD pathogenesis [17, 18]. For example, Interleukin 6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-[alpha]) enhance COPD by increasing inflammation [17, 19-21]. Significantly higher levels of IL-2 have been reported in the plasma of patients with stable COPD compared to rapidly progressing COPD and may influence disease progression [22]. IL-4 might enhance COPD by increasing the production of IgE [23-25]. Granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) also contributes to the enhancement of COPD through increasing the number of neutrophils [26, 27]. Increased levels of IL-8 play a pivotal role in COPD pathogenesis by inducing and sustaining inflammatory response as it is a chemoattractant for neutrophils [28, 29]. Interferon gamma (IFN-[gamma]) decreases the number of Th2 cells thereby enhancing COPD [30]. Increased levels of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 have been associated with reduced COPD exacerbations [31-35]. Thus, it becomes important to assess the systemic and local chemokine and cytokine expression among well-characterized COPD subjects with similar socioeconomic status, geographical location, ethnicity, and exposure particularly in case of developing countries like India which represents enormous diversity. The ""Mysuru studies of Determinants of Health in Rural Adults (MUDHRA)"" in India is an ongoing project taking into consideration the above-mentioned factors to phenotype COPD patients in South India [36-38]. However, biomarker discovery studies along with addressing the abovementioned cohort characterization approach are limited in India. Therefore in this pilot study, we assessed the cytokine concentrations of IL-2, 4, 6, 8, 10, GM-CSF, IFN-[gamma], and TNF-[alpha] using a panel assay in a rural cohort of long-term tobacco smokers with and without COPD. The concentrations of cytokines exhibiting significant difference were further analyzed for correlation to lung function parameters to identify plausible systemic biomarkers for COPD in the study cohort. 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Subject Population. The cohort consisted of 30 tobacco smokers with COPD (TS COPD; moderate: 14, severe: 12, and very severe: 4) and 20 tobacco smokers without COPD (TS CONTROL) dwelling in the same geographical area (Mysuru, Karnataka, India). All subjects were male and current smokers [except 3 subjects in the TS COPD group who quitted smoking 3, 8, and 10 years ago at ages (y) 67, 55, and 62, respectively] and reported chronic bronchitis. The tobacco consumption (pack-years) was matched between the TS COPD and TS CONTROL groups. COPD was diagnosed according to the global initiative for chronic obstructive lung disease (GOLD) criteria of persistent airflow obstruction determined by the ratio of [FEV.sub.1]/FVC of <0.7 and the severity of COPD was classified according to GOLD guidelines. A detailed validated questionnaire based on the burden of obstructive lung disease (BOLD) study translated in regional language (Kannada) was used to assess the exposure scenario and other background information following a house to house visit by trained field workers who had earlier participated in the urban Mysore BOLD study and trained in the BOLD protocol. All subjects were in stable condition and without any reported infection in the previous 4 weeks prior to blood sampling. Subjects with histories of any other respiratory disease like asthma and tuberculosis were excluded. Chest X-ray and sputum for acid-fast staining were done for most chest symptomatics to rule out tuberculosis. Subjects with any reported cardiovascular and metabolic diseases such as diabetes were also excluded. Most of the patients were naive to inhaled corticosteroid/long-acting beta-agonist inhalers (ICS/LABA) and not on any regular medications. They used medications only for managing the intermittent acute exacerbations. This scenario is common in rural India. The demographics of the study cohort are provided in Table 1. The cohort characterization procedure has been previously described [36-38]. 3 ml of venous blood samples was collected from each subject by trained professionals using the venipuncture method in the BD Vacutainer[R] PLUS plastic serum tubes with spray-coated silica. The tubes were incubated in an upright position at room temperature for 30 minutes and centrifuged for 15 minutes at 2500 RPM. The supernatant (serum) was carefully aspirated without disturbing the cell layer into prelabeled cryovials and stored at -80[degrees]C till further use. All procedures of this study were approved by Institutional Ethical Clearance JSS Medical College (JSSMC/IEC/13/4048/20162017), Mysore, Karnataka, India. Informed and written consent was obtained from each subject. 2.2. Cytokine Panel Assay. Concentrations of eight proinflammatory cytokines, IL-2, 4, 6, 8,10, GM-CSF, IFN-[gamma], and TNF-[alpha] were measured using the Bio-Plex Pro Assays 8-Plex assay kit (Bio-Rad, Cat#M50-0007A) and Bio-Plex Multiplex immunoassay system (Biorad Bio-Plex 200) according to the manufacturer's instruction. Bio-Plex Manager[TM] and BioPlex Data Pro[TM] Software were used to analyze the generated multiplex data. All samples were measured in duplicate and the mean of the two measurements was considered. The assay passed the quality control of the manufacturer. Concentrations of cytokines are presented as median (25th75th percentile) pg/ml. Out of range (<OOR) values were considered as the lowest detectable value. There were no >OOR values. Supplementary Table ST1 shows the number of <OOR values for each analyte along with the lowest detectable concentration. Briefly, diluted 50[micro]l of (1X) magnetic beads was added to individual wells of a 96-well plate and adhered using vacuum filtration. After washing, 50[micro]l of prediluted standards and serum samples were added to the respective wells and plate was incubated on a shaker at 850 rpm for 45 min at room temperature. Thereafter, the plate was washed and 25[micro]l prediluted Bio-Plex (1X) detection antibody was added and incubated for 30 minutes. After incubation followed by washing with Bio-Plex assay buffer, 50[micro]l prediluted (1X) streptavidin-conjugated PE was added and incubated for 10 minutes followed by an additional wash with Bio-Plex assay buffer and then 125[micro]l assay buffer was added. Thereafter, the plate was placed for incubation on shaker for 5 minutes at 850 rpm. Then the plate was analyzed using the Bio-Plex Protein Array system and the concentrations of each cytokine were determined using software Bio-Plex 200 based on Luminex technology. 2.3. Statistics. Nonparametric Mann-Whitney U (two-tailed) t-test was performed to determine the statistical significance for the difference of cytokine concentrations between the TS COPD and TS CONTROL groups. Two-tailed nonparametric Spearman rank test was used to analyze the correlation with [FEV.sub.1-pre], [FEV.sub.1-post], [FEV.sub.1-post]/FVC, and pack-years with cytokine concentrations. The correlation study was performed only with the significantly different cytokines (GM-CSF, IFN-[gamma], IL-4, and TNF-[alpha]) among TS COPD and TS CONTROL groups. p<0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. All statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism software (Version: 5) (La Jolla, California). 2.4. Results. Concentrations of GM-CSF, IFN-[gamma], IL-4, and TNF-[alpha] were significantly different among the eight cytokines measured between TS COPD and TS CONTROL in our study cohort (Table 2). The correlation between cytokine concentrations and lung function parameters was weak. Concentrations of significantly different cytokines were not correlated to tobacco consumption (pack-years). 2.5. GM-CSF. Increased GM-CSF concentration (Figures 1(a) and 1(b)) has been detected in TS COPD subjects compared to TS CONTROL in our study cohort [TS COPD: 69.64 (46.67, 97.48); TS CONTROL: 36.78 (30.07, 53.88) pg/ml; p=0.014]. The GM-CSF concentrations correlated inversely with the lung function parameters [FEV.sub.1]/FVC (p=0.003; r=-0.415; Figure 1(c)), [FEV.sub.1-pre] (p=0.038; r=-0.295; Figure 1(d)), and [FEV.sub.1-post] (p=0.030; r=-0.307; Figure 1(e)). 2.6. IFN-[gamma]. The IFN-[gamma] concentrations (Figures 2(a) and 2(b)) were increased in TS COPD subjects compared to TS CONTROL in our study cohort [TS COPD: 51.06 (17.00, 84.86); TS CONTROL: 11.70 (3.18, 32.81) pg/ml; p=0.017]. The IFN[gamma] concentrations correlated inversely with the lung function parameter [FEV.sub.1]/FVC (p=0.008; r=-0.373; Figure 2(c)). 2.7. IL-4. Increased IL-4 concentrations (Figures 3(a) and 3(b)) have been detected in TS COPD subjects compared to TS CONTROL in our study cohort [TS COPD: 9.09 (1.8, 19.9); TS CONTROL: 1.8 (1.8, 4.46) pg/ml; p=0.024]. The IL4 concentrations correlated inversely with the lung function parameters [FEV.sub.1]/FVC (p=0.043; r=-0.287; Figure 3(c)) and [FEV.sub.1-post] (p=0.030; r=-0.307; Figure 3(d)). 2.8. TNF-[alpha]. Increased TNF-[alpha] concentrations (Figures 4(a) and 4(b)) were detected in TS COPD subjects compared to TS CONTROL in our study cohort [TS COPD: 20.68 (5.5, 29.26); TS CONTROL: 3.5 (3.5, 4.5) pg/ml; p<0.001]. The TNF-[alpha] concentrations correlated inversely with the lung function parameters [FEV.sub.1]/FVC (p<0.001; r=-0.459; Figure 4(c)), [FEV.sub.1-pre] (p=0.002; r=-0.436; Figure 4(d)), and [FEV.sub.1-post] (p=0.002; r=-0.435; Figure 4(e)). 3. Discussion Our study included subjects recruited from two villages near Mysuru, Karnataka, India, with similar socioeconomic status and ethnicity. We have been performing COPD phenotyping studies in the same region for the study titled ""Mysuru studies of Determinants of Health in Rural Adults (MUDHRA)"" [35, 36]. A total of 8457 men and women above the age of 30 years from randomly selected 16 villages in rural Mysore district were screened for chronic respiratory diseases. 1692 subjects were invited to participate in pre- and post-bronchodilator spirometry. 1269 participated and 1085 satisfied American Thoracic Society (ATS) criteria. These 1085 subjects make up the MUDHRA cohort and have since been followed up twice with repeat spirometry to monitor the decline in lung functions. The cases and controls in this study were from this cohort. The Indian subcontinent offers a remarkable diversity in regard to ethnicity of people as well as their socioeconomic status. Therefore, in order to perform biomarker discovery studies, consideration of the abovementioned factors becomes crucial. All the eligible subjects answered a validated demographic and clinical questionnaire. Age and gender matched controls underwent pre- and post-bronchodilator spirometry (acceptable spirometry: ATS). Due to cultural reasons, tobacco smoke induced COPD is particularly observed among men in India and most women in rural India do not smoke. Thus, our study was confined to males only. One of the important strengths of the two groups (TS COPD and TS CONTROL) is the matched tobacco consumption, age, socioeconomic status, and dwelling habits. This provided a strong base to carry out our pilot study investigating the systemic concentrations of IL-2, 4, 6, 8,10, GMCSF, IFN-[gamma], and TNF-[alpha] within the two groups. Our analysis identified serum concentrations of GM-CSF, IFN-[gamma], IL-4, and TNF-[alpha] to be significantly increased among TS COPD group compared to TS CONTROL. Even though IL-2, 6, 8, and 10 have been consistently implicated in COPD pathogenesis, similar tobacco consumption among TS COPD and TS CONTROL groups in our study cohort may explain the lack of any difference in their levels. This also highlights the fact that systemic GM-CSF, IFN-[gamma], IL-4, and TNF-[alpha] level alone or in combination may play a crucial role in determining susceptibility for COPD onset among individuals with similar tobacco load in our study cohort. Correlation of GM-CSF, IFN-[gamma], IL-4, and TNF-[alpha] concentrations to [FEV.sub.1-pre], [FEV.sub.1-post], and/ or [FEV.sub.1]/FVC, although weak, further supports our finding. However, we recognize the fact that the generated data on the investigated cytokines from the cell free bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid induced sputum and/ or airway biopsies along with BAL and blood differential cell counts; fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) and arterial oxygen saturation levels would have improved the understanding of our findings. GM-CSF is a key regulator for the differentiation and survival of neutrophils, eosinophils, and macrophages and has been implicated in COPD [18]. It is released by alveolar macrophages of COPD patients [40] and increased concentrations in BAL fluid of patients with COPD are correlated with the increased numbers of neutrophils [27]. Increased systemic GM-CSF levels have been reported in subjects exposed to high levels of particulate matter (PM) particularly PM10 [41, 42]. Tobacco smoke exposed alveolar macrophages produce GM-CSF along with other cytokines that induce the proliferation and release of polymorphonuclear leucocytes and monocytes from the bone marrow [43]. The studies showed that a range of different PMs stimulate alveolar macrophages to produce proinflammatory cytokines, and these cytokines are also increased in the blood of subjects during acute air pollution episodes. This indicates a temporal link between these cytokines and the systemic response. Interestingly, it has been shown that GM-CSF itself is a weak or ineffective direct inducer of inflammatory cytokine production in cells other than macrophages or neutrophils [44]. However, it exerts its effect by increasing cytokine gene expression [45-47] and in particular priming inflammatory cells to amplify their responses to other stimuli such as IFN[gamma] [48,49]. Oudijk et al. [50] reported that progression of COPD to be associated with the activation of neutrophils following cytokine gene expression studies in GM-CSF stimulated peripheral blood neutrophils of healthy subjects and COPD patients. IFN-[gamma] secreting T cells (Th1, Tc1) are increased in the airways of COPD patients [49]. IFN-[gamma] orchestrates the infiltration of Th1 and Tc1 cells in the COPD lungs through the upregulation of the chemokine receptor, CXC-chemokine receptor (CXCR) 3, on these cells and the release of the CXCR3-activating chemokines [51]. Consistent with Th1 responses, IFN-[gamma] levels are elevated in COPD. IFN-[gamma] has been also associated with the development of emphysema in mice [52, 53]. Moermans et al. [54] demonstrated increased release of IFN-[gamma] from the blood leukocytes of COPD patients compared to those of healthy subjects. IFN-[gamma] was detectable in 61% of COPD and only 27% of healthy subjects. Interestingly, 75% of COPD patients producing IFN[gamma] from their sputum cells also released IFN-[gamma] from their blood cells. The enhanced release of IFN-[gamma] in COPD patients supported the role Th1 pathway at the local as well as systemic level. IL-4 is a Th2 cytokine that regulates the differentiation of uncommitted T0 cells to Th2 cells. It also plays an important role in the isotype switching of B cells from IgG to IgE producers [17]. IL-4 expression is increased in the CD8+ cells (Tc2 cells) of bronchoalveolar lavage of COPD patients [18, 24]. Several studies reported the increase of TNF-[alpha] concentrations in the sputum and plasma of COPD patients during acute exacerbations. Increased systemic TNF-[alpha] level has been detected in COPD patients with weight loss due to its secretion from circulating cells [18, 52, 55]. This has been also supported by mouse studies where mice overexpressing pulmonary TNF-[alpha] resulting in emphysema also exhibited increased plasma TNF-[alpha] and muscle wasting [56]. Recently, increased serum TNF-[alpha] level has been also correlated to the severity of airway obstruction among COPD patients [57]. 3.1. Conclusions. Our findings of increased serum GM-CSF, IFN-[gamma], IL-4, and TNF-[alpha] concentrations are consistent with the overall understanding of COPD not only as a lung inflammatory disorder but also as a systemic inflammatory disorder. Oxidative stress, activation of circulating inflammatory cells, and increased levels of circulating inflammatory cytokines are an integral part of the overall phenomenon [54, 58]. It is plausible that systemic GM-CSF, IFN-[gamma], IL-4, and TNF-[alpha] level may serve as COPD predisposition markers among long-term smokers in the investigated population that warrants further studies in larger and multiple independent cohorts.

This increase is due primarily to a global epidemic of tobacco smoking, a leading risk factor for COPD. After reading this protocol, you will understand what causes COPD, how therapy can relieve symptoms and how lifestyle changes can reduce exacerbations. You will also learn about novel therapies and natural compounds that can target some key mechanisms that drive COPD progression, including inflammation and oxidative stress. There is no cure for COPD. However, both pharmacologic and lifestyle management strategies can help improve health status and physical function. What is Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease? Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a lung disease characterized by inflammation and airway obstruction. There is no cure for COPD; the goal of treatment is to slow disease progression, improve health status, prevent exacerbation, and reduce mortality. Smoking is the leading cause of COPD, so quitting is the most crucial step toward preventing or delaying disease progression. COPD encompasses two main conditions: emphysema and chronic bronchitis. Emphysema damages the alveoli in the lungs, while chronic bronchitis is a cough that accompanies airway inflammation. COPD-related lung damage can be caused by oxidative stress, inflammation, and an imbalance in the enzymes that repair cellular damage. Natural interventions such as vitamin D and N-acetylcysteine may help prevent COPD and improve symptoms. What are Risk Factors for Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease? Smoking or exposure to secondhand smoke Exposure to occupational toxins and lung irritants Exposure to solid or biomass fuels (eg, coal and wood smoke) Asthma Genetic defect (alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency) What are Signs and Symptoms of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease? Progressive and chronic coughing Sputum production (phlegm coughed up from airways) Shortness of breath Decreased exercise tolerance Wheezing or grunting respiration “Barrel chest” (later stages) What are Conventional Medical Treatments for Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease? Bronchodilators such as beta-2 agonists (short- or long-acting), methylxanthines, and anticholinergics Corticosteroids Oxygen therapy Surgery Endobronchial valve (EBV) What are Emerging Therapies for Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease? New bronchodilators Phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitors, agents that can reduce airway inflammation Statins What Dietary and Lifestyle Changes Can Be Beneficial for Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease? Quitting smoking Exercise programs and breathing exercises Nutritional support, as weight loss and muscle wasting are common Eating a healthy, well-balance diet including fresh fruits and vegetables What Natural Interventions May Be Beneficial for Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease? Vitamin D. Vitamin D plays an important role in inflammatory responses and airway smooth muscle regulation. Vitamin D deficiency is prevalent in smokers with COPD, and high-dose supplementation improved respiratory muscle strength and exercise capacity in COPD patients. Vitamins A, C, and E. These three vitamins all have antioxidant properties. Low levels of the vitamins are linked with an increased risk of COPD and more severe symptoms. N-acetylcysteine (NAC). NAC is a precursor to glutathione, dissolves mucus, and repairs oxidative damage. NAC treatment reduced symptoms, exacerbations, and declining lung function in COPD patients. Ginseng. Ginseng has been used in traditional Chinese medicine to treat a range of respiratory symptoms. Combining ginseng with conventional treatment improved symptoms and quality of life and reduced exacerbation compared with conventional treatment alone. Sulforaphane. Sulforaphane, a compound found in cruciferous vegetables, may augment the anti-inflammatory effects of corticosteroids in COPD. It can also counteract oxidative stress. Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10). CoQ10 is a powerful antioxidant. A case-control study observed lower CoQ10 levels during exacerbation of COPD, indicating supplementation may be useful. Omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids can protect against harmful inflammatory reactions. A study showed that COPD subjects receiving supplemental omega-3 fatty acids EPA and DHA had less shortness of breath and inflammatory markers in serum and sputum. Essential amino acids. As weight loss and muscle wasting are common in COPD patients, supplementation with essential amino acids, which are central to processes that help sustain muscle mass, can be helpful. Essential amino acids, and especially whey protein as a source, may help with weight gain and physical function. Other natural interventions that may help patients with COPD include Boswellia serrata, resveratrol, zinc, L-carnitine, and melatonin. 2 Introduction Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is an underdiagnosed lung disease characterized by persistent inflammation and airflow obstruction. COPD is preventable and treatable, but not fully reversible (Rabe 2007; GOLD 2011; Bednarek 2008; CDC 2011; NIH MedlinePlus 2012; Kardos 2006; American Thoracic Society 2004). COPD is the fourth-leading cause of death in most industrialized countries and is predicted to become third by 2020 (Cosio 2009). This increase is due primarily to a global epidemic of tobacco smoking, a leading risk factor for COPD (WHO 2008). COPD encompasses two main conditions (GOLD 2011; NIH NHLBI 2010, Fischer 2011): Emphysema, which damages and enlarges the alveoli - the tiny sacs where oxygen transfer takes place in the lungs; and Chronic bronchitis, in which a chronic cough accompanies persistent inflammation of the airways. The goal of COPD treatment is to slow or prevent disease progression, improve exercise tolerance, improve health status, prevent and treat exacerbations, and reduce mortality. Smoking cessation is the most crucial step to prevent COPD or delay its progression (GOLD 2011; NIH-NHLBI 2006). Conventional therapies such as inhaled corticosteroids, inhaled anticholinergics, and beta2-agonists are helpful in treating COPD (Ferri 2012). However, inhaled corticosteroids may increase the risk of pneumonia (Spencer 2011) and osteoporosis (Leib 2011), and inhaled anticholinergics may increase the risk of death (Singh 2011). After reading this protocol, you will understand what causes COPD, how therapy can relieve symptoms, and how lifestyle changes can reduce exacerbations. You will also learn about novel therapies and natural compounds that can target some key mechanisms that drive COPD progression, including inflammation and oxidative stress. 3 Understanding The Causes Of COPD Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is a slowly progressing disease that often develops over decades as a result of chronic exposure to inhaled irritants, which trigger an inflammatory response in the lungs (Rabe 2007). In a typical case, a patient will experience declining lung function for many years before being diagnosed with COPD and receiving therapy. During this time, the lungs are undergoing several changes characteristic of COPD (Crawford 2008). Three pathologic processes play a significant role in COPD-related lung damage: (1) oxidative stress, (2) inflammation, and (3) an imbalance in enzymes (e.g., proteases ) involved in cell injury and repair (Fischer 2011). The bulk of lung tissue is composed of alveoli - tiny air sacs where the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide takes place. Having a large surface area and blood supply makes the lungs susceptible to oxidative injury caused by reactive oxygen species (ROS) and free radicals either in air pollutants or released through metabolic processes. Cigarette smoke itself contains numerous oxidizing agents (Loukides 2011). As a first line of defense, the lungs produce antioxidants such as glutathione, catalases, and peroxidases to detoxify the reactive species. However, in COPD, increased oxidant burden and/or decreased antioxidant defense causes an imbalance (oxidative stress) between the amount of ROS and the body's ability to neutralize them (Stanojkovic 2011). Oxidative stress can cause the air sacs to become less elastic, and the extracellular matrix of the lungs to become damaged (Loukides 2011; Fischer 2011). The underlying cause of COPD damage is an inflammatory response mounted by the immune system. Chronic exposure to an irritant (e.g., cigarette smoke) causes inflammatory cells (e.g., neutrophils, macrophages, eosinophils) to gather in the airspaces of the lung. In response to the toxins, macrophages release inflammatory chemicals and begin to recruit more immune-system cells, which in turn release more inflammatory chemicals as well as protease enzymes that degrade the extracellular matrix (Fischer 2011; GOLD 2011; Mosenifar 2011). The two main disease types encompassing COPD are emphysema and chronic bronchitis (Fischer 2011). Emphysema Emphysema occurs when alveoli enlarge and cluster. This process destroys the air sacs where gas exchange occurs. As tissue walls become damaged and disintegrate, the alveoli expand and coalesce into larger, thinner-walled air sacs (i.e., blebs or bullae). As the walls lose their elasticity, the lung tissues become less efficient gas chambers. Gas exchange for oxygen and carbon dioxide worsens as the disease progresses. With weakened air sacs, the airway collapses during expiration (breathing out) causing airway obstruction (Crawford 2008; GOLD 2011). Chronic Bronchitis As inflammatory cells migrate to the midsize airways, mucus glands in the lungs become enlarged, causing more mucus production and cough. Over time, the bronchial walls thicken, airways narrow (becoming deformed), and airflow becomes more limited (Crawford 2008; GOLD 2011). A number of airway changes occur, including hypertrophy (increase in size) of smooth muscle cells, fibrosis (formation of scar tissue) in the airway walls, and infiltration of inflammatory cells. The term for the lung damage and inflammation of the mucus membrane in the airways is chronic bronchitis. Chronic bronchitis is diagnosed by the presence of cough and sputum production for at least 3 months in each of two consecutive years (GOLD 2011). Because changes in the lungs develop incrementally, symptoms appear gradually and may be present for many years before medical treatment is initiated. Progressive and chronic coughing, sputum production, and shortness of breath (dyspnea) are the characteristic symptoms of COPD. A majority of people with COPD also suffer from other medical conditions (e.g., heart disease, osteoporosis, anemia, metabolic syndrome, diabetes, depression, respiratory infections, wasting of the skeletal muscles, and lung cancer) that can affect prognosis (GOLD 2011; Divo 2012). Poor lung function and poor nutrition may also exacerbate muscle weakness, abnormalities in fluid and electrolyte balance, and depression (GOLD 2011; Decramer 2012). 4 Causes And Risk Factors Smoking is a primary risk factor for COPD, accounting for up to 75% of all COPD cases globally. Genetics, occupational exposures to gases & fumes, and exposure to biofuel account for the remaining cases (Salvi 2009; ICSI 2011). People exposed to more than one risk factor can develop COPD earlier, or have more severe symptoms and exacerbations (GOLD 2011). Smoking More than half of all long-term smokers will develop COPD (Mannino 2007; IOM 2011). Moreover, life-long cigarette smokers have a significantly higher rate of decline in lung function, are more likely to develop COPD with age, and more frequently die of COPD compared to non-smokers (Rennard 2006; Kohansal 2009). Secondhand smoke is an independent risk factor for COPD (Eisner 2010; Jordan 2011). Evidence shows that COPD risk doubled among never-smokers exposed to secondhand tobacco smoke for more than 20 hours/week (Jordan 2011). Occupational Exposure Occupational exposure is another risk factor in the development of COPD. Studies show that toxic gases in the workplace, such as chemical dust and fumes in factories, can increase the risk of COPD (Mannino 2007; Salvi 2009) and severe exacerbations of COPD (Rodriguez 2008). Biomass Fuel Globally, and especially in low- to middle-income countries, another important risk factor for COPD may be exposure to air pollutants such as solid or biomass fuels (e.g., coal, straw, animal dung, and wood) (Mannino 2007; Salvi 2009). Of these fuels, wood smoke, followed by mixed biomass smoke, is the most notable COPD risk factor (Kurmi 2010). Asthma (Bronchial Hyperresponsiveness) Childhood asthma is a risk factor for the development of COPD later in life, and asthma in the elderly shares many similarities with COPD (e.g., shortness of breath, wheezing, coughing, decline in lung function and treatment options) (Eisner 2010; Mannino 2011; GOLD 2011). Also, airway obstruction becomes more severe with long-term asthma. Therefore, it is necessary for doctors to distinguish the two conditions in order to properly diagnose and manage them (Tzortzaki 2011). Clinically distinguishing asthma and COPD is typically straightforward among middle-age and younger people. However, in the elderly, especially those who smoke, differentiating between the two conditions can be difficult using standard clinical lung function assessments. More comprehensive diagnostic testing, including allergy testing, CT scanning of the lungs, and advanced biomarker analyses that characterize COPD vs. asthma based upon the profile of inflammatory mediators in the blood, allow modern clinicians to confidently categorize most patients (Tzortzaki 2011, Hanania 2011). Treatment response can also aid in the differentiation of the two conditions. For example, asthma is typically significantly reversible using bronchodilators, while COPD is only minimally reversible (Tzortzaki 2011). Alpha-1-Antitrypsin Deficiency Alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency is a rare (up to 3% of COPD patients), inherited cause of COPD, occurring primarily in individuals of northern European descent. This genetic defect causes the body to produce a decreased amount of the protein alpha-1-antitrypsin, which normally prevents neutrophil elastase from damaging the alveoli. Emphysema typically develops by early middle age in people with severe alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency, especially in those who smoke (Merck Manual 2008; American Lung Assc. 2011; Fregonese 2008; Ferri 2012). 5 Diagnosis Physicians typically consider COPD in patients with chronic cough, sputum production, shortness of breath, decreased exercise tolerance, and a history of exposure to tobacco smoke (GOLD 2011). Early in the disease, physical examination(s) may be normal. Later in the disease, however, the classic ""barrel chest"" may occur due to residual air trapped in the lungs, leading to their hyperinflation. In addition, the increased effort required to exhale can produce wheezing, while pursed lips or grunting respirations may signal efforts to keep the airways open by increasing pressure at the beginning of expiration (Crawford 2008; GOLD 2011; ICSI 2011). Also, severe to very severe COPD commonly results in fatigue, weight loss and anorexia (GOLD 2011). Spirometry is the gold standard for diagnosing and monitoring progression of COPD. This breathing test includes forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) - the greatest volume of air that can be breathed out in the first second of a large breath, and the forced vital capacity (FVC) - the greatest volume of air that can be breathed out in a whole large breath. In healthy people, at least 70% of the FVC comes out in the first second (i.e., the FEV1/FVC ratio is >70%). In fact, the FEV1/FVC ratio <70% is a diagnostic characteristic of COPD (Nathell 2007; GOLD 2011). Other tests (e.g., x-rays, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging) may be performed if complications such as pneumonia are suspected. The serum alpha-1-antitrypsin level may also be measured to detect alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency. This testing may be especially considered for individuals of northern European descent with a personal history of COPD before age 50, family history of COPD or emphysema, and limited exposure to inhalants or irritants (Serapinas 2012; American Lung Assc. 2011; Merck Manual 2008). Exacerbations of COPD often develop following a viral upper respiratory or tracheal infection. Assessment of COPD exacerbations is based upon the degree of airflow limitation, duration or worsening of new symptoms, and number of previous episodes. Clinical tests (e.g., electrocardiography, blood count, and presence of infections) may also be performed to assess the severity of an exacerbation (GOLD 2011). 6 Treatment for COPD There is no cure for COPD. However, both pharmacologic and lifestyle management strategies can help improve health status and physical function (GOLD 2011; Collins 2012). According to the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD), effective COPD management has the following goals (GOLD 2011): Preventing disease progression Relieving symptoms Improving exercise tolerance and health status Preventing and treating complications and exacerbations Reducing mortality Pharmacologic Therapy Bronchodilators Bronchodilators are the first-line therapy for mild COPD. Bronchodilators relax airway smooth muscles, making it easier to breathe. Treatment may begin with a rescue bronchodilator used ""as needed"" during mild episodes of COPD. In more severe COPD, combination bronchodilator therapy (i.e., a rescue bronchodilator combined with a controller [long-acting] bronchodilator) may help relieve symptoms (ICSI 2011; GOLD 2011). Bronchodilators include the following: Beta2-agonists. Short-acting beta2-adrenergic agonists (SABAs) (e.g., albuterol and levalbuterol) are rescue medications used ""as-needed"" to relieve acute symptoms by relaxing airway smooth muscles (Barnes 2002). The effect(s) of SABAs are immediate, but usually wear off within 4 to 6 hours. Long-acting beta2-adrenergic agonists (LABAs) (e.g., salmeterol and indacaterol) are effective for 12 or more hours (GOLD 2011). LABAs can significantly reduce exacerbations and improve respiratory health, but do not reduce hospitalization or mortality (Calverley 2007). Side effects of beta-2-agonists include increased heart rate and blood pressure, trembling, and cardiac arrhythmias (Littner 2011). Anticholinergics (e.g., ipratropium and tiotropium) prevent contraction of airway smooth muscle and can reduce exacerbations as well as improve symptoms and health status (Barnes 2004; Tashkin 2008; GOLD 2011). The main side effect of anticholinergics is dry mouth. A comprehensive review showed that tiotropium mist inhaler is associated with a 50% increased risk of death in people with COPD (Singh 2011). Another study showed the use of anticholinergic inhalers increased risk of acute urinary retention among COPD patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) (i.e., benign enlargement of the prostate) (Stephenson 2011). Methylxanthines (e.g., theophylline) are a group of alkaloids commonly used for their effects as mild stimulants and bronchodilators (Minor 1994). They are not as well tolerated as inhaled LABAs. Side effects include headache, insomnia, nausea, heartburn, and abnormal cardiac rhythms (which have potential to be fatal in some individuals) (GOLD 2011). Corticosteroids Inhaled steroid medications (e.g., fluticasone and budenoside) reduce airway inflammation and frequency of exacerbation(s). They can be effective in severe COPD, especially that which co-occurs with asthma (Barnes 2010b; Roche 2011). At low doses, regular use can improve symptoms, lung function, and quality of life. Side effects include hoarse voice, cough, and oral fungal infection (Irwin 2006). Inhaled corticosteroids may also increase the risk of pneumonia and impair bone health (Barnes 2010b; Spencer 2011). Combining inhaled corticosteroids with a LABA significantly reduces morbidity and mortality in COPD when compared to steroids alone, although much of the benefit may be due to the LABA (Barnes 2010b; Nannini 2007). Oral corticosteroids (e.g., prednisone, prednisolone), due to their adverse effects (e.g., muscle weakness and respiratory failure), are not recommended for long-term use in patients with COPD (GOLD 2011). Surgery and Other Treatments Oxygen therapy. Long-term oxygen therapy may be recommended for severe COPD when oxygen levels during rest fall below the normal threshold twice over a three-week period, or if there is evidence of pulmonary hypertension or failure. Stable but very severe COPD may require ventilator support to improve survival (GOLD 2011). Surgery. Surgery is a viable treatment in a small subset of carefully selected patients with severe COPD (Van Raemdonck 2010; Gulati 2013). Bullectomy. In a bullectomy procedure, large air sacs (bullae) that have been damaged by emphysema are removed. Surgical removal of these bullae can help restore lung volume and allow the remaining healthy parts of the lung to function better. Lung volume reduction surgery (LVRS). In LVRS damaged tissue of the lung(s) is removed. LVRS can improve lung function, overall health status, and survival; however, it is indicated only for a small portion of patients with end-stage COPD who no longer respond to more conservative measures (Clarenbach 2015; Criner 2018). LVRS, while being a high-risk procedure with a high frequency of adverse effects and increased mortality risk in the short-term, is associated with a survival benefit long-term (van Agteren 2016). Lung transplantation. Lung transplantation can improve quality of life and survival for those with very severe, end-stage COPD. However, the survival benefit is typically limited, and complications can include an increased risk of lung cancer (and other cancers, due to the subsequent need for lifelong therapy with immunosuppressive drugs) (GOLD 2011; Lane 2015; Olland 2018). Endobronchial valve. In 2018, the FDA approved a novel device called the Zephyr Endobronchial Valve (EBV) for the treatment of COPD. The Zephyr EBV, which is placed into the airway during a minimally invasive bronchoscopic procedure, directs airflow toward healthy lung tissue and away from lung tissue damaged by emphysema. This improves overall lung efficiency. The EBV has been clinically shown to be comparable to LVRS for FEV1 and six-minute walk distance but has a 38% lower mortality risk and less overall adverse effects (PulmonX 2018). The multi-center, randomized, controlled LIBERATE trial compared the Zephyr EBV device with standard care. One hundred twenty-eight trial participants with severe emphysema underwent an EBV-placement procedure, and 62 patients received standard care and served as controls. The main endpoint in the trial was an improvement in lung function (as measure by FEV1) of at least 15%. Forty-eight percent of subjects in the EBV group achieved this endpoint at 12 months post-intervention versus only 17% of control subjects. The Zephyr EBV also resulted in significant improvement in clinical measures of functional ability and respiratory health. Lung collapse (pneumothorax) is one possible complication of the EBV device. It occurred in roughly 25% of subjects in the LIBERATE trial who received the device. Fortunately, the majority of cases occurred soon after the procedure and were managed successfully; the development of pneumothorax did not prevent long-term benefit from the procedure (Criner 2018). Since COPD increases susceptibility to lower respiratory tract infections, preventive vaccines, such as pneumococcal and influenza vaccinations, are recommended in all COPD cases (ICSI 2011). Data show long-term use of antibiotics does not affect the frequency of exacerbations. Unless used to treat bacterial infections, antibiotics are not recommended for long-term COPD therapy (GOLD 2011). Lifestyle And Dietary Management Smoking Cessation Quitting smoking is the most important step to prevent or slow down the progress of COPD. Comprehensive smoking cessation programs include counseling, organized ""quit"" plans, and when necessary, nicotine replacement therapy (e.g., gum, skin patches, and other methods). The National Network of Tobacco Cessation Quit lines at 1-800-QUITNOW (1-800-784-8669) can provide smokers in every state access to information and support to quit smoking (NCI 2012). Avoiding secondhand smoke and air pollutants that contribute to COPD symptoms and exacerbations of the disease are also beneficial (GOLD 2011). Although tobacco smoking cessation can help slow disease progression and prevent exacerbations in some cases of severe or very severe COPD, with cardiovascular and respiratory benefits becoming evident within one year of cessation, lung function will not be completely restored by stopping smoking (Godtfredsen 2011). Pulmonary Rehabilitation Exercise Programs. Air passage obstruction in COPD causes the lungs and heart to work harder to carry oxygen throughout the body. General muscle wasting also becomes a risk as COPD progresses. Exercise programs can strengthen chest muscles and facilitate breathing, reduce depression and anxiety related to COPD, and improve recovery along with health status after hospitalization (de Blasio 2012). Multidisciplinary pulmonary rehabilitation programs provide well-monitored exercise programs. Breathing exercises. Breathing exercises induce relaxation and make breathing easier. Pursed-lip breathing stimulates relaxation, increases oxygen intake and prevents shortness of breath. It has been shown to increase exercise and walking endurance, as well as shorten recovery time(s) in patients with moderate to severe COPD (Faager 2008). Breathing exercises are an important part of a COPD rehabilitation program. Respiratory therapists work closely with physicians to personalize the best regimen for each individual. Diet and COPD Progressive weight loss, muscle wasting, and malnutrition are common with moderate to severe COPD (Collins 2012; de Blasio 2012). Nutritional support can contribute to weight gain and muscle mass restoration in COPD (Collins 2012). In a three-year, randomized, controlled COPD trial, higher intake of antioxidant-rich foods (i.e., fresh fruits and vegetables) resulted in significantly improved pulmonary function while an unrestricted diet resulted in lung function decline (Keranis 2010). Further, a large study showed that a healthy diet (i.e., fruits, vegetables, fish and whole-grains) was associated with lower risk of COPD (Varraso 2010). 7 Novel And Emerging Therapies Despite use of current treatments, lung function continues to decline in long-term COPD. Therefore, new classes of drugs and/or non-pharmacological therapies to reduce disease progression are needed (Barnes 2010a; Matera 2012a). Several novel drug therapies are being developed that may offer benefit to people with COPD. New bronchodilators Indacaterol (Arcapta Neohaler®), an ultra-long-acting beta2-agonist, was FDA approved in July 2011 (FDA 2012). It is a bronchodilator with rapid-onset action that remains effective for 24 hours or longer. In clinical trials, a once-daily treatment of indacaterol significantly improved shortness of breath and lung function, exercise endurance, and lung hyperinflation compared to placebo among COPD patients. Also, fewer subjects receiving indacaterol experienced COPD worsening compared to placebo (McKeage 2012; Steiropoulos 2012; Roig 2009). Glycopyrronium bromide, a novel anticholinergic with rapid-onset action that lasts for 24 hours, is being investigated as a new COPD treatment (EMA 2012). In a clinical trial among COPD patients, significant improvement in forced expiratory volume (FEV1) occurred 5 minutes after dosing and continued to be evident through week 26 of treatment (D'Urzo 2011). Anti-inflammatory Agents Phosphodiesterase-4 (PDE-4) inhibitors can be used to reduce airway inflammation and exacerbations in severe to very severe COPD with a history of exacerbation and chronic bronchitis. A majority of clinical trials used roflumilast (Daxas®) and cilomilast (Ariflo®), second-generation oral PDE-4 inhibitors. Roflumilast, in particular, is approved in the United States, Canada, and European Union (Diamant 2011). Adverse side effects of PDE-4 inhibitors are nausea, diarrhea, weight loss, sleep problems, and headache (Diamanti 2011). A safety concern with the anti-inflammatory agents under development is their ability to affect innate immunity, potentially increasing the risk of lung infection and perhaps cancer among people predisposed to COPD (Barnes 2008). Statins Statins, which treat cardiovascular disease by lowering cholesterol and combatting inflammation, may have potential as a therapy for COPD exacerbations (Matera 2012b; Bartziokas 2011). Statins possess a variety of biological functions including modulation of the inflammatory response, as well as tissue remodeling pathways, both of which are of potential benefit in treating COPD. Analysis of a large randomized trial on statins and cardiovascular disease found that treatment with pravastatin (Pravachol®) reduced exacerbations and death due to COPD (Heart Protection Study 2005). Another randomized trial found that pravastatin use for 6 months improved exercise performance in COPD (Lee 2008). A prospective trial reported that statin treatment in the first year after hospitalization for COPD exacerbation reduced risk and severity of exacerbations and improved quality of life (Bartziokas 2011). 8 Targeted Nutritional Strategies Vitamin D The mechanism by which vitamin D affects the pathogenesis of COPD is unclear. However, studies show that vitamin D can modulate the activity of various immune cells (Herr 2011), inhibit inflammatory responses (Hopkinson 2008), and regulate airway smooth muscles (Banerjee 2012). A review of molecular and animal experiments showed that vitamin D regulates airway contraction, inflammation, and remodeling in airway smooth muscles characteristic of COPD (Banerjee 2012). A cross-sectional study found that higher plasma levels of vitamin D are associated with increased bone mineral density and exercise capacity in people with COPD (Romme 2012). Evidence also showed that high dose vitamin D supplementation improved respiratory muscle strength and exercise capacity in people with COPD (Hornikx 2011). A study among 414 smokers with COPD showed that vitamin D deficiency is highly prevalent in this population, and correlates with disease severity. The study also found that genetic determinants for low vitamin D levels were associated with an increased risk of COPD (Janssens 2010). Other COPD intervention studies are underway to examine the effect(s) of 3,000 – 6,000 IU of vitamin D3 on rehabilitation (NCT01416701), as well as time to first upper respiratory infection and first moderate-to-severe exacerbation (NCT00977873) (clinicaltrials.gov 2012). Antioxidants: Vitamins A, C, and E Vitamin A plays a role in proper lung development (in the embryonic stage) and repair of damaged lung tissue. Animal models showed that mice with low vitamin A levels were more likely to develop emphysema after 3 months of exposure to cigarette smoke compared to mice with normal vitamin A levels (Van Eijl 2011). In one study, high dietary vitamin A intake (greater than 2,770 IU daily) was associated with a 52% reduction in risk of COPD (Hirayama 2009). Vitamin E levels are low in smokers, increasing their susceptibility to free radical damage (Bruno 2005). A 10-year, randomized, population-based trial of 38,597 healthy women reported that supplementing with 600 IU of vitamin E reduced the risk of chronic lung disease by 10% (Agler 2011). A review of population studies reported that low levels of vitamins E and C were associated with more wheezing, phlegm, and dyspnea. Levels of vitamins E and A were significantly lower during acute exacerbations of COPD compared to stable COPD (Tsiligianni 2010). A case-control study showed that people with COPD had significantly lower serum levels of vitamins A, C, E, and carotenoids compared to healthy controls. The COPD group also had higher white blood cell DNA damage and consumed fewer vegetables and fruits than the healthy group (Lin 2010). N-acetylcysteine (NAC) N-acetylcysteine (NAC), a glutathione precursor, can dissolve mucus (mucolytic properties) and repair damage caused by reactive oxygen species (Sadowska 2007; Sadowska 2012). A comprehensive review of studies reported that oral NAC lowered the risk of exacerbations and improved symptoms in patients with chronic bronchitis compared to placebo (Stey 2000). NAC (600 mg) given twice daily for two months reduced the oxidant burden in the airways of people with stable COPD (De Benedetto 2005). Experimental and clinical studies also showed that NAC can reduce symptoms, exacerbations, and slow declining lung function in COPD (Dekhuijzen 2006). Treating moderate-to-severe COPD with 1,200 mg of oral NAC daily for 6 weeks improved performance on lung function tests after exercise. NAC treatment also reduced air trapping in the lungs compared to placebo (Stav 2009). Clinical evidence indicates that administering 1,200 to 1,800 mg of NAC daily counteracts oxidative stress among subjects with COPD (Foschino 2005; De Benedetto 2005). In contrast, a large multi-center COPD trial reported no difference between NAC and placebo in the decline of lung function. However, those taking NAC who were not on corticosteroids appeared to have fewer exacerbations (Decramer 2005). A clinical trial is underway to investigate the effect of adding 1,200 mg of NAC daily to standard treatment to reduce air trapping and exacerbations in stable COPD (NCT01136239). Ginseng Ginseng has traditionally been used in Chinese medicine to treat a wide range of respiratory symptoms (An 2011). A review of twelve small randomized studies showed that ginseng may be a potential adjunct therapy in patients with COPD. Oral ginseng formula combined with pharmacotherapy improved respiratory symptoms and quality of life, and reduced exacerbation of COPD compared to placebo, non-ginseng formula, or pharmacotherapy alone (An 2011). These results confirmed a previous study on the effects of 200 mg of ginseng extract daily on pulmonary function tests (Gross 2002). Pulmonary function and exercise capacity were significantly improved among people with moderate-to-severe COPD taking ginseng extract compared to placebo. A 2011 article reported that there is a large, multi-center, randomized, controlled study underway to evaluate the safety and efficacy of 200 mg of standardized root extract of Panax ginseng daily for 24 weeks among people with moderate COPD (Xue 2011). Sulforaphane Emerging evidence shows that sulforaphane, a compound in broccoli and other cruciferous vegetables, can potentially augment the anti-inflammatory effects of corticosteroids in COPD (Malhotra 2011). A study showed that histone deacetylase 2 (HDAC2), an enzyme that enables corticosteroids to reduce inflammation, was low in the lung tissue of people with COPD (Cosio 2004; Barnes 2006). Evidence revealed that sulforaphane can restore corticosteroid sensitivity and increase the activity of HDAC2 (Malhotra 2011). Sulforaphane can also counteract oxidative stress by activating Nrf2, a chemical pathway involved in protecting cells from oxidative stress caused by cigarette smoke and other irritants (Harvey 2011; Malhotra 2011; Starrett 2011). Coenzyme Q10 Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) is a powerful antioxidant (Quinzii 2010). Indirect evidence shows potential benefit of supplementation in people with COPD who have low CoQ10 levels (Tanrikulu 2011). A case-control study showed that CoQ10 levels were lower and oxidative stress markers increased during exacerbation of COPD, indicating an imbalance in antioxidant defense during those periods. The authors suggest supplementation with CoQ10 may reduce COPD exacerbation (Tanrikulu 2011). A study of the effects of CoQ10 on the exercise performance of athletes and non-athletes showed that plasma levels of CoQ10 increased after 2 weeks of supplementation. Participants who supplemented with COQ10 also experienced less fatigue and increased muscle performance compared to placebo (Cooke 2008). These results support a previous study wherein CoQ10 supplementation (90 mg daily for 8 weeks) improved exercise performance in people with COPD (Fujimoto 1993). Omega-3 Fatty Acids Omega-3 fatty acids such as eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) help protect against damaging inflammatory reactions, build healthy cell membranes, and repair tissues (Calder 2012; Calder 2002; Odusanwo 2012). Omega-6 fatty acids, such as linoleic acid (LA) and arachidonic acid (AA), mediate pro-inflammatory activities (Calder 2002). A study of clinically stable COPD reported that high dietary intake of omega-3 fatty acids decreased the risk of elevated blood inflammatory markers in COPD, while higher dietary intake of omega-6 fatty acids increased the risk of elevated inflammatory markers (de Batlle 2012). EPA and DHA supplementation can reduce the destructive effects of chronic inflammation (Calder 2012). One study showed a significant improvement in shortness of breath and a decrease in inflammatory markers in serum and sputum in a COPD group receiving omega-3 supplementation compared with controls (Matsuyama 2005). Boswellia serrata Cell culture and animal studies report that boswellic acids, specifically acetyl-11-keto-beta-boswellic acid (AKBA), from boswellia serrata can inhibit two enzymes involved in inflammation: 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX) and cathepsin G (catG) (Siddiqui 2011; Abdel-Tawab 2011). 5-LOX stimulates the manufacture of pro-inflammatory leukotrienes and promotes the migration of inflammatory cells to the inflamed body area. 5-LOX has been shown to cause bronchoconstriction and promote inflammation (Siddiqui 2011). Cathepsin is a protein-degrading enzyme that attracts T cells and other leukocytes (white blood cells) at the sites of injury (Abdel-Tawab 2011). Animal studies showed that synthetic cathepsin inhibitors reduced smoke-induced airway inflammation (Maryanoff 2010) as well as airway hyperresponsiveness and inflammation (Williams 2009). Studies in asthma suggest an anti-inflammatory role for Boswellia serrata in pulmonary disease. For instance, a randomized controlled trial showed that daily treatment with Boswellia serrata extract (BSE) increased the lung function of people with asthma compared to a control group (Gupta 1998). Resveratrol Resveratrol, a molecule found in red wine, grapes, and Japanese knotweed, has antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties that may protect against COPD and asthma (Wood 2010). A cell culture study found that resveratrol inhibited the release of all measured inflammatory mediators (cytokines) from immune cells extracted from the alveoli of smokers and non-smokers with COPD. In contrast, the corticosteroid dexamethasone did not inhibit the release of some cytokines in smokers with COPD (Knobloch 2011). Moreover, while resveratrol attenuated the release of inflammatory mediators in airway smooth muscle cells, it preserved signaling of a protein called vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), which may be protective against emphysema. Meanwhile, although corticosteroids significantly reduced inflammatory mediators, they also suppressed VEGF signaling (Knobloch 2010). In another study, resveratrol inhibited inflammatory cytokine release from alveolar macrophages in smokers and non-smokers with COPD in a dose-dependent manner (Culpitt 2003). Zinc The concentration of zinc is lower-than-normal in people with COPD; the level is even lower in severe cases (Herzog 2011). A clinical trial showed that critically ill people with COPD spent significantly less time on mechanical ventilation after receiving an intravenous cocktail of selenium, manganese and zinc, compared to those who did not (El-Attar 2009). Another study demonstrated that treatment with 22 mg of zinc picolinate for 8 weeks significantly increased the levels of an important antioxidant, superoxide dismutase, in COPD patients (Kirkil 2008). L-carnitine Respiratory infections increase the frequency and severity of exacerbations. L-carnitine modulates immune function, supports fatty acid and glucose metabolism, and may prevent wasting syndrome (Manoli 2004; Ferrari 2004; Alt Med Rev 2005; Silverio 2011). In one clinical trial, 2 grams of L-carnitine daily improved exercise tolerance and the strength of respiratory muscles in people with COPD. Blood lactate level, which is associated with muscle fatigue, was also reduced with L-carnitine supplementation (Borghi-Silva 2006; Cooke 1983). Essential Amino Acids and Whey Protein COPD is associated with muscle wasting and weight loss (i.e., sarcopenia, cachexia), especially in elderly people; and a higher degree of wasting predicts mortality in this population (Franssen 2008; Slinde 2005). Supplementation with essential amino acids, which are central to anabolic processes that help sustain muscle mass with advancing age, may help combat wasting in aging people with COPD (Dal Negro 2010). In a 12-week study involving 32 COPD patients aged 75 (mean) with impaired lung function, supplementation with 8 grams of essential amino acids daily lead to gains of body weight and fat free mass, as well as improved physical function and several biomarkers compared to placebo (Dal Negro 2010). Whey protein is a good source of essential amino acids and evidence indicates that whey protein may support muscle protein synthesis even more so than its constituent essential amino acids among an aging population (Katsanos 2008). Melatonin Poor sleep quality is prevalent among individuals with COPD, and oxidative stress is a significant contributor to lung deterioration and disease progression (Gumral 2009; Nunes 2008). Since the hormone melatonin is both a powerful antioxidant and a regulator of the sleep-wake cycle, it has received interest within the COPD research community for its potential to target these two important aspects of the disease (Pandi-Perumal 2012; Srinivasan 2009). Observational data indicate that melatonin levels decline and oxidative stress increases during COPD exacerbations (Gumral 2009). Clinical trials have shown that administering 3 mg of melatonin to COPD patients improves sleep quality and attenuates oxidative stress (de Matos Cavalcante 2012; Shilo 2000; Nunes 2008).
