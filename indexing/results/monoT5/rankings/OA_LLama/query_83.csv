Multiple Sclerosis: Signs of Multiple Sclerosis Relapse When you experience a multiple sclerosis relapse (also known as an exacerbation or flare-up), it's because new damage in the brain or spinal cord disrupts nerve signals. That's why you might notice new symptoms or the return of old symptoms. A true relapse lasts more than 24 hours and happens at least 30 days after any previous relapses. Relapses vary in length, severity, and symptoms. Over time, symptoms should improve. Many people recover from their relapses without treatment. Damage to the protective covering of nerve fibers interrupts normal signals from the brain to the body. When those signals are disrupted, your body doesn't function like it once did. Things you did easily before can seem difficult -- like opening a jar or turning a doorknob. Sudden or worsening weakness that doesn't go away could mean you're having a relapse. If your vision is blurred or you're seeing double, you could be starting to relapse. Some people also lose their depth or color perception as the optic nerve becomes inflamed. Taking a hot shower or bath or having a viral infection like the flu can sometimes trigger vision problems, but these are only temporary and should go away within a day. Numbness is one of the most common signs of a multiple sclerosis relapse. You can lose so much feeling that it's hard to use your hands or other affected body parts. You might not be able to write or hold a coffee cup. If numbness is new or getting worse, it's time to call your doctor. It's frustrating to forget where you left your car keys, or to have to re-read the same paragraph over and over just to understand it. MS can affect your mind in many ways, interfering with memory, concentration, language, and information processing, especially as the disease progresses. Any new trouble thinking clearly or remembering past events is a warning that you could be in the midst of a relapse. Feeling lightheaded or unsteady on your feet can be an unsettling experience, but it's a common sign of MS relapses. The dizziness is due to damage in the parts of your brain that control equilibrium. A motion sickness drug can take away that 'room-is-spinning' feeling in the short term, but if it lasts more than a day you may need to be treated for an exacerbation. ""Somebody may start to feel like they're drunk when they walk, or they [may] have trouble coordinating movements in their arm,"" says John Ratchford, MD, MSc, assistant professor of neurology at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. Muscle weakness or spasm, numbness, and a loss of balance during a relapse can make you uncoordinated and unsteady on your feet. Soak in a hot tub or sit outside on a muggy day and you might feel like you're having a flare-up -- but you're not. ""There's a lot of confusion among patients about heat,"" says Aaron Miller, MD, medical director of the Corinne Goldsmith Dickinson Center for Multiple Sclerosis at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine. Heat may bring on MS symptoms, but they'll go away as soon as you cool off. A recent bout of the flu or other infection can trigger an MS relapse, some studies have suggested. Other suspected triggers are less certain, including stress, which is hard to study because it affects everyone differently. ""I think it's quite possible that for some people, stress can have effects on the immune system and potentially increase the risk for a relapse,"" Ratchford says. The best way to prevent relapses is to take the medicine your doctor prescribes. ""All of the medicines we use for relapsing MS have been shown to reduce the frequency of relapses -- that's the main reason they were approved,"" Miller says. Eating well, sleeping enough, and reducing stress are also good advice. Call your doctor if any new symptom appears or gets worse, and doesn't go away after 24 hours. Not every relapse needs to be treated. If movement isn't limited and you're not uncomfortable, your doctor might recommend waiting until the symptoms improve on their own. For more bothersome exacerbations, intravenous steroids can speed recovery. Sometimes plasma exchange -- removing the blood and replacing the liquid part -- is used to treat more severe relapses.

9f28e504-f932-472b-a24c-ff68e65a2f0d,"Relapses, also referred to as exacerbations, attacks, flare-ups, episodes, or bouts, are initially experienced by most people diagnosed with multiple sclerosis (MS). Relapses occur with relapsing-remitting, progressive-relapsing, and sometimes secondary-progressive forms of MS. Relapses do not occur with primary-progressive MS, although patients may experience day-to-day fluctuations in how they feel. During a relapse, inflammation is occurring along the nerves and the myelin, causing patients to have a temporary worsening or recurrence of existing symptoms and/or the appearance of new symptoms. This can range from a few days in duration to a few months, followed by a complete or partial recovery (remission). Acute physical symptoms and neurological signs must be present for at least 24 to 48 hours, without any signs of infection or fever, before the treating physician may consider this type of flare-up to be a true relapse. A pseudoexacerbation is a temporary worsening of symptoms without actual myelin inflammation or damage, brought on by other influences. Examples include other illnesses or infection, exercise, a warm environment, depression, exhaustion, and stress. When symptoms flare, checking for a fever is important, since even a minor infection and slight increase in temperature can cause symptoms to appear. Urinary tract infection (UTI) is the most common type of infection to cause a pseudoexacerbation. Additionally, people with “heat-sensitive” MS will experience a temporary increase in symptoms when their body temperature rises, often after exercise. Many heat-sensitive individuals may opt to avoid hot tubs, saunas, or other situations that can raise the body’s temperature. Relapses are usually treated with a high-dose course of powerful (a type of steroid) over a period of three to five days. These are given by intravenous (IV) infusion, administering the drug directly into the bloodstream for a quicker response. Administration may be performed at a hospital, infusion center, or sometimes at home. Some doctors prescribe oral steroids after the high-dose treatment, to ease the patient off of the medication. These are usually tapered over one to two weeks. Another FDA-approved option is , which contains a highly purified form of the hormone . It is given once daily for two to three weeks and is injected either into the muscle or under the skin.

acd5f7da-ddcd-4703-96a5-a457ba56d385,"Multiple sclerosis is a neurodegenerative disorder that damages the nerves in the brain and spinal cord, leading to problems with muscle movement, balance and vision. The illness is an example of a demyelinating disease, where the protective coating called myelin that surrounds nerve fibres becomes damaged. Integrin b3 and ACE2 linked by short linear motifs enabling endocytosis and autophagy of SARS-CoV-2 Study finds higher suicide rate among people with neurological disorders Drug prices beat inflation all the way even with discounts Multiple sclerosis follows a different course in every individual but there are three main ways in which the disease can progress depending on which form of the illness a patient has. Around 80% of all individuals with multiple sclerosis have the relapsing remitting form of the disease. These individuals have periods where their symptoms are mild or absent (remission), followed by periods of symptom relapse. Symptoms may occur suddenly and in acute bouts or exacerbations. During these periods of relapse, symptoms may become worse each time and the relapsing remitting form of this condition may eventually progress to secondary progressive multiple sclerosis, where there are few or no periods of remission. Relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis may be diagnosed when two episodes of relapse are separated by more than 30 days or there has only been one relapse but there is MRI evidence of newly scarred or damaged myelin three months later. Patients with this form of multiple sclerosis often experience phases of relapse followed by remission at first, but this later gives way to progressive disease, characterized by worsening symptoms and few or no periods of remission. The least common form of multiple sclerosis is the primary progressive form which occurs in about 10% to 15% of all cases and usually in people aged over 40 years. In this form of the condition, symptoms get worse over time rather than occurring in bouts or as sudden attacks. Primary progressive multiple sclerosis may be diagnosed if there have been no previous symptoms of relapse but the patient has become increasingly disabled over a period of at least one year. http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Multiple-sclerosis/Pages/Causes.aspx www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/tutorials/multiplesclerosis/nr229105.pdf http://www.who.int/mental_health/neurology/Atlas_MS_WEB.pdf http://www.nice.org.uk/nicemedia/live/10930/29202/29202.pdf Last Updated: Aug 23, 2018 Dr. Ananya Mandal is a doctor by profession, lecturer by vocation and a medical writer by passion.

Relapses do not occur with primary-progressive MS, although patients may experience day-to-day fluctuations in how they feel.

Acute physical symptoms and neurological signs must be present for at least 24 to 48 hours, without any signs of infection or fever, before the treating physician may consider this type of flare-up to be a true relapse. With relapses, inflammation is occurring along the nerves and the myelin. Myelin is the protective covering that insulates the nerves of the central nervous system (CNS) – a system that consists of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerves. Please visit the section of MSAA’s website for more information about the MS process and what happens during an MS relapse. Less-severe relapses are usually not treated with steroids, so their use may be reserved for more severe flare-ups. When treatment is required, relapses are usually treated with a high-dose course of powerful (a type of steroid) over a period of three to five days. These are given by intravenous (IV) infusion, providing the drug directly into the bloodstream for a quicker response. Administration may be performed in a hospital, infusion center, or sometimes at home. Corticosteroids work by reducing inflammation in the CNS. While they usually lessen the severity and duration of a relapse, they do not appear to affect the long-term progression of the disease. As approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA), patients are often given methylprednisolone (Solu-Medrol®) to treat an MS relapse. In practice, doctors may sometimes prescribe the corticosteroid dexamethasone (Decadron®), in place of methylprednisolone. An oral steroid (prednisone) may be prescribed after the high-dose treatment to ease the patient off the treatment, tapered over one to two weeks. is also approved by the FDA to treat MS relapses and has been used as an alternative to corticosteroids for more than 30 years. This may be helpful for individuals who are not able to tolerate the side effects of steroids, who have found that previous treatments were not effective, or who may have difficulty getting timely medical support for IV infusions. Studies suggest that the effectiveness of Acthar Gel is similar to corticosteroids. Acthar contains a highly purified form of the adrenocorticotropin (ACTH) in gelatin. It is given once daily for two to three weeks and is injected either into the muscle or under the skin. This is then absorbed slowly into the bloodstream. Acthar works differently than corticosteroids by helping the body to produce its own natural steroid hormones that reduce inflammation and aid in recovery. Other therapies include (plasma exchange or “PE”) and (IVIG). Neither of these is approved by the FDA specifically for MS relapses, but either may sometimes be used for individuals who are experiencing a severe relapse and are not responding to other treatments. With PE, blood is taken from the patient, cleansed of potentially toxic elements, and returned to the patient. IVIG therapy uses human immunoglobulin, an antibody derived from the blood of healthy donors. With both of these therapies, more studies are needed to determine their individual effectiveness. To follow is a list of drugs and therapies that may be used in the treatment of an MS relapse. Not all of these treatments are approved by the United States Food & Drug Administration (FDA) specifically for the treatment of MS. *Please note that with these latter two therapies, clinical trial results have been mixed. Studies continue to determine the effectiveness of these treatments with MS.

46342f06-e6b3-4f25-aa1a-9a18d80269b6,"CORONAVIRUS: DELAYS FOR ROUTINE SURGERIES, VISITOR RESTRICTIONS + COVID-19 TESTING. 800.223.2273 Neurological Institute Cleveland Clinic Menu Call for Additional Assistance Neurological Institute Menu Cleveland Clinic Menu / Institutes & Departments / Neurological Institute / Departments & Centers / Mellen Center for Multiple Sclerosis / Multiple Sclerosis Approaches / Relapse Management in Multiple Sclerosis Relapse Management in Multiple Sclerosis A: In the context of an established MS diagnosis, a clinical relapse is defined as a “monophasic clinical episode with patient-reported symptoms and objective findings typical of MS, reflecting a focal or multifocal inflammatory demyelinating event in the CNS, developing acutely or subacutely, with a duration of at least 24 hours in the absence of fever or infection.”Other synonyms that have been used for MS relapse include exacerbation, flare, attack, and bout. Common relapse syndromes include unilateral optic neuritis, focal brainstem or cerebellar syndromes, or partial myelitis. Atypical symptoms that would warrant further evaluation include encephalopathy, complete ophthalmoplegia, headache, or isolated fatigue. A typical MS relapse evolves over 24-48 hours and reaches a nadir in several days. More sudden or gradual symptoms should prompt evaluation of alternative diagnoses. Most patients experience some spontaneous recovery though it is variable and affected by other factors such as comorbidities, functional status prior to the relapse, and age.  Q: What is the differential diagnosis for a MS relapse? A: MS can manifest with a wide array of new or worsening symptoms and they do not all constitute a relapse. A pseudorelapse is a temporary recrudescence of prior neurological deficits usually in the setting of certain stressors such as an infection, heat exposure (including fever or exercise), or adverse psychosocial event.  Common paroxysmal syndromes include trigeminal neuralgia, Lhermitte sign which is an electrical sensation elicited with neck flexion or Pulfrich phenomenon which is an illusionary, binocular disturbance where object moving across the visual field is perceived as travelling along a curved trajectory. Uhthoff phenomenon specifically refers to transient visual blurring with exercise in patients with a history of optic neuritis though other motor or sensory symptoms can exhibit the same phenomenon. Disability accrual in MS can also occur independent of relapses (ie progression). The most common phenotypic presentation is gradual worsening myelopathy. This can be a challenging diagnosis because this qualifier is made retrospectively over time and patients can have overlying relapses. Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) can be very difficult to distinguish from a MS relapse especially early in PML. Clinicians should be vigilant in MS patients treated with certain therapies associated with PML infection, particularly natalizumab. In patients being treated with highly effective therapies, there is usually a low risk of breakthrough disease so PML as the cause of new symptoms should be considered, especially if they include seizures, behavioral changes or cognitive abnormalities; if they evolve subacutely or do not respond to corticosteroids. MRI can assist in differentiating a PML lesion from a MS relapse. A: The evaluation of a relapse should be tailored to the clinical scenario. In the setting of an established diagnosis of MS, new neurologic symptoms compatible with those caused by MS, and no symptoms or history suggesting an intercurrent condition, no further ancillary testing may be needed. When symptoms are atypical of a relapse, a targeted work-up should be pursued to identify the cause. For example, if a patient presents with reemergence of remote neurological deficits concerning for a pseudorelapse they should undergo basic laboratory testing before consider pharmacological treatment for a relapse. This includes a urinalysis with culture since occult urinary tract infections are common in MS, along with a complete cell count and comprehensive metabolic panel. Based on the clinical history, further investigative measures can be ordered if symptoms suggest an intercurrent condition or alternative medical condition. An infection or other derangement does not exclude a concomitant relapse, but identification and correction of the possible trigger should be managed before the relapse is treated. A: In general, neuroimaging is not necessary to diagnose a relapse, which is a clinical diagnosis. MRI can be a useful adjuvant to screen for other mimics such as PML or stroke. MRI can also be helpful if there is diagnostic uncertainty as radiographic activity in the context of new neurological symptoms would support the diagnosis of a MS relapse. The prototypical MRI finding in a relapse is gadolinium enhancement reflecting blood brain barrier breakdown. Gadolinium enhancement is observed in most but not all new lesions and resolves over the course of several weeks. Clinicians should be aware that potential treatment such as corticosteroids can alter these radiographic findings. Enhancing lesions can also occur without obvious clinical signs or symptoms. A: In general, we treat relapses, as they cause significant morbidity and symptoms typically interfere patients’ ability to function. Mild relapses such as non-disabling sensory symptoms or those already exhibiting spontaneous improvement may not require intervention as the risk of therapy may outweighs potential benefit of treatment. Ultimately, treatment decisions are made jointly between the patient and provider using a shared decision-making model. Mild, asymptomatic MRI lesion activity does not require treatment as the rationale for pharmacological treatment is to decrease the duration and intensity of neurological symptoms. We often treat in the setting of multiple asymptomatic active lesion as those patients are at increased risk for clinical worsening. New clinical or radiographic disease activity may warrant a change in disease modifying therapy. Please refer to the Mellen Center Approach (MCA) on switching disease modifying therapies for more information on that topic. A: Corticosteroids are the mainstay treatment option for MS relapses. High dose corticosteroids offer rapid symptom relief and hasten neurologic recovery. While there has been much debate about intravenous vs oral administration, it has been demonstrated that dose rather than the route of administration is the most important factor in terms of efficacy.10 We typically use intravenous methylprednisolone (IVMP 1000mg daily) or an equivalent dose of intravenous of high dose oral prednisone (1250mg daily which equates to twenty-five 50mg tablets) for 3-5 days for relapses. Multiple studies have shown that high-dose, oral corticosteroid and high-dose, IV methylprednisolone are bioequivalent with a similar side effect profile and equivalent MRI /clinical outcomes. If the oral regimen is selected, we advise patients that they do not need to take all the pills at one time but they take the pills earlier in the day to prevent potential sleep disturbance.  To lessen side effects, we typically prescribe a proton pump inhibitor or H2 antagonists along with a sleep aid (typically melatonin or diphenhydramine) to proactively manage the impact of the high dose corticosteroids. In addition, steroids are associated with rare yet serious complications including aseptic necrosis of the shoulder or hip and hepatic failure. If patients experience severe psychiatric manifestations including mania, depression or psychosis we have a higher threshold for prescribing corticosteroids as those symptoms are difficult to mitigate and could be life threatening. Corticosteroid-induced psychosis usually self-resolves once the medication is stopped but discontinuation is not always possible. Symptoms can be managed with short courses of atypical antipsychotic or mood stabilizing medications though we would encourage treatment coordination with a mental health professional. Hypersensitivity reactions to corticosteroids are rare yet serious adverse reaction that providers should also be aware of. Reactions seem to be attributable to the specific formulation (i.e. the salt or preservative agent) rather than the steroid itself. A different corticosteroid preparation can be tried again in a controlled setting where emergency medications and personnel are present. A steroid taper can be considered based on relapse severity and clinical context (i.e. comorbidities) but is not required. There is no clear evidence that a taper contributes to recovery or that a short course of high dose corticosteroids significantly suppresses the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis which would necessitate a taper in most patients.   Q: What treatments options are available for relapses with incomplete recovery? A: We will consider a second course of corticosteroids if a patient has an incomplete response to the initial treatment though we have a low threshold to escalate therapy as incomplete symptom resolution is a major cause of early disability in MS. We typically use plasmapheresis for treatment of severe or refractory relapses with an incomplete response to the corticosteroids. The length of treatment can vary between 3-7 sessions depending on the treatment response and tolerance. The most common treatment period is 5 sessions over 7-10 days. Plasmapheresis is usually well tolerated but there are a number of potential side effects clinicians should be aware of including infection (specifically related to the venous catheter), deep venous thrombosis, , hypotension, and hypoalbuminemia. Most of these side effects are easily managed and do not require plasmapheresis discontinuation, though close coordination with the plasmapheresis administration team is essential. Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) treatment has been approved for use in MS relapses since the 1960s though it was supplanted in clinical practice by corticosteroids in the 1980s. There has been some recent, renewed interest in ACTH given its effects on melanocortin receptors on circulating lymphocytes. There is no conclusive evidence that ACTH has any additional benefits when compared to corticosteroids or improves the recovery of patients with incomplete response to corticosteroids. Clinical trials are currently underway to further investigate. Current evidence does not support intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) as a treatment for acute MS relapse. IVIG could be considered if a patient was intolerant to both IVMP and PLEX but we do not typical prescribe it at the Mellen Center. Please refer to the MCA on IVIG for more information regarding that specific therapy. A: Relapses are typically managed in the outpatient setting unless circumstances necessitate inpatient treatment such as an inability for the patient to perform self-care, loss of ability to ambulate, or comorbidities that increase the risk of corticosteroid-related complications. Given the challenges of arranging out-patient plasmapheresis, we usually admit these patients to the hospital for expedited central venous line placement and treatment, though sometimes outpatient therapy can be arranged. Acute treatment in the inpatient setting also is considered if subsequent inpatient rehabilitation is anticipated. Q: What adjunctive methods can be used to manage a relapse? A: We believe rehabilitation is an integral part of relapse management. Our patients engage with a multidisciplinary team to focus on their physical and emotional wellbeing when being treated for a relapse or pseudorelapse. This team encompasses physiatrists, psychologists, physical therapists, occupational therapists, and speech therapists. Rehabilitation can focus on motor impairment, gait instability or cognitive dysfunction. These services can also focus on a broader range of functions including an ability to perform activities of daily living, improve mobility, or a return to work. Management of the relapse symptoms can also lead to improved quality of life for patients. For example, treating painful sensory disturbances with a neuropathic pain medications or addressing disabling fatigue with pharmacological and non- pharmacological methods. Q: How are relapses managed during pregnancy or breastfeeding? A: Typically, disease modifying therapy is discontinued during pregnancy and while breast feeding, which increases the risk of disease activity. Fortunately, MS disease activity decreases during this time though women with highly active disease before pregnancy are at higher risk for a relapse, especially for three to four months postpartum. Women undergoing an assisted reproductive technique may also have a higher relapse risk due to the hormone changes induced by gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists. We typically use the standard treatment strategy for relapses during pregnancy or while breastfeeding. We do have a higher threshold for treatment in the first trimester as there is some evidence for adverse fetal outcomes with corticosteroids, including cleft palate and low birth weight. Generally, relapses during the second and third trimesters can be treated safely with corticosteroids. Ultimately, a joint decision is made between the patient, provider and obstetrician (OBGYN). Corticosteroids can cross into the breast milk so we recommend patients to avoid breast feeding for several hours after their treatment.  For disabling, corticosteroids-refractory relapses, plasmapheresis can be considered. For more information regarding MRIs during pregnancy and breast feeding please refer to the MCA on MRI Activity.  References: Thompson AJ, Banwell BL, Barkhof F, et al.

2a3f72b7-e391-412b-b439-58440a3640d1,"A sudden or severe exacerbation (also known as a relapse, attack, flare-up, or episode), in which existing symptoms worsen, or new symptoms develop. To be considered a true relapse, symptoms must be present for at least 24 to 48 hours, and not be associated with other factors that might mimic an acute attack, such as a urinary tract infection, anxiety, depression, hot weather, and extreme exercise. Relapses occur with relapsing-remitting, progressive-relapsing, and sometimes secondary-progressive forms of MS. Written instructions that provide specific directions to doctors and family regarding a person’s end-of-life choices in advance, should this person become unable to make these decisions on his or her own when needed. Typically include appointing a healthcare representative or proxy as well as creating a “living will.” A brace that holds and angles the foot and ankle in the best position for maximum comfort and mobility. This device can also relieve stress on the knee. A protein produced by the body’s immune system when it detects foreign substances, called antigens. Examples of antigens include microorganisms (such as bacteria, fungi, parasites, and viruses) and chemicals. Antibodies may be produced when the immune system mistakenly targets healthy tissue, which happens with an autoimmune disorder. Each type of antibody is unique and defends the body against one specific type of antigen. A foreign molecule or substance that stimulates the immune system to activate a series of events to eliminate the antigen. In MS, the immune system misdirects the reactivity to antigens to damage the CNS, which is referred to as autoimmunity. Tools, products, or types of equipment that help someone perform tasks and activities. They may help individuals to move around, see, communicate, eat, or get dressed. Some are high-tech tools, such as computers (which can be adapted to meet various disabilities such as reduced vision or dexterity/mobility problems). Others are much simpler, like a “reacher” – a tool that helps someone to grasp an object that is difficult to reach. Any service or tool that can help a person with a disability perform activities that might otherwise be difficult or not be possible. Inability to coordinate walking movements. The decrease in the volume of brain or muscle tissue often associated with MS. When the body’s own immune system attacks its own tissue, it is known as an autoimmune disease. MS is believed to be an autoimmune disease. The ANS helps control blood flow to and from the extremities; it also controls: heart rate; blood pressure; bowel, bladder, and sexual activity; and other automatic bodily functions. The wire-like nerve fibers that conduct signals between neurons (nerves of the brain and spinal cord). Axons have a protective myelin covering and are found in the white matter of the brain. Damaged nerves that are unable to efficiently conduct impulse flow. Immune-system cells that produce antibodies to fight against “foreign invaders” (such as bacteria or viruses) within the body and help to regulate other immune cells. These cells have been shown to be an element of the autoimmune destruction seen in MS. The Babinski reflex occurs after the sole of the foot has been firmly stroked. The big toe then moves upward or toward the top surface of the foot. The other toes fan out. This reflex is normal in children up to 2-years old. It disappears as the child gets older. When the Babinski reflex is present in a child older than 2 years or in an adult, it is often a sign of a brain or nervous-system disorder. Multiple sclerosis is among the disorders that could be indicated by this reflex in people older than 2 years. Bell’s palsy is the most common cause of facial paralysis. It usually affects just one side of the face. Symptoms appear suddenly and are at their worst about 48 hours after they start. They can range from mild to severe and include twitching, weakness, paralysis, drooping eyelid or corner of mouth, drooling, dry eye or mouth, excessive tearing in the eye, and impaired ability to taste. Scientists think that a viral infection makes the facial nerve swell or become inflamed. Individuals are most likely to get Bell’s palsy if pregnant, diabetic, or sick with a cold or flu. It can also occur with multiple sclerosis. Three out of four patients improve without treatment. With or without treatment, most people begin to get better within two weeks and recover completely within three to six months. A protective barrier that lines the blood vessels, this layer of cells is designed to prevent damaging cells and other substances in the blood (including those that could cause disease) from entering the brain, optic nerves, and spinal cord of the CNS. Consists of the brain, optic nerves, and spinal cord and functions to send and receive nerve impulses throughout the body. The liquid that surrounds the brain and spinal cord. Prior to a diagnosis of MS, CIS is a single attack (or the appearance of one or more symptoms characteristic of MS), with a very high risk of developing MS, when no other diseases or causes for symptoms are apparent. A group of mental processes that include functions such as memory, decision making, and concentration, which is the ability to focus on specific tasks and planning. Some of the cognitive functions typically affected in people with MS include: information processing; perceiving; attending/responding to incoming information; information-processing speed; cognitive flexibility, such as attending to multiple stimuli at the same time (“multi-tasking”); problems with storage, manipulation, and retrieval of information; and executive function, which includes planning, working memory, attention, and problem-solving. A type of steroid that works by reducing inflammation in the CNS. A steroid first used to treat MS relapses in 1951. Small proteins that may stimulate or inhibit the function of other cells. They connect to specific receptors found on the surface of cells and send messages from one cell to another. They can stimulate or inhibit the inflammation process. Damage to the protective (insulating) covering of the nerves (myelin) of the CNS, causing interruptions in the flow of nerve impulses in the CNS. This can ultimately affect a wide range of function. Double vision resulting from lesions in the brain stem, a part of the nervous system between the brain and cervical spinal cord. Neither the participants nor the medical staff administering or evaluating the new treatment are told who is receiving the drug and who is receiving the placebo or other drug being compared to the test drug. Speech that is slurred or poorly articulated; it can involve a loss of volume control, unnatural emphasis on words or sentences, and a slower rate of speaking. Type of pain that is experienced as a burning, aching, or “pins and needles” type of sensation under the skin. For some, this can be painful; for others, it is more bothersome. Disorder causing changes in the quality of speech, such as a breathless quality to the voice, or speech that sounds harsh. An electrical test used to evaluate nerve and muscle problems. Evoked potentials measure the speed of the brain’s response to visual, auditory (sound), or sensory (feeling) stimuli to the central nervous system, using electrodes (taped to the patient’s head) and a computer. This system measures the time for an impulse to travel from the eye, ear, arm, or leg to the brain. This 10-point scale (from 1 to 10 with half points) measures degrees of disability, largely in terms of mobility. Points 1 to 3 on the scale are primarily used to measure function; points 4 to 9 measure mobility. Half points are used for higher clarity. An MS-like disease in animals, induced through the injection of myelin plus adjuvant (a substance that enhances the body’s response), to enable investigators to see how experimental treatments affect this MS-like disorder (often in mice). A type of dye given via injection prior to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). It serves to enhance areas of active inflammation and blood-brain barrier (BBB) breakdown. A procedure to help bring urinary symptoms under control by inserting a catheter (a specially designed thin tube) into the urinary opening to drain urine from the bladder, for people who cannot empty their bladder normally (see neurogenic bladder). An electric shock-like sensation down the spine and legs when the neck is flexed forward; approximately 40 percent of individuals with MS experience this type of pain, although it usually does not require any treatment. It is often an indication of myelin damage in the spinal-cord area. Also known as a spinal tap, LP is a procedure where a very thin needle is inserted at the lower back and a small amount of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is collected to look for induced changes or other problems. A type of white blood cell that plays a strong role in the body’s immune system, which works to defend the body against foreign bodies and disease. In MS, the lymphocytes may be misdirected to cause damage to the central nervous system. Some lymphocytes help to control the MS damage (T-regulatory cells). Type of white blood cell that works to ingest and destroy foreign substances. Scan of the brain and/or spine. The MRI uses a computer, radiofrequency stimulator, and a large electromagnet to provide a picture of the brain. Monoclonal antibodies are produced to defend the body and are derived from cells that are identical (cloned from a single cell and then replicated). They are produced from animal tissue, most commonly laboratory mice. Humanized monoclonal antibodies are antibodies from non-human species whose protein sequences have been modified to increase their similarity to antibodies produced naturally in humans. Monoclonal antibodies are an important type of medication, as they can be specifically targeted to perform a particular action, which is desirable when trying to impact a complex structure like the immune system. The name of all monoclonal antibodies ends with “mab.” These antibodies attack and destroy specific inflammatory lymphocytes that may be damaging the CNS in MS. A scale that measures lower-limb function (walking), upper-limb function (arm movements), and cognition. Myelin is a fatty protein that serves as a protective covering and insulation to the nerves (called axons) that work like wires to carry messages to and from the CNS. Bladder problems resulting from demyelination in the nervous system pathways that control the muscles of the bladder and the sphincters of the urinary tract. The three categories of bladder problems are usually referred to as “failure to store” (small, spastic bladder), “failure to empty” (large, flaccid bladder), and “dyssynergia,” which is a disconnect between the muscles of the bladder wall and the urinary sphincter. Involuntary movements of the eyes that result from lesions in the brain stem, a part of the nervous system between the brain and cervical spinal cord. It typically is an uncontrolled side-to-side (horizontal) or up-and-down (vertical) movements of the eye. It can be asymptomatic (causing no visual problems) or severe enough to disturb vision. Objects may appear to jump or move unpredictably as the two eyes no longer coordinate well with each other. Nystagmus can be more of a nuisance than a major problem and is usually temporary. It may sometimes distort vision. Abnormal immune proteins called immunoglobulins. These are present in the CSF of roughly 90 percent of individuals with MS, however, they can occur with several other neurological disorders. Since the introduction of the MRI, CSF analysis is used less often, but it can be helpful in supporting an MS diagnosis if the MRI results are normal or inconclusive. Cells that produce and maintain myelin. Over time, oligodendrocytes may be damaged or lost and fail to repair the damaged myelin. A condition that causes decreased or blurred vision. This is an inflammation of the optic nerve, which – unlike the nerves that innervate most of the body that are part of the peripheral nervous system – is actually part of the central nervous system and is myelinated in the same way as axons in the brain and spinal cord. Tingling, burning, or numbing sensation. Sudden recurrence of a symptom, spasm, or seizure. Area around the cerebro-spinal fluid in the brain. Areas of inflammation and damage in the brain or spinal cord in MS. This form of MS presents a gradual but steady accumulation of neurological problems from the onset, without the presence of relapses and remissions. A progressive course of MS from the onset with acute relapses occurring later in the disease course. Characterized by uncontrolled, inappropriate, and/or exaggerated episodes of crying, laughing, or other emotional display. PBA occurs involuntarily with little or no stimulation to invoke such a response. A temporary worsening of symptoms without actual myelin inflammation or damage, brought on by other influences. These can include other illnesses or infection, over-exercise, a warm environment, depression, exhaustion, and stress. When symptoms flare, checking for a fever is important, since even a minor infection and slight increase in temperature can cause symptoms to appear. A temporary worsening or recurrence of existing symptoms and/or the appearance of new symptoms (also called an “acute attack;” definition shown above), caused by inflammation occurring along the nerves and the myelin. This can range from a few days in duration to a few months, followed by a complete or partial recovery (remission). Acute physical symptoms and neurological signs must be present for at least 24 to 48 hours, without any signs of infection or fever, before the treating physician may consider this type of flare-up to be a true relapse. Treatments may improve recovery time. A course of MS that includes temporary symptom flare-ups (also referred to as relapses, attacks, exacerbations, or bouts), which typically last for one to three months. These are followed by a complete or partial recovery. Reduction and stability in severity of one’s MS, or the disappearance of symptoms. The restoration or repair of myelin (protective covering to the nerves). Characterized by long pauses between syllables and words with loss of melody in speech production; it is a type of dysarthria. Blind spot in the center of the visual field. This phase of MS follows relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) and is reached when the patient experiences a progressive worsening of symptoms. SPMS may occur with or without superimposed relapses. Disease-modifying therapies for MS help to delay the conversion from RRMS to SPMS. A tightness or stiffness of the muscles – occurring typically in the legs (calf or thigh), groin, buttocks, arms, or hands. Immune-system cells that have the ability to increase an immune response within the body, causing inflammation and damage in MS. A spontaneous, sharp or shooting facial pain, often brought on by a light touch or movement. The sensation of “spinning or rotation,” which may occur as the result of lesions in the brainstem areas that coordinate balance.

5eb2be07-cabc-407c-a9de-6ab7f7488611,"Medically reviewed by — — Understanding the typical progression of multiple sclerosis (MS) and learning what to expect can help you gain a sense of control and make better decisions. MS occurs when the body’s immune system abnormally targets the central nervous system (CNS), though it’s not considered to be an autoimmune disorder. The attack on the CNS damages the myelin and the nerve fibers that the myelin protects. The damage disrupts or distorts the nerve impulses being sent down the spinal cord. People with MS generally follow one of four disease courses that vary in severity. The first stage to consider occurs before your doctor has made a diagnosis of MS. In this initial stage, you may have symptoms that you’re concerned about. Genetic and environmental factors are thought to play a role in who gets MS. Perhaps MS runs in your family, and you’re worried about your likelihood of developing the disease. Maybe you’ve previously experienced symptoms that your doctor has told you might be indicative of MS. At this stage, your doctor can determine whether you’re at high risk for developing the condition based on your medical history and a physical exam. However, there is no definitive test to confirm the presence of MS and many of the symptoms also occur with other conditions, so the disease can be tough to diagnose. The next step on the continuum is receiving a diagnosis of MS. Your doctor will diagnose you with MS if there is clear evidence that, at two different points in time, you have had separate episodes of disease activity in your CNS. Often it can take time to make this diagnosis because other conditions must first be ruled out. These include CNS infections, CNS inflammatory disorders, and genetic disorders. In the new diagnosis stage, you will likely discuss treatment options with your doctor and learn new ways to manage everyday activities with your condition. There are different types and stages of MS. Learn more below about the different types. This is the first episode of symptoms caused by inflammation and damage to the myelin covering on nerves in the brain or spinal cord. Technically, CIS doesn’t meet the criteria for a diagnosis of MS as it’s an isolated incident with only one area of demyelination responsible for symptoms. If an MRI shows another episode in the past, a diagnosis of MS can be made. The type of MS generally follows a predictable pattern with periods in which symptoms worsen and then improve. Eventually it may progress to . According to the , around 85 percent of people with MS are initially diagnosed with relapsing-remitting MS. People with RRMS have flare-ups (relapses) of MS. Between the relapses, they have periods of remission. Over a few decades, the course of the disease is likely to change and become more complex. Relapsing-remitting MS can progress into a more aggressive form of the disease. The reports that, if left untreated, half of those with the relapsing-remitting form of the condition develop secondary-progressive MS within a decade of the first diagnosis. In secondary-progressive MS, you may still experience relapses. These are then followed by partial recoveries or periods of remission, but the disease doesn’t disappear between cycles. Instead, it steadily worsens. Approximately 15 percent of people are diagnosed with a relatively uncommon form of the disease, called primary-progressive MS. This form is characterized by slow and steady disease progression with no remission periods. Some people with primary-progressive MS experience occasional plateaus in their symptoms as well as minor improvements in function that tend to be temporary. There are variations in the progression rate over time. In addition to adults, children and adolescents can be diagnosed with MS. The reports that between 2 and 5 percent of all MS patients noticed symptoms that started before they were 18 years old. Pediatric MS follows a similar course of progression as the adult form of the disease with similar symptoms as well. However, some children experience additional symptoms, such as and . Also, the disease course may progress more slowly for younger people than it does for adults. There are a variety of treatment options available to a person diagnosed with MS. Your doctor and medical team can help you find the best combination of treatments to manage your symptoms and improve your quality of life. Prescription treatments and medical interventions include: Any time you’re making a change to your treatment plan, consult your doctor first. Even natural remedies can interfere with medications or treatments you’re currently taking. When you’re aware of what to look for in each stage of MS, you can take better control of your life and seek appropriate treatments. Researchers continue to make strides in their understanding of the disease. Improved therapeutic advances, new technologies, and FDA-approved medications are having an impact on the underlying course of MS. Using your knowledge and working closely with your doctor can make MS easier to manage throughout the course of the disease. Are there any ways to slow the progression of MS? If so, what are they? Besides a healthy diet and exercise with stretching, make sure you are taking in enough Vitamin D since MS patients have been found to be deficient. And as always, taking MS medications regularly has been shown to slow the disease progress and prevent relapse. Answers represent the opinions of our medical experts.

Mayo Clinic Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences Mayo Clinic School of Continuous Professional Development A complete neurological exam and medical history are needed to diagnose . There are no specific tests for . Instead, a diagnosis of multiple sclerosis often relies on ruling out other conditions that might produce similar signs and symptoms, known as a differential diagnosis. Your doctor is likely to start with a thorough medical history and examination. During a spinal tap (lumbar puncture) procedure, you typically lie on your side with your knees drawn up to your chest. Then a needle is inserted into your spinal canal — in your lower back — to collect cerebrospinal fluid for testing. Brain MRI scan showing white lesions associated with multiple sclerosis. to help rule out other diseases with symptoms similar to . Tests to check for specific biomarkers associated with are currently under development and may also aid in diagnosing the disease. in which a small sample of cerebrospinal fluid is removed from your spinal canal for laboratory analysis. This sample can show abnormalities in antibodies that are associated with . A spinal tap can also help rule out infections and other conditions with symptoms similar to . which can reveal areas of (lesions) on your brain and spinal cord. You may receive an intravenous injection of a contrast material to highlight lesions that indicate your disease is in an active phase. which record the electrical signals produced by your nervous system in response to stimuli. An evoked potential test may use visual stimuli or electrical stimuli. In these tests, you watch a moving visual pattern, or short electrical impulses are applied to nerves in your legs or arms. Electrodes measure how quickly the information travels down your nerve pathways. In most people with relapsing-remitting , the diagnosis is fairly straightforward and based on a pattern of symptoms consistent with the disease and confirmed by brain imaging scans, such as MRI. Diagnosing can be more difficult in people with unusual symptoms or progressive disease. In these cases, further testing with spinal fluid analysis, evoked potentials and additional imaging may be needed. Brain MRI is often used to help diagnose multiple sclerosis. Our caring team of Mayo Clinic experts can help you with your multiple sclerosis-related health concerns There is no cure for multiple sclerosis. Treatment typically focuses on speeding recovery from attacks, slowing the progression of the disease and managing symptoms. Some people have such mild symptoms that no treatment is necessary. Multiple sclerosis research laboratory at Mayo Clinic such as oral prednisone and intravenous methylprednisolone, are prescribed to reduce nerve inflammation. Side effects may include insomnia, increased blood pressure, increased blood glucose levels, mood swings and fluid retention. The liquid portion of part of your blood (plasma) is removed and separated from your blood cells. The blood cells are then mixed with a protein solution (albumin) and put back into your body. Plasma exchange may be used if your symptoms are new, severe and haven't responded to steroids. For primary-progressive , ocrelizumab (Ocrevus) is the only FDA-approved disease-modifying therapy (DMT). Those who receive this treatment are slightly less likely to progress than those who are untreated. For relapsing-remitting , several disease-modifying therapies are available. Much of the immune response associated with occurs in the early stages of the disease. Aggressive treatment with these medications as early as possible can lower the relapse rate, slow the formation of new lesions, and potentially reduce risk of brain atrophy and disability accumulation. Many of the disease-modifying therapies used to treat carry significant health risks. Selecting the right therapy for you will depend on careful consideration of many factors, including duration and severity of disease, effectiveness of previous treatments, other health issues, cost, and child-bearing status. Treatment options for relapsing-remitting include injectable and oral medications. These drugs are among the most commonly prescribed medications to treat . They are injected under the skin or into muscle and can reduce the frequency and severity of relapses. Side effects of interferons may include flu-like symptoms and injection-site reactions. You'll need blood tests to monitor your liver enzymes because liver damage is a possible side effect of interferon use. People taking interferons may develop neutralizing antibodies that can reduce drug effectiveness. This medication may help block your immune system's attack on myelin and must be injected beneath the skin. Side effects may include skin irritation at the injection site. This once-daily oral medication reduces relapse rate. You'll need to have your heart rate and blood pressure monitored for six hours after the first dose because your heartbeat may be slowed. Other side effects include rare serious infections, headaches, high blood pressure and blurred vision. This twice-daily oral medication can reduce relapses. Side effects may include flushing, diarrhea, nausea and lowered white blood cell count. This drug requires blood test monitoring on a regular basis. This twice-daily capsule is similar to dimethyl fumarate but typically causes fewer side effects. It's approved for the treatment of relapsing forms of . This once-daily oral medication can reduce relapse rate. Teriflunomide can cause liver damage, hair loss and other side effects. This drug is associated with birth defects when taken by both men and women. Therefore, use contraception when taking this medication and for up to two years afterward. Couples who wish to become pregnant should talk to their doctor about ways to speed elimination of the drug from the body. This drug requires blood test monitoring in a regular basis. Research shows that this once-daily oral medication can reduce relapse rate and help slow progression of . It's also approved for secondary-progressive . Possible side effects include viral infections, liver problems and low white blood cell count. Other possible side effects include changes in heart rate, headaches and vision problems. Siponimod is harmful to a developing fetus, so women who may become pregnant should use contraception when taking this medication and for 10 days after stopping the medication. Some might need to have the heart rate and blood pressure monitored for six hours after the first dose. This drug requires blood test monitoring on a regular basis This medication is generally prescribed as second line treatment for those with relapsing-remitting . It was also approved for secondary-progressive . It is given in two treatment courses, spread over a two-week period, over the course of two years. Side effects include upper respiratory infections, headaches, tumors, serious infections and reduced levels of white blood cells. People who have active chronic infections or cancer should not take this drug, nor should women who are pregnant or breast-feeding. Men and women should use contraception when taking this medication and for the following six months. You may need monitoring with blood tests while taking cladribine. This humanized monoclonal antibody medication is the only approved by the FDA to treat both the relapse-remitting and primary-progressive forms of . Clinical trials showed that it reduced relapse rate in relapsing disease and slowed worsening of disability in both forms of the disease. Ocrelizumab is given via an intravenous infusion by a medical professional. Infusion-related side effects may include irritation at the injection site, low blood pressure, a fever and nausea, among others. Some people may not be able to take ocrelizumab, including those with a hepatitis B infection. Ocrelizumab may also increase the risk of infections and some types of cancer, particularly breast cancer. This medication is designed to block the movement of potentially damaging immune cells from your bloodstream to your brain and spinal cord. It may be considered a first line treatment for some people with severe or as a second line treatment in others. This medication increases the risk of a potentially serious viral infection of the brain called progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) in people who are positive for antibodies to the causative agent of JC virus. People who don't have the antibodies have extremely low risk of . This drug helps reduce relapses of by targeting a protein on the surface of immune cells and depleting white blood cells. This effect can limit potential nerve damage caused by the white blood cells. But it also increases the risk of infections and autoimmune disorders, including a high risk of thyroid autoimmune diseases and rare immune mediated kidney disease. Treatment with alemtuzumab involves five consecutive days of drug infusions followed by another three days of infusions a year later. Infusion reactions are common with alemtuzumab. The drug is only available from registered providers, and people treated with the drug must be registered in a special drug safety monitoring program. Alemtuzumab is usually recommended for those with aggressive or as second line treatment for patients who failed another medication.

Even though there are few or no relapses at this point in the disease, a gradual worsening of symptoms over time is common; this worsening is known as disease progression. The term “secondary-progressive” comes from the fact that (SPMS) can only be diagnosed in a person who has previously experienced RRMS.   Because the transition from a relapsing-remitting course to a more progressive one is a gradual process, the healthcare provider will not be able to tell exactly when it is happening. If a person’s are worsening, the challenge for the provider is to determine whether: The worsening is left over from the last (in other words, permanent but stable damage that remains after the inflammatory attack has ended) — which would mean that the person is experiencing an RRMS disease course; or The disease is continuing to worsen even though the person is no longer experiencing inflammatory relapses — which would mean that the person has transitioned to a SPMS disease course. A variety of strategies, including a careful history of the changes in a person’s symptoms, the , and repeat  scans, help determine whether the transition to SPMS has occurred. Read about the .

d9d57356-cb52-411f-860c-6b2db0524805,"MS, the coronavirus and vaccines – updated global advice MS, the coronavirus and vaccines – updated global advice There are four main types of MS: clinically isolated syndrome, relapsing MS, secondary progressive MS and primary progressive MS. The course of MS is unpredictable. Some people may feel and seem healthy for many years following diagnosis, while others may be severely debilitated very quickly. Most people fit somewhere between these two extremes. Although every individual will experience a different combination of MS , and it is hard to predict how MS will affect a person over their lifetime, there have been four basic types of MS identified relating to the course of the disease. Clinically Isolated Syndrome (CIS) is the first episode of neurological symptoms experienced by a person, lasting at least 24 hours. The person may experience a single sign or symptom, or more than one at the same time. As with MS, it is caused by inflammation and demyelination in the central nervous system. Not everyone who experiences CIS goes on to develop MS, but CIS can be an indicator for it. Researchers don’t yet know why CIS turns into MS for some people but not others. If someone with CIS also has lesions (as seen on a brain MRI) that are similar to those seen in MS, then they are at higher risk. Research suggests that early of CIS can delay conversion to MS for people at high risk. In relapsing MS (sometimes called relapsing-remitting MS), people experience attacks or exacerbations of symptoms (‘relapses’), which then fade or disappear (‘remission’). The symptoms may be new, or existing symptoms may become more severe. Relapses can last for varying periods – from a few days up to months – and then the disease may then be inactive for months or years. About 85 per cent of people with MS are initially diagnosed with relapsing MS. Relapsing MS can also be categorised by whether it is or (someone who has arelapses and/or evidence of new MRI activity). It can also be classified as (a confirmed increase in disability over a specified period of time following a relapse) or Secondary progressive MS (SPMS) is a secondary phase of relapsing MS that may develop years or even decades following diagnosis with relapsing MS. Most people who have relapsing MS will transition to SPMS. In SPMS there is progressive worsening of symptoms over time with no definite periods of remission. SPMS can also be categorised by whether it is or (someone who has arelapses and/or evidence of new MRI activity). It can also be classified as (evidence of disease worsening over time, with or without relapses) or About 10 to 15 per cent of people with MS are diagnosed with primary progressive MS (PPMS). People with PPMS have steadily worsening symptoms and disability from the start, rather than sudden attacks or relapses followed by recovery. PPMS can also be categorised by whether it is or (someone who has arelapses and/or evidence of new MRI activity). It can also be classified as (evidence of disease worsening over time, with or without relapses) or For useful descriptions of what looks like in relapsing MS, primary and secondary progressive MS, see the graphs on the National MS Society’s web page here.

8325bd52-28d3-4acb-856d-3c338f2db1a4,"MS, the coronavirus and vaccines – updated global advice MS, the coronavirus and vaccines – updated global advice There are four main types of MS: clinically isolated syndrome, relapsing MS, secondary progressive MS and primary progressive MS. The course of MS is unpredictable. Some people may feel and seem healthy for many years following diagnosis, while others may be severely debilitated very quickly. Most people fit somewhere between these two extremes. Although every individual will experience a different combination of MS , and it is hard to predict how MS will affect a person over their lifetime, there have been four basic types of MS identified relating to the course of the disease. Clinically Isolated Syndrome (CIS) is the first episode of neurological symptoms experienced by a person, lasting at least 24 hours. The person may experience a single sign or symptom, or more than one at the same time. As with MS, it is caused by inflammation and demyelination in the central nervous system. Not everyone who experiences CIS goes on to develop MS, but CIS can be an indicator for it. Researchers don’t yet know why CIS turns into MS for some people but not others. If someone with CIS also has lesions (as seen on a brain MRI) that are similar to those seen in MS, then they are at higher risk. Research suggests that early of CIS can delay conversion to MS for people at high risk. In relapsing MS (sometimes called relapsing-remitting MS), people experience attacks or exacerbations of symptoms (‘relapses’), which then fade or disappear (‘remission’). The symptoms may be new, or existing symptoms may become more severe. Relapses can last for varying periods – from a few days up to months – and then the disease may then be inactive for months or years. About 85 per cent of people with MS are initially diagnosed with relapsing MS. Relapsing MS can also be categorised by whether it is or (someone who has arelapses and/or evidence of new MRI activity). It can also be classified as (a confirmed increase in disability over a specified period of time following a relapse) or Secondary progressive MS (SPMS) is a secondary phase of relapsing MS that may develop years or even decades following diagnosis with relapsing MS. Most people who have relapsing MS will transition to SPMS. In SPMS there is progressive worsening of symptoms over time with no definite periods of remission. SPMS can also be categorised by whether it is or (someone who has arelapses and/or evidence of new MRI activity). It can also be classified as (evidence of disease worsening over time, with or without relapses) or About 10 to 15 per cent of people with MS are diagnosed with primary progressive MS (PPMS). People with PPMS have steadily worsening symptoms and disability from the start, rather than sudden attacks or relapses followed by recovery. PPMS can also be categorised by whether it is or (someone who has arelapses and/or evidence of new MRI activity). It can also be classified as (evidence of disease worsening over time, with or without relapses) or For useful descriptions of what looks like in relapsing MS, primary and secondary progressive MS, see the graphs on the National MS Society’s web page here.

b3669cc3-1cd3-4c89-acd4-b019b4150ef7,"— — Multiple sclerosis (MS) is often diagnosed when people are in their 20s and 30s. The disease typically follows a pattern, moving through different variations or types over the years. This is because as you get older, your MS symptoms are likely to change. MS damages myelin, the protective coating around nerves. This damage interrupts the flow of nerve impulses from the brain to the body. The greater the damage that’s done to the myelin, the more severe your symptoms will become. Everyone with MS is different. How quickly your disease progresses and the symptoms you experience won’t necessarily be the same as someone else’s with the condition. Your doctor can’t predict exactly how your disease will change over time. But advances in MS research are offering better treatments to slow the disease’s progression and improve the outlook for people living with MS. MS often starts with a single attack. Suddenly your vision becomes blurry, or your legs feel numb or weak. When these symptoms last for at least 24 hours and this is the first attack, they’re called clinically isolated syndrome (CIS). CIS typically starts between ages 20 and 40. It’s caused by inflammation or damage to myelin in your central nervous system. CIS can be a warning of MS to come, but that isn’t always the case. Between of people with CNS will develop MS. If an MRI shows signs of brain lesions, MS is much more likely to develop. Up to of people with MS are first diagnosed with RRMS. It typically starts when people are in their 20s or 30s, although it can begin earlier or later in life. In RRMS, attacks on myelin produce periods of symptom flare-ups called relapses. During a relapse, symptoms may include: Each relapse can last from a few days to a few months. The exact symptoms and their severity can be different for each person. After a relapse, you’ll enter a symptom-free period called remission. Each remission lasts for several months or years. The disease doesn’t progress during remission. Some people stay in RRMS for many decades. Others progress to the secondary-progressive form within a few years. It’s impossible to predict how each person’s disease will act, but new treatments are helping to slow the progression of MS overall. About of people with MS are diagnosed with the primary progressive form. PPMS usually appears during the mid to late 30s. In PPMS, nervous system damage and symptoms steadily get worse over time. There are no real remission periods. The disease continues to progress, and it can eventually lead to problems walking and performing other daily activities. SPMS is the stage that follows RRMS. In this type of MS, myelin damage gets worse over time. You won’t have the long remissions that you had with RRMS. Increasing nervous system damage will lead to more severe symptoms. In the past, about with RRMS moved into the SPMS stage within 10 years, and transitioned to SPMS within 25 years. With new MS drugs, fewer people are progressing to SPMS, and the transition is happening much more slowly. Experts don’t yet know how long these treatments can delay the progression to SPMS. MS is a disease that starts early in life but progresses over time. Most people start with the relapsing-remitting form, alternating periods of symptoms called relapses with symptom-free periods called remissions. Without treatment, the disease continues to the secondary-progressive form. Yet new and more effective treatments are slowing MS progression, sometimes for decades. — — Advancing MS: Coping with Depression, Stress, and Anger Understanding Secondary-Progressive Multiple Sclerosis Depression and MS: Ways to Care for Your Mental Health If you have MS, you're at an increased risk of developing depression.

9c9981ab-400d-4876-a705-fcbb3165e533,"Understanding Secondary-Progressive Multiple Sclerosis — — Secondary-progressive multiple sclerosis (SPMS) is a form of multiple sclerosis. It’s considered the next stage after relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS). With SPMS, there are no longer any signs of remission. This means that the condition is worsening despite treatment. However, treatment is still recommended at times to help reduce attacks and hopefully slow the progression of disability. This stage is common. In fact, most people with MS will develop SPMS at some point if not on an effective disease-modifying therapy (DMT). Knowing the signs of SPMS can help you detect it early. The sooner your treatment starts, the better your doctor will be able to help you reduce new symptoms and worsening of your disease. MS is a chronic autoimmune disease that comes in different forms and affects people differently. According to , about 90 percent of those with MS are initially diagnosed with RRMS. In the RRMS stage, the first noticeable symptoms include: RRMS symptoms can come and go. Some people might not have any symptoms for several weeks or months, a phenomenon called remission. MS symptoms can come back, too, though this is called a flare-up. People can also develop new symptoms. This is called an attack, or relapse. A relapse typically lasts for several days to several weeks. The symptoms can gradually worsen initially and then improve gradually over time without treatment or sooner with IV steroids. RRMS is unpredictable. At some point, many people with RRMS no longer have periods of remission or sudden relapses. Instead, their MS symptoms continue and worsen without any break. Continued, worsening symptoms indicate that RRMS has progressed to SPMS. This usually occurs 10 to 15 years after the first MS symptoms. However, SPMS can be delayed or even possibly prevented if started on effective MS DMTs early on in the disease course. Similar symptoms exist within all forms of MS. But SPMS symptoms are progressive and don’t improve over time. During the early stages of RRMS, symptoms are noticeable, but they aren’t necessarily severe enough to interfere with everyday activities. Once MS progresses to the secondary-progressive stage, symptoms become more challenging. SPMS develops as a result of neuronal loss and atrophy. If you notice your symptoms becoming worse without any remission or noticeable relapse, an MRI scan may aid in the diagnosis. MRI scans can show the level of cell death and brain atrophy. An MRI will show increased contrast during an attack because leaking of the capillaries during an attack causes a greater uptake of the gadolinium dye used in MRI scans. SPMS is marked by the absence of relapses, but it’s still possible to have an attack of symptoms, also known as a flare-up. Flare-ups are usually worse in heat and during times of stress. Currently, there are 14 DMTs used for relapsing forms of MS, including SPMS that continues to have relapses. If you were taking one of these drugs to treat RRMS, your doctor may have you on it until it stops controlling disease activity. Other types of treatment can help improve symptoms and quality of life. These include: Clinical trials test new types of medicine and therapies on volunteers in order to improve treatment for SPMS. This process gives researchers a clearer sense of what’s effective and safe. Volunteers in clinical trials may be among the first to get new treatments, but some risk is involved. The treatments may not help with SPMS, and in some cases, they may come with serious side effects. Importantly, precautions should be in place to keep volunteers safe, as well as protect their personal information. Participants in clinical trials generally need to meet certain guidelines. When deciding whether to take part, it’s important to ask like how long the trial will last, what the potential side effects might include, and why researchers think it’ll help. The lists clinical trials in the United States, though the COVID-19 pandemic may have delayed planned studies. Clinical trials currently listed as recruiting include one for , which may slow the progression of SPMS, as well as research into whether different types of therapy can help people with MS . Another trial aims to test whether can help people with progressive MS stay mobile and protect the brain. And a clinical trial is set to finish later this year of cells. Its goal is to test the safety and efficacy of stem cell treatment in people with progressive MS. Progression refers to symptoms becoming measurably worse over time. At some points, SPMS may be described as “without progression,” meaning it doesn’t seem to be measurably worsening. Progression varies considerably among people with SPMS. In time, some may need to use a wheelchair, but remain able to walk, possibly using a cane or walker. Modifiers are that indicate whether your SPMS is active or inactive. This helps inform conversations with your doctor about possible treatments and what you can expect going forward. For example, in the case of SPMS that’s active, you might discuss new treatment options. In contrast, with absent activity, you and your doctor may discuss using rehabilitation and ways to manage your symptoms with possibly a DMT that has less risk. The average life expectancy for people with MS tends to be about shorter than the general population. It’s not entirely clear why. Apart from severe cases of MS, which are rare, the main causes seem to be other medical conditions that also affect people generally, like cancer and heart and lung disease. Importantly, life expectancy for people with MS has increased in recent decades. It’s important to treat MS in order to manage symptoms and decrease disability worsening. Detecting and treating RRMS early can help prevent the onset of SPMS, but there’s still no cure. Though the disease will progress, it’s important to treat SPMS as early as possible. There’s no cure, but MS isn’t fatal, and medical treatments can significantly improve quality of life. If you have RRMS and are noticing worsening symptoms, it’s time to talk to your doctor. — — More in Finding Balance with Progressing Multiple Sclerosis Lifestyle Modifications That Make a Difference for Secondary Progressive MS Mobility Support Devices for Secondary Progressive MS: Braces, Walking Devices, and More FDA Approves 2 New Multiple Sclerosis Drugs: What You Need to Know New Medication and Treatment Options for Secondary Progressive MS Support for Life with Secondary Progressive MS: Social, Financial, and More Secondary progressive MS (SPMS) is a chronic condition that causes new and more severe symptoms to develop over time.

This characteristics of this type of MS is discussed. MS: Relapsing Remitting Multiple Sclerosis (RRMS) Menu In 1999, an international panel published a classification of multiple sclerosis (MS) that defined different forms of MS. One of these, the most common form, was relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS). Relapsing-remitting MS is defined as MS in which patients have relapses of MS and periods of stability in between relapses. Relapses are episodes of new or worsening symptoms not caused by or infection and that last more than 48 hours. In other words, a stable course is punctuated by episodes of new or worse symptoms. Relapsing-remitting MS is the most common initial form of MS. Younger patients are more likely to have this form of MS than older patients. What are the symptoms of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis? The symptoms of RRMS vary widely. Frequent early symptoms include: No two patients have the same symptoms. Some people are sensitive to heat. Some people get a tingling feeling when they bend their neck forward (Lhermitte's symptom). Some patients will have problems with weakness or unsteadiness of walking. Some combination of symptoms is common, and symptoms may vary over time in an individual.

25fd484d-2a9b-42bb-8dd1-0d49535cbe9e,"MS, the coronavirus and vaccines – updated global advice MS, the coronavirus and vaccines – updated global advice Sean Hegarty from the UK is in his mid-forties and lives with relapsing progressive MS My story actually starts some 15 years ago now, when I was about 30. I had just got married when my first symptom occurred. We had gone out for a walk one afternoon, and got a bit lost. After about an hour I started to drag my left foot, and then by the time we got back to where we were staying, I was dragging both feet. After a sit down and a rest, everything was ok again. This symptom kept occurring for the next eight years, and is still occurring today. It was seven years after this episode started that the second symptom occurred. This one was far more complex. Following a discussion with my wife, who said that I was acting very depressed, I went to my GP who, in turn, referred me to a psychiatrist. It was this psychiatrist who felt there was something more to my predicament than just depression. It was after this that I began to realise just how the depression was affecting my work. I subsequently got referred again, this time onto a neurologist, who started what turned out to be four years’ worth of investigations into my health problems! It was following my first MRI that my neurologist gave me three possible illnesses that he would be looking into: Sarcoidosis, SLE or multiple sclerosis. That afternoon I trawled through the internet, finding out about the three options that I had been given. After reading about the symptoms I was 90 per cent sure that I had MS. Everything seemed to fit – it was like it had been written about me. In the following months more referrals were made. Firstly onto a clinical neuro psychologist at the Wolfsen Neuro Re-Habilitation Centre, where my cognition was proved to be amiss, and then a second neuro psychologist at St George’s. A urologist at Roehampton had a say as well. It took a long time to get a final diagnosis as to whether it was relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) or primary progressive MS (PPMS), but finally it was confirmed as PPMS. After reading about PPMS I realised that my symptoms fitted like a glove, and with hindsight, that I don’t remit or relapse. Getting the diagnosis left me feeling quite relieved. The doctor confirmed to me that I had PPMS, albeit a very rare form of PPMS: relapsing progressive MS. He said I was one of 10 per cent of people with PPMS to have this type. Over the past six years, my life has changed BIG time. Firstly, I lost my health. My marriage broke down and I’m now divorced (that’s another big story). I lost my job because my employer did not understand MS (again, is another big story), and I also lost my brother to a brain tumour (yet again, that’s another big story). I have always been very positive about my MS. In fact I love my MS; after all I have to live with it for the rest of my life. Yes, it’s a pain in the backside (not literally) but I have to make the best of everything. I want to help other people with any form of MS and I want to keep myself busy whilst accepting my limits. I do not work anymore – I was a carpenter for all my working life. My balance and stability are shot, and now walking is becoming harder every week, but I manage. The fatigue gets to me every day and my short term memory has been blown to pieces, but thankfully my long term memory is fine. I have recently seen an MS counsellor, who helped me answer questions that I did not realise even needed asking. She told me that my ‘emotional gate’ was closed, so it did not allow me to take or show any emotion. It has taken a few years to get my emotions back to how they used to be. But I do not think life will ever be the same. I have also seen a physiotherapist and participated in a fatigue management course and a relaxation course. These have helped me no end, and I would recommend them to other people with MS. I would also say to other people with MS, be as positive as you can about your MS and try and keep yourself as busy as you can. I find that it does help to take your mind off the numerous problems associated with the MS. It is now with hindsight, and quite a lot of research, that I realise my MS has probably been with me since I was about 20, with nothing definite showing until I was about 38. I am now 46 and live with relapsing progressive MS (I have yet to get a true, actual meaning of this type of MS). I also live with Nystagmus, as brought on by my MS. I would love to get more information on this type of MS – I have found out that it is quite rare, with only 5 per cent of the 10 per cent who live with primary progressive MS living with this type. It equates to there being 500 people in the UK living with relapsing progressive MS, so I am one of the 500. It makes me feel quite special now. It is now summer 2014 and my condition has progressed, only very slowly though. I am now 48 and not much has changed with my MS, although my walking seems to be a bit more tricky now, and the neuralgic pain that I get, mainly in my left leg, has increased. This is now being treated, quite successfully, with the medication 2x60mg’s of Duloxetine, that my consultant has put me on. The other medications that have also put me on are 2700IU of Vitamin D3 and, most recently, in a month’s time I will be on 60mg of Simvastatin, only on 40mg at present, which is a Statin, and said to be beneficial to those who live with a progressive MS. I just wish that I could get to see my consultant at least twice a year now, but I understand why it is only once yearly, with their work load, and my very slow progression of my MS. All of my emotions are now back to where they were, and sometimes increased to what they were, which I think is brilliant. I got re-married last year, with a very small but quite lovely ceremony at a Masonic lodge, a stone’s throw from Twickenham Rugby Stadium. We only went on honeymoon this year, but that was to the Dominican Republic, which was so nice. The Nystagmus, which I live with also, is more prominent in my day to day life. This may be because I have been told that the Nystagmus is vertical as well as horizontal, with the later being the worst. I now intend to live my life to the fullest, whilst taking my disability into account. This is what everyone who is, or may be, in the same club as me, should also strive for. It gives a good reason for living, even if it is only with a rare form of multiple sclerosis. أحدث البحوث والتطورات العلمية في مجال مرض التصلب العصبي المتعدد بالنقر على ""إرسال"" انا أعطي موافقة للأتحاد الدولي للتصلب العصبي المتعدد MSIF بأن يرسل لي نشرة MS Research News Please read our and Multiple Sclerosis International Federation 3rd Floor Skyline House 200 Union Street London SE1 0LX Keep in touch with our work on Twitter, Facebook and YouTube.

2423bd61-2d45-4679-ae7e-f351da8d5a26,"MS, the coronavirus and vaccines – updated global advice MS, the coronavirus and vaccines – updated global advice Sean Hegarty from the UK is in his mid-forties and lives with relapsing progressive MS My story actually starts some 15 years ago now, when I was about 30. I had just got married when my first symptom occurred. We had gone out for a walk one afternoon, and got a bit lost. After about an hour I started to drag my left foot, and then by the time we got back to where we were staying, I was dragging both feet. After a sit down and a rest, everything was ok again. This symptom kept occurring for the next eight years, and is still occurring today. It was seven years after this episode started that the second symptom occurred. This one was far more complex. Following a discussion with my wife, who said that I was acting very depressed, I went to my GP who, in turn, referred me to a psychiatrist. It was this psychiatrist who felt there was something more to my predicament than just depression. It was after this that I began to realise just how the depression was affecting my work. I subsequently got referred again, this time onto a neurologist, who started what turned out to be four years’ worth of investigations into my health problems! It was following my first MRI that my neurologist gave me three possible illnesses that he would be looking into: Sarcoidosis, SLE or multiple sclerosis. That afternoon I trawled through the internet, finding out about the three options that I had been given. After reading about the symptoms I was 90 per cent sure that I had MS. Everything seemed to fit – it was like it had been written about me. In the following months more referrals were made. Firstly onto a clinical neuro psychologist at the Wolfsen Neuro Re-Habilitation Centre, where my cognition was proved to be amiss, and then a second neuro psychologist at St George’s. A urologist at Roehampton had a say as well. It took a long time to get a final diagnosis as to whether it was relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) or primary progressive MS (PPMS), but finally it was confirmed as PPMS. After reading about PPMS I realised that my symptoms fitted like a glove, and with hindsight, that I don’t remit or relapse. Getting the diagnosis left me feeling quite relieved. The doctor confirmed to me that I had PPMS, albeit a very rare form of PPMS: relapsing progressive MS. He said I was one of 10 per cent of people with PPMS to have this type. Over the past six years, my life has changed BIG time. Firstly, I lost my health. My marriage broke down and I’m now divorced (that’s another big story). I lost my job because my employer did not understand MS (again, is another big story), and I also lost my brother to a brain tumour (yet again, that’s another big story). I have always been very positive about my MS. In fact I love my MS; after all I have to live with it for the rest of my life. Yes, it’s a pain in the backside (not literally) but I have to make the best of everything. I want to help other people with any form of MS and I want to keep myself busy whilst accepting my limits. I do not work anymore – I was a carpenter for all my working life. My balance and stability are shot, and now walking is becoming harder every week, but I manage. The fatigue gets to me every day and my short term memory has been blown to pieces, but thankfully my long term memory is fine. I have recently seen an MS counsellor, who helped me answer questions that I did not realise even needed asking. She told me that my ‘emotional gate’ was closed, so it did not allow me to take or show any emotion. It has taken a few years to get my emotions back to how they used to be. But I do not think life will ever be the same. I have also seen a physiotherapist and participated in a fatigue management course and a relaxation course. These have helped me no end, and I would recommend them to other people with MS. I would also say to other people with MS, be as positive as you can about your MS and try and keep yourself as busy as you can. I find that it does help to take your mind off the numerous problems associated with the MS. It is now with hindsight, and quite a lot of research, that I realise my MS has probably been with me since I was about 20, with nothing definite showing until I was about 38. I am now 46 and live with relapsing progressive MS (I have yet to get a true, actual meaning of this type of MS). I also live with Nystagmus, as brought on by my MS. I would love to get more information on this type of MS – I have found out that it is quite rare, with only 5 per cent of the 10 per cent who live with primary progressive MS living with this type. It equates to there being 500 people in the UK living with relapsing progressive MS, so I am one of the 500. It makes me feel quite special now. It is now summer 2014 and my condition has progressed, only very slowly though. I am now 48 and not much has changed with my MS, although my walking seems to be a bit more tricky now, and the neuralgic pain that I get, mainly in my left leg, has increased. This is now being treated, quite successfully, with the medication 2x60mg’s of Duloxetine, that my consultant has put me on. The other medications that have also put me on are 2700IU of Vitamin D3 and, most recently, in a month’s time I will be on 60mg of Simvastatin, only on 40mg at present, which is a Statin, and said to be beneficial to those who live with a progressive MS. I just wish that I could get to see my consultant at least twice a year now, but I understand why it is only once yearly, with their work load, and my very slow progression of my MS. All of my emotions are now back to where they were, and sometimes increased to what they were, which I think is brilliant.

f65820dc-24cc-4c79-affb-1df059c5a1f8,"Information about the 2019 Novel Coronavirus. Información sobre el coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19). In multiple sclerosis (MS), the central nervous system, which includes the brain and spinal cord, becomes damaged. MS causes the immune system to attack the myelin, which is the insulation protecting the nerves. The nerves themselves can also be damaged. When myelin or the nerves become damaged, nerves cannot properly pass along their signals. The damaging process forms scar tissue called sclerosis, which gives the disease its name of multiple sclerosis.  Different types of MS affect people in different ways. One type is called relapsing-remitting MS. With this type, you have flare-ups of the disease, or relapses. Between these flare-ups, you have periods of recovery, or remissions. Most people diagnosed with MS start off with the relapsing-remitting type. In most cases, the course of the disease changes after a few decades and is then likely to become steadily worse. MS most often develops in people in their 20s and 30s. Women are twice as likely to have MS as men. Multiple sclerosis occurs when your body’s immune system attacks the central nervous system, damaging the myelin that protects nerve fibers. Experts believe that environmental factors trigger the disease in people whose genetics make them susceptible to MS. Scientists think MS may be caused by an infection that lays dormant in the body such as Epstein-Barr Virus (the virus that causes infectious mononucleosis) Scientists also think there may be a genetic susceptibility for some people Relapsing-remitting MS is marked by relapses that last at least 24 hours. During a relapse, symptoms get worse. A relapse will be followed by a remission. During a remission, symptoms partly or completely go away. Healthcare providers use many tests to help diagnose MS. Your healthcare provider will ask you questions about your symptoms. It's important to rule out other diseases that can cause similar symptoms. Your healthcare provider will also check to see how well your vision, your sense of balance, and other functions are working. You will need an MRI scan of your brain and spine. This may find areas of damage in your brain or spinal cord that suggest you may have MS. Another possible test measures what’s called visual evoked potentials. Painless electrodes placed on your scalp measure how your brain responds to things you see. Your healthcare provider may want to check your blood for other signs of disease. He or she may also order a test called a spinal tap (also called a lumbar puncture) to look at a sample of your spinal fluid. MS is not considered curable, but different types of medicine are available to decrease inflammation and slow down the progression of the disease. These medicines include:  Other medicines can be prescribed to treat: Your healthcare provider may also suggest steroids to reduce symptoms during flare-ups. If steroids are not effective your healthcare provider may recommend plasmapheresis, a blood cleansing procedure. What are the complications of relapsing-remitting MS? In most cases, relapsing-remitting MS is mild, although you may need to use a cane or other mobility device. In some cases, the disease is severe and causes the inability to care for yourself. Seldom does it cause death. If you have relapsing-remitting MS, you can take steps to manage your condition. Eat a diet low in saturated fat and trans-fat. Eat more foods with healthy omega-3 fatty acids because these nutrients are believed to fight inflammation. Avoid situations that cause you to become overheated. Get a moderate amount of exercise and enough sleep. Multiple sclerosis affects young people in their 20’s and 30’s. Although there is no cure, medicines can help you manage your symptoms. Adopting a healthy life-style can also help you manage your disease. Avoiding overheating or other triggers can prevent flares of MS. Tips to help you get the most from a visit to your healthcare provider: Know the reason for your visit and what you want to happen. Before your visit, write down questions you want answered. Bring someone with you to help you ask questions and remember what your provider tells you. At the visit, write down the name of a new diagnosis, and any new medicines, treatments, or tests. Also write down any new instructions your provider gives you. Know why a new medicine or treatment is prescribed, and how it will help you. Also know what the side effects are. Ask if your condition can be treated in other ways. Know why a test or procedure is recommended and what the results could mean. Know what to expect if you do not take the medicine or have the test or procedure. If you have a follow-up appointment, write down the date, time, and purpose for that visit. Know how you can contact your provider if you have questions.",83,Why get episode diagnosed by a doctor as a relapse of multiple sclerosis?,-0.1636812388896942,22
OA_LLama_83,"An exacerbation or 'relapse' of MS is when there are new symptoms, worsening symptoms, or both. It's common for people with relapsing-remitting MS to have periods where their disease activity increases and they have more frequent attacks (also known as flare-ups).
It can be helpful to see your healthcare provider if you think that you may be having an attack so that you can discuss treatment options early on. If it is an acute attack then corticosteroids like Solu-Medrol would be administered intravenously over the course of five days in the hospital, this will speed up recovery from the attack. You should call 911 immediately though if you experience any sudden weakness in arms or legs along with loss of bladder or bowel control or vision changes; these could all be signs of a serious medical emergency.
Early intervention and proper management by healthcare professionals has been shown to help reduce the severity and duration of attacks and also increase the chances of full recovery after each one.",83,Why get episode diagnosed by a doctor as a relapse of multiple sclerosis?,-0.17029385268688202,23

670b51d8-75a7-4bf7-aa52-aaf118dc82c1,"Everything You Need to Know About Transitioning from RRMS to SPMS — Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a progressive disease of the central nervous system (CNS) that affects your brain and the spinal cord. According to the National MS Society, about people over the age of 18 live with this condition in the United States. MS is an autoimmune disease in which the immune system attacks the CNS. This triggers inflammation and damages myelin, an insulating material that surrounds nerve fibers. The exact mechanism of how someone gets the disease is unknown. However, we do know that there is likely a combination of triggers including genetic and environmental factors. Damage to these fibers can trigger multiple neurological symptoms. This includes fatigue, numbness, weakness, cognitive problems, and issues with walking. The severity of your symptoms varies from person-to-person, and depends on the type of MS you have. Many people are initially diagnosed with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS). But over time, symptoms can progress to another type of MS, known as secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (SPMS). Here’s what you need to know about both types of MS. RRMS refers to a type of MS in which you experience periods of new MS symptoms or relapses followed by periods of remission. Remission is when symptoms improve or disappear. During relapses, you may have new typical MS symptoms like numbness, tingling, and blurred vision. These symptoms can lasts for days, weeks, or months, and then slowly improve over weeks to months. Some people experience complete disappearance of their symptoms during remission. On the other hand, if your symptoms continue, they may not be as severe. About with MS receive an RRMS diagnosis at first. Many people experience progression of their symptoms after living with RRMS for some time. This means that the disease becomes more active, and periods of remission become less and less frequent. This stage of MS is known as secondary progressive multiple sclerosis or SPMS. This condition is best described as MS without relapses. MS affects everyone differently, and not everyone with RRMS will transition to SPMS. But SPMS only develops after an initial diagnosis of RRMS. You’ll have typical MS symptoms during the transition from RRMS to SPMS, but you may experience a slow worsening of symptoms. You may even develop new symptoms. Before, maybe you had numbness or mild weakness, and these didn’t interfere much with your daily life. Once you transition to SPMS, though, you may notice cognitive changes, such as difficulty finding words. You may also have increased difficulty with walking or more noticeable numbness and tingling. The cause of this transition is unknown, but it may have to do with the disappearance of nerve fibers as the result of progressive nerve damage. Or it may be connected to the progressive loss of grey matter, which can be more subtle. Some people transition soon after an MS diagnosis, whereas others live with RRMS for decades before transitioning to SPMS. Since MS symptoms are unpredictable, it can be difficult to distinguish an RRMS relapse from the onset of SPMS. Speak with your doctor if you feel that you’re experiencing new or worsening symptoms. Your doctor can use an imaging test like an MRI to examine inflammation in your brain. Based on the level of inflammation in your brain as well as your relapse history, your doctor can determine whether your symptoms are a new relapse or SPMS. Even though some people with RRMS eventually transition to SPMS, it’s possible to delay disease progression. Treating MS is key to improving your symptoms and quality of life, and ultimately, slowing down the disease. Your doctor can prescribe disease-modifying therapies to help decrease inflammation, which can also improve the severity and frequency of your attacks. These include injectable, oral, and infusion medications such as: These treatments and others can help with the relapsing forms of MS. Talk to your doctor to find out which one is best for you. You may also receive intravenous corticosteroids to reduce acute inflammation in your CNS. This helps speed up recovery from an MS relapse. MS is a progressive condition that can lead to disability. You may eventually require some type of rehabilitation to help with daily living. Programs vary based on your needs. If you’re having difficulty with speech or swallowing, you may receive assistance from a speech or language pathologist. Or you may need appointments with an occupational therapist if you’re having difficulty with personal care, housework, or employment. Lifestyle changes can help improve your symptoms, too. Regular exercise may reduce spasticity and joint stiffness. It can improve both your flexibility and your overall health. Plus, exercise increases the brain’s production of endorphins, which are hormones that help regulate your emotions and mood. To avoid injury, start slow with gentle activities like water aerobics or walking. It’s also important to stretch both before and after activity to reduce muscle spasms, which are common in MS. Learn how to pace yourself and set limits. Additionally, you’ll want to avoid foods that can increase inflammation. These include highly processed foods such as hamburgers and hot dogs and foods high in salt. Examples of foods that can reduce inflammation are whole foods such as green leafy vegetables, fish high in omega-3s, and fruits such as blackberries and raspberries. If you smoke, talk to your doctor about ways to quit. Some people feel better after confiding in a close friend or family member, or after joining a support group for MS. MS is a serious condition, but early treatment can help you achieve remission and slow the progression of the disease. Worsening of symptoms can also interfere with the quality of your life. Talk with your doctor if you develop any new symptoms or signs of advancing MS. — More in Finding Balance with Progressing Multiple Sclerosis Lifestyle Modifications That Make a Difference for Secondary Progressive MS Understanding Secondary-Progressive Multiple Sclerosis Mobility Support Devices for Secondary Progressive MS: Braces, Walking Devices, and More FDA Approves 2 New Multiple Sclerosis Drugs: What You Need to Know New Medication and Treatment Options for Secondary Progressive MS Understanding Secondary-Progressive Multiple Sclerosis Secondary-progressive MS (SPMS) is a form of multiple sclerosis.

0b67a1c5-7dd6-41c5-a9c6-3fcfa0b9932c,"Primary progressive multiple sclerosis (PPMS) is an uncommon form of MS that affects approximately 10-15% of MS patients. In PPMS, symptoms steadily get worse over time without frequent relapses or remission. Unlike relapse-remitting MS (RRMS), which affects women more than men, PPMS affects an equal number of both genders. PPMS is usually diagnosed in older individuals between the ages of 40 to 60, yet it is sometimes diagnosed beyond this range. Early symptoms in PPMS develop slowly over a period of time and usually involve issues with walking and general mobility. The pace and progress of PPMS can vary from patient to patient. In some people with PPMS, relapses can occur along with steady disease progression. This is referred to as progressive-relapsing MS (PRMS). The diagnosis of PPMS is particularly difficult as it is diagnosed in the 40s and 50s when other health issues related to mobility tend to develop. Since PPMS is characterized by a gradual and steady accumulation of disability over time, the criteria for diagnosis of PPMS are different from that of other forms of MS. Worsening of neurological function for one year without remission Indications of immune activity in the CNS (such as elevated IgG index) These criteria often take a long time to develop, hence PPMS diagnosis usually taking two to three years more than diagnosis of RRMS. Treatment for PPMS mainly aims at managing neurological symptoms. Ongoing drug trials focus on reducing relapses and slowing down the disease progression rate as well as the build-up of disability. Currently, no FDA-approved medications are available for the treatment of PPMS. This is mainly because most approved therapies work towards reducing inflammation, which is not a characteristic of PPMS. Many clinical trials are underway to find an effective drug for this disease. Drug prices beat inflation all the way even with discounts Integrin b3 and ACE2 linked by short linear motifs enabling endocytosis and autophagy of SARS-CoV-2 Study sheds light on myelin's role in 'chemobrain' and multiple sclerosis Wellbeing and rehabilitation of people affected with PPMS is important and can be achieved by following a healthy diet and exercise regimen. Unsteadiness in walking and muscle weakness can be tackled with the help of an occupational therapist and a physiotherapist, while a dietician can help develop an appropriate meal plan based on the patient’s individual mobility levels. Neurologic examination and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) must be performed at least once a year to evaluate disease progression and activity. Characterizing the disease course at regular intervals is important as it helps in updating treatment methods. If PPMS is active with relapses or fresh MRI activity, a disease-modifying therapy (DMT) should be started so as to mitigate the risk of an attack. If PPMS is stable with no progression or activity, treatment should focus on rehabilitation so as to maintain function and symptom management. If PPMS is inactive with no relapses or activity, but with disease progression and build-up of disability, treatment should aim at maintaining function and promoting independence of the patient. PPMS does not involve relapses due to inflammation; hence, patients with this type of MS have fewer lesions or plaques in the brain with fewer inflammatory cells. Relapsing forms such as RRMS and secondary progressive MS (SPMS) are characterized by frequent inflammatory attacks. The age of onset for relapsing forms of MS is about 10 years earlier than that for PPMS. PPMS tends to affect walking and mobility more than other functions, while relapsing MS types cause numbness, spasticity, vision problems, and cognitive decline. http://www.nationalmssociety.org/What-is-MS/Types-of-MS/Primary-progressive-MS/Treating-Primary-Progressive-MS http://www.nationalmssociety.org/What-is-MS/Types-of-MS/Primary-progressive-MS https://www.mssociety.org.uk/what-is-ms/types-of-ms/primary-progressive-ppms Last Updated: Feb 27, 2019 Susha has a Bachelor of Science (B.Sc.) degree in Chemistry and Master of Science (M.Sc) degree in Biochemistry from the University of Calicut, India.

cd2862c3-2efd-423d-965b-6be71c728046,"Medically reviewed by — — A diagnosis of can be overwhelming at first. The condition itself is complex, and there are so many unknown factors because of the way multiple sclerosis (MS) manifests differently among individuals. That said, you can take actions now that may help you manage PPMS while preventing complications that can get in the way of your quality of life. Your first step is to have an honest conversation with your doctor. Consider bringing this list of 11 questions with you to your appointment as a PPMS discussion guide. The exact cause of PPMS, and all other forms of MS, is unknown. Researchers believe environmental factors and genetics might play a role in the development of MS. Also, according to the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS), about 15 percent of people with MS have at least one family member with the condition. People who smoke are also more likely to get MS. Your doctor may not be able to tell you how exactly you developed PPMS. However, they might ask questions about your personal and family health histories to gain a better overall picture. PPMS may be if you have at least one brain lesion, at least two spinal cord lesions, or an elevated immunoglobulin G (IgG) index in your spinal fluid. Also, unlike other forms of MS, PPMS may be evident if you’ve had symptoms that continuously worsen for at least a year without remission. In the relapsing-remitting form of MS, during exacerbations (flare-ups), the degree of disability (symptoms) get worse, and then they either go away or partially resolve during remission. PPMS may have periods when the symptoms don’t get worse, but those symptoms don’t lessen to earlier levels. Lesions, or plaques, are found in all forms of MS. These primarily occur on your brain, though they develop more so in your spine in PPMS. Lesions develop as an inflammatory response when your immune system destroys its own myelin. Myelin is the protective sheath that surrounds nerve fibers. These lesions develop over time and are detected through MRI scans. Sometimes diagnosing PPMS can take up to two or three years longer than diagnosing relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS), according to the . This is due to the complexity of the condition. If you’ve just received a PPMS diagnosis, it likely stemmed from months or even years of testing and follow-up. If you haven’t received a diagnosis for a form of MS yet, know that it can take a long time to diagnose. This is because your doctor will need to look through multiple MRIs to identify patterns on your brain and spine. The recommends an annual MRI as well as a neurological exam at least once a year. This will help determine whether your condition is relapsing or progressing. Additionally, MRIs can help your doctor chart the course of your PPMS so that they can recommend . Knowing the progression of the disease might help thwart the onset of disability. Your doctor will offer specific follow-up recommendations. You may also need to visit them more often if you start experiencing worsening symptoms. The onset and progression of symptoms in PPMS tend to occur more quickly than in other forms of MS. Therefore, your symptoms may not fluctuate as they would in relapsing forms of the disease but continue to steadily worsen. As PPMS progresses, there’s a risk of disability. Due to more lesions on your spine, PPMS can cause more walking difficulties. You may also experience worsening depression, fatigue, and decision-making skills. In 2017, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved ocrelizumab (Ocrevus), the first medication available for use in treating PPMS. This disease-modifying therapy is also approved to treat RRMS. Research is ongoing to find medications that will reduce the neurological effects of PPMS. Alternative and complementary therapies that have been used for MS include: Safety with alternative therapies is a concern. If you take any medications, herbal supplements might cause interactions. You should only try yoga and tai chi with a certified instructor that’s familiar with MS — this way, they can help you safely modify any poses as needed. Talk to your doctor before trying out any alternative remedies for PPMS. In addition to offering recommendations in these areas, your doctor may also refer you to other types of specialists. These include physical or occupational therapists, dietitians, and support group therapists. Currently, there’s no cure for any form of MS — this includes PPMS. The goal then is to manage your condition to prevent worsening symptoms and disability. Your doctor will help you determine the best course for PPMS management. Don’t be afraid to make follow-up appointments if you feel like you need more management tips.

It’s caused by an immune response that destroys the myelin sheath, or coating on nerves. Primary progressive multiple sclerosis (PPMS) is one of the four types of MS. The three other types of MS are: PPMS is one of the least common types, affecting about of all people diagnosed with MS. Most people affected by MS have acute attacks with symptoms, called relapses, and periods of months or years with little to no symptoms, called remissions. PPMS is different. The disease progresses once symptoms start to appear, hence the name primary progressive. There may be periods of active progression and then periods of inactive progression of symptoms and disability. One difference between PPMS and the relapsing forms is that while active progression may stop temporarily, the symptoms don’t resolve. In relapsing forms, the symptoms may actually improve or return near where they were before the most recent relapse. Another difference is that there isn’t as much inflammation in PPMS compared to relapsing forms. Because of this, many of the drugs that work for relapsing forms don’t work for PPMS or SPMS. The progression of symptoms can worsen over a few months or several years. PPMS is often diagnosed in people in their . RRMS, on the other hand, usually presents in people in their 20s and 30s. PPMS also affects both sexes equally, while RRMS affects two to three times as many women as men. PPMS is caused by slow nerve damage that stops nerves from sending signals to each other. All four types of MS involve damage to the protective coating (myelin) of the central nervous system, called demyelination, as well as damage to the nerve. PPMS symptoms are similar to SPMS symptoms. Of course, what one person experiences will be different from another. A continuous contraction of certain muscles may cause stiffness and tightness, which may affect movement. This can make it more difficult to walk, use the stairs, and influence your overall activity level. About of those with PPMS experience . This can significantly affect daily life and make it difficult to work and complete regular activities. Those diagnosed with PPMS may find themselves very tired from simple activities. For example, the task of cooking dinner could wear them out and require them to take a nap. Another early symptom of PPMS is or tingling in various body parts, such as your face, hands, and feet. This can be confined to one area of your body, or travel to other parts. This can include , , inability to identify colors and contrasts, and pain when moving your eyes. While PPMS typically affects mobility, some individuals may experience a cognitive decline. This can significantly impair remembering and processing information, solving problems, focusing, and learning anything new. Those with PPMS may have episodes of and lightheadedness. Others may experience vertigo, a sensation that they’re spinning and losing their balance. Bladder and bowel problems can range from , to the constant need to go, to . This can lead to sexual problems, such as , , and less sensation in the genitals. About will face at least one depressive episode. Although it’s common to be upset or angry about the increasing disability, these mood changes typically go away with time. , on the other hand, doesn’t subside and requires treatment. PPMS has similar symptoms to other types of MS, as well as other nervous system disorders. As a result, it may take up to longer to get a confirmed PPMS diagnosis than a RRMS diagnosis. have a year of progressively worsening neurologic function meet two of the following criteria: Your doctor will likely conduct a medical history exam and ask you about any previous neurologic events. They may ask for family members to be present, as they can contribute their experiences with past symptoms. Your doctor will then likely do a thorough physical exam, specifically checking your nerves and muscles. Your doctor will order an MRI scan to check for lesions in the brain and spinal cord. They may also order an to check for electrical activity in the brain. Finally, your doctor will perform a to look for signs of MS in the spinal fluid. There’s no cure for PPMS. One medication, ocrelizumab (Ocrevus), is approved for PPMS as well as relapsing forms of MS. are commonly used in relapsing forms, however, because they decrease inflammation. PPMS doesn’t have a lot of inflammation, so immunosuppressants may not be recommended as useful. Research on effective treatments is ongoing. While there’s no cure for PPMS, those diagnosed with PPMS shouldn’t give up hope. With the help of doctors, physical therapy professionals, speech pathologists, and specialists in mental health, there are ways to manage the disease. These can include medications that help relieve symptoms, such as for muscle spasms, as well as a healthy diet, exercise, and a proper sleep routine.

d7ccea3c-f2e8-4ed8-b344-1bb35f1adc16,"Information about the 2019 Novel Coronavirus. Información sobre el coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19). Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a neurodegenerative disease. It interferes with your brain's ability to control your body. It can be disabling. Each type might be mild, moderate, or severe. MS affects people differently.  With PPMS, neurologic functions get steadily worse in the beginning. There are no symptom flare-ups (also called relapses or attacks). And there is no recovery (remission). How fast the disease progresses may vary. There can be times when things are stable. And there can be periods of short-term (temporary) minor improvements. But declining neurologic progression is constant.  Men and women are evenly affected by this type of MS. About 10% of people diagnosed with MS have PPMS. On average, people with primary-progressive MS start having symptoms between ages 35 and 39. The exact cause of MS is not known, but research suggests it develops when your immune system attacks a substance called myelin. Myelin acts as a type of insulation on your nerve cells. This process can lead to damage in and around the nerves in your brain and spinal cord. It can also damage nerves used for vision. The occurrence and severity of PPMS symptoms vary with each person. Symptoms can include: Pain (for example, headaches, pain in the legs and feet, back pain, and muscle spasms) Electric-shock sensations that run down the back and limbs when the neck is bent (Lhermitte sign) Methods that your healthcare provider may use to diagnose MS include: Your healthcare provider will talk with you about your symptoms. This is done to see how your nerves and muscles are working. These images will help your healthcare provider look for signs of damage that suggest MS. This test measures nerve fibers in the retina. Your healthcare provider removes a sample of spinal fluid to check for signs of MS. This test is done to see how well your optic nerves are working. After the general diagnosis of MS, the diagnosis of PPMS is based almost exclusively on the patient's symptom history. Because of this, it may take time for the PPMS diagnosis to be made. Several medicines are available to treat relapsing forms of MS. But the FDA hasn't approved any medicines to treat primary-progressive MS. Your healthcare provider may still be able to use 1 of these medicines in your case. But more likely your healthcare provider will try to provide treatments that relieve symptoms and improve your quality of life. These may address problems such as depression, sexual problems, and extreme tiredness (fatigue). Experts don't know how to prevent MS or the PPMS type of MS. Some people limit MS relapses by avoiding specific triggers such as stress and overheating. Physical and occupational therapy may be helpful. For example, therapists may teach you exercise strategies and how to manage new symptoms that develop. Your healthcare provider will also probably want to meet with you on a regular basis to monitor your disease. Regular exercise and getting plenty of sleep may also help. If your body temperature goes up, it may make your symptoms worse for a short time. So it’s best to not do things that could lead to overheating, such as extended periods of time in the sun or overexerting yourself.",83,Why get episode diagnosed by a doctor as a relapse of multiple sclerosis?,-0.37363699078559875,29

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a disorder of the central nervous system (CNS) characterized by inflammation, demyelination and degenerative changes that can lead to functional loss and disability. Most people with MS experience relapses and remissions of neurological symptoms, particularly early in the disease, and relapses are usually associated with new inflammation in the CNS. Over time, there are fewer relapses and less new inflammatory activity with the disease process becoming more progressive.  There is a large that supports with an approved disease modifying therapy as an evidence-based approach to reducing new relapses, delaying progression of disability and limiting new inflammation in the CNS. The FDA has approved several for the treatment of relapsing forms of MS, which include clinically isolated syndrome, relapsing-remitting disease (RRMS) and active secondary progressive disease (SPMS with relapses). One DMT has also been approved for primary progressive MS and one other for non-active secondary progressive MS (no inflammatory demyelination or clinical relapses).

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory central nervous system disease that causes often disabling physical symptoms, including problems with mobility, vision, coordination and cognitive function, as well as fatigue and pain. If you've been diagnosed with relapsing-remitting , your doctor is likely to recommend immediate treatment with medications known as disease-modifying therapy (DMT). have been shown to reduce the number of relapses and delay progression of disability to some degree. These drugs differ in how they're taken and how often, whether they can be taken during pregnancy, and what side effects they can cause. They also differ in how people respond to them, and a person's response to a drug can change over time. Also, aren't a cure, and you might still need treatment for symptoms of . An understanding of can help you and your doctor form the best treatment strategy for your relapsing-remitting . These medications are among the first approved for relapsing and are still used as first line therapy. They include: The interferon beta medications are given by self-injection, either under the skin or in a muscle. The frequency of injections varies from once every two days to once every two weeks. These drugs have moderate to strong evidence of effectiveness, reducing the relapse rate and slowing the development of new -related brain lesions for relapsing . These drugs are considered generally safe and require minimal monitoring. Flu-like symptoms and injection site reactions, such as redness and discomfort, are commonly reported side effects of interferon beta drugs. This also is considered an initial therapy option for relapsing . This drug is thought to act through immune system cells known as T cells. It might also have nerve-protecting effects. Glatiramer acetate is given by self-injection under the skin, either three times weekly or every day. It's generally well tolerated, but injection site reactions, such as redness and discomfort, are common. This is the first drug approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat both relapsing and primary-progressive . Not only has it been shown to reduce relapses, but it can slow disease progression. Ocrelizumab is given as an IV infusion initially twice in two weeks. After that, the infusion is given every six months. Infusion reactions, such as a headache, rash, nausea and fever, are common. Your doctor might recommend that you be given a corticosteroid and an antihistamine before infusion to help prevent reactions. People with hepatitis B shouldn't take ocrelizamab. is a humanized monoclonal antibody that reduces the migration of immune cells across the blood-brain barrier into the central nervous system. This medication is given intravenously every four weeks. Natalizumab is effective against relapsing , reducing the relapse rate by about two-thirds. However, it's associated with a small but important risk of a serious brain infection known as progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML). People who take natalizumab must be closely monitored for symptoms of , which include progressive weakness and visual or cognitive changes that might not be reversible. A person's ongoing risk is assessed using factors such as: The presence of antibodies to a virus known as John Cunningham virus on blood testing Previous treatment of immunosuppressive drugs, such as mitoxantrone This drug helps reduce relapses of by targeting a protein on the surface of immune cells and depleting white blood cells. This effect can limit potential nerve damage caused by the white blood cells, but it also increases the risk of infections and autoimmune disorders. Treatment with alemtuzumab involves five consecutive days of drug infusions followed by three days of infusions a year later. Infusion reactions, such as a headache, rash, nausea and fever, are common with alemtuzumab. Due to the risks associated with alemtuzamab, the recommends extensive screening before using the drug. It's only available from registered providers, and people treated with alemtuzumab must be registered in a special drug safety monitoring program. These oral are approved for treating relapsing . This once-daily oral medication reduces the relapse rate of . Fingolimod is a unique medication that binds to many different types of body cells. It traps white blood cells in lymph nodes so that they can't enter the brain and cause new lesions. People with heart disorders or related conditions can't use fingolimod. It can temporarily slow the heart rate, so the first dose must be taken under medical supervision. It also requires monitoring of vision because of a risk of buildup of fluid in the macula, an area in the center of the retina. For that reason, people with diabetes generally shouldn't use fingolimod. Teriflunomide has been approved in two doses, 7 milligrams (mg) and 14 mg, taken once daily. It's generally well tolerated at both doses. Possible side effects include headache, diarrhea, nausea, elevation in liver enzymes and hair thinning. Pregnant women and people with liver conditions shouldn't use teriflunomide. Also known as BG-12, dimethyl fumarate is taken twice daily. Common side effects include flushing and gastrointestinal problems, such as diarrhea and nausea.

We are here to help you — with information , tips for about your medical issues, and whatever else you may need during this difficult time.  For referrals to healthcare providers in your area, call 1-800-344-4867 to speak to one of our MS Navigators®. Here is some information to get you started: Is there someone I can talk to about my situation? Absolutely. If you have questions about MS — , , , or any other issues that are of concern to you, call 1-800-344-4867 to speak to one of our MS Navigators®. Why can’t the doctor tell me what’s wrong with me? While diagnostic criteria exist to help make an accurate diagnosis of MS, it is not an easy disease to diagnose. There is no single test for multiple sclerosis. Second, the diagnosis cannot be made until the healthcare provider finds evidence of two episodes of disease activity in different locations in the central nervous system that have occurred at different points in time. And third, most MS symptoms, particularly early in the disease, can be caused by other conditions, which means that your healthcare provider needs to rule out all other possible explanations.  Very often, when a central nervous system problem, such as MS, is suspected, a number of tests will need to be done before the diagnosis is confirmed. One of those test, MRI, is an important test that helps with the diagnosis as it can reveal areas of damage that are typical of MS. Are there any treatments available to help me in the meantime? If your healthcare provider believes — based on your medical history, physical exam, and test results — that you have and are at high risk of developing MS, there are that have been shown to delay the development of clinically-definite MS. If you’re experiencing symptoms that are making you uncomfortable or interfering with your everyday activities, be sure to discuss them with your healthcare provider. Many symptoms can be successfully managed even without a confirmed diagnosis. If you’re feeling overwhelmed or by your symptoms or the uncertainty of the diagnosis, consider talking with a counselor about it. The Society can refer you to a professional in your area for help in dealing with this difficult situation. What should I say to my employer about my medical problems and absences from work?

28a543a7-d394-4d26-aa31-7b48e097cffb,"MS, the coronavirus and vaccines – updated global advice MS, the coronavirus and vaccines – updated global advice At present there is no cure for MS but various treatments exist to manage the disease At present there is no cure for MS, but management of the disease includes drug treatments to treat acute inflammatory attacks (or relapses), medications that reduce the risk of further inflammatory relapses (disease modifying therapies) and treatments to slow disease progression. Then there are also therapies that alleviate and improve various symptoms. Successful management of MS also includes a healthy diet, exercise and rehabilitation. The following information should not be relied on to suggest a course of treatment for a particular individual, and it should not be used in place of a visit, call, consultation or the advice of a physician or other qualified healthcare provider. MS relapses are caused by inflammation in the central nervous system that damages the myelin coating around nerve fibres. This damage slows or disrupts the transmission of nerve impulses and causes the symptoms of MS. Acute relapses are commonly treated with steroids, which can be given intravenously or orally for only a few days. The steroids work by damping down the inflammation that is causing demyelination. Steroids are not believed to have any long-term benefit on the course of disease, but they can be effective at: Steroids do not affect the outcome of a relapse, such as any difficulty or disability that someone might experience following a relapse Disease modifying treatments are not a cure for MS but aim to prevent or reduce the number of relapses that occur in relapsing-remitting MS. Drugs commonly used to modify the disease course in relapsing MS beta interferon-1a (Avonex): injected into a muscle once a week. beta interferon-1a (Rebif): injected under the skin three times a week. beta interferon-1b (Betaferon): injected under the skin every other day. beta interferon-1b (Extavia): injected under the skin every other day. glatiramer acetate (Copaxone or Brabio): injected under the skin daily, or three times a week at a higher dose. glatiramer acetate (generic): injected under the skin daily. peginterferon beta 1a (Plegridy): injected under the skin once every two weeks. cladribine (Mavenclad): pills taken for up to five consecutive days in the first month and for up to five consecutive days in the second month, with the same course repeated a year later. This may need to be repeated at some point in the future. dimethyl fumarate (Tecfidera): taken as a capsule, twice daily. diroximel fumarate (Vumerity): taken as a capsule, twice daily. fingolimod (Gilenya): taken as a capsule, once daily. The first dose is taken under medical supervision to monitor heart rate and blood pressure. siponimod (Mayzent): approved to treat relapsing forms of MS and clinically isolated syndrome. It is taken as a tablet, once a day. So far, it has only been approved for use in the United States of America by the American Food and Drug Administration. teriflunomide (Aubagio): taken as a tablet, once daily. alemtuzumab (Lemtrada): taken as two treatment courses of intravenous infusions (IV or ‘drip’). The first course consists of intravenous infusions on five consecutive days. The second course is taken 12 months later and consists of intravenous infusions on three consecutive days. Some people may need a third or further infusion. ocrelizumab (Ocrevus): taken as an intravenous infusion, with a more intense course to start and then further infusions every six months. natalizumab (Tysabri): taken as an intravenous infusion via a drip once every four weeks. It is generally administered in a hospital infusion clinic by a qualified health professional. Drugs used to modify the disease course in progressive MS So far, only a few drugs have been approved specifically to treat progressive MS. In some countries, people with relapsing forms of MS who are initially treated with one of the above drugs and are subsequently diagnosed with secondary progressive MS, can continue with their existing treatment if they still experience relapses (a phase described as active secondary progressive MS). In other countries, however, being diagnosed with secondary progressive MS can act as a trigger to stop the individual from being prescribed with drugs approved for relapsing MS. ocrelizumab (Ocrevus): approved to treat .  Ocrelizumab is also an immune suppressing or modifying drug. In primary progressive MS it targets B cells. As above, it is taken as an intravenous infusion, with two half doses in the first month followed by further infusions every six months. In some countries (notably those in Europe) there is a more restrictive license that requires people with primary progressive MS to also have evidence of inflammatory activity. This evidence is collected through MRI scans. siponimod (Mayzent): approved to treat . As with the treatments above, siponimod is also an immune modifying drug, similar to fingolimod, but with further biological effects. It is taken as a tablet, once a day. So far, it has only been approved for use in the United States of America by the Food and Drug Administration. cladribine (Mavenclad): approved to treat relapsing forms of MS including Cladribine is taken as a tablet in two treatment courses, twelve months apart. diroximel fumarate (Vumerity): approved by the Food and Drug Administration in the US to treat . It is taken as a capsule, twice daily. Other drugs that have been used to modify the disease course in MS In some countries, a number of other immune suppressing or modifying treatments are still used to treat relapsing multiple sclerosis, although in many countries these have been replaced by the treatments above. They can be useful for some people with MS, such as for those with more severe or frequent relapses or for people whose MS is rapidly worsening. Neurologists and people with MS need to work together to balance the positive effects of the drugs against their potential adverse side effects. These drugs include: autologous haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (aHSCT): This is usually a disease modifying drug treatment  the transplantation of haematopoietic stem cells. It is typically available through clinical trials or as experimental medicine. People with MS experience a wide range of symptoms caused by damage to their central nervous system. A number of treatments have been tested for MS symptoms and there has been some progress for particular symptoms such as spasticity and gait problems. However, testing of treatments for use in other symptoms such as fatigue and cognitive impairment has been unclear to date. Balancing treatment benefits with the risk of side effects is difficult in symptom management. For example, a treatment that improves spasticity and pain but worsens mobility may not be worth pursuing. Neurologists need to work closely with each person with MS to find appropriate treatments for that person’s symptoms. Other symptom management techniques such as rehabilitation, energy conservation and exercise also need to be considered. Aversa, Italy, 03/2012. Like many people with MS, Stefania Salzillo finds it difficult to cope with the daily injections of Interferon-b. Her boyfriend, Ernesto Lodice, helps out providing both practical and emotional support.

However, testing of treatments for use in other symptoms such as fatigue and cognitive impairment has been unclear to date. Balancing treatment benefits with the risk of side effects is difficult in symptom management. For example, a treatment that improves spasticity and pain but worsens mobility may not be worth pursuing. Neurologists need to work closely with each person with MS to find appropriate treatments for that person’s symptoms. Other symptom management techniques such as rehabilitation, energy conservation and exercise also need to be considered. Aversa, Italy, 03/2012.

Researchers have apparently a way to help predict multiple sclerosis disease progression one year after an initial attack. Magnetic resonance imaging scans (MRIs) have long been used to assist in diagnosing multiple sclerosis (MS). But now these tests are providing information that can tell experts what type of MS a patient may get, if any. Experts say that by using the first MRI after the presentation of disease and determining location, length, and numbers of lesions, they created a feasible way to predict whether a patient will have more attacks. They can also gauge whether a person’s disease will turn into relapsing MS or progressive MS. “MS treatments have a price and side effects can be serious,” said Dr. Noam Bosak, part of the research group and a physician in the neurology department of Rambam Health Care Campus in Haifa, a 1,000-bed academic hospital serving more than 2 million residents of northern Israel. “We wish to help healthcare professionals and patients make better decisions together.” Bosak explained how after an initial demyelinating attack, a person could have no more activity, a diagnosis known as clinically isolated syndrome (CIS). “It can sometimes take 12 months for a doctor and patient to make a decision on treatment,” she told Healthline. By categorizing lesions based on size and location, the MRI can help show which kind of treatment may work best and when it’s needed. “Some patients will need more aggressive treatments while others will do well on a more relaxed follow-up program,” Bosak said. “This is a unique study focusing on the first year.” The study took patients with one clinically isolated attack and measured their brain lesions with an MRI at time of attack and at intervals during the first year. One year after the first MRI, 54 percent of the patients had progressed to MS. Researchers concluded that patients with lesions that were temporal, occipital, or perpendicular to the corpus callosum at the first episode were more likely to have a recurrence. Those patients with a combination of more than 13 lesions, with maximal lesion length greater than 0.75 cm, and a lesion perpendicular to the corpus callosum, had a 19 times higher chance of conversion MS during the following year. There were only 46 patients in the study, but experts say the results are revealing. “This small study adds to the literature of MRI studies which suggest the utility of specific MRI parameters as prognostic indicators,” said Dr. Barbara Giesser, professor of clinical neurology at the David Geffen School of Medicine at the University of California at Los Angeles and clinical director of the UCLA MS program. “What people are trying to accomplish is to diagnose as early as possible,” added Bruce Bebo, executive vice president of research at the National Multiple Sclerosis Society. “The earlier we treat [MS], the better the outcomes. We know that.” “This work is part of a whole series of people around the world to discover who’s at high risk to get MS. And to have the confidence to treat these patients before they get MS,” Bebo told Healthline. He added that experts are looking for anything that gives confidence in diagnosing MS as early as possible with tools such as MRI and biomarkers. “It was a fine study, intriguing, interesting, and adds to what we know about the imaging factor, but it’s not actionable yet,” Bebo said. “It was a pretty small number of participants, but it’s a clue. A hypotheses-generating study would need to be pursued by larger groups and people to use it as prognostic tool.” Today, neurologists can use MRIs, clinical history, and examinations to start to get a sense for those with CIS and to separate those with higher and lower risk for developing MS. “Neurologists can then decide if they’re willing to treat CIS if factors like imaging and history are adding up to high risk category,” explained Bebo. MRIs are increasingly used with confidence in helping healthcare providers and patients determine a course of action in treatment. In 2017, the Consortium of MS Centers created new on how to best use MRIs in the MS diagnosis and follow-up processes. “Most interesting, most important thing, I found is clearly practical,” concluded Bosak, “It gives us a tool to make decisions about DMTs [disease modifying therapies] for patients.” The biggest question regarding MS treatment is how to attack it correctly from day one. “One wouldn’t make a decision based on this information, but it gives a direction.” Bosak said. “We need a larger study to make it a better clinical tool.” Editor’s note: Caroline Craven is a patient expert living with MS.

146e4df7-ec0d-4b9e-9b4b-b034db97890e,"Think of Multiple Sclerosis as a Leaking Swimming Pool [Video] A new way of looking at the neurodegenerative disorder could lead to more and better treatments For 20 years neurologists have divided the neurological disorder multiple sclerosis (MS) into four distinct categories—subtypes that are supposed, in part, to help patients get the right treatments. But a new theory erases the distinctions between these groups and suggests that MS is a single disease after all. The idea was developed by Stephen Krieger, a neurologist at Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City, and presented in late April at the American Academy of Neurology (AAN) annual meeting in Washington, D.C. If the theory holds up, it could lead to more effective management for a wider range of patients. In MS the body produces antibodies that attack the central nervous system, i.e. the brain and spinal cord. Specifically these antibodies ravage myelin, a fatty substance that insulates neurons, allowing them to conduct electricity. The nerves develop scars or sclerotic lesions (sclerosis is Greek for hard) in the aftermath of such attacks. As a result, patients can suffer from weakness, pain and walking difficulties—not to mention vision loss and a host of undesirable bowel, bladder and psychiatric ills. The current classification system arose as a way to describe the various ways MS symptoms tend to unfold. The most common type of MS is called relapsing-remitting disease; patients experience flare-ups—in which, for example, they suddenly lose vision in one eye—followed by periods of neurologic normalcy. Presumably their immune system has gone into overdrive when the flare-ups occur and then the activity subsides for months or even years. Less common are primary and secondary progressive MS. In the former, symptoms progress from the get-go and never remit; in the latter, patients first experience relapses and remissions but then progress to continuously worsening symptoms. Finally there’s progressive-relapsing MS in which patients experience continuously progressive disease on top of which more severe exacerbations occur. Krieger’s hypothesis is a metaphoric reunion of these four otherwise separate divisions of disease—one that can perhaps best be explained by analogy with a swimming pool in need of repair. Imagine a pool with mountains rising up from the bottom. The mountains represent scars in the central nervous system; the water surface is the threshold at which symptoms appear. Lesions below the water line do not cause symptoms whereas those jutting out of the water do. The water surface can also be seen as the body's neurologic reserve capacity. Our brains are astoundingly resilient: If one part of the brain is injured, neighboring neurons can step in and take over. But according to Krieger, as we age and as MS progresses, not only does the scarring worsen (that is, the mountains grow higher), the brain also loses its ability to compensate for injured tissue—meaning water starts draining out of the pool and more lesions and resulting symptoms become apparent. Krieger calls his view of MS the topographical model (referring to the mountains jutting out of the water). He believes his concept unites the MS categories and demonstrates the relationship between relapsing and progressive disease. Relapsing-remitting patients have mountains that temporarily rise above the waterline but then sink again. In those with the other three forms of MS—the more consistently progressive forms—the mountains emerge above the surface but never recede and the symptoms never go away. If Krieger’s hypothesis is correct, the four MS divisions could be reenvisioned as different stages or different expressions of the same disease. It’s not that the disease completely goes away during ‘remission,’ Krieger explains. ""We can see old lesions there on MRI the whole time."" But the brain’s ability to compensate for the effects of the lesions declines. In other words, after the immune system’s assault has waned and a patient with relapsing-remitting disease is symptom-free, some of the neurons are nonetheless still scarred. The nervous system, however, is somehow able to compensate—until one day it cannot and the disease is considered progressive. This could explain why many patients look and feel better than their brain scans would suggest; and also why some patients, in Krieger’s words, catch up to their MRI."" Krieger acknowledges that the existing categories—incidentally developed by his mentor, Fred Lublin, director of the Center for Multiple Sclerosis at Mount Sinai Medical Center—have been incredibly helpful in MS care. He just feels they need to be appreciated collectively. ""Neurologists find that it’s very hard to apply the current categories to individual patients,"" he says. ""We’ve shown that diagnostically we don’t really know when someone goes from relapsing-remitting MS to progressive MS. And often times when we think someone has a progressive form of MS, they stay stable for years and don’t actually progress."" Although this new model is in its infancy, it is quickly turning heads among MS experts. In an e-mail, Lawrence Steinman, professor of neurology, pediatrics and genetics at Stanford University, wrote, ""at first glance, it looks quite exciting in the way it integrates visually the ‘topographical’ distribution of lesions and the relapses they cause; relapse frequency, severity and recovery; and progression rate."" It looks quite ""promising,"" Lublin wrote. ""The model provides an individual dynamic to the MS disease courses that we’ve described. It has potential usefulness for practitioners and for enhancing patient understanding of the illness."" The idea that MS is caused not only by worsening immune activity but also by declining general brain health opens new therapeutic possibilities. ""We can think of our medicines as working on the floor of the pool, Krieger says. ""They prevent lesions But I don’t think they affect the decline of reserve. People with MS can stay neurologically well for a long time with their disease below the surface."" A two-pronged attack that aims to boost brain health as well as prevent lesions would be ideal. Data from some studies suggest that approach may already possible. Exercise has been shown to prevent the degeneration of brain tissue in patients with MS whereas smoking and diets low in antioxidants are associated with a worsening of the disease. Also beyond just targeting aberrant immune activity, drug companies could pursue compounds that increase the brain’s ability to compensate. In fact, a separate study of 154 people presented at the AAN meeting showed that large doses of the vitamin biotin (found in a range of foods from grains to meats to vegetables) reduced disability in patients with MS, possibly by helping to preserve myelin. A drug that helps regenerate myelin might also be on the way. Early data on an antibody called BIIB033, which was also presented at the conference, suggest it improves electrical conduction in the optic nerves of MS patients, possibly by improving the function of oligodendrocytes, the cells that produce myelin. According to developer Biogen, this is the first evidence of remyelination occurring with a drug therapy. A means to repair myelin would go far to increase brain and nervous system resiliency in MS patients. In the meantime, if Krieger’s idea catches on, it could have more immediate influence on diagnosis and patient care. Most research into MS treatments has focused on the relapsing-remitting subtype; treatment options for those with progressive MS are few and far between and primarily off-label, meaning they’re not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. If MS comes to be thought of as a single disorder, it could encourage clinicians to consider using treatments that they had previously reserved just for relapsing-remitting disease to the other subtypes as well. It could also help distinguish between a true relapse and a temporary decline in neurologic function that briefly renders lesions symptomatic, like, say, when a patient has the flu. When the brain is fatigued for whatever reason—infection, fever, stress—its resiliency can wane and cause MS symptoms to emerge. But according to Krieger’s new model, this might not represent a true relapse but rather a temporary leak in the pool.

3a559f0d-7124-4610-9f2c-1177b52c075f,"RRMS: What You Need to Know About Switching Medications — — Relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) is the most common form of multiple sclerosis (MS). You may have periods when symptoms either don’t progress or don’t occur at all (remission) followed by bouts of worsening symptoms or brand-new symptoms (relapse). During remission, sometimes the symptoms that remain become permanent. Over time, inflammation will affect the central nervous system of people with MS. This makes symptoms and overall disease progression difficult to predict. With RRMS, symptoms may worsen over time. Subsequently, your treatment plan may require modification. If you’re having new symptoms, you may be thinking about . While switching RRMS medications might be helpful, the transition won’t necessarily be a smooth one. Talking with your doctor can help. Before you stop your current treatment plan and start up another one, be sure to safety considerations, effectiveness, and the possibility of side effects with your doctor. You’ll also need to understand all dosing information. MS medications are also known as disease-modifying therapies (DMTs). The primary goal of DMTs is to help prevent new lesions and new symptoms from occurring. They also help slow disease progression. The recommends changing your DMT if: The medication’s treatment schedule isn’t working for you. Your symptoms can also indicate whether or not your DMT is working properly. Common symptoms of RRMS include: If you’re already on medication and experience the above symptoms in a new or worsening fashion, then it’s time to consider a new DMT. People usually make this type of switch if new symptoms continue to develop after of treatment with a DMT. However, keep in mind some medications may take 6 months to become fully active. Your doctor will also consider the number of relapses you’ve had in the past year. The more recent your relapse, the more likely it is that your RRMS will respond to a new DMT. DMTs come in the form of as well as . Some are also delivered intravenously, or through a vein. In addition to DMTs, your doctor may prescribe medications to treat symptoms that are directly related to RRMS. For example, your doctor might recommend antidepressants for anxiety or depression. They might also recommend medications that reduce muscle spasms, such as baclofen (Lioresal, Gablofen). It’s important that you don’t stop taking these types of medications just because you suspect your current DMT isn’t working. Your doctor will evaluate all of your current medications and help you adjust accordingly. Suddenly stopping any medication can cause increased symptoms, such as worsening depression when abruptly stopping the use of an antidepressant. The following side effects are associated with RRMS medications: increased liver enzymes, which indicate liver inflammation skin reactions, in the case of injectable medications worsening thyroid symptoms, in the case of preexisting related diseases Regular blood testing can help ensure that any new DMT isn’t adversely affecting the body. However, if you experience any new or worsening symptoms, it’s likely related to your new medication. At this point, you may talk to your doctor about switching your DMT to get rid of these side effects. If you take multiple medications to manage your symptoms, this process may take time. Occasional MRI tests are also needed to help your doctor detect changes from MS-related inflammation. These tests are performed once or twice a year, depending on the severity of your condition. Through an MRI, your doctor will look for any new cerebral lesions, which often have no symptoms. You may also need to change medications if you have new lesions and worsening disability without any notable relapses. The bottom line: Switching requires careful monitoring If you’re and decide to switch, your doctor will be the ultimate source of guidance. They’ll carefully monitor your condition as you transition between medications in case there are any signs that a certain medication isn’t working. The good news is that RRMS has a better response to medications than other forms of MS. Still, it can take some trial and error before you find the right therapy for you. Keep in mind that everyone responds to MS therapies differently, so continue touching base with your doctor to see if your current plan is the best fit. — — Six Talking Points to Bring Up at Your Next Appointment for MS Oral vs. Injectable MS Treatments: What’s the Difference?

Blair, who has starred in films like “Hellboy” and “Legally Blonde” wrote on her Instagram this week that she “is disabled.” “I have . I am in an exacerbation,” Blair wrote in an Instagram post. “By the grace of the lord, and will power and the understanding producers at Netflix, I have a job. A wonderful job. I am disabled. I fall sometimes. I drop things. My memory is foggy. And my left side is asking for directions from a broken gps.” Blair said she was diagnosed in August but had symptoms years earlier. “I have probably had this incurable disease for 15 years at least,” she wrote. In fact, Blair actually fits many of the demographics at higher risk of the disease. The actress’ news has put a spotlight on a condition that can still be confusing for patients and physicians alike. MS isto affect women than men, and most symptoms first appear when a person is between 20 and 40, according to the American Association of Neurological Surgeons. About 1,000,000 Americans have MS, which also affects over 2.3 million individuals across the globe, reports. Multiple sclerosis, also known as MS, is a neurological disease that impairs communication between the brain and other parts of the body. Difficulty with coordination and balance, as well as blurred vision, are common symptoms of the disease. Dr. Daniel M. Harrison, a neurologist and interim division director of the Maryland Multiple Sclerosis Center, said an accurate diagnosis can be made in the majority of cases when a patient undergoes proper evaluation and testing. “The diagnosis of multiple sclerosis is made based on a combination of a patient’s clinical signs and symptoms, and the results of supportive testing,” he said. But sometimes, symptoms are not as obvious, added Dr. Philip De Jager, PhDa director of the Multiple Sclerosis Clinical Care and Research Center at the Columbia University Medical Center in New York. “There is no test that tells you whether you have MS. It remains a diagnosis of exclusion, meaning we have to rule out all other possibilities,” he said. Harrison noted that MS is an autoimmune condition that occurs when inflammation causes a loss of myelin (the insulation around nerve cells). This damages the nerve cells and their supporting structures in the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerves. Having a family history of MS or another autoimmune condition significantly increases your chance of having MS, Harrison said. Vitamin D deficiency, especially in childhood, also plays a clear role and likely works together with a genetic predisposition for MS. “More controversially, exposure to some viral infections, perhaps also in childhood, may also work together with a genetic predisposition to help trigger the development of MS,” he explained. Some people experience MS “attacks” but recover from them; others accumulate disabilities over time, noted De Jager. While vision changes, weakness, numbness, and imbalances are common symptoms, each patient’s symptoms can vary greatly. Signs of MS vary, and can also include movement control issues, alterations of reflexes, muscle tone changes, slow moving limbs, and poor limb coordination. Sensory pathways can also be affected, so a patient may experience a decreased sensitivity to touch, pain, temperature, vibration, or position. Lower acuity of vision, missing visual fields and altered pupil reflexes are also symptoms. “If the parts of the brain that control eye movements are affected, we will often find misalignments in the way that the left and right eyes move together,” he added. Sometimes, patients can experience cognitive symptoms, such as memory impairment, language dysfunction, or concentration difficulties. Kathy Costello, associate vice president of health care access for the National MS Society, explained that MS is a progressive disease. “The disease course and severity are different for each person who is diagnosed,” she said. For about 85 percent of patients, MS includes times when they will experience symptoms, followed by a period when symptoms may seem to disappear. “Over time, these individuals generally have fewer relapses, but the disease course changes to being predominantly progressive, with a worsening of symptoms and potentially an increase in disability over time,” she said. The other 15 percent of people who have MS experience a primary progressive form of the disease, which means their symptoms worsen and accumulate. These patients don’t have relapses or remissions. “When a patient experiences such an event, they will often have supportive findings on their physical examination, which should trigger the ordering of an MRI,” Harrison said. An MRI scan of the brain and spinal cord will show signs of both current and previous regions of inflammation and loss of myelin. If the patient’s symptoms and findings on MRI are sufficient to meet the diagnostic criteria for MS, the diagnosis can be made at this point, he said. In some cases, spinal fluid testing is needed to confirm the diagnosis. “Since MS can affect almost any part of the brain and spinal cord, the symptoms of MS can be very similar to many other neurologic conditions, so it is very difficult to know someone has MS solely based on their symptoms,” he explained. A thorough physical examination and use of the proper diagnostic procedures will help a physician determine if MS is a concern, or, if there is another neurologic or non-neurologic explanation for the symptoms. “If anyone is experiencing neurologic symptoms, they should seek medical attention for them and undergo a proper evaluation by their physician,” Harrison added. Harrison said there are many treatments available for MS, including more than 10 treatments for relapsing MS, which is just one variation of the disease. The treatments can drastically reduce a patient’s chance of having future episodes, new MRI activity, and disability accumulation. Last year, the FDA approved a treatment for primary progressive MS, which is a rarer form of the condition. The newer treatment helps to reduce the disability from further progressing. Treatments on the horizon include those that possibly may be able to restore health, repair myelin, and reverse symptoms. MS cannot be prevented, though some research is examining the potential of vitamin D use in those with a family history, as a way to prevent the disease from forming. “Despite the benefits of the treatments we currently have for MS, many patients can still experience lifelong symptoms, some of which can be disabling,” Harrison said. Actress Selma Blair’s MS diagnosis puts a spotlight on a confusing and sometimes misunderstood disease. Multiple sclerosis is a neurological disease that impairs communication between the brain and other parts of the body. Difficulty with coordination and balance, as well as blurred vision, are common symptoms of the disease. About 400,000 Americans have MS, which also affects about 2.1 million individuals across the globe, reports. It is more likely to affect women than men, and first symptoms often occur between the ages of 20 to 40.

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic disease that affects the central nervous system. It affects more than 25,000 people in Australia and is 3 times more common in women than in men. MS means there is damage to the protective sheath (known as myelin) that surrounds the nerve fibres in . This damage causes scars, or lesions, in the nervous system, meaning that the nerves can’t send signals round the body properly. A person's risk of developing MS is increased if they have a close relative with the condition. The cause of MS is not known, but theories include that it is an ; that it is caused by genetic or environmental factors (it is more common the further away from the equator you live); and that it is caused by a virus. There is currently no known cure for MS although there are treatment options. MS affects different people in different ways, and treatment often involves managing symptoms. What are the different types of multiple sclerosis? — This is the most common form of MS and about 3 in every 4 people with MS begin with a relapsing-remitting stage. With RRMS, new symptoms appear or existing symptoms worsen over a period of days, weeks or even months, followed by a partial or complete recovery, which is then followed by another relapse. For some people, these relapses get worse and the disability stays. Their health gradually declines. This is known as secondary progressive MS (see below). — 1 or 2 people in every 10 with MS are diagnosed with PPMS. These people usually find that their symptoms become gradually worse, with no separate attacks. — Most people with RRMS will eventually experience SPMS. In this form, disability generally worsens slowly, independent of any relapses. MS usually starts with mild symptoms that may or may not get worse over time. Symptoms depend on which part of the central nervous system is affected and how much damage has occurred. problems with controlling the body — like muscle spasms, weakness, loss of coordination and balance tiredness and sensitivity to heat (a hot day or a hot bath, or even a hot cup of tea, can make symptoms worse) other nervous symptom problems — including vertigo, pins and needles, dizziness, neuralgia and problems with eyesight continence problems — including bladder incontinence and constipation changes in memory, in concentration, in reasoning, in emotions, or in mood (such as depression) The symptoms of MS vary widely from person to person. They can also come and go in any one person. MS is unpredictable. A range of tests can be used to diagnose MS, including to detect lesions in the central nervous system, a physical examination to check reflexes and responses, blood tests, and other types of tests to measure nerve activity. Sometimes it can take years to reach a diagnosis because there is no single test for MS. A person will be diagnosed with MS if there is evidence of lesions in different parts of the central nervous system, at different times, with no other explanation than MS. Medicines can delay the progression of MS and reduce the risk of relapses. These are called ‘disease modifying therapies’. Other medicines are used to control symptoms. The best medicine for you depends on the type of MS you have. Talk to your doctor or other health professionals who care for you about the right combination of treatments for your particular situation. Disease modifying therapies work by targeting the immune system. They slow the frequency and severity of attacks so the myelin sheaths are damaged less. These medicines are also called immunotherapies. However, these treatments do not reverse current symptoms and there can be significant side effects. These medicines are usually used for people with relapsing-remitting MS. Steroids can reduce the severity of an MS attack by reducing inflammation and suppressing the immune system. Medicines to suppress the immune system (called immune suppressants) are sometimes used, especially for people with progressive MS. There are medicines available that can ease muscle spasms, pain, continence problems, tiredness, depression and other symptoms. Regular exercise, physiotherapy and occupational therapy can also help reduce symptoms and help you be as active as possible. A well-balanced diet low in fat and high in fibre can help. Regular exercise can strengthen muscles, improve heart health and improve mood. A lot of research, including stem cell research, is focused on prevention, treatment and a cure for MS. There is also help and support available for people with MS, and their carers.

4b887440-aa7f-4c16-bab2-2d3d5368a535,"/ Multiple sclerosis Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a chronic central nervous system (CNS) disease which affects the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerves. Even in the absence of symptoms, the disease is continuously active (causing brain damage) from early stages of MS. In recent times, MS prevalence rates in India have been revised from 1 case in every lakh to3 cases/100,000 people– compare this to US, where MS occurs in 1 per 1000 people. MS is anautoimmune disease because the MS patient’s immune system (body’s defence against infection) attacks a part of its own body – the nerve cell myelin sheath. The nervous system consists of billions of neurons (nerve cells) which relay messages within the brain and between the brain and other body parts. In a normal nervous system, nerves (bundles of nerve cells) pass messages amongst themselves at superfast speed. The axon (long arm of a nerve cell) is covered by the myelin sheath (multi-layered bands) with small gaps in between. The nerve impulses, that is, chemical signalsjump from gap-to-gap and rapidly spread the messages to surrounding nerve cells. MS is neurodegenerative because the damaged myelin sheath and oligodendrocytes (cells that produce myelin) delay communication between nerve cells resulting in inefficient functioning of various body systems. Demyelinating (without myelin sheath) nerve cells occurs in multiple areas of the brain and nervous system. Damaged portions of the axon undergo (develop hardened scars) A noteworthy feature of MS is the remissions (remyelination with improved symptoms) and relapses (further demyelination with worsened symptoms) cycle that occur over time. MS does not result from any particular lifestyle choice and is not contagious. A link between MS and autoimmune diseases and smoking has been reported. Several other viral and bacterial infections e.g., Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection and childhood mumps, are considered as MS triggers. Sincevitamin D is important for proper immune function, low levels of this vitamin are considered as a potential cause of MS. Environmentally, strong associations exist between MS and geography (temperate and cold zones) and demographics(age, gender, and ethnicity). Genetics play a role in MS, though not hereditary, as there is increased risk of MS incidence among siblings. Scientists are investigating which genes are common within families affected by MS or in populations with high MS incidence rates. MS symptoms are variable, unpredictable, and appear in different patterns. Most common patterns are relapsing/remitting (symptoms come and go) and chronic progressive(symptoms continuously worsens). Depending on which part of the nervous system develops demyelination, the condition affects corresponding body systems.The first MS symptom, in nearly 50% patients, appears as double or blurred vision caused by optic neuritis (demyelination of nerves connected to the eyes). Loss of coordination (30% patients) and speech difficulties also occur frequently. Other common symptoms include - MRI(magnetic resonance imaging) scans of over 90% of MS patients show the presence oflesions (demyelinated and scarred areas). MRI scans along with the patient’s medical history plus neurological exam confirms MS diagnosis.Spinal taps(check spinal fluid for abnormalities) andEEG (measures brain electrical activity) help rule out other autoimmune conditions or infections (HIV or Lyme disease). High disease variability is a challenge for patients and neurologists It is difficult to predict the development course of MS which may be asymptomatic, mild or severe.In severe cases the patients lose their ability to write, speak or walk which drastically affects their daily lives. In a recent publication,(a Chennai-based Clinical Neurologist) commented that access plus cost of diagnostic tests and treatment arefor MS patients. For example, a MS patient in Chennai pays Rs. 70,000 monthly for drugs that require alternate day injections. In addition, there is minimal to zero insurance or disability compensation for patients who are unable to work as a result of their weakened physical, mental and emotional abilities. MS treatment options include disease-modifying drugsmethylprednisolone, interferons (Avonex, Betaseron), Copaxone and Rebif that provide symptom relief and slowdown the disease progressionto prevent relapses. Counselling, physical and occupational therapy help to cope with movement and behavioural symptoms. MS is not fatal but complications arising from a weak immune system, such as pneumonia, lower life expectancy by ten years in MS patients.  (US-based MS expert) during a Feb 2012 presentation, at The TS Srinivasan Institute, observed that MS prevalence in India is probably underestimated because of a lack of awareness amongst patients and neurologists. Dr. Rudick, also declared that MS treatment had progressed beyond the ABCR drugs (Avonex, Betaseron and Copaxone and Rebif) to personalised medicine such that several drug combinations could be used to possibly completely block multiple sclerosis disease (MS) activity. MS Society of India (MSSI) supports MS patients and caregivers MSSI (), found in 9 cities, offers useful advice, reading material, research updates, and community support. MSSI also organizes and conducts health camps, workshops, social events and fundraisers across the country throughout the year.  To end with, here’s a heart-warming picture of a 36 year old MS patient, Jigna Chanpura, who recently completed a 21km Half Marathon at a MSSI event.

01ab3c75-54e1-4a3e-83e8-c62a76437734,"Medically reviewed by — — (MS) is a chronic, progressive autoimmune condition that affects the central nervous system. MS occurs when the immune system attacks the myelin that protects the nerve fibers in the spinal cord and brain. This is known as demyelination, and it causes communication difficulty between the nerves and the brain. Eventually it can result in damage to the nerves. The cause of multiple sclerosis is currently unknown. It’s thought that genetic and environmental factors can play a role. There’s currently no cure for MS, though there are treatments that can reduce symptoms. Multiple sclerosis can be difficult to diagnosis; there is no single test that can diagnose it. Instead, a diagnosis typically requires multiple tests to rule out other conditions with similar symptoms. After your doctor conducts a physical examination, they’ll likely order several different tests if they suspect you may have MS. Blood tests will likely be part of the initial workup if your doctor suspects you might have MS. Blood tests can’t currently result in a firm diagnosis of MS, but they can rule out other conditions. These conditions include: All of these disorders can be diagnosed with bloodwork alone. Blood tests can also reveal abnormal results. This can lead toward diagnoses such as cancer or a vitamin B-12 deficiency. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the test of choice for diagnosing MS in combination with initial blood tests. MRIs use radio waves and magnetic fields to evaluate the relative water content in tissues of the body. They can detect normal and abnormal tissues and can spot irregularities. s offer detailed and sensitive images of the brain and spinal cord. They’re much less invasive than or , which both use radiation. Doctors will be looking for two things when they order an MRI with a suspected diagnosis of MS. The first is that they’ll check for any other abnormalities that could rule out MS and point to a different diagnosis, such as a brain tumor. They’ll also look for evidence of demyelination. The layer of myelin that protects the nerve fibers is fatty and repels water when it’s undamaged. If the myelin has been damaged, however, this fat content is reduced or stripped away entirely and no longer repels water. The area will hold more water as a result, which can be detected by MRIs. To diagnose MS, doctors must find evidence of demyelination. In addition to ruling out other potential conditions, an MRI can provide solid evidence that demyelination has occurred. Before you go in for your MRI, remove all jewelry. If you have any metal on your clothes (including zippers or bra hooks), you’ll be asked to change into a hospital gown. You’ll lie still inside the MRI machine (which is open on both ends) for the duration of the procedure, which takes between 45 minutes and 1 hour. Let your doctor and technician know ahead of time if you have: any other conditions that you think could be relevant , also called a spinal tap, is sometimes used in the process of diagnosing MS. This procedure will remove a sample of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) for testing. Lumbar punctures are considered invasive. During the procedure, a needle is inserted into the lower back, between vertebrae, and into the spinal canal. This hollow needle will collect the sample of CSF for testing. A spinal tap typically takes about 30 minutes, and you will be given a local anesthetic. The patient is typically asked to lay on their side with their spine curved. After the area has been cleaned and a local anesthetic has been administered, a doctor will inject the hollow needle into the spinal canal to withdraw one to two tablespoons of CSF. Usually, there is no special preparation. You may be asked to stop taking blood thinners. Doctors who order lumbar punctures during the process of an MS diagnosis will use the test to rule out conditions with similar symptoms. They’ll also look for signs of MS, specifically: elevated levels of antibodies called IgG antibodies The number of white blood cells in the spinal fluid of people with MS can be up to than normal. However, these abnormal immune responses can also be caused by other conditions. It’s also estimated that of people with MS do not show any abnormalities in their CSF. Evoked potential (EP) tests measure the electrical activity in the brain that occurs in response to stimulation, such as sound, touch, or sight. Each type of stimuli evokes minute electrical signals, which can be measured by the electrodes placed on the scalp to monitor activity in certain areas of the brain. There are three types of EP tests. The visual evoked response (VER or VEP) is the one most commonly used to diagnose MS. When doctors order an EP test, they’re going to look for impaired transmission that is present along the optic nerve pathways. This typically happens fairly early in most MS patients. However, before concluding that abnormal VERs are due to MS, other ocular or retinal disorders must be excluded. No preparation is necessary to take an EP test. During the test, you’ll sit in front of a screen that has an alternating checkerboard pattern on it. You may be asked to cover one eye at a time. It does require active concentration, but it’s safe and noninvasive. If you wear glasses, ask your doctor ahead of time if you should bring them. Medical knowledge is always advancing. As technology and our knowledge of MS moves forward, doctors may find new tests to make the MS diagnosis process an easier one. A blood test is currently being developed that will be able to detect biomarkers that are associated with MS. While this test likely won’t be able to diagnose MS on its own, it can help doctors evaluate risk factors and make diagnosis just a little easier. Diagnosing MS currently can be challenging and time consuming. However, symptoms supported by MRIs or other test findings combined with the elimination of other possible causes can help make the diagnosis clearer. If you’re experiencing symptoms that resemble MS, make an appointment with your doctor. The sooner you get diagnosed, the sooner you can get treatment, which can help to alleviate troublesome symptoms. It might also be helpful to talk to others who are going through the same thing.

Due to this basic difference in the disease course, different criteria are used to make an accurate diagnosis of PPMS. The criteria for a diagnosis of PPMS are: One year of disease progression (worsening of neurological function without remission), A type of lesion in the brain that is recognized by experts in as being typical of MS Two or more lesions of a similar type in the spinal cord Evidence in the spinal fluid of oligoclonal band or an elevated IgG index, both of which are indicative of immune system activity in the central nervous system Meeting these criteria can sometimes take a fairly long time, particularly if the person has only recently begun to experience neurologic symptoms. Several studies have suggested that the PPMS may take two to three years longer to diagnose than relapsing-remitting MS.

a41dff9d-43ea-4326-9e5b-cef47a4bc524,"— Neuromyelitis optica (NMO) is a condition that causes inflammation and damage to nerves in the eyes, spinal cord, and sometimes brain. If you or a loved one have been diagnosed with this condition, you might be wondering: Can NMO be cured? Is NMO fatal? Does NMO get worse over time? Read on to understand the answers to these pressing questions. There’s currently no known cure for NMO. But NMO treatments may reduce the number of relapses you experience. If you’ve tested positive for a type of antibody known as anti-AQP4, your doctor may prescribe eculizumab (Soliris) or inebilizumab (Uplizna). These targeted immune-suppressing therapies may help limit relapses in people with NMO who produce anti-AQP4 antibodies. Several other medications may also help reduce relapses in people with NMO, including those who don’t have anti-AQP4 antibodies. These include: Your doctor may also prescribe additional medications, physical therapy, or other treatments to help manage symptoms and complications of NMO. NMO affects different people in different ways. It’s possible to live for many years with NMO, especially if you receive treatment early on with immune-modulating medications. Some people develop life threatening complications from NMO. One small study found that about people with NMO develop breathing difficulties. Those breathing problems may require treatment with a ventilator. Fatal respiratory failure sometimes occurs. Starting treatment soon after diagnosis is important to reduce the risk of death. The authors of a 2019 review article report that about of people with NMO who don’t get any treatment die within 5 years of their first episode of symptoms. Getting early treatment may help you live longer and healthier with NMO. It’s rare for NMO to have a secondary progressive stage like you’d see in multiple sclerosis (MS). Disabilities tend to occur due to multiple acute relapses or episodes. During an attack, symptoms get worse over the course of several days. After each relapse, NMO symptoms may partially improve. But over time, multiple relapses tend to cause lasting nerve damage that may result in irreversible vision loss, muscle weakness, paralysis, and other impairments. Treatment with targeted therapies or other immune-modulating medications may help prevent relapses and limit impairments. NMO rarely has a secondary progressive stage. It can cause multiple relapses. You may experience partial improvements after each relapse but develop lasting impairments over time. There is no cure for NMO, but starting treatment quickly helps increase the likelihood that you’ll live longer and with better overall health. Early treatment with targeted therapies or other immune-modulating medications may help prevent relapses, limit the development of impairments, and prevent early death from NMO. Your doctor can help you learn more about your treatment options. — What’s the Difference Between Neuromyelitis Optica and MS? What’s the Connection Between MS and Optic Neuritis? Who Treats NMO?

22384df7-c9b5-493e-bf9d-95efc12f7456,"Are you sure your patient has Multiple Sclerosis? What are the typical findings for this disease? A first attack of neurological symptoms in children with central nervous system (CNS) demyelination may represent a monophasic illness or be the first presentation of a chronic relapsing disorder such as multiple sclerosis (MS), a condition that is increasingly being recognized and diagnosed in childhood. Cranial, and possible spinal imaging, and lumbar puncture are key diagnostic tests. Acute management of demyelination usually involves initiation of corticosteroid therapy with IVIG, with plasma exchange required in severe cases. Once the diagnosis of MS is confirmed, immunomodulatory treatment should be initiated with the goal of reducing relapse rates and disability accrual. Safety and tolerability data support the use of these MS immunomodulatory therapies in pediatric MS. Neurological symptoms attributable to demyelination commonly include the following: Unilateral or bilateral visual loss (optic neuritis) Motor, sensory or urological deficits localizing to the spinal cord (transverse myelitis) Brainstem deficits (typically internuclear ophthalmoplegia or INO) Other monofocal or polyfocal neurological deficits Polyfocal neurological deficits with encephalopathy (acute disseminated encephalomyelitis or ADEM) Optic neuritis should be considered in any child presenting with subacute monocular or binocular visual loss (see Figure 1). Ophthalmological features of optic neuritis typically include: Optic disc edema is sometimes seen, but may be absent in retrobulbar optic neuritis. Neurological abnormalities outside of the optic nerve may also be present. Neuroimaging, usually brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with contrast, reveals optic nerve thickening and/or enhancement in approximately 55% of children (see Figure 2) and visual evoked potentials are abnormal in up to 88% of children. Optical coherence tomography (OCT), a non-invasive technique for measuring retinal nerve fiber thickness, may aid in diagnosis. Transverse myelitis should be considered in any child presenting with subacute onset of weakness and sensory deficits localizing to the spinal cord (see Figure 3). Typical symptoms of transverse myelitis include: Bilateral (may be asymmetric) lower extremity weakness Sensory paresthesias or hyperesthesias with a spinal sensory level L’Hermitte’s symptom (pain with forward neck flexion) indicating cervical spinal involvement Bowel or bladder dysfunction (lesions above the sacral cord cause urinary retention and constipation) While many children will experience partial TM, others may have complete cross-sectional cord involvement with clinical features of flaccid paresis with hyporeflexia and later hyperreflexia. Longitudinally-extensive transverse myelitis (spanning > 3 spinal segments) or transverse myelitis with concurrent or rapidly sequential optic neuritis should prompt consideration of neuromyelitis optica (see Figure 2). Of note, approximately 10% of children with MS have longitudinally-extensive spinal cord lesions. Somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEPs) may be useful to confirm a spinal cord localization. Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) is defined by the presence of polyfocal neurological symptoms and signs with encephalopathy (either behavioral change or alteration in consciousness). Symptoms of ADEM are often preceded by a febrile illness or viral prodrome. ADEM may be the clinical manifestation of age-dependent demyelination as the majority of individuals with ADEM are under the age of 10 years. While ADEM is most commonly a monophasic illness, relapsing and multiphasic forms have been described. International consensus definitions for monophasic and relapsing forms of ADEM describe the clinical features and time course in detail. Typical brain MRI findings of ADEM are shown in Figure 4. Other presentations of acute demyelination include: Polyfocal neurological deficits without encephalopathy The cornerstone of MS diagnosis is demonstration of demyelination that is disseminated in both space and time. Specific consensus definitions have been proposed for childhood-onset MS requiring either (i) two discrete demyelinating attacks separated by at least 30 days and involving two separate areas of the CNS; (ii) one attack consistent with demyelination and MRI evidence of new lesions meeting criteria for dissemination in time (see below); or (iii) two non-ADEM attacks in a child with an initial ADEM presentation. As in adult-onset MS, MRI may be used as a surrogate marker for dissemination in space and time, facilitating earlier disease diagnosis. Specifically, new criteria proposed by Polman et al (2010) require that dissemination in space on MRI be defined as involvement of greater than or equal to one T2 lesion in at least two of the following four areas: i. periventricular ii. juxtacortical iii. infratentorial and iv. spinal cord with symptomatic brainstem or spinal cord symptoms not contributing towards the total lesion count. Dissemination in time may be fulfilled by demonstration of either: i. new T2 and/or gadolinium-enhancing spinal cord lesion(s) on follow-up MRI (irrespective of timing of baseline MRI) or ii. simultaneous presence of gadolinium-enhancing and non-enhancing lesions. More than 95% of children with multiple sclerosis initially experience a relapsing-remitting disease course with reported relapse rates between 0.38 and 1.2 per year. Primary progressive disease (neurological deterioration in the absence of discrete relapses) is rare in the pediatric age group. Children with MS appear to experience more frequent relapses as compared to adult-onset MS patients in the first several years following diagnosis. The time from a first attack to a second neurological event is highly variable and may be greater in younger children. Childhood-onset MS patients may enter a secondary progressive phase, defined by disability progression in the absence of clear relapses, between 15 to 20 years following first attack. What other disease/condition shares some of these symptoms? Acutely, it is important to exclude central nervous system infection especially if neurological symptoms are accompanied by fever, encephalopathy, meningismus or other systemic signs. The combination of brain and/or spinal cord white matter abnormalities with multiple cranial neuropathies should raise suspicion of central nervous system Lyme disease (neuroborreliosis), especially if there has been recent travel to an endemic area or if a tick bite is recalled. While rare, malignancy, such as central nervous system lymphoma, should also be considered, particularly if MRI features are atypical for demyelination, or if spinal fluid examination reveals atypical cells. A history of persistent or increasingly frequent headache, seizures, or lumbar puncture evidence of an elevated opening pressure should prompt consideration of isolated CNS vasculitis or CNS vasculitis associated with systemic disease (such as systemic lupus erythematosus). Children with CNS vaculitis usually respond to steroid therapy and experience an exacerbation of symptoms as steroids are tapered. Distinguishing vasculitis from MS has important therapeutic implications as vasculitis management requires long-term immunosuppression with medications such as cyclophosphamide. Neurological symptoms associated with renal or liver impairment, fever, lymphadenopathy and disseminated intravascular coagulation should prompt consideration of macrophage activation syndrome. High serum ferritin and fasting triglycerides, unexpectedly low ESR, and the presence of hemophaocytic cells in a bone marrow aspirate or CSF are diagnostic. Repeated attacks of optic neuritis and transverse myelitis should raise suspicion of the diagnosis of neuromyelitis optica (NMO). The diagnosis of NMO is aided by testing for antibodies directed against Aquaporin 4. NMO is important to consider as the disease often has an aggressive course with rapid disability progression, requiring potent immunosuppressive agents to maintain disease control. See Figure 6. MS is thought to be a disease influenced by both genetic predisposing factors and environmental triggers of aberrant CNS directed autoimmunity. It is increasingly believed that MS predisposition is established during childhood, as evidenced by studies of immigrants to areas of high MS prevalence who acquire the MS risk of their new community only if they immigrated prior to age 15 years. What laboratory studies should you request to help confirm the diagnosis? How should you interpret the results? There is no laboratory test that can confirm MS diagnosis. The majority of laboratory evaluations are performed to exclude other conditions – a requirement prior to considering MS as the etiology of a patient’s clinical symptoms. However, several investigations are helpful in supporting an MS diagnosis. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examination is important in confirming the presence of CNS demyelination and for excluding other diagnoses. At first presentation, more that 50% of children with MS will have an elevated CSF leukocyte count, typically below 30 cells/microliter with a lymphocytic predominance. A higher leukocyte count or neutrophilic predominance should prompt consideration of CNS vasculitis, CNS infection, or NMO. CNS vasculitis is also often associated with an elevated opening pressure. CSF oligoclonal bands (OCBs) in CSF, but not detected in serum, may be found in up to 90% of childhood-onset MS patients at first presentation as compared to approximately 10% of children with ADEM or NMO. Isoelectric focusing methods have the highest diagnostic yield. It should be noted that MS patients may initially have undetectable CSF OCBs, but may develop them later in the disease course. Testing of visual, brainstem auditory, and visual evoked potentials is often useful for confirming the clinical demyelinating syndrome and for documenting subclinical disease. Almost 50% of children with MS in one study demonstrated subclinical abnormalities in at least one of these evoked potential pathways, most commonly visual. Visual evoked potentials are abnormal in over 85% of children with clinical optic neuritis. Would imaging studies be helpful? If so, which ones? Neuroimaging, especially brain and/or spinal MRI with contrast, is valuable in confirming the presence of inflammatory CNS lesions and in excluding other possible diagnoses. Lesion characteristics of younger children may differ from older children, with younger MS patients being more likely to have ill-defined brain MRI lesions and grey matter involvement. Large lesions with indistinct borders are typical for ADEM. One recent study suggested that the presence of two of the following MRI features may aid in distinguishing children with MS from those with ADEM with 81% sensitivity and 95% specificity: i. presence of T1 black holes ii. absence of diffuse bilateral pattern iii. presence of two or more periventricular lesions. MRI has now been incorporated into the diagnostic criteria for MS in children and adults and allows a diagnosis of MS even at first presentation if there is the simultaneous presence of gadolinium-enhancing and non-enhancing lesions suggesting disease dissemination in time. Classification of Childhood Demyelinating Syndromes An algorithmic approach to the classification of childhood demyelination has been published (Banwell, Lancet Neurol 2007) and Yeh (Nature Reviews Neurol 2009 ). If you are able to confirm that the patient has Multiple Sclerosis, what treatment should be initiated? The care of children with MS revolves around management of acute relapses and longer-term immunomodulation with the goal of reducing relapse rates and disability accrual. The acute management of a first attack of demyelination or MS relapse usually relies on initiation of corticosteroid therapy. Doses in the range of 20-30 mg/kg IV per day (maximum 1 g per dose) for 3 to 5 days are typically used. Mild relapses that are not distressing to the patient and do not impair functioning may require supportive management, but not pharmacological therapy. Serum glucose, urine glucose, and blood pressure should be monitored during corticosteroid treatment. If children improve, with this initial course but have an incomplete resolution of symptoms, an oral prednisone taper starting at 1 mg/kg/day for 2-3 weeks could be considered. If children do not significantly improve or clinically worsen during the course of steroid therapy, evidence from published case series suggest that IVIG may be of benefit with a typical dose of 2 g/kg administered over 2 to 5 days. If symptoms of demyelination are severe and potentially life-threatening (for example, severe encephalopathy or respiratory depression), there is class I evidence in adult MS patients for the use of plasma exchange (PLEX), which is typically administered as 5 to 8 exchanges over 10 days. Class I evidence in adult-onset MS exists for the following therapies: interferon beta 1a, interferon beta 1b, and glatiramer acetate. Route of administration, doses, potential adverse effects, and associated laboratory abnormalities are summarized in Figure 5. While there have been no formal randomized-controlled trials of interferons or glatiramer acetate in children with MS, available case-series level evidence suggest that these treatments are safe and well-tolerated in childhood. Children who are receiving interferon treatments should have serum white blood cell counts and liver enzymes monitored monthly for the first 6 months and every 3 months thereafter. Thyroid function should be monitored yearly. Sexually active patients should be counselled regarding contraceptive use due to potential teratogenicity of some of these agents. Second-line therapies are offered to families if frequent relapses occur despite treatment with one of the first-line agents, or if treatment with these agents causes intolerable side effects. Cyclophosphamide, mitoxantrone, azahtioprine all have case-series level evidence to support their use in childhood MS. Case series have also recently been published reporting natalizumab use in pediatric MS patients. Fingolimod (FTY 720) has recently been licensed for use in adult-onset MS patients and increased efficacy and convenience of oral administration may make this an attractive therapeutic option for pediatric MS patients. The safety of this medication in children for whom the immune system is still maturing has not yet been definitively established and fingolimod does not have regulatory approval for use in children. Emerging therapies including cladribine, rituximab, alemtuzumab, dacluzumab, laquinimod and ocrelizumab also have the potential for improved efficacy and tolerabiltiy as compared to interferons or glatiramer acetate but the risks of life-threatening infection and malignancy must be carefully considered, especially for pediatric MS patients. What are the adverse effects associated with each treatment option? Corticosteroid therapy may be associated with the development of hypertension and hyperglycemia. Many children experience gastrointestinal irritation that can be reduced with use of H2 blocking agents. Agitation, mood disturbances, sleep disruption and personality changes are common in patients on high doses of corticosteroids, but typically resolve as doses are reduced. Longer-term use may be associated with osteopenia, weight gain, and adrenal suppression. Given that long-term (ie: more than 3 weeks) of corticosteroid therapy is not recommended and repeated monthly intravenous corticosteroids failed as a model for MS disease modulation, corticosteroids are reserved for acute relapse therapy. IVIG infusion may be associated with headache, nausea, flushing, back pain, and hyptotension. If any of these occurs during an infusion, the infusion rate may be slowed or the medication discontinued. Premedication with antihistamines or corticosteroids may be useful in preventing these symptoms. Rarely, IVIG may be associated with acute renal failure, cardiac failure, or thrombosis. Severe anaphylactic reactions have been described in patients with IgA deficiency. Aseptic meningitis is a well-described complication of IVIG administration. As in treatment with other blood products, transmission of infectious agents is possible. Treatment with PLEX may be associated with hypotension, pulmonary edema, metabolic alkalosis and electrolyte abnormalities (ex: hypocalcemia or hypokalemia) and therefore requires administration by a trained team of individuals and close monitoring. Anaphalaxis is rare but can occur as can significant hemorrhage (from heparin-induced thrombocytopenia) and infection. Side effects of commonly used first-line immunomodulatory therapies are summarized in Figure 5. What are the possible outcomes of Multiple Sclerosis? Almost 95% of children with MS experience a relapsing remitting course with attacks consisting of subacute onset of neurological symptoms separated by periods of relative disease quiescence. While recovery after an acute relapse is expected, residual deficits often perist. Persistent neurological deficits may significantly affect daily functioning. After a period of between 15 to 20 years, childhood-onset MS patients may enter a secondary progressive phase where there is disability accrual in the absence of discrete relapses. The goal of immunomodulatory treatment is to reduce relapse rate and long-term disabilty. The available first-line therapeutic agents have a similar efficacy in reducing relapse rates by approximately 18-30%. Medications differ in terms of route of administration, frequency of administration, and side effect profiles and therefore treatment choice must be individualized. Fatigue significant enough to limit daily activities and to affect school performance is experienced by up to 40% of children with MS. Non-pharmacological measures such as scheduling key activities for early in the day, and brief daytime napping may be sufficient for some MS patients, but pharmacological therapy is often required. Modafinil prescribed at a starting dose of 50 mg once daily and increased as needed up to 100 mg twice daily is often an effective pharmacological therapy. Childhood MS occurs during key academic years and ongoing CNS inflammation may interfere with learning and memory. Between 50- 70% of children with MS demonstrate evidence of cognitive impairment with formal testing. Cognitive impairment has been associated with younger age at first attack and longer disease duration. Impaired learning and scholastic difficulties have longer-term implications for global functioning and vocational choices. Children with MS may experience bowel and/or bladder dysfunction as well as sexual dysfunction. Mood disorders, most commonly depression, are often identified in pediatric MS patients. Health care practioners should be comfortable discussing these issues with adolescent patients. Childhood MS is being increasingly recognized and diagnosed. While the true incidence of pediatric MS remains to be precisely defined, it is estimated that 3-10% of all MS patients experience their first symptoms prior to the age of 18 years. Multiple sclerosis in both children and adults has been reported in many countries worldwide, but there is marked regional variation in MS prevalence. There is a well-described latitude gradient in MS, with greatest MS prevalence reported in countries further away (in either direction) from the equator. Early life place of residence appears to correlate with MS risk. A study of adult-onset MS patients demonstrated that immigration from areas of low reported MS prevalence (India and Pakistan) prior to the age of 15 years was associated with higher risk of being later diagnosed with MS as compared to immigration after age 15. A single center Canadian study of adult and childhood-onset MS patients showed that the two groups shared the common experience of having spent most of the childhood years in Canada, irrespective of self-reported familial ancestry. One of the factors that may explain regional variations in MS risk and especially the latitude gradient is sunlight exposure and consequent serum vitamin D status. Studies in adults have shown that MS risk is inversely related to daily oral vitamin D intake and serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] levels. A study of twins discordant for MS diagnosis showed that co-twins who reported higher sunlight exposure were less likely to subsequently develop MS. Risk of adult-onset MS is higher for individuals born in the spring as compared to the fall, suggesting that maternal vitamin D status during pregnancy may be an important determinant of MS risk. Both retrospective and prospective studies in children have shown that low serum 25(OH)D levels at first presentation are correlated with increased risk of MS diagnosis. Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) infection has been implicated as a contributing factor to MS development in both children and adults. Three case-control studies in children have shown that children with MS more commonly demonstrate remote EBV seropositivity as compared to matched controls. One prospective Canadian study has shown EBV seropositivity at first attack of CNS demyelination to be more common in children later diagnosed with MS as compared to those individuals remaining monophasic. In seropositive individuals, antibody titres are also higher in children with MS as compared to controls. MS is more common in first-degree relatives of MS patients, as compared to the general population, and MS has a higher prevalence in monozygotic as opposed to dizygotic twins, suggesting that there may a genetic contribution to MS risk. The HLA DRB1 allele has been associated with increased risk of adult-onset MS in numerous studies. A recent prospective study in Canadian children with a first attack of central nervous system demyelination demonstrated that the HLA DRB1*15 allele was more common in those children later diagnosed with MS as opposed to children who remained monophasic. Several genome-wide studies have implicated other immune-related genes in MS, but all are felt to have a very low contribution to individual MS risk. What complications might you expect from the disease or treatment of the disease? Fatigue, cognitive impairment, and persistent neurological disability are all possible complications of MS in children (see above). Treatment-related side effects are discussed in the section describing therapies. Are additional laboratory studies available; even some that are not widely available? Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is a new non-invasive technique that enables measurement of retinal nerve fibre thickness. As significant numbers of axons are found in the retina, OCT is emerging as a potentially valuable tool in measuring the degree of axonal degeneration in MS. Applications of OCT in MS include estimation of visual prognosis after optic neuritis, demonstration of degree of axonal degeneration in MS patients without optic neuritis, and use as a surrogate outcome marker in MS treatment trials. To date, there is no known intervention that will prevent MS development. There is increasing evidence that vitamin D deficiency at first presentation of neurological symptoms increases risk of subsequent attacks and is associated with relapse rate in individuals with established MS. Future studies exploring the role of vitamin D supplementation are of considerable interest.

Resources:MS Society of Canada: National MS Society: . Ongoing controversies regarding etiology, diagnosis, treatment There is still considerable debate about definitions for many childhood demyelinating syndromes, especially recurrent and multiphasic forms of ADEM. It remains unclear whether these forms of ADEM represent discrete diagnostic entities with a favourable prognosis, or if these forms of ADEM represent an age-related early manifestation of MS. Treatment algorithms for childhood MS are largely derived from randomized controlled trials conducted in adults. There is a paucity of clinical trials that include pediatric participants. Inclusion of children with MS in large scale therapy trials will be increasingly important in the near future with the introduction of new potent immunosuppressive/immunomodulatory treatments for whom the effects on the developing immune system have yet to be defined.

Approximately 250,000 to 350,000 people have been diagnosed with M.S. in the United States (Schoenstadt, 2006). Every week, 200 new people are diagnosed with M.S. in our country (National MS Society, n.d.). M.S. can affect each person differently. Damage to the myelin in the Central Nervous System and nerve fibers disturb the signals sent between the brain and spinal cord to other parts of the body causing the primary symptoms of Multiple Sclerosis (National MS Society, n.d.)Symptoms can come and go without any warning. An idea on how to help people suffering from M.S. is to have a dietitian either come to an M.S. housing building or support group, and introduce a healthy, nutritious diet that will help decrease the symptoms of Multiple Sclerosis. There are many diets out there that can help reduce symptoms and weight. Using a dietitian to introduce a healthy diet to those with M.S. can be very beneficial because it can decrease their pain and exacerbations, and improve the quality of their lives. There are four different types of M.S. that people can have. They are relapsing- remitting (RRMS), secondary progressive (SPMS), primary progressive (PPMS) and progressive-relapsing Multiple Sclerosis (PRMS) (National MS Society, n.d.). RRMS is when patients have relapses followed by periods of recovery (Mayo Clinic, 2012). SPMS occurs when there are relapses and partial recoveries, but the disability progressively gets worse until a steady progression of disability replaces cycles of exacerbations (Mayo Clinic, 2012). PPMS is when the disease progresses slowly and steadily from start with no periods of remissions (Mayo Clinic, 2012). Finally, PRMS is a rare type of M.S. where people experience both steadily worsening symptoms and attacks during times of remission (Mayo Clinic, 2012). To people who have Multiple Sclerosis, being diagnosed with any one of these types can be depressing. People with Multiple Sclerosis often suffer with extreme pain. My Mom has been living with M.S. for over 15 years now and she struggles with severe back pain every day. She is currently seeing a pain management doctor to help relieve some of her pain. M.S. patients can have pain in two different areas, which are neuropathic and musculoskeletal. Neuropathic pain is caused by the disruption in how the nerves carry messages within the brain and spinal cord (Multiple Sclerosis Trust, 2012).Musculoskeletal pain is from damage to muscles, tendons, ligaments, and soft tissue (Multiple Sclerosis Trust, 2012).Even with the use of pain medication, the pain associated with M.S. can be very hard to deal with. There are certain foods that can reduce inflammation and pain in people who have M.S. Anything that can lessen or stop the use of pain medication would be valuable to patients. Multiple Sclerosis affects a person’s brain and spinal cord causing a variety of troubling symptoms. The most common symptoms of M.S. are pain, fatigue, numbness, poor motor skills and vision problems. There are also many other symptoms that can trouble those who suffer from M.S. Other common symptoms are trouble walking, bladder, bowel dysfunction, dizziness, depression, and spasticity. Through diet and exercise, people with M.S. can improve some of those problems and lead a healthier, more productive life. A dietitian can help them focus on the foods and exercises that will eliminate or reduce the symptoms that bother them the most. M.S. patients struggle their whole lives dealing with exacerbations. They never know when one will come and how long it will last for. During an exacerbation, a lot of different problems can occur. An exacerbation is a relapse or flare up of Multiple Sclerosis symptoms. It can bring on new symptoms or... References: Gandy, J. Journal of Human Nutrition and Dietetics. (Feb 2007). 20 (1), 1.

This disease starts as an auto-immune disease in which CD4 T cells cross the blood brain barrier and attack myelin sheaths of olygodendrocytes resulting in demyelination (Gandhi et al., 2010; Lund et al., 2013). Initially this is a transient process and re-myelination occurs, so initial stage of the disease is characterized by neurological dysfunctions that eventually recover. However this re-myelination is not permanent (Compston and Coles, 2008; Wakerley et al., 2012). The continuous immune attacks cause serious pathological changes of myelin sheaths hence disease progression and development of serious disabilities . (Makris et al., 2013; Wakerley et al., 2012; Hafler, 2004; Nylander and Hafler, 2012; Eshaghi et al., 2013). Peak age of the initial diagnosis of MS is 30 and the disease progress overtime causing a in decline in health and even mortality (Makris et al., 2013). Though it is subjective the average decrease in life expectancy of a patient with MS is 5 to 10 years after the disease is being diagnosed (Keegan and Noseworthy, 2002). Disabilities caused by the disease vary between patients and depend on the abnormalities of the neuronal track that is affected (Leray et al., 2010). Some disabilities include numbness, muscle...

MS affects approximately 400,000 people in the United States alone. The onset of MS is usually between 20 and 40 years of age and is more common in women; men may have a more severe progressive course (Luzzio, 2013). Life expectancy is shortened in persons with MS, and the survival rate is linked to disability. Death usually results from secondary complications but can also be due to primary complications unrelated to MS. The occurrence rate of MS is affected by gene-environment interactions in susceptible individuals (Huether & McCance, 2012). Definition of Disorder is a progressive, inflammatory, demyelinating disorder of the central nervous system (CNS), which can affect the peripheral nervous system (PNS) as well.

7a31b320-0fb9-4fa1-a497-2a9254ab33fc,"— — (MS) is a condition where the body’s immune system attacks healthy tissue in the central nervous system (CNS). Areas affected include the: Several types of multiple sclerosis exist, but doctors don’t currently have a definitive test to determine if someone has the condition. Because there isn’t a single diagnostic test for MS, your doctor may run several tests to rule out other possible conditions. If the tests are negative, they may suggest other tests to find out if your symptoms are due to MS. However, innovations in imaging and continued research on MS in general have meant improvements in diagnosing and treating MS. The CNS acts as the communication center in your body. It sends signals to your muscles to make them move, and the body transmits signals back for the CNS to interpret. These signals could include messages about what you’re seeing or feeling, such as touching a hot surface. On the outside of the nerve fibers that carry signals is a protective casing called myelin (MY-uh-lin). Myelin makes it easier for nerve fibers to transmit messages. It’s similar to how a fiber-optic cable can conduct messages faster than traditional cable. When you have MS, your body attacks myelin and the cells that make myelin. In some cases, your body even attacks the nerve cells. vary from person to person. Sometimes, symptoms will come and go. Doctors associate some symptoms as being more common in people living with MS. These include: difficulty thinking, such as affected memory and problems focusing vision problems, including blurred vision and pain with eye movement If you have any of these symptoms, talk to your doctor. MS isn’t the only condition that results from damaged myelin. There are other medical conditions your doctor may consider when diagnosing MS that could include: , like collagen vascular disease Your doctor will start by requesting your medical history and reviewing your symptoms. They will also perform tests that can help them assess your neurological function. Your neurological evaluation will include: Your doctor may also order blood tests. This is to rule out other medical conditions and vitamin deficiencies that could be causing your symptoms. Evoked potential (EP) tests are those that measure the brain’s electrical activity. If the test shows signs of slowed brain activity, this could indicate MS. Testing EP involves placing wires on the scalp over specific areas of your brain. You’ll then be exposed to light, sounds, or other sensations while an examiner measures your brain waves. This test is painless. While there are several different EP measurements, the most accepted version is the visual EP. This involves asking you to view a screen that displays an alternating checkerboard pattern, while the doctor measures your brain’s response. (MRI) can show abnormal lesions in the brain or spinal cord that are characteristic of an MS diagnosis. In MRI scans, these lesions will appear bright white or very dark. Because you can have lesions on the brain for other reasons, like after having a stroke, your doctor must rule out these causes before making an MS diagnosis. An MRI doesn’t involve radiation exposure and isn’t painful. The scan uses a magnetic field to measure the amount of water in the tissue. Usually myelin repels water. If a person with MS has damaged myelin, more water will show up in the scan. This procedure isn’t always used to diagnose MS. But it’s one of the potential diagnostic procedures. A involves inserting a needle into the spinal canal to remove fluid. A laboratory professional tests the spinal fluid for the presence of certain antibodies that people with MS tend to have. The fluid can also be tested for infection, which could help your doctor rule out MS. Doctors may have to repeat diagnostic tests for MS several times before they can confirm the diagnosis. This is because MS symptoms can change. They may diagnose someone with MS if testing points to the following : Signs and symptoms indicate there’s damage to the myelin in the CNS. The doctor has identified at least two or more lesions in two or more parts of the CNS via an MRI. There’s evidence based on a physical exam that the CNS has been affected. A person has had two or more episodes of affected neurological function for at least one day, and they occurred a month apart. Or, a person’s symptoms have progressed over the course of one year. The doctor can’t find any other explanation for the person’s symptoms. Diagnostic criteria have changed over the years and will likely continue to change as new technology and research comes along. The most recent accepted criteria were published in 2017 as the revised The International Panel on the Diagnosis of Multiple Sclerosis released these criteria. One of the more recent innovations in diagnosing MS is a tool called optical coherence tomography (OCT). This tool allows a doctor to obtain images of a person’s optical nerve. The test is painless and is much like taking a picture of your eye. Doctors know that people with MS tend to have optic nerves that look different from people who don’t have the disease. OCT also allows a doctor to track a person’s eye health by looking at the optic nerve. Is the diagnostic process different for each type of MS? Doctors have identified a number of MS types. In 2013, the International Advisory Committee on Clinical Trials of MS revised the descriptions of these types based on new research and updated imaging technology. Although the diagnosis of MS has initial criteria, determining the MS type a person has is a matter of tracking a person’s MS symptoms over time. To determine the type of MS a person has, doctors look for It’s estimated that of people with MS are initially diagnosed with , which is characterized by relapses. This means new MS symptoms appear and are followed by a remission of the symptoms. About half of the symptoms that occur during relapses leave some lingering problems, but these may be very minor. During a remission, a person’s condition doesn’t get worse. The National MS society estimates that of people with MS have . Those with this type experience a steady worsening of symptoms, usually with fewer relapses and remissions early in their diagnosis. People with this type of MS have early incidences of relapse and remission, and symptoms worsen over time. A doctor may diagnose a person with (CIS) if they have an episode of neurologic symptoms associated with MS that lasts at least 24 hours. These symptoms include inflammation and damage to myelin. Having just one episode of experiencing a symptom associated with MS doesn’t mean a person will go on to develop MS. However, if the MRI results of a person with CIS show that they might be at higher risk for developing MS, the new guidelines recommend starting disease-modifying therapy. According to the , these guidelines have the potential to reduce the onset of MS in people whose symptoms are detected in the very early stages. — — Promising Treatments and Clinical Trials for Relapsing-Remitting MS Could an Undiagnosed Sleep Disorder be Causing Your MS Fatigue?

CALABRESI, M.D., Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland Abstract Abstract Multiple sclerosis, an idiopathic inflammatory disease of the central nervous system, is characterized pathologically by demyelination and subsequent axonal degeneration. The disease commonly presents in young adults and affects twice as many women as men. Common presenting symptoms include numbness, weakness, visual impairment, loss of balance, dizziness, urinary bladder urgency, fatigue, and depression. The diagnosis of multiple sclerosis should be made by a physician with experience in identifying the disease. Diagnosis should be based on objective evidence of two or more neurologic signs that are localized to the brain or spinal cord and are disseminated in time and space (i.e., occur in different parts of the central nervous system at least three months apart). Magnetic resonance imaging with gadolinium contrast, especially during or following a first attack, can be helpful in providing evidence of lesions in other parts of the brain and spinal cord. A second magnetic resonance scan may be useful at least three months after the initial attack to identify new lesions and provide evidence of dissemination over time. It is critical to exclude other diseases that can mimic multiple sclerosis, including vascular disease, spinal cord compression, vitamin B deficiency, central nervous system infection (e.g., Lyme disease, syphilis), and other inflammatory conditions (e.g., sarcoidosis, systemic lupus erythematosus, Sjögren’s syndrome). Symptom-specific drugs can relieve spasticity, bladder dysfunction, depression, and fatigue. Five disease-modifying treatments for multiple sclerosis have been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. These treatments are partially effective in reducing exacerbations and may slow progression of disability. Multiple sclerosis (MS) typically presents in adults who are 20 to 45 years of age. Occasionally, the disease presents in childhood or late middle age. Twice as many women are affected as men, and persons of Northern European descent appear to be at highest risk for the disease. Magnetic resonance imaging should be performed or repeated three months after a clinically suspicious episode to facilitate early diagnosis of MS. Corticosteroid therapy should be used to shorten the duration of MS relapses and accelerate recovery. Disease-modifying treatment should be started early in the course of MS to minimize irreversible axonal damage. Glatiramer and the beta interferons have different mechanisms of action. Patients with MS who have an unsatisfactory response to beta interferons should be considered for glatiramer therapy. Patients with worsening forms of MS may be referred for mitoxantrone therapy; however, this agent has acute short-term adverse effects, as well as serious long-term adverse effects that include cardiotoxicity. A = consistent, good quality patient-oriented evidence; B = inconsistent or limited quality patient-oriented evidence; C = consensus, disease-oriented evidence, usual practice, opinion, or case series.

Common presenting symptoms include monocular visual impairment with pain (optic neuritis), paresthesias, weakness, and impaired coordination . Frequent accompanying signs and symptoms include bladder urgency or retention, constipation, sexual dysfunction, fatigue, depression, diplopia, gait and limb ataxia, and Lhermitte’s sign (electrical sensation down the spine on neck flexion). Lhermitte’s sign (electrical sensation down the spine on neck flexion) Decreased perception of pain, vibration, or position Impaired visual acuity or red color perception with optic disc pallor and afferent pupillary defect; disconjugate eye movements Lhermitte’s sign (electrical sensation down the spine on neck flexion) Decreased perception of pain, vibration, or position Impaired visual acuity or red color perception with optic disc pallor and afferent pupillary defect; disconjugate eye movements MS frequently is overlooked because initial symptoms resolve spontaneously in most patients. Relapses occur within months or years. In some patients, however, MS has a primary progressive course from onset. Abstract The diagnosis of MS is based on the presence of central nervous system (CNS) lesions that are disseminated in time and space (i.e., occur in different parts of the CNS at least three months apart), with no better explanation for the disease process. Because no single test is totally reliable in identifying MS, and a variety of conditions can mimic the disease , diagnosis depends on clinical features supplemented by the findings of certain studies. CNS infection (e.g., Lyme disease, syphilis, human immunodeficiency virus infection, human T-lymphotrophic virus type I) CNS inflammatory condition (e.g., sarcoidosis, systemic lupus erythematosus, Sjögren’s syndrome) CNS microvascular disease (e.g., disease caused by hypertension, diabetes mellitus, vasculitis, CADASIL) Genetic disorder (e.g., leukodystrophy, hereditary myelopathy, mitochondrial disease) Structural or compressive condition of the brain and spinal cord (e.g., cervical spondylosis, tumor, herniated disc, Chiari’s malformation) Vitamin B deficiency CNS = central nervous system; CADASIL = cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been shown to be highly sensitive in detecting clinically silent MS plaques. Consequently, findings of this imaging modality are included in diagnostic criteria that have been proposed by one set of investigators.  The major advantage of the proposed criteria is that an early diagnosis of MS can be made if an MRI scan performed three months after a clinically isolated attack demonstrates formation of a new lesion. The proposed diagnostic criteria also define MRI lesion characteristics that increase the likelihood of MS, including number of lesions (nine or more), location of lesions (position abutting the ventricles; juxtacortical, infratentorial, or spinal position), and lesion enhancement with the use of contrast medium .

A brain MRI scan is the most useful test for confirming the diagnosis of MS. MS lesions appear as areas of high signal, predominantly in the cerebral white matter or spinal cord, on T-weighted images . MRI scanning is useful for detecting structural pathology in regions that can be difficult to image by computed tomography, such as the posterior fossa, craniocervical junction, and cervical cord. A brain MRI scan performed with a high-field magnet (1.5 tesla or greater) is abnormal in almost all patients who have clinically definite MS.

MRI scans of the spinal cord in a patient with MS. Sagittal images using the short tau inversion recovery (STIR) protocol reveal multiple high-signal lesions within the spinal cord, consistent with demyelination. These lesions, which also can be seen on the transverse cuts, often are situated dorsolaterally, and are usually less than one vertebral body in length. The lesions rarely cause cord swelling. Evoked potentials (visual, brainstem auditory, and somatosensory) may be useful in demonstrating the presence of subclinical lesions in sensory pathways or in providing objective evidence of lesions suspected on the basis of subjective complaints. Of the sensory evoked potential tests, the visual evoked potential is the most useful because it can provide objective evidence of an optic nerve lesion that may not be evident on an MRI scan. In approximately 90 percent of patients with definite MS, the CSF IgG concentration is increased relative to other CSF proteins (e.g., albumin), and CSF gel electrophoresis reveals oligoclonal bands that are not present in a matched serum sample. However, an increased CSF IgG index and the presence of oligoclonal bands are not specific for MS and therefore are not diagnostic of the disease. CSF analysis probably is most useful for ruling out infectious or neoplastic conditions that mimic MS. Peripheral blood tests may be helpful in excluding other disease processes. Testing frequently includes determination of the vitamin B level, thyroid-stimulating hormone level, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and anti-nuclear antibody titers, as well as a test for Lyme disease, and a test for syphilis (rapid plasma reagin test). In unusual cases, a more extensive evaluation may include tests for anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies, anti-phospholipid antibodies, Sjögren’s syndrome A and B, angiotensin-converting enzyme, human T-lymphotrophic virus type I, and very long chain fatty acids (for adrenoleukodystrophy). Rarely, human immunodeficiency virus infection and opportunistic infections can mimic MS. Certain clinical or laboratory red flags should alert physicians to a possible diagnostic error. These flags include symptoms that could be explained by localized disease; the presence of steadily progressive disease; the absence of clinical remission; the absence of oculomotor, optic nerve, sensory, or bladder involvement; and normal CSF findings. However, none of these findings excludes the diagnosis of MS. Abstract Mild spasticity may be managed by stretching and exercise programs such as water therapy, yoga, and physical therapy. Medication is indicated when stiffness, spasms, or clonus interferes with function or sleep. Baclofen (Lioresal), tizanidine (Zanaflex), gabapentin (Neurontin), and benzodiazepines are effective antispastic agents . Intrathecal baclofen therapy has a major impact on medically intractable spasticity and has largely supplanted chemical rhizotomy or myelotomy. Baclofen (Lioresal), 10 to 40 mg three times daily; in high doses, can cause weakness and fatigue Tizanidine (Zanaflex), 2 to 8 mg three times daily; in high doses, can cause weakness and fatigue Gabapentin (Neurontin), 300 to 900 mg three or four times daily; in high doses, causes fatigue Gabapentin, 300 to 900 mg three or four times daily; in high doses, causes fatigue Carbamazepine (Tegretol), 100 to 600 mg three times daily; in high doses, causes rash and neurologic side effects; requires monitoring of complete blood count and liver function Amitriptyline (Elavil), 10 to 150 mg per day at bedtime Oxybutynin (Ditropan), 5 mg once daily to 20 mg per day in divided doses; causes dry mouth and can exacerbate glaucoma or worsen urinary retention Tolterodine (Detrol), 2 to 4 mg twice daily; causes dry mouth and can exacerbate glaucoma or worsen urinary retention (these side effects occur less often than with oxybutynin) SSRIs preferred because of activating properties; can have sexual side effects Alternatives to SSRIs when sexual side effects occur: extended-release venlafaxine (Effexor) 75 to 225 mg per day, or sustained-release bupropion (Wellbutrin), 150 mg per day to 150 mg twice daily Third-line drug or for use when a patient has a sleep disorder or concomitant headaches: amitriptyline, 10 to 150 mg per day at bedtime Amantadine (Symmetrel), 100 mg twice daily; can cause rash, edema, and anticholinergic effects Modafinil (Provigil), 100 to 200 mg given in the morning; can cause jittery sensation and palpitations Baclofen (Lioresal), 10 to 40 mg three times daily; in high doses, can cause weakness and fatigue Tizanidine (Zanaflex), 2 to 8 mg three times daily; in high doses, can cause weakness and fatigue Gabapentin (Neurontin), 300 to 900 mg three or four times daily; in high doses, causes fatigue Gabapentin, 300 to 900 mg three or four times daily; in high doses, causes fatigue Carbamazepine (Tegretol), 100 to 600 mg three times daily; in high doses, causes rash and neurologic side effects; requires monitoring of complete blood count and liver function Amitriptyline (Elavil), 10 to 150 mg per day at bedtime Oxybutynin (Ditropan), 5 mg once daily to 20 mg per day in divided doses; causes dry mouth and can exacerbate glaucoma or worsen urinary retention Tolterodine (Detrol), 2 to 4 mg twice daily; causes dry mouth and can exacerbate glaucoma or worsen urinary retention (these side effects occur less often than with oxybutynin) SSRIs preferred because of activating properties; can have sexual side effects Alternatives to SSRIs when sexual side effects occur: extended-release venlafaxine (Effexor) 75 to 225 mg per day, or sustained-release bupropion (Wellbutrin), 150 mg per day to 150 mg twice daily Third-line drug or for use when a patient has a sleep disorder or concomitant headaches: amitriptyline, 10 to 150 mg per day at bedtime Amantadine (Symmetrel), 100 mg twice daily; can cause rash, edema, and anticholinergic effects Modafinil (Provigil), 100 to 200 mg given in the morning; can cause jittery sensation and palpitations In most instances, dystonic spasms respond well to carbamazepine (Tegretol) can be treated effectively with anticonvulsants or amitriptyline (Elavil). In patients with new bladder symptoms, urinalysis and culture should be performed to rule out infection, with appropriate treatment provided if needed. The first step in medical management of the neurogenic bladder is to determine whether the problem is a failure to empty urine or a failure to store urine. The history may or may not be helpful. A postvoid residual urinary volume is the best means of determining urinary retention. The anticholinergic drugs oxybutynin (Ditropan) and tolterodine (Detrol) are effective for symptoms of failure to store urine (in the absence of infection or overflow incontinence). Drug treatment of urinary retention usually is ineffective, although some patients benefit from attempts to decrease bladder neck tone using an alpha-adrenergic receptor antagonist such as terazosin (Hytrin), doxazosin (Cardura), or tamsulosin (Flomax). Bethanechol (Urecholine) may be helpful in patients with a flaccid bladder. Definitive treatment of urinary retention involves teaching the patient to perform intermittent self-catheterization, if possible. In some patients, inhaled desmopressin (DDAVP) can be used to suppress nocturnal urinary production. Constipation is common in patients with MS. It should be managed aggressively to avoid long-term complications. Fecal incontinence is rare; when it occurs, the addition of fiber can provide enough bulk to the stool to allow a partially incompetent sphincter to hold in the bowel movement long enough for the patient to reach a bathroom. Short-term use of anticholinergics or antidiarrheal agents may be effective in combating incontinence associated with diarrhea. A careful sexual history may reveal problems such as feelings of sexual inadequacy, impaired libido, or direct sexual dysfunction resulting from erectile dysfunction, impaired lubrication, spasticity, or heat-related sensory dysesthesias. Counseling, a review of the sexual side effects of medications, and medical therapy may be appropriate. In some patients with MS, erectile dysfunction can be managed effectively with sildenafil (Viagra). Depression occurs in more than one half of patients with MS. Patients with mild, transient depression can be cared for with supportive measures. Those with more severe depression should be treated with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), which are less sedating than other antidepressants. Bedtime administration of amitriptyline can be useful in depressed patients who also are having difficulty sleeping or have headaches or other pain syndromes. This symptom often responds to rest or medication. Amantadine (Symmetrel), 100 mg twice daily, may be effective. Modafinil (Provigil), a narcolepsy drug that acts as a CNS stimulant, has been found to be effective in patients with MS; the drug is given in a dosage of 200 mg once daily in the morning. Occasionally, SSRIs can relieve fatigue in patients with MS. Amantadine has the added advantage of having anti–influenza-A properties and may be given from October to March. In a patient with an apparent relapse of MS, it is important to rule out a treatable infection such as sinusitis, bronchitis, or urinary tract infection. Corticosteroids are the mainstay of symptomatic relief for an acute relapse of MS. These agents work through immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory effects, restoration of the blood-brain barrier, and reduction of edema. They also may improve axonal conduction. Corticosteroid therapy shortens the duration of acute relapses and accelerates recovery. However, corticosteroids have not been shown to improve the overall degree of recovery or to alter the long-term course of MS. If a patient is having acute disability from an attack, the physician should consider treatment with a three- to five-day course of intravenous methylprednisolone (or equivalent corticosteroid) in a dosage of 1 g administered intravenously in 100 mL of normal saline over 60 minutes once daily in the morning. In patients with MS, physical therapy always should be considered because it improves function and quality of life independent of drug therapy. Supportive care in the form of counseling, occupational therapy, advice from social workers, input from nurses, and participation in patient support groups are all part of a united health care team approach to the management of MS. Some patients require temporary disability status. Patients with MS often are tempted to try alternative therapies such as special diets, vitamins, bee stings, a compound “off-label” transdermal medication (i.e., Prokarin), or acupuncture. Although definitive proof of the effectiveness of these treatments in MS is lacking, patients sometimes use them in a complementary fashion. Sole reliance on alternative therapies should be discouraged because patients then may be deprived of therapies that have been shown to be effective in the treatment of MS. Four disease-modifying therapies for the initial management of MS are available in the United States: intramuscular interferon beta-1a (Avonex), subcutaneous interferon beta-1a (Rebif), interferon beta-1b (Betaseron), and glatiramer acetate (Copaxone). A fifth agent, mitoxantrone (Novantrone), has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of worsening forms of relapsing-remitting MS and secondary progressive MS .

Montvale, N.J.: Medical Economics Data, 2004. Cost to the patient will be higher, depending on prescription filling fee. The beta interferons are naturally occurring cytokines with a variety of immunomodulating and antiviral activities that may account for their therapeutic effects. The three FDA-approved beta interferons that are used for MS have been shown to reduce relapses by about one third and are recommended as first-line therapy or for use in glatiramer-intolerant patients who have relapsing-remitting MS. In randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled trials, use of beta interferons resulted in a 50 to 80 percent reduction in inflammatory lesions visualized on brain MRI scans. There also is evidence that these drugs improve quality of life and cognitive function. The major difference in the beta interferon drugs is that intramuscular interferon beta-1a is given once a week and subcutaneous interferon beta-1a and interferon beta-1b are given three times a week, or every other day, respectively. The adequacy of weekly dosing has been questioned. There appears to be a modest dose-response effect with the beta interferons. One study of double-dose (60-mcg) intramuscular interferon beta-1a administered once a week found no benefit over the single-dose regimen. Whether the benefit of more frequent dosing is sustained remains unclear. An increased incidence of neutralizing antibodies with the more frequent subcutaneous dosing also must be considered. Influenza-like symptoms, including fever, chills, malaise, muscle aches, and fatigue, occur in approximately 60 percent of patients treated with interferon beta-1a or interferon beta-1b. These symptoms usually dissipate with continued therapy and premedication with a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug. Dose titration at the initiation of beta interferon therapy also is a useful strategy. Other side effects of the beta interferons include injection-site reactions, worsening of pre-existing spasticity, depression, mild anemia, thrombocytopenia, and elevated transaminase levels. These side effects usually are not severe and rarely lead to discontinuation of treatment. Treatment with any beta interferon can result in the development of neutralizing antibodies. Although study results are variable, once-weekly intramuscular interferon beta-1a therapy has been reported to have the lowest incidence of neutralizing antibody development. The effect of neutralizing antibodies on the long-term efficacy of beta interferon therapy remains to be fully defined because titers and durations of antibody positivity (some neutralizing antibodies resolve with time) are variable. This drug is a polypeptide mixture that was originally designed to mimic and compete with myelin basic protein. Its mechanism of action is distinct from that of the beta interferons; therefore, patients may respond differently to the drug. Glatiramer in a dosage of 20 mg administered subcutaneously once daily has been shown to reduce the frequency of MS relapses by approximately one third. The drug also is recommended as a first-line treatment in patients with relapsing-remitting MS and in the treatment of patients who cannot tolerate beta interferon therapy. Glatiramer therapy results in a one-third reduction in the inflammatory activity seen on MRI scans. Glatiramer generally is well tolerated and is not associated with influenza-like symptoms. Immediate postinjection reactions include local inflammation and an uncommon idiosyncratic reaction consisting of flushing, chest tightness with palpitations, anxiety, or dyspnea, which resolves spontaneously without sequelae. Routine laboratory monitoring is not considered necessary in patients treated with glatiramer, and the development of binding antibodies does not interfere with therapeutic efficacy. A phase-III, randomized, placebo-controlled, multicenter trial found that mitoxantrone, an anthracenedione antineoplastic agent, reduced the number of treated MS relapses by 67 percent and slowed progression on the Expanded Disability Status Scale, Ambulation Index, and MRI measures of disease activity. Mitoxantrone is recommended for use in patients with worsening forms of MS. Acute side effects of mitoxantrone include nausea and alopecia. Because of cumulative cardiotoxicity, the drug can be used for only two to three years (or for a cumulative dose of 120 to 140 mg per m). There also is some concern about treatment-related leukemia. Mitoxantrone is a chemotherapeutic agent that should be prescribed and administered only by experienced health care professionals. Natalizumab (Antegren) is in the final stages of phase-III clinical trails and is under accelerated review by the FDA. In a phase-II clinical trial, this drug appeared promising in that it reduced active MRI lesions by 90 percent and decreased MS relapses by more than 50 percent. Natalizumab is a monoclonal antibody that is directed against an adhesion molecule called VLA-4. The drug is administered intravenously once a month. Despite lack of FDA approval and definitive evidence of efficacy, several other drugs commonly are used in patients with MS. A number of small clinical trials support the modest effect of intravenous IgG, azathioprine, methotrexate, and cyclophosphamide, either alone or in combination with standard therapy. Abstract Accumulating evidence indicates that the best time to initiate disease-modifying treatment is early in the course of MS. Data indicate that irreversible axonal damage may occur early in relapsing-remitting MS, and that drug therapies appear to be more effective in preventing new lesion formation than in repairing old lesions. With disease progression, the autoimmune response of the disease may become more difficult to suppress. Both intramuscular interferon beta-1a therapy and subcutaneous interferon beta-1a therapy have been shown to reduce the cumulative probability of the development of clinically definite MS in patients who present with a first clinical demyelinating episode and have two or more brain lesions on an MRI scan. Based on these data, the National Multiple Sclerosis Society supports the initiation of immunomodulating therapy at the time of diagnosis. The physician must weigh evidence and recommendations against the practical concerns of young patients for whom the prospect of starting therapy that requires self-injection may be frightening and burdensome. Furthermore, few long-term data (more than 10 years) are available on the safety and sustained efficacy of disease-modifying drugs. A patient may opt to defer therapy, hoping to be among the minority of persons with benign MS; however, certain MRI and clinical features should prompt the physician and patient to reconsider this approach. An MRI scan with contrast-enhancing lesions, a large burden of white matter disease, or any T low-signal lesions (black holes) suggests a relatively poor prognosis. It may be useful to repeat brain MRI scanning in six months or one year to determine how quickly the disease process is evolving. The presence of spinal cord lesions or atrophy also suggests a poor prognosis. Clinical features may be less useful for assessing prognosis. Once definite disability develops, it may be too late to treat that component of the disease. The ability to diagnose and treat MS has improved considerably in the past 10 years because of the availability of MRI and partially effective immunomodulating therapies. The limited efficacy of immunomodulating drugs in the later, noninflammatory stages of MS highlights the importance of developing remyelinating and neuroprotective strategies for the disease.

2ab8e4cc-cf30-4db1-953d-c8ac582f829e,"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a disease of the central nervous system (CNS). The CNS consists of the brain, optic nerves, and spinal cord. With MS, areas of the CNS become inflamed, damaging the protective covering (myelin) that surrounds and insulates the nerves (axons). In addition to the myelin, over time, the axons and nerve cells (neurons) within the CNS may also become damaged. This damage is referred to as neurodegeneration. The damage to the protective covering and also to the nerves disrupts the smooth flow of nerve impulses. As a result, messages from the brain and spinal cord going to other parts of the body may be delayed and have trouble reaching their destination – causing the symptoms of MS. Described later in this booklet, these symptoms can include a wide variety of physical, emotional, and cognitive changes. Areas of inflammation and damage are known as lesions, which are viewed on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. The changes in size, number, and location of these lesions may determine the type and severity of symptoms. While individuals with relapsing forms of MS are believed to experience more inflammation than those with progressive forms of MS, lesions still occur for individuals with all forms of MS. However, the lesions in progressive forms of MS may be less active and expand more slowly. Shown above is an illustration of two nerve cells. The normal one on the left has a healthy nerve fiber, or axon, protected by myelin (insulation covering the nerve), and is able to transmit signals at a very fast speed – similar to electricity traveling along an electrical cord. The MS nerve cell on the right shows damage to the myelin, and as a result, signals do not travel well along the nerve. MS affects each person differently. For many years, the most common types of MS had been classified as: However, these classifications are changing, and some experts are now grouping relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) and secondary-progressive MS (SPMS) together, as a continuum of the same disease. These are now frequently referred to as “” Additionally, progressive-relapsing MS (PRMS) and primary-progressive MS (PPMS) have also been grouped together. These are now frequently referred to as “” Initially, most people with MS experience symptom flare-ups, which are also known as relapses, exacerbations, or attacks. When someone experiences a relapse, he or she may be having new symptoms or an increase in existing symptoms. These usually persist for a short period of time, from a few days to a few months. Afterward, the symptoms greatly improve or remit completely, and these individuals may remain symptom-free for periods of months or years. This type of MS is known as relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS). Approximately 80 to 85 percent of MS patients are initially diagnosed with this form of the disease. Over time, RRMS may advance to secondary-progressive MS (SPMS). This form of MS does not have the dramatic variations in symptoms that RRMS does, but rather has a slow, steady progression – with or without relapses. If relapses do occur, they usually do not fully remit. Without treatment, approximately half of individuals with RRMS convert to SPMS within 10 years. However, with the introduction of long-term disease-modifying therapies (DMTs), fewer individuals advance to this latter form of the disease. Since 1993, and as of mid-2017, a total of 15 DMTs have been approved by the FDA and are available through prescription. All of these approved medications are aimed at slowing disease activity and delaying progression in MS. Individuals who are not initially diagnosed with RRMS may be experiencing a more steady progression of the disease from the onset. Approximately 10 percent of the MS population is diagnosed with primary-progressive MS (PPMS), where individuals experience a steady worsening of symptoms from the start, and do not have periodic relapses and remissions. Approximately 5 percent of patients are initially diagnosed with progressive-relapsing MS (PRMS). This type of MS steadily worsens from the onset, but symptom flare-ups – with or without remissions – are also present. All forms of MS share an underlying pathogenesis, which refers to the origin of a disease and its development. The pathogenesis of MS includes: – this is an autoimmune attack where an individual’s own white blood cells cause damage to his or her own neurons within the brain and spinal cord – this is damage to the myelin covering around nerves, caused by inflammation – this is the shrinking, atrophy, and death of neurons – this is the body’s own attempt to repair damaged myelin, although this repair is often incomplete – this results in multiple scars within the brain and spinal cord at sites of damage from MS Research has shown that individuals with progressive forms of MS have predominantly neurodegeneration and less inflammation. This is in comparison to relapsing-remitting MS, where inflammation is the predominant driver of the disease with less neurodegeneration occurring early in the disease process. Particularly with relapsing forms of MS, inflammation is greatly involved with the initial disease process. This causes damage to the myelin – the protective covering of the nerves in the central nervous system – and eventually damage to the nerves as well. As time progresses and fewer relapses are experienced, the disease involves increasingly less inflammation and more neurodegeneration, which is the breakdown or cell death of nerve cells. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has revolutionized the ability to efficiently diagnose MS, track new inflammatory-disease activity – through the discovery of new T2 bright spots and/or new gadolinium-enhancing lesions (these are areas of disease activity with inflammation) – as well as monitor an individual’s response to MS disease-modifying therapies. Currently, an MRI scan provides the best biomarker for evidence of MS progression. MRI measures that most closely correlate to progression include: accelerated brain atrophy, which refers to faster brain shrinkage development of T1 hypointensities, also referred to as “black holes,” which indicate more neurodegeneration versus inflammation Readers should note that many of the current MS therapies have been shown to decrease the accumulation of bright spots and black holes as viewed on an MRI, along with slowing atrophy rates. MS specialists encourage people with MS to review their MRI scans with their providers and to ask about these two types of disease measures. MSAA may be able to help cover MRI costs through its MRI Access Fund program (certain income limits apply). To learn more, please visit or call . Kurtzke’s Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) is the oldest and most widely accepted measure of MS disability. The EDSS ranges from 0 to 10 in half-point increments, where 0 is a normal examination, 3.0 is moderate disability, 6.0 is where the person needs assistance to walk, and higher numbers refer to greater disability, largely in terms of mobility. Shown above are features from Kurtzke’s Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS). Frequently used for clinical evaluation and research study assessments, it mainly focuses on mobility when determining a score. A trained MS clinician assigns a functional score to a patient in eight neurologic systems: pyramidal (referring to the motor system, with weakness and spasticity), cerebellar, brainstem, sensory, bladder and bowel, vision, cerebral, and “other.” These are all based on a standard neurologic examination. The EDSS is frequently criticized for being insensitive to small changes, being heavily dependent on mobility, not capturing cognitive impairment, being subjective in some assessments (rating scores can vary), and for not capturing the full range of disabilities. The Multiple Sclerosis Functional Composite (MSFC) is another clinical tool that assesses MS disability. Unlike the EDSS that is based on a standard neurological examination, the MSFC assesses disability using three “functional” tests. It summarizes the scores of the following: the paced auditory serial addition test evaluating cognition The goal of this system is to capture information on key functional measures affected by MS, specifically leg, arm, and cognitive function. The MSFC is often used in connection with the EDSS in MS clinical trials. Many aspects of the MSFC, such as the timed 25-foot walk, are routinely monitored in MS clinics as well. Approximately one in every 750 individuals in the United States has MS. The natural progression of MS has changed over time. Early studies showed that the median time from onset of PPMS to needing a device (such as a cane) to assist with walking was 10 years, while more contemporary studies show that this has increased to 15 years. Another study showed that 25 percent of people with PPMS still did not require a cane after more than 25 years. Although difficult, individuals with MS should not compare their disease course with those of others, as every individual is different. Risk factors for disease progression have been identified, but their interplay is complex. Early onset of disease and female gender are favorable factors associated with a better prognosis in terms of one’s long-term course of MS. For instance, individuals who were young at the onset of their MS have been shown to take a longer amount of time before their MS progresses to the point of needing a device to assist with walking, which is a score of 6.0 on the EDSS. Relapses can still occur in people with progressive MS. Individuals with secondaryprogressive MS can have an occasional relapse, which is a new neurologic symptom that lasts more than 24 hours, in the absence of fever or infection. This occasional relapse is superimposed on progressive disease, characterized by a gradual decline. For example, an individual with SPMS may notice worsening balance and walking issues over several years, and then notice over the course of hours to days, they have developed blurry vision in one eye and pain with eye movements. He or she may then be diagnosed with an MS relapse of optic neuritis, in addition to having a gradual decline in neurologic function over the course of years. This is different from RRMS, as individuals with RRMS only experience neurologic worsening in the setting of a relapse. The word “progressive” has historically carried a negative connotation among members of the MS community. However, when this term was first coined, the understanding of the pathophysiology of MS – which is how the disease progresses and its effects – was very limited. Neuro-diagnostics, which use advanced technology to diagnose, evaluate, and sometimes treat certain neurological conditions, were in their infancy, and the therapies that could slow progression were lacking. Fortunately, the MS world is changing. Currently, no criteria have been defined to determine definitively when a person with MS has progressed from RRMS to SPMS. However, criteria are in place for a diagnosis of SPMS, which requires the onset of the disease with at least one clinical relapse (differentiating it from PPMS), followed by a gradual decline in neurologic function over the course of at least six to 12 months. This decline must be separate from the worsening that occurs during relapses. The diagnosis of PPMS has distinct criteria based on 2010 McDonald criteria for the diagnosis of MS. To receive a diagnosis of PPMS, a person with MS must have one year or more of gradual decline in neurologic function, in addition to two or more of the following: two or more lesions consistent with MS in the spinal cord cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis consistent with the diagnosis Individuals with RRMS are usually diagnosed between the ages of 15 and 40. The average age of onset of SPMS and PPMS is in the fifth and sixth decades of life, when people are in their 40s or 50s. While RRMS often affects women two-to-three times more often than men, the gender ratio in PPMS is equal between males and females. In both SPMS and PPMS, the rate of decline in neurologic function occurs at a similar rate. Individuals with PPMS generally have more spinal-cord lesions than those with SPMS. It is important to note that the diagnosis of the type of MS is based on clinical history, which is determined through doctor visits and evaluations. Progressive forms of MS cannot be diagnosed with an MRI or spinal-fluid analysis alone. As part of the 2013 International MS Phenotype Group revised MS classification criteria, three important modifiers were added to the description of MS: activity, worsening, and progression. These modifiers help to more accurately reflect the current disease process in a specific individual with MS. refers to a new clinical MS attack (relapse) or a new bright spot (showing inflammation) on the MRI. simply reflects that a specific person’s neurological examination has gotten worse compared to prior examinations, possibly related to an MS attack (relapse). indicates worsening on an exam, independent from an attack (relapse). In summary, people with progressive MS can and do have attacks (relapses), albeit infrequently, and develop new spots (or lesions) on MRI. Both relapses and new lesions are types of disease activity. Additionally, MS may be “clinically silent,” showing no increase in symptoms, yet continuing to show signs of disease activity within the CNS, as seen on MRI. Conversely, these same people can experience long periods of time without progression and without worsening. These variations in disease activity show how dynamic MS is, while affecting each individual differently. Clinical worsening in MS, or the gradual decline in function, should not immediately be attributed to MS as the only cause. Individuals with MS can also acquire other medical problems that can mimic MS progression. These include: cervical stenosis – a narrowing of the spinal canal in the neck, which can put pressure on the spinal cord and cause a worsening of gait, sensation, strength, as well as a worsening of bowel and bladder control As a result, a thorough evaluation by a neurologist as well as a regular follow up with a primary-care physician are important. If alternative causes are ruled out, then a neurologist may confirm that progression is directly related to one’s MS. | | Improving Lives Today! – A Guide to MSAA’s Programs and Services How to S.E.A.R.C.H.™ for the Right MS Therapy for You!

Multiple Sclerosis: Symptoms, Management & New Research Multiple sclerosis is a disease that affects the brain and spinal cord. Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a disease that affects the central : the brain and spinal cord. In MS, the body's immune system mistakenly attacks myelin, the protective coat surrounding nerve fibers. The destruction of myelin leads to ""sclerosis,"" or the formation of scar tissue. It also impairs the ability of nerve cells to transmit signals in the form of electrical impulses. MS is an . That means that ""for some reason, your immune system is acting incorrectly and it becomes intolerant to its own central nervous system,"" said Dr. Karen Blitz, director of the North Shore-LIJ Multiple Sclerosis Care Center in East Meadow, New York. It's not known what causes this condition, which can take an unpredictable and varying course among patients. People with MS can experience a variety of neurological impairments related to the functioning of the brain and spinal cord. This includes problems with vision, muscle control and sensory issues in the limbs, according to the . MS affects 400,000 Americans and about 2.5 million individuals globally, according to the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health. Patients are typically diagnosed between ages 20 and 40, and the disease tends to affect women more often than men. Diagnosing MS is often difficult and requires clinical detective work. ""We get a history from the patient, we examine the patient, and then we do some testing,"" Blitz said. Looking at symptoms or test results by themselves cannot conclusively point to MS, according to the . Tests for MS include neurologic exams (to test nerve function, sensation and reflexes) and . An MRI identifies scarring or lesions in the brain and spinal cord. One of the key aspects of diagnosing MS is to determine whether nerve damage is present in more than one spot, and whether that damage occurred at different times. In 2017, the International Panel on the Diagnosis of Multiple Sclerosis published new guidelines —  — on the use of MRIs and cerebrospinal fluid analysis for speedy diagnosis of MS. Blood tests may be done to rule out diseases that can mimic MS. ""There are many such diseases, but some examples include Lyme disease, vasculitis, thyroid dysfunction, B12 deficiency and migraine headaches,"" Blitz said. ""Then you put all these pieces together to come up with a clinical diagnosis."" Symptoms of MS can differ in each patient, depending on which nerve fibers are affected. According to the , the symptoms include: Numbness or weakness, which can occur on one side of the body, or the legs and trunk. The sensation of an ""electric shock"" upon moving the neck, also known as Lhermitte's sign. Blurred or double vision. Also, partial or total vision loss in one eye at a time, usually with pain during eye movement Each patient's MS symptoms may progress differently. Patients usually face one of the four following disease courses, according to the U.S. National Library of Medicine: : Marked by attacks of MS symptoms (relapses), followed by periods without symptoms (remissions). The attacks do not worsen over time. About 80% of patients are diagnosed with relapsing-remitting MS. : After about 10 years of experiencing relapsing-remitting MS, the pattern can change into secondary-progressive MS. The attacks progressively worsen, with no periods of remission. : This is the second most common form of MS. With no relapses or remissions, this type is marked by constant and steadily worsening symptoms. About 10-20% of patients have primary-progressive MS. : Initially marked by constant, steadily worsening symptoms, similar to primary-progressive MS. However, this rare type also includes attacks of more severe symptoms. While most MS patients experience one of the disease courses listed above, fulminant MS is another rare form of the disease, which mostly affects children and young adults, according to . It is similar to remitting-relapsing MS, but progresses very rapidly. Anyone can develop MS. While there is no known cause, according to the Mayo Clinic, several factors may increase the risk of developing the disease. These include: Women are two to three times more likely to develop relapsing-remitting MS. Having a parent or sibling with MS puts you at higher risk of developing the disease. Many viral infections are linked to MS. This includes the Epstein-Barr virus, which causes infectious mononucleosis. White people, are at highest risk of developing MS. In particular, those of Northern European descent. At the lowest risk, are those of Asian, African or Native American descent. MS is more common in countries farther from the equator, including southern Canada, the northern United States, New Zealand, southeastern Australia and Europe. MS is less common in countries closer to the equator. Lower levels of vitamin D and low exposure to sunlight are also risk factors. Having thyroid disease, Type 1 diabetes or inflammatory bowel disease may put one at a slightly higher risk of developing MS. For people who have MS, certain lifestyle factors have also been linked to the outcome of the disease. For example, people with MS who smoke are more likely than nonsmokers to develop a more severe form of the disease, Blitz said. Additionally, ""there is good data now that exercise is another piece of the puzzle,"" she said. Patients who exercise seem to do better than those who don't. The cause of MS is unknown and there's no cure for the disease. However, there are a number of treatments and medications available to treat the symptoms and disease progression. can slow the course of MS, reduce the number of relapses and help manage major symptoms. Here are the most commonly used ones. : These reduce inflammation associated with relapse and are the most common MS drugs, according to the Mayo Clinic. Oral prednisone and intravenous methylprednisolone are two corticosteroids used. : These medications slow the progression of MS symptoms, though they can result in liver damage. Examples include Betaseron, Avonex and Rebif (none of which comes in the generic form). : Also known as the brand name Copaxone, this IV drug can hinder the immune system's attack on myelin. Side effects can include shortness of breath and flushing, according to the Mayo Clinic. : Also known as Tysabri, this is used if other drugs don't work or aren't well-tolerated. It impedes potentially damaging immune cells from migrating from the blood to the central nervous system. : Also known as Novantrone, this immunosuppressant is typically used only in advanced MS because of risks to the heart. For MS sufferers who find it difficult to tolerate the side effects from injections, or who want the convenience of a pill, there are three oral medications approved by the FDA: Tecfidera (dimethyl fumarate), Aubagio (teriflunomide) and Gilenya (fingolimod). Other MS therapies manage symptoms or address disabilities caused by the condition. Physical and occupational therapists can demonstrate flexibility- and strength-increasing exercises as well as the use of adaptive devices that help patients perform daily tasks, according to the Mayo Clinic. According to the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health, some complementary health practices can help to ease MS symptoms. For instance, yoga and tai chi can help with improving fatigue and mood. and may help with spasticity and pain. Marijuana-derived medications are not approved by the FDA at this time. However, Canada and some European countries have approved Sativex, a prescription mouth spray for muscle control. In 2018, the to treat both relapsing-remitting and primary-progressive MS. In clinical trials, it was shown to significantly slow disease progression in both forms. In MS patients, (a type of white blood cell) have been shown to accumulate in lesions, or areas of scarring. The drug, which is an antibody, targets and destroys specific types of B-cells in the body. As of January 2019, other promising drugs are in late-stage , according to published in the journal Lancet. is a drug for the treatment of progressive MS. In Phase 2 trials it reduced the rate of brain atrophy by about 48%. Researchers are also conducting clinical trials with pediatric MS patients to test drugs approved for use in adults. The review reported that much of current research on treating MS is focused on identifying new biomarkers for the disease, particularly those that can indicate the degeneration of neurons.

b798f00f-ab82-425d-bced-df86bc66cfec,"Can Radiology Be Used to Diagnose Multiple Sclerosis? Medically reviewed by — — is a chronic disease of your central nervous system (CNS). It’s thought to be the result of an immune system attack. MS causes demyelination, or the damage of myelin. This is the protective layer that surrounds your nerve fibers. As scar tissue (lesions) forms, it interferes with nerve signals within the CNS. People with relapsing-remitting MS experience periods of increased disease activity followed by remissions. Progressive forms of MS cause symptoms that steadily worsen. There are many symptoms associated with MS, depending on the location of the lesions. Severity of symptoms varies significantly from person to person. Some common symptoms include: balance and coordination problems or unsteady gait Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has made it easier to diagnose MS and monitor disease progression. An MRI can provide different information, depending on how it’s done. Types of MRI and radiology tests that may be used for MS include: Using contrast dye to detect active inflammation, this scan highlights new lesions or lesions that are growing. It can also show dark areas that indicate possible permanent damage. This scan detects all old and new lesions and helps gauge total disease progression. As a more sensitive scan, this test can help identify brain lesions. This test can detect lesions within your spinal cord. This scan, involving radiation, can also detect areas of demyelination, but with less detail than MRI. There’s not much preparation for an MRI, but there are some important considerations. Due to the strong magnetic field, some conditions may make it unsafe or require special preparation. Let your doctor and MRI technician know if you: have an implanted medical device, such as a , drug infusion device, cochlear implant, or aneurysm clips If you’re claustrophobic or anxious about the procedure, tell your doctor in advance. A mild prescription sedative may help. For an MRI of your spine, wear clothing that’s easy to change. Even if you’re only having images taken of your brain, you’ll still need to choose clothes with no metal, such as zippers or snaps. You may be required to wear a hospital gown. You’ll be asked to remove jewelry and other metal objects. You may need to leave your valuables in another room. Most hospitals provide a locker for safekeeping. Your doctor or facility should provide you with instructions before the day of your scheduled test. Preparation for a CT scan is similar to that of an MRI. If your test will be done with contrast dye, you may be asked not to eat solid foods for a few hours before the test. Your MRI may be performed with or without contrast. Contrast dye is given to you through an IV in your arm. You’ll lie on a table that slides into the tube-shaped MRI machine. Earphones help you communicate with the technician, who will monitor from another room. MRI is noisy. You’ll hear loud banging sounds. Some facilities offer music via the earphones to help drown out the noise. You’ll also have a call button in case you feel claustrophobic or anxious. You must remain perfectly still during scanning. Any movement could ruin the scans. The procedure is painless and you won’t feel anything. Length of the procedure depends on how many scans are being done and if they’re done both with and without contrast. It generally takes at least one hour but could take much longer. Like MRI, the CT scanner doesn’t touch you and you won’t feel anything. You’ll be required to remain still. The scanner makes some noise as it moves and captures images. You’ll be able to dress and go home as soon as scanning is complete. If you were given an IV it will be removed. If you took a sedative, you’ll need someone to drive you home. MS was a lot more difficult to diagnose before MRI was available. The detailed images are an excellent way to detect MS lesions, which appear as white spots in the brain or spinal column. However, other things can cause white spots, so they don’t necessarily mean you have MS. A single lesion accompanied by symptoms of MS is usually diagnosed as clinically isolated syndrome (CIS). CIS can sometimes develop into MS. Multiple lesions may indicate MS. The diagnosis usually requires at least two lesions within your CNS that occurred at separate points in time. A radiologist will study the MRI or CT scans and prepare a report for your doctor to share with you. There’s no single test for MS. To make a proper diagnosis, your doctor will consider your clinical evaluation, symptom history, and other test results. Other diagnostic tests may include: This will check for antibodies sometimes found in people with MS and can also help rule out similar conditions. These study how well electrical signals in your CNS work. No blood test can diagnose MS, but they can help rule out quite a few other conditions with similar symptoms. There are a variety of medications used in the treatment of MS: are designed to slow progression and lower the relapse rate. Most are self-injectable, but a few are given intravenously. Some newer drugs are available in pill form. are generally used to reduce inflammation during relapses. Individual symptoms can also be treated. Options may include: medication to treat fatigue, muscle spasms, or other symptoms Your individual outlook depends on the type and severity of the disease, as well other health factors. While there’s no cure for MS, there are a variety of treatments and ways of managing your MS. is close to normal, averaging about seven years less than the general population. This is mainly due to complications or other health problems. It’s rare, but MS can be fatal. Good lifestyle habits not only help you feel better, but they help prevent additional health problems. That’s why you should strive for a well-balanced diet, regular exercise, and maintaining a healthy weight. If you use a disease-modifying drug, it must be taken exactly as directed. Follow up with your doctor regularly. Most people with MS continue to lead active, fulfilling lives. Having some symptoms isn’t enough to conclude you have MS. These symptoms can be caused by a variety of conditions. That’s why it’s important to investigate the cause. Start with your family physician. If necessary, you’ll be referred to a neurologist. Symptoms of MS can come and go, so diagnosis can take time. Radiology tests can be a key in your diagnosis and maintenance. It’s also a good idea to keep a symptom diary. Keep track of your symptoms, when they started, and when they stopped. That information will help your doctor decide on the next steps.

f62e58e6-ef98-4715-beaf-b9933b3ac20a,"Visual problems are common among those with MS and are often a first sign of the disease. Optic neuritis is often the first symptom of MS. This occurs when inflammation and demyelination are present along the optic nerve (the nerve that connects the brain to the eye). A diagnosis of optic neuritis may suggest MS, but does not necessarily indicate that a person has or will develop MS. Symptoms of optic neuritis include the acute onset of any of the following: Rarely are both eyes affected simultaneously with optic neuritis in MS. Pain with eye movement usually accompanies or precedes visual loss, and visual loss tends to worsen over the course of a few days before improving. Almost 55 percent of people with MS will have an episode of optic neuritis (according to WebMD). Many functions are involved in seeing an object. Two major components needed for effective vision are (1) the ability to correctly image what is seen and (2) the proper coordination of the muscles that surround the eye and control its movements. Either or both of these functions can be affected by MS. The most common problems are decreased or blurred vision (caused by ), double vision (), and shaking, involuntary movements of the eyes (). While optic neuritis results from inflammation and demyelination along the optic nerve, double vision and involuntary eye movements are the result of lesions in the brain stem, a part of the nervous system between the brain and cervical spinal cord. Inflammation along the optic nerve or in other areas of the brain and spinal cord is thought to be the cause of MS relapses, and if severe enough, is often treated with steroids (described later). However, as with other symptoms, visual problems in MS can also be brought on by fatigue, an increase in temperature, stress, and infection. Managing these symptoms may help to improve any associated visual problems. Full loss of vision, decreased vision, or blurred vision frequently affects only one eye of a person with MS who is experiencing optic neuritis. Colors may appear washed out, and night vision may be particularly difficult. Sensitivity to contrasts in light or the presence of holes ( or “blind spots”) may also occur. Occasionally, optic neuritis will cause pain upon movement of the affected eye. Diplopia, also known as “double vision,” occurs when the muscles that control a particular eye movement are weakened and not coordinated. Although annoying, double vision usually resolves on its own without medical treatment. When diplopia comes on suddenly, it could indicate an acute attack. Less common than diplopia, another disorder stemming from muscle weakness and loss of coordination around the eye is nystagmus. This is the uncontrolled side-to-side (horizontal) or up-and-down (vertical) movements of the eye. It can be asymptomatic (causing no visual problems) or severe enough to disturb vision. Objects may appear to jump or move unpredictably as the two eyes no longer coordinate well with each other. Nystagmus can be more of a nuisance than a major problem and is usually temporary. Some individuals with MS may experience a , a disorder that causes a blind spot to appear in the center of vision. A different disorder, homonymous , occurs rarely, causing vision to be lost on the right or left visual fields of both eyes. Whenever a visual problem arises, an ophthalmologist or neuro-ophthalmologist should be consulted. At times, the doctor may decide that the best treatment is to wait for the inflammation to go down and to see if the visual symptoms disappear on their own, reserving steroid treatment for more severe attacks. If the symptoms are severe, intravenous steroid treatment may be used to reduce the inflammation and accelerate the recovery process. The same steroid treatment used to treat other types of MS relapses is often effective in shortening the duration of visual problems. These are usually given via intravenous injection (IV) for a few days, but steroids may also be given orally. An example of high dose steroids would be 1,000 mg of Solu-Medrol® (IV methylprednisolone). Steroids may be administered two ways. As mentioned, a high dose of Solu-Medrol may be given through intravenous injection (IV), and this is often given daily for three to five days during an attack. Deltasone® (oral prednisone), Decadron® (oral dexamethasone), or Medrol® (oral methylprednisone) in a pill form may also be administered orally for several days after IV treatment, or they may be taken alone without an earlier IV treatment. While these corticosteroids may shorten MS attacks and help one to recover more quickly, no convincing evidence has been shown that corticosteroids can affect the long-term course of MS. Acthar® Gel (ACTH given via injection) is another option for treating MS relapses. Another line of action is through disease-modifying therapies (DMTs). Presently, 10 disease-modifying therapies are FDA-approved for treating the relapsing forms of MS. Several studies have shown that these can reduce the number and severity of attacks, which in turn reduces the development of visual difficulties. Several non-pharmaceutical options are also available to help cope with visual changes. For instance, an eye patch is sometimes used to treat diplopia (double vision) when necessary, such as when driving or reading. An ophthalmologist may also offer additional ideas or treatments for specific visual symptoms. Examples include using yellow lenses to tone down light for those experiencing a light sensitivity, or prisms in eye glasses to redirect the image. In other instances, a patient may find ways to simply adjust – as by turning the head to allow better alignment of the eyes. If visual problems persist, an ophthalmologist who specializes in low vision can help provide low-vision devices that include magnification and computer modifications. He or she can also design a variety of helpful strategies for managing daily activities. Individuals with MS experiencing visual problems are often comforted by the fact that these symptoms are usually temporary. As with other MS symptoms, as noted earlier, please keep in mind that visual problems in MS may also be worsened by stress, fatigue, infection, certain medications, or an increase in temperature. When possible, avoiding situations that could worsen the symptoms of MS will also help to minimize the occurrence of visual issues.

Abstract Symptom-Specific Treatment and Multidisciplinary Care Abstract Symptom-Specific Treatment and Multidisciplinary Care Multiple sclerosis (MS) is the most common permanently disabling disorder of the central nervous system in young adults. Relapsing remitting MS is the most common type, and typical symptoms include sensory disturbances, Lhermitte sign, motor weakness, optic neuritis, impaired coordination, and fatigue. The course of disease is highly variable. The diagnosis is clinical and involves two neurologic deficits or objective attacks separated in time and space. Magnetic resonance imaging is helpful in confirming the diagnosis and excluding mimics. Symptom exacerbations affect 85% of patients with MS. Corticosteroids are the treatment of choice for patients with acute, significant symptoms. Disease-modifying agents should be initiated early in the treatment of MS to forestall disease and preserve function. Two immunomodulatory agents (interferon beta and glatiramer) and five immunosuppressive agents (fingolimod, teriflunomide, dimethyl fumarate, natalizumab, and mitoxantrone) are approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of MS, each with demonstrated effectiveness and unique adverse effect profiles. Symptom management constitutes a large part of care; neurogenic bladder and bowel, sexual dysfunction, pain, spasticity, and fatigue are best treated with a multidisciplinary approach to improve quality of life. Multiple sclerosis (MS) is the most common permanently disabling disorder of the central nervous system (CNS) in young adults. The prevalence varies by geographic region, ranging from 110 cases per 100,000 persons in the northern United States to 47 per 100,000 in the southern United States. Women, smokers, and persons residing at higher latitudes or with a family history of MS are at increased risk of disease. Those with increased exposure to sunlight and higher 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels are at decreased risk. Total costs associated with MS may exceed $50,000 per person annually.  Enlarge     Print Multiple sclerosis is a clinical diagnosis requiring two neurologic deficits or objective attacks separated in time and space.

For information about the SORT evidence rating system, go to Abstract Symptom-Specific Treatment and Multidisciplinary Care The most common type of MS is relapsing remitting MS . In the acute attack, T cells, B cells, and macrophages interact with adhesion molecules on blood vessel surfaces to traverse a blood-brain barrier weakened by matrix metalloproteinases. Once through, T cells and B cells release inflammatory mediators and immunoglobulins targeting the myelin sheath, while macrophages expose axonal surfaces and release harmful nitrous oxygen and oxygen free radicals. This cascade of events leads to demyelination and axonal injury.  Enlarge     Print Discrete attacks that evolve over days to weeks, followed by some degree of recovery over weeks to months; the patient has no worsening of neurologic function between attacks Initial relapsing remitting disease, followed by gradual neurologic deterioration not associated with acute attacks Primary progressive and progressive relapsing (10% of cases) Characterized by steady functional decline from disease onset; these types cannot be distinguished during early stages until attacks occur (progressive relapsing) or fail to occur (primary progressive); progressive relapsing is rarer than primary progressive *—Develops in about 50% of patients with relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis.

Abstract Symptom-Specific Treatment and Multidisciplinary Care Typical symptoms of MS include sensory disturbances, motor weakness, optic neuritis (monocular visual impairment with pain), Lhermitte sign (electrical sensation down the spine on neck flexion), fatigue, and impaired coordination.

CNS pathologies to consider include other inflammatory, demyelinating, or degenerative diseases; infections; neoplasms; and migraines. Genetic diseases, nutritional deficiencies, and psychiatric diseases may also present in a manner similar to MS. The diagnosis of MS should be questioned in the presence of abrupt/transient symptoms, prominent cortical features (seizures, aphasia), peripheral neuropathy, and other organ (cardiac, hematologic) involvement, because these are not typical of MS.  Enlarge     Print Conditions Potentially Confused with Multiple Sclerosis Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy Human immunodeficiency virus infection, Lyme disease, mycoplasma, syphilis Behçet syndrome, sarcoidosis, Sjögren syndrome, systemic lupus erythematosus Arteriovenous malformation, herniated disk, neoplasm Cerebrovascular accident, diabetes mellitus, hypertensive disease, migraine, vasculitis Alcohol, cocaine, isoniazid, lithium, penicillin, phenytoin (Dilantin) Folate deficiency, vitamin B deficiency, vitamin E deficiency Conditions Potentially Confused with Multiple Sclerosis Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy Human immunodeficiency virus infection, Lyme disease, mycoplasma, syphilis Behçet syndrome, sarcoidosis, Sjögren syndrome, systemic lupus erythematosus Arteriovenous malformation, herniated disk, neoplasm Cerebrovascular accident, diabetes mellitus, hypertensive disease, migraine, vasculitis Alcohol, cocaine, isoniazid, lithium, penicillin, phenytoin (Dilantin) Folate deficiency, vitamin B deficiency, vitamin E deficiency Abstract Symptom-Specific Treatment and Multidisciplinary Care MS is a clinical diagnosis.

In addition to MRI, evoked potentials (visual, auditory, and somatosensory) may provide objective evidence of deficits consistent with MS. Visual evoked potentials are especially helpful for persons with vision-related symptoms. Cerebrospinal fluid may be obtained, although this is not routinely recommended; analysis typically demonstrates oligoclonal bands and an increased immunoglobulin G concentration. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis is more useful in ruling out MS mimics and in diagnosing primary progressive MS than in diagnosing relapsing remitting MS.  Serologic testing is performed to exclude other diseases .  Enlarge     Print Serologic Tests to Rule Out Conditions That Mimic Multiple Sclerosis Rheumatologic disease, systemic lupus erythematosus Performed when appropriate to the clinical situation Autoantibody assays* (e.g., antineutrophil cytoplasmic, anticardiolipin, antiphospholipid, anti–SS-A, and anti–SS-B antibodies) Behçet syndrome, Sjögren syndrome, systemic lupus erythematosus, vasculitis *—These tests are commonly ordered by neurologists on initial consultation.

Abstract Symptom-Specific Treatment and Multidisciplinary Care Exacerbations affect 85% of patients with MS; infections and stress may play a role. For those with significant, acute symptoms, corticosteroids are the treatment of choice and have strong evidence of benefit. Although parenteral steroids build up to peak concentrations faster than oral preparations, a Cochrane review indicates no difference in effectiveness (as measured by clinical or radiologic markers) or safety between oral and parenteral preparations. If the disease is unresponsive to steroids, plasmapheresis may be performed. Plasma exchanges are relatively well tolerated and are usually performed every other day for 14 days. Abstract Symptom-Specific Treatment and Multidisciplinary Care The goal of disease-modifying therapy is to forestall disease, preserve function, and sustain healthy immune function while suppressing the T-cell autoimmune cascade thought to be responsible for demyelination and axonal damage. Early treatment at or before the diagnosis of clinically confirmed MS may delay damage to the CNS.  The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved seven agents for the treatment of MS: interferon beta, glatiramer (Copaxone), fingolimod (Gilenya), teriflunomide (Aubagio), dimethyl fumarate (Tecfidera), natalizumab (Tysabri), and mitoxantrone . Because of the chronic nature and evolving treatment of MS, disease-modifying treatment is typically managed by a neurologist with expertise in prescribing these potentially toxic agents.  Enlarge     Print Disease-Modifying Agents for Relapsing Remitting Multiple Sclerosis Injection site reactions (e.g., edema, inflammation, pain); influenza-like symptoms; leukopenia; elevated liver enzyme levels; depression and suicidal thoughts (increased with preexisting depression, neutralizing antibodies) Decrease in progression: RR = 0.69; (0.55 to 0.87) Injection site reactions, facial flushing, chest tightness, palpitations Decrease in disability at two years: MD = 0.33; (0.08 to 0.58) Annualized relapse rate vs. placebo: 0.18 vs. 0.40 Bradycardia (contraindicated in recent heart disease or arrhythmia); elevated liver enzyme levels Decrease in progression at two years: HR = 0.70; (0.55 to 0.87) Melanoma, macular edema, herpes encephalitis (only occurs at higher doses) Annualized relapse rate vs. placebo: 0.37 vs. 0.54 Alopecia, diarrhea, nausea, decreased white blood cell count, elevated liver enzyme levels, peripheral neuropathy Decrease in progression: HR = 0.76; (0.51 to 0.97) Annualized relapse rate vs. placebo: 0.17 vs. 0.36 Flushing, abdominal pain, lymphocytopenia, elevated liver enzyme levels Decrease in progression: HR = 0.62; (0.44 to 0.87) Infusion reactions, headache, fatigue, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy Decrease in progression at two years: RR = 0.74; (0.62 to 0.89) Myelosuppression, elevated liver enzyme levels, decreased cardiac function, leukemia Decrease in progression: OR = 0.30; (0.09 to 0.99) HR = hazard ratio; MD = mean difference; OR = odds ratio; RR = relative risk. *—Estimated retail price of treatment for one year based on information obtained at .

Interferon beta, an immunomodulatory agent with more than 20 years of safety data, is effective in decreasing exacerbations and the progression of relapsing remitting MS. Interferon beta is available in three injectable formulations. Common adverse effects include local reactions and influenza-like symptoms. Interferon treatment may be associated with suicidal thoughts, so other agents should be considered in patients with depression. Glatiramer is an alternative immunomodulatory daily injection for relapsing remitting MS with a good safety record. Glatiramer decreases relapse and progression of disability at two years. Common adverse effects include local and systemic injection reactions (e.g., chest tightness, palpitations). Glatiramer should be avoided in persons with known hypersensitivity to this agent. Fingolimod is the first oral agent that is FDA approved for disease modification in relapsing remitting MS. A study of 1,272 patients between 18 and 55 years of age with relapsing remitting MS compared fingolimod with placebo, and demonstrated a decrease in annual exacerbations and progression of disease at two years. Bradycardia is a known adverse effect; patients should be observed for six hours after taking their first dose, and the medication is contraindicated in those with recent heart disease or arrhythmia. The FDA has approved two additional oral agents. Teriflunomide, approved in September 2012, has been shown to decrease relapse rates compared with placebo. Adverse effects include elevated transaminase levels, alopecia, and diarrhea. Teriflunomide carries an FDA warning for hepatic toxicity. Dimethyl fumarate, approved in March 2013, has been shown to decrease relapses and disease progression. Adverse effects include flushing, abdominal pain, decreased lymphocyte counts, and elevated transaminase levels. All of these oral agents suppress the immune system and put patients at risk of opportunistic infections. Because of this, these agents are typically used when the disease does not respond to, or the patient is unable to tolerate, an immunomodulatory agent. Natalizumab and mitoxantrone are immunosuppressive agents reserved for disease that does not respond to first-line agents. Although both are effective, natalizumab carries an FDA warning for progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, and mitoxantrone carries a warning for cardiotoxicity. Ongoing trials are evaluating the effectiveness and safety of additional agents in the treatment of MS to include the injectable daclizumab and oral cladribine and siponimod. Symptom-Specific Treatment and Multidisciplinary Care Abstract Symptom-Specific Treatment and Multidisciplinary Care Multidisciplinary treatment of primary and associated symptoms is essential in enhancing the quality of life in younger and older patients with MS. More than 70% of patients with MS have urinary tract dysfunction, with 10% demonstrating urinary symptoms at initial diagnosis. Urinary dysfunction can be classified as failure to store or empty, and can be differentiated with postvoid residual testing. Failure-to-store symptoms are typically treated with anticholinergic medications, although patients should be cautioned about adverse effects, such as dry mouth and confusion. Nocturia may respond to limited evening fluid intake or intranasal desmopressin; if desmopressin is prescribed, patients should be cautioned about the potential for hyponatremia. Injectable onabotulinumtoxinA (Botox) may be used if symptoms do not respond to these agents. Failure-to-empty symptoms are treated with clean intermittent catheterization, although some may respond to an alpha adrenergic blocker. Up to 75% of patients with MS experience constipation, incontinence, or both. Treatment should include dietary fiber, bulk-forming agents, and adequate hydration. Rectal stimulants, stool softeners, and enemas may be used if needed. Colostomy is an option for patients with intolerable symptoms. About 50% to 90% of men and 40% to 85% of women with MS have some type of sexual dysfunction. Although sexual dysfunction may have a considerable negative impact on quality of life, it is often unaddressed. Men are primarily treated with peripherally acting phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors. There is no established pharmacologic agent for women. Collaboration with a sex therapist or couples counselor may be beneficial. Approximately 85% of patients with MS report pain during the course of their illness. Those with pain report poorer health and poorer psychological functioning. Trigeminal neuralgia and dysesthetic (neuropathic) limb pain are common. Trigeminal neuralgia is initially treated with carbamazepine (Tegretol) and baclofen (Lioresal), as it is in persons without MS. Neuropathic pain in MS may be treated with tricyclic antidepressants, anticonvulsants, and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. Hydrotherapy has also been shown to be helpful in pain management, and is beneficial for the spasticity associated with MS. Cannabinoid therapy may be helpful for pain symptoms. It is estimated that 70% to 80% of patients with MS experience muscle spasticity. These symptoms are best treated with a multidisciplinary approach, incorporating modalities such as physical, occupational, and electromagnetic therapy. Baclofen is a first-line agent and works by decreasing alpha motor neuron activity. Oral baclofen has a short half-life and is associated with daytime sedation and muscle weakness. Intrathecal baclofen can be used to avoid daytime sedation, although muscle weakness may still occur. Diazepam (Valium) and gabapentin (Neurontin) may be used alone or in conjunction with baclofen. OnabotulinumtoxinA, with or without concomitant physical therapy, may also be helpful. Although cannabinoid therapy has been used for spasticity, the evidence for its effectiveness is mixed. The American Academy of Neurology states that patients should be counseled that these agents are probably ineffective for objective spasticity. More than 90% of patients with MS report fatigue; one-third report it to be their most troubling symptom, and many present with it. Although fatigue may occur as a result of comorbid depression, it also may appear independently. Fatigue has profound impacts on quality of life and is a leading cause of disability claims. Treatment for fatigue is multifocal. After evaluating for comorbid causes of fatigue (e.g., sleep disorders, thyroid disease, vitamin B deficiency, anemia), environmental manipulation, such as controlling heat and humidity levels, may help prevent flare-ups. Energy conservation measures such as napping and the use of assistive devices for mobility may be recommended based on the individual patient. Amantadine has been used off label in a limited number of trials and has been found to be beneficial for fatigue, although it is associated with insomnia and confusion. Other medications, such as modafinil (Provigil), have been tried with mixed results, and are not FDA approved for patients with MS. Abstract Symptom-Specific Treatment and Multidisciplinary Care The prevalence of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus, and other vascular comorbidities in patients with MS is similar to that in the general population. The presence of these conditions may worsen the course of MS. In addition to using targeted MS and symptom-modifying therapies, physicians should also manage these comorbidities. Surveys show that more than 50% of patients with MS seek treatments such as acupuncture, chiropractic manipulations, massage, yoga, and herbal therapies.  Physicians should ask patients if they are using integrative treatments, and should be prepared to help them find quality information on the risks and benefits of the treatments they choose. provides information and resources on traditional and integrative treatments for MS.  Enlarge     Print Multiple Sclerosis Resources for Patients and Physicians Cleveland Clinic: Mellen Center for Multiple Sclerosis General information: http://my.clevelandclinic.org/multiple_sclerosis_center/default.aspx Information on integrative therapies: http://my.clevelandclinic.org/Documents/Multiple_sclerosis_center/4%20Alternative%20and%20Complementary%20Therapies%20for%20MS.pdf http://my.clevelandclinic.org/Documents/Multiple_sclerosis_center/integrative-medicine.pdf Information on integrative therapies: Information on integrative therapies: General and integrative medicine information: http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/multiplesclerosis.html General information: Information on integrative therapies: http://www.nationalmssociety.org/Treating-MS/Complementary-Alternative-Medicines Multiple Sclerosis Resources for Patients and Physicians Cleveland Clinic: Mellen Center for Multiple Sclerosis General information: http://my.clevelandclinic.org/multiple_sclerosis_center/default.aspx Information on integrative therapies: http://my.clevelandclinic.org/Documents/Multiple_sclerosis_center/4%20Alternative%20and%20Complementary%20Therapies%20for%20MS.pdf http://my.clevelandclinic.org/Documents/Multiple_sclerosis_center/integrative-medicine.pdf Information on integrative therapies: Information on integrative therapies: General and integrative medicine information: http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/multiplesclerosis.html General information: Information on integrative therapies: http://www.nationalmssociety.org/Treating-MS/Complementary-Alternative-Medicines : A PubMed search was completed using the keyword and medical subject heading multiple sclerosis.

cab3d81b-683b-4ad2-95c4-00c2b349450f,"How to S.E.A.R.C.H.™ for the Right MS Therapy for You! Once a DMT is initiated, evidence suggests that treatment needs to be ongoing for benefits to persist. Non-adherence and gaps in treatment have been associated with an increased rate of relapses and progression of disability. Rather than discontinuing the medication, it is essential for individuals to talk with their doctor about recent changes in their MS and explore options to make adjustments with their current medication or switch to another DMT. The SEARCH model can be helpful in recalculating a treatment decision. MSAA also recognizes that adhering to an MS medication can present certain challenges over time, which may cause people to limit or discontinue prescribed usage. Fortunately, many of these challenges can be managed to help keep you on course with your therapy. Some helpful strategies include: Each of the approved treatments has side effects that are usually manageable. Initial side effects to some of the DMTs include headache and flu-like symptoms. These often dissipate after several weeks and can be easily managed with over-the-counter medications. Individuals using injectable medications can manage pain or skin reactions at the injection site by icing the area, rotating injection sites, taking over-the-counter pain relievers, and using an auto injector. For individuals taking an oral medication, common side effects include headache, nausea, and diarrhea. These are usually mild, dissipate over time, and can often be managed by taking over-the-counter medications, as prescribed by your doctor. Taking an oral DMT while having a full stomach may also assist with reducing side effects, if advised by your doctor. Individuals must allow six months to one year for their prescribed medication to have an effect on their disease course. This also necessitates that patients are taking their medication as prescribed on a consistent basis and not skipping or altering doses. People often think that in order for the medication to be working they must “see” results. In fact, the opposite is true for MS. It is important to realize that if patients are not seeing an increase in relapses and/or not experiencing additional symptoms, then, most likely, their DMT is effectively treating their MS. However, individuals need to consult their neurologist and/or healthcare team to help determine the success of their current long-term treatment. Even with the best intentions, people can forget to take their medication. A few simple suggestions to help remember include setting a schedule and abiding to it as much as possible, utilizing memory aids such as print and electronic calendars and reminder notes, recording your dosage in a journal or mobile phone app such as , and involving family members in the treatment plan. In addition to forgetfulness, fear or anxiety related to injections has often been a concern shared by the MS community. Receiving proper training from a healthcare professional on administering the injection and using an auto injector are effective strategies in building self-confidence and reducing fear. The effectiveness of any disease-modifying therapy for MS can vary greatly from person-to-person and even change within the same individual as the disease progresses over time. All DMT’s have potential risks and some of the newer therapies require tests before and during treatment to help determine if the medication would be considered an appropriate option for the individual, and whether or not he or she can manage the potential side effects. It is important for individuals with MS to work together with their neurologist to explore new treatment options and remain committed to finding a therapy that works for them. Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a neurological disorder affecting the nerves of the , which consists of the brain, optic nerves, and spinal cord. Most individuals with MS experience their first symptoms as a young adult and are often diagnosed in the prime of their life. Although MS is not contagious, a cause and cure have yet to be discovered. As discussed later in this booklet, several effective treatment choices are available for most individuals with MS to help reduce disease activity. Caucasians have the greatest incidence of MS and about three times as many women are diagnosed with MS than men. MS does not usually occur with populations living in warm areas near the equator; in general, the further people live from the equator (north or south), the greater their risk of developing the disease. With MS, nerve fibers (or ““) and their fatty-rich protective covering (known as ““) become damaged. As a result, nerve impulses along these nerve fibers are interrupted; causing the symptoms of MS. MS is believed to be an , where the body’s own immune system is sending disease-fighting cells to destroy specific elements within the body. Examples of other autoimmune diseases include lupus and rheumatoid arthritis. The symptoms of MS include a wide range of physical, mental, and emotional difficulties. Examples include: visual problems, spasticity (spasms and tightening of muscles), weakness, tremor, numbness, and dizziness; bladder, bowel, and sexual dysfunction; mobility issues; chronic, aching pain; fatigue, depression, and memory problems. On average, 80 percent of people with MS begin with the . This type of MS has temporary symptom flare-ups or “relapses” (also referred to as exacerbations, attacks, or bouts), which may last from a few days to a few months. These are followed by a complete or partial recovery (““). Women are more likely to be diagnosed with RRMS than men. Between relapses, many people may go into remission for a year or more. During this time, they may remain symptom-free, or only experience mild changes with symptoms that did not fully remit following the exacerbation. This remission can be deceptive, however, because of the aspect of MS. While symptoms may not appear or worsen between MS attacks, changes do continue within the CNS. (areas of inflammation along the nerves in the brain and spinal cord) can flare up within the CNS at least 10 times as often as clinical attacks (those with visible symptoms). If untreated, more than 90 percent of individuals with RRMS may eventually enter a second phase of RRMS, known as , within 25 years of their diagnosis. This phase is reached when an individual experiences a progressive worsening of symptoms. SPMS may occur with or without superimposed relapses. While approximately 80 percent of individuals with MS are initially diagnosed with RRMS, the majority of the other 20 percent are diagnosed with . This form of MS presents a gradual but steady accumulation of neurological problems from the onset, without the presence of relapses and remissions. Unlike RRMS, PPMS is equally divided between the genders. Other types of MS exist, but these are not as common. These include (with little or no change after 20 years), (PRMS) (a progressive course from the onset with acute relapses), and or (a rapidly progressive disease course). What drugs are approved for the long-term treatment of MS? At the time of this publication, have been approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA), each shown to help slow disease activity for individuals with relapsing forms of MS. Since inflammation appears to be a major component in the relapsing forms of MS, these treatments are believed to reduce the inflammation within the CNS, thereby reducing the number and severity of active lesions (and also reducing the number of clinically silent flare-ups). Other immunological changes are also thought to occur with these disease-modifying therapies (DMTs). Many experts now recommend treatment as early as possible with one of these approved DMTs. Research has shown that treating after the first attack can significantly delay the amount of time to the second attack. Early treatment is also thought to possibly limit axonal (nerve) injury, which may be irreversible, and later lead to a progressive form of MS. The 13 FDA-approved, long-term disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) for MS (as of the printing of this booklet) are listed on pages 8 through 11. An individual with MS is usually prescribed only one of these medications during any one time period, although trials with combinations of these treatments are being conducted. When switching from one therapy to another, doctors will often allow time between treatments for the former medication to be completely out of one’s system. This is known as a “wash-out” period. Results from several large clinical trials have found that all of these medications reduce the number and severity of relapses, as well as the development of new areas of inflammation as seen on MRI. These studies also showed some evidence of delaying disease progression. Similar to most any medication, these DMTs are accompanied by certain side effects and/or adverse events, most of which may be managed or avoided through various precautionary actions. For instance, the interferons may cause flu-like symptoms and injection-site reactions, especially when first starting the such as smaller needles and gradually increasing from a small dose to the full dose (dose titration), can greatly help to avoid the potential side effects mentioned. Liver function is also monitored while taking an interferon. Injection-site reactions can occur with Copaxone, and for a small percentage of patients, a brief systemic reaction (such as flushing, dizziness, palpations, and/or shortness of breath) may occur following an injection. Novantrone poses additional risks to the heart and for developing leukemia. For this reason, this medication is typically reserved for severe cases of MS that are not responding to any of the other DMTs. To avoid these adverse events, Novantrone may not be taken for more than two to three years. Approximately 0.1 percent (or one in one thousand) of patients taking Tysabri develop a condition known as progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), which is a potentially fatal brain infection with the JC virus (JCV), in people with weakened immune systems. About 55 percent of individuals with MS have this virus, which normally stays dormant, unless a suppressed immune system allows it to become activated. New guidelines to minimize the risk have been identified, and safety monitoring programs have been put in place for early detection and treatment, as well as to track any occurrences of this condition. A new blood test shows if a person has been exposed to the JC virus and if he or she could be at risk of developing PML if taking Tysabri. Gilenya may cause certain heart-related issues when first starting the medication. For this reason, patients are screened in advance for heart problems and are monitored during the first six to 24 hours following the initial treatment at a treatment center. Please note that all of these MS medications have been approved by the FDA. This agency has determined that the benefits of these medications outweigh any risks – many of which are rare. Other side effects (not listed in this booklet) may occur with these drugs. For more information on potential benefits and risks, individuals are advised to speak with their physician.

bf8eed9b-2548-46ba-9838-d06b4bfde7ae,"Complementary & Alternative Medicines Find Programs & Services in Your Area COVID-19 Vaccine Guidance for People Living with MS     SPMS follows an initial relapsing-remitting course. Some people who are diagnosed with RRMS will eventually transition to a secondary progressive course in which there is a progressive worsening of neurologic function (accumulation of disability) over time. SPMS can be further characterized as either (with relapses and/or evidence of new MRI activity during a specified period of time) or, as well as  (evidence of disability accrual over time, with or without relapses or new MRI activity) or . This graphic shows the kinds of disease activity that can occur in SPMS; however each person's experience with SPMS will be unique. Following a period of relapsing-remitting disease, disability gradually increases over time, with or without evidence of disease activity (relapses or changes on MRI). In SPMS, occasional relapses may occur, as well as periods of stability. Disease activity and progression should be evaluated at least yearly by neurologic examination and MRI. Being able to characterize the course of your disease at different points in time helps you and your MS care provider discuss your treatment options and expected outcomes.  For example:   If you have SPMS that is active, you and your MS care provider will want to talk about treatment with a disease-modifying therapy to reduce the risk of a relapse. If you have SPMS that is active and progressing despite the medication you are taking, the conversation with your MS care provider might be about the potential benefits and risks associated with switching to a more aggressive treatment strategy. If your SPMS is not active but there is evidence of progression and accumulation of disability, you and your MS care provider will want to focus on rehabilitation strategies to help improve your function and mobility, and promote safety and independence. If your SPMS is stable without activity or progression, the conversation with your MS care provider could focus on rehabilitation and other symptom management strategies to help you maintain function. How does SPMS differ from the other disease courses? SPMS occurs in people who initially had a relapsing-remitting disease course. In other words, SPMS occurs as a second phase of the disease for many individuals. In SPMS, people may or may not continue to experience relapses caused by inflammation; the disease gradually changes from the inflammatory process seen in RRMS to a more steadily progressive phase characterized by nerve damage or loss. Read more about strategies to help you lead a full life with secondary progressive MS. Prior to the availability of the approved disease-modifying therapies, studies indicated that 50 percent of those diagnosed with relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) would transition to secondary-progressive MS (SPMS) within 10 years, and 90 percent would transition within 25 years. While MS experts agree that the medications have an impact on disease progression, it is too soon to tell the extent to which the disease-modifying treatments alter or delay the transition to SPMS. The National MS Society is pursuing all promising research paths and collaborating worldwide to drive progress in research in progressive MS, for which few therapies exist.

83099e81-7d36-465e-827d-ad5cb119c360,"Multiple Sclerosis Relapses Don’t Necessarily Occur After Pregnancy In a new study, researchers say there was no significant increase in relapse rate after childbirth for women with MS. Pregnancy may not cause multiple sclerosis (MS) to worsen as previously thought. For the past 20 years, women with MS were told that while pregnancy might help , those relapses often got worse after childbirth. However, researchers say in a that they discovered the disease didn’t show increased relapse activity after a woman has given birth. The research team was headed by , a clinical assistant professor of neurology at the University of Southern California (USC) Keck School of Medicine as well as an affiliated investigator in neurology with Kaiser Permanente Research. “This is a super interesting study,” , PhD, executive vice president of research at the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, told Healthline. “We have had this dogma for a long time,” said Bebo. “Women with MS showed an exacerbated rate of relapses after pregnancy, but Dr. Langer-Gould questioned this and found in this preliminary study a different result.” Previous studies occurred before current disease-modifying treatments.There are now approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Almost in the United States are estimated to be living with MS. Of these, about are women. The objective of the recent study was to investigate what happens to women with MS after giving birth. Researchers looked at the risk of relapses and identified potentially modifiable risk factors. This population study looked at 466 pregnancies from 375 women in the years 2008 to 2016. The records were taken from the Kaiser Permanente Southern and Northern California databases. The participants were surveyed about treatments, breastfeeding, and relapses. “This study provides an important update on previous data, which had indicated that women with MS were more likely to have a relapse in the first three to six months postpartum, with that risk being higher for patients with more active disease before pregnancy,” , professor of clinical neurology at the David Geffen School of Medicine at the University of California Los Angeles (UCLA) and clinical director of the UCLA MS program, told Healthline. Of the women in the study, 38 percent weren’t on any treatment in the year prior to conception, while 15 percent had clinically isolated syndrome and 8 percent relapsed during pregnancy. No increase in relapses postpartum were observed, although the authors point out that some of the women had only had a single episode. About one-third of the women breastfed exclusively, which seemed to reduce the relapse rate. “This is good news for women with MS who wish to have children, and larger population-based studies of this type are encouraged,” noted Giesser. Immune mechanisms are triggered during pregnancy to keep a woman’s body from rejecting the fetus. This mechanism is also responsible for suppressing the immune system responsible for MS relapses. “These results are exciting, as MS is more common among women of childbearing age than in any other group,” Langer-Gould said in a . “This shows us that women with MS today can have children, breastfeed, and resume their treatment without experiencing an increased risk of relapses during the postpartum period,” she added. “The results are somewhat preliminary and not definitive,” noted Bebo. “But it provides an important piece of information that adds to our knowledge for MS and pregnancy, before and after.” The authors report the lack of rebound disease activity in the early postpartum period is likely due to a combination of the participants in a population-based setting, inclusion of women diagnosed after a single relapse, and high rates of breastfeeding. “There were not a lot of people in the study that were on the stronger DMTs, so it may be skewed to a more calm version of disease,” cautioned Bebo, “There wasn’t a lot of exacerbation postpartum.” “We do not know how certain DMTs will affect pregnancy,” Bebo said. He emphasized the importance of pregnant women with MS contacting their healthcare provider as soon as possible to us a shared-decision approach to treatment. “People should have all the information in making family decisions, and this is something that can help,” said Bebo. “This information is helpful, but everyone needs to evaluate their own circumstance with their healthcare provider to make informed decisions on how to proceed.” Editor’s note: Caroline Craven is a patient expert living with MS.

People who were previously diagnosed with are now considered to have (either active or not active). RRMS is the most common form of MS. As many as receive an initial diagnosis of RRMS. RRMS is characterized by or attacks of inflammation in the . These flare-ups are followed by remission periods with improved or completely resolved symptoms. People who’ve been living with RRMS for 10 years gradually develop SPMS. RRMS symptoms come on suddenly and include episodes of: There are several disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) available to treat RRMS. Many of these can also be used to treat SPMS in people who experience relapses. PPMS is characterized by a steady worsening of neurologic function without distinct attacks or remission periods. This type of MS involves considerably less of the type of inflammation seen in RRMS, resulting in fewer lesions and more lesions. is the only medication currently approved by the for treating PPMS. are ongoing to find more treatments specifically for PPMS. The following are some of the key differences between RRMS and PPMS: RRMS is diagnosed earlier. Most people are diagnosed with RRMS in their 20s and 30s.PPMS is diagnosed later. Most people are diagnosed with PPMS in their 40s and 50s. People with RRMS tend to have more brain lesions with more inflammatory cells.Those with PPMS tend to have more spinal cord lesions and fewer inflammatory cells. RRMS affects women two to three times more often than men. People with RRMS will likely have mobility issues, but these issues are more gradual.People with PPMS often experience more mobility issues and have more trouble walking. In general, PPMS tends to affect the body’s ability to function more than RRMS does. For example, those with PPMS may also find it more difficult to continue working because of their mobility issues and declining neurologic function. As far as symptoms go, RRMS and PPMS are oftentimes very different from each other. People with RRMS enter periods of flare-ups and remission, while those with PPMS are in a continual phase of deterioration. However, has shown through that they have certain characteristics in common. This includes the amount of and the appearance of their brain lesions. More research is still needed to see if there are other links between RRMS and PPMS.

The specific symptoms experienced depend on which area of the spinal cord is affected and can include muscle weakness, abnormal sensations in the arms and legs, bladder and bowel problems or L’hermitte’s symptom, described as an electric shock sensation on movement of the neck. Onset may be sudden or develop over a period of hours to days; symptoms include blurred vision vision loss (usually in only one eye), pain behind the eye, decreased color vision or blind spots. Symptoms can include nausea, vomiting, double vision, dizziness, hearing loss and unsteady walking. It is important to contact a neurologist if you are experiencing the symptoms listed above. The neurologist will want to determine if the cause of your symptoms is a condition that should be treated immediately. If it is determined that you do have CIS, your neurologist will be able to help you understand the probability of your condition progressing to MS. In diagnosing CIS, it is important to rule out other potential causes as some may require immediate intervention.

d194e8df-120f-43fa-aaf0-589d65a9dcf9,"— — Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a condition that damages nerve cells in your central nervous system (CNS). Your CNS is composed of your brain, spinal cord, and optic nerves. causes symptoms that gradually get worse, as well as symptoms that come on suddenly after a period of being controlled. This sudden appearance of symptoms is called a . There’s for MS, and the damage it causes can’t be reversed. However, certain medications can help you manage the condition. Condition management focuses on medication that can treat relapses, as well as modify the disease to reduce damage and disability. It also involves other drugs that treat the symptoms or complications of MS. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved the following drugs for the treatment of multiple sclerosis (MS): cladribine (Mavenclad), dimethyl fumarate (Tecfidera), diroximel fumarate (Vumerity), fingolimod (Gilenya), monomethyl fumarate (Bafiertam), ozanimod (Zeposia), siponimod (Mayzent), teriflunomide (Aubagio) interferon beta-1a (Avonex, Rebif), interferon beta-1b (Betaseron, Extavia), glatiramer acetate (Copaxone, Glatopa), peginterferon beta-1a (Plegridy) alemtuzumab (Lemtrada), mitoxantrone hydrochloride, natalizumab (Tysabri), ocrelizumab (Ocrevus) There are several types of that work to help change the course of MS. The length of treatment with these medications can range from a few months to years, depending on how effective the medications are for you. Your may recommend switching between these drugs throughout the course of your treatment. This will depend on how effectively each drug manages your disease and how you tolerate the side effects. If you switch to a different DMT, your doctor will take note of whether you develop new . The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved 12 MS medications that are administered by injection or infusion. They help modify relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) and secondary progressive MS (SPMS) in cases of active disease — that is, a relapse has occurred or new lesions have appeared on an MRI scan. They also treat clinically isolated syndrome (CIS), a one-off episode of neurological symptoms. CIS can progress to MS and is sometimes categorized as a type of MS. These drugs are made up of proteins that keep certain from entering your brain and spinal cord. These WBCs are thought to that forms a protective coating over your nerve fibers. Therefore, preventing these WBCs from moving into your brain and spinal cord can help slow their damage and reduce the number of relapses you have. You inject these drugs yourself. Your healthcare provider will show you how to do this. The number of injections depends on the drug: Glatiramer acetate (Copaxone) is a manufactured substance that resembles a basic protein of natural myelin. It’s thought to work by prompting the WBCs to attack the substance instead of the myelin cells. It’s used to treat RRMS and SPMS in cases of active disease — that is, a relapse has occurred or new lesions have appeared on an MRI scan. It can also treat CIS. You inject this drug yourself once per day or three times per week, depending on your dosage. Your healthcare provider will show you how. People who receive injections three times per week should ensure that at least 48 hours elapses between their injections. The FDA has also approved Glatopa, a generic form of Copaxone. Natalizumab (Tysabri) is an antibody that may block damaged T lymphocytes from moving into your brain and spinal cord. It’s used to treat RRMS and SPMS in cases of active disease — that is, a relapse has occurred or new lesions have appeared on an MRI scan. It can also treat CIS. A healthcare provider gives you this drug as an intravenous (IV) infusion. The infusion takes about an hour, and you’ll get it every 4 weeks. Mitoxantrone hydrochloride was originally used to treat cancer. Now it’s also prescribed to treat people with MS. It suppresses the immune system cells that are thought to attack myelin cells. This medication is only available as a generic drug. It’s used to treat SPMS or worsening RRMS in instances where other drugs haven’t worked. It has a high risk of serious side effects, so it’s only appropriate for people with these more severe forms of MS. A healthcare provider gives you this drug as a short IV infusion once every 3 months. The infusion should only take 5 to 15 minutes. Alemtuzumab (Lemtrada) is approved for people with relapsing forms of MS, including RRMS and active SPMS. It’s intended for people who’ve tried at least two other MS medications but found that treatment was unsuccessful or caused intolerable side effects. It works by reducing the number of specific B and T lymphocytes in your body. This action may decrease the inflammation of and damage to nerve cells. Alemtuzumab is given as a 4-hour IV infusion. To start, you receive this drug once per day for 5 days. Then 12 months after your first treatment course, you receive it once per day for 3 more days. Ocrelizumab (Ocrevus) is the newest infusion treatment for MS. It was approved by the FDA in 2017. It’s the first drug used to treat primary progressive MS (PPMS). It’s also used to treat CIS and relapsing forms of MS. Ocrelizumab appears to work by targeting and ultimately reducing the number of B lymphocytes. B lymphocytes are responsible for damage and repair of the myelin sheath. Ocrelizumab is given as an IV infusion. To begin, you’ll receive it in two 300-milligram (mg) infusions, separated by 2 weeks. After that, you’ll receive it in 600-mg infusions every 6 months. You’ll also receive a corticosteroid and an on the day of each infusion to reduce the risk of reaction to the medication. Ofatumumab (Kesimpta) was approved by the FDA in August 2020 and is the newest treatment for MS. It’s used to treat RRMS and SPMS in cases of active disease — that is, a relapse has occurred or new lesions have appeared on an MRI scan. It can also treat CIS. Like ocrelizumab (Ocrevus), it also works by targeting harmful B lymphocytes and reducing their overall number. Ofatumumab is given as an injection once per week for the first 3 weeks. After a 1-week break, the drug is given as a monthly injection. The FDA has approved eight oral medications for the treatment of MS. Fingolimod (Gilenya) comes as an oral capsule that you take once per day. It was the first oral medication approved by the FDA to treat RRMS. It’s also used to treat CIS and active SPMS. Fingolimod causes the damaging WBCs to remain within your lymph nodes. This reduces the chance that they’ll enter your brain or spinal cord and cause damage. Teriflunomide (Aubagio) is an oral tablet that you take once per day. It’s used to treat RRMS and SPMS in cases of active disease — that is, a relapse has occurred or new lesions have appeared on an MRI scan. It can also treat CIS. Teriflunomide works by blocking an enzyme that’s needed by the damaging WBCs. As a result, teriflunomide helps decrease the number of these cells, which reduces the damage they can inflict. Dimethyl fumarate (Tecfidera) is an oral capsule that you take twice per day. It’s used to treat RRMS and SPMS in cases of active disease — that is, a relapse has occurred or new lesions have appeared on an MRI scan. It can also treat CIS. It appears to work by interfering with the activity of certain immune system cells and chemicals to reduce the risk of MS relapse. It may also have antioxidant properties that help protect against brain and spinal cord damage. Monomethyl fumarate (Bafiertam) is an oral capsule that you take twice per day. It’s the newest oral drug on the market, having been approved by the FDA in April 2020. It’s used to treat RRMS and SPMS in cases of active disease — that is, a relapse has occurred or new lesions have appeared on an MRI scan. It can also treat CIS. Monomethyl fumarate is a bioequivalent of dimethyl fumarate (Tecfidera). Like dimethyl fumarate, monomethyl fumarate may have antioxidant properties and appears to work by interfering with the activity of certain immune system cells and chemicals. Cladribine (Mavenclad) is a pill that you take for a total of 16 or 20 days over the course of 2 years. You’ll have treatment for 2 weeks per year, with each one lasting 4 or 5 days. There’s a 1-month break in between the 2 weeks of treatment. It’s approved for people with relapsing forms of MS, including RRMS and active SPMS. It’s intended for people who’ve tried at least one other MS medication but found that treatment was unsuccessful or caused intolerable side effects. It may work by reducing the number of harmful B and T lymphocytes that you have. Siponimod (Mayzent) is an oral tablet that you take once per day. It’s used to treat RRMS and SPMS in cases of active disease — that is, a relapse has occurred or new lesions have appeared on an MRI scan. It can also treat CIS. It’s believed to work by blocking certain inflammatory cells from leaving your lymph nodes. This action limits the amount of nerve damage that they can inflict. Diroximel fumarate (Vumerity) is an oral capsule that you take twice per day. It’s used to treat RRMS and SPMS in cases of active disease — that is, a relapse has occurred or new lesions have appeared on an MRI scan. It can also treat CIS. Diroximel fumarate has the same active ingredient as dimethyl fumarate (Tecfidera), and it works the same way. This means that it may also have antioxidant properties and interfere with the activity of certain immune system cells and chemicals. Ozanimod (Zeposia) is an oral capsule that you take once per day. It’s used to treat RRMS and SPMS in cases of active disease — that is, a relapse has occurred or new lesions have appeared on an MRI scan. It can also treat CIS. It’s believed to work by blocking immune cells from leaving your lymph nodes and entering your CNS. Fingolimod (Gilenya) is currently the only DMT that’s approved by the FDA for use in children. It’s safe for use in people ages 10 years old and up. However, doctors may prescribe other DMTs off label. Off-label drug is when a medication approved by the FDA for one purpose is used for a different purpose that hasn’t been approved. However, a doctor can still use the drug for that purpose. This is because the FDA regulates the testing and approval of drugs, but not how doctors use drugs to treat their patients. So, your doctor can prescribe a drug however they think is best for your care. While many relapses go away on their own, more severe relapses require treatment. Inflammation causes MS relapses, and it’s typically treated with . These drugs can reduce inflammation and help make MS attacks less severe. Corticosteroids used to treat MS include: If corticosteroids don’t work, your doctor may prescribe corticotropin (H.P. Acthar Gel). Corticotropin is an injection, and it’s also known as ACTH gel. It works by prompting the adrenal cortex to secrete the hormones cortisol, corticosterone, and aldosterone. The secretion of these hormones helps to reduce inflammation. Medications to treat MS symptoms and complications Other drugs can be used to treat specific or from MS-related damage. Dalfampridine (Ampyra) is an oral tablet taken twice per day to help improve walking. Dalfampridine works by blocking potassium channels, which form tiny pores in your nerve cells. This action may help damaged nerve cells to better send messages. Improved nerve impulse conduction aids in leg muscle control and strength. A doctor will often give to people with MS who have painful muscle stiffness or muscle spasms. Drugs commonly used to treat these symptoms include: is a common problem for people with MS. For this symptom, your doctor may prescribe a drug such as modafinil (Provigil). They may also prescribe an off-label drug, such as amantadine (Gocovri) and fluoxetine (Prozac). means “bad sensation.” It’s a type of pain that can feel like ongoing burning or itching. It may also feel like wetness, electric shock, or pins and needles. According to a published in Nature Reviews Neurology, some research has shown that people with MS are more likely to be clinically depressed than the general population. Drugs used to treat depression in people with MS include: Constipation is another common complication of MS. Your doctor may recommend with one of the following : Bladder dysfunction is also a common complication of MS. Symptoms may include frequent urination, , or hesitancy in starting urination. You may also experience frequent (nighttime urination). Both men and women with MS tend to have higher rates of sexual dysfunction than the general population, according to an from 2016. that may be prescribed to help treat include: Older drugs that must be injected directly into the penis are also available. These drugs aren’t used as much now that oral drugs are available. They include alprostadil (Caverject). A drug that may be used off label for this purpose is the blood pressure medication papaverine. People with a vagina or clitoris may experience problems such as reduced feeling or . There are no drugs currently available to treat these problems. However, for vaginal dryness, you can use water-soluble personal lubricants available over the counter. Many different types of drugs are available to help you manage MS. The type of drugs that may be best for you depend on the type of MS you have and the symptoms you experience. You may not be able to access all of these medications. Ask your doctor to confirm which drugs are currently on the market in your area and which ones might be most appropriate for you. Speaking with your doctor is especially important if you’re pregnant or planning to become pregnant. Work with your doctor to to manage your MS symptoms and help prevent further damage from the disease. Sticking to your treatment plan can help you feel better and slow the progression of your condition. — — MS Treatment Chart: Comparing Disease-Modifying Therapies Oral vs. Injectable MS Treatments: What’s the Difference?

70c47080-6b6f-416d-ac2a-71cffe016381,"CORONAVIRUS: DELAYS FOR ROUTINE SURGERIES, VISITOR RESTRICTIONS + COVID-19 TESTING. 800.223.2273 Cleveland Clinic Menu Call for Additional Assistance / Health Library / Disease & Conditions Multiple Sclerosis (MS) Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic condition that impacts the brain and spinal cord. There are several different types of MS, including relapsing-remitting, progressive and fulminant. The severity of your condition depends on the type of MS you have. Symptoms of MS can include numbness, difficulty walking, fatigue and weakness in one or more body part. Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a central nervous system disorder — that is, it affects the brain and spinal cord and spares the nerves and muscles that leave the spinal cord. MS is an inflammatory disorder in which infection-fighting white blood cells enter the nervous system and cause injury. It is a demyelinating disorder because the myelin sheath that protects nerves is stripped off during inflammation. When this happens, the nerves cannot conduct electricity as well as they should, causing various symptoms. Symptoms may be the type that come and go over time (relapsing-remitting MS) or progress over time (progressive MS). MS can happen to just about anyone and is long-term. Are there different types of multiple sclerosis (MS)? MS varies from patient to patient so that each individual has their own set of symptoms, problems, and their own course. There are people who have MS so mildly that they never even know that they have it. Of course, there are also others that have it severely. It is really a spectrum that ranges from mild to severe. An international panel of experts developed a classification of MS in 1999 that most neurologists use today: : Patients have attacks of symptoms/signs, with or without recovery, but between attacks have no interval worsening. : This is often after a few years of relapsing-remitting MS. The pattern changes from a relapsing pattern to progressive in between attacks, usually with fewer attacks. : This involves a gradual onset from the beginning and no attacks. : This is a rare form, and begins with a progressive course, while later developing attacks. : This is a rare form, and is very severe, rapidly progressive MS. Is there such a thing as benign multiple sclerosis (MS)? The term, ""benign MS,"" is not part of the international classification. It is used when people have had MS for many years without developing significant measurable disability. Recent studies have shown that it cannot be predicted early in the disease and so the term can only really be used retrospectively, after people have done very well with MS for many years. What are the risk factors of multiple sclerosis (MS)? There has been extensive research about MS over the past 50 years. While we still do not know the cause of MS, we know that it is an inflammatory disorder of the central nervous system that occurs in people with a tendency to such a problem. We know that about 350,000 people in the United States have MS, about one in a 1,000 people. We know that it is more common further north and south of the equator, though we are still unsure why this is. Females tend to get MS about three times as often as males, a rate which is similar to other immune diseases. It is more common in Caucasians, but can occur in other populations. It is not contagious nor is it infectious. There may be a link with reduced vitamin D levels and perhaps with decreased sun exposure. We know that there is a genetic component to MS. Having a mother or father with MS increases the risk of having MS to about 3 to 5% lifetime, and having an identical twin with MS increases the risk to about 30%. However, many people with MS have no close family members with the disease. There is nothing that an individual with MS either did to cause the disease to happen, or can avoid to stop the disease from following its natural course. We know that emotional stress may increase the symptoms of MS. We also know that attacks of MS are more likely after infections. There does not seem to be any association with physical trauma or surgical procedures and MS, nor do these seem to make MS worse. There has been widespread research about MS over the past 50 years. We do not know the cause of MS, but do know that it is an inflammatory disorder of the central nervous system that occurs in people with a tendency to such a problem. We know that about 350,000 people in the United States have MS, about 1 in 1,000 people. We know that it is more common further north and south of the equator. Although we are still unsure exactly why this is. Females tend to get MS about three times as often as males, a rate similar to other immune diseases. MS is more common in Caucasians, but can occur in other populations. It is not contagious, nor is it infectious. Did I do anything to bring on the multiple sclerosis (MS) or make it worse? As far as we know there are no activities that specifically cause MS or make it worse. People with MS may not tolerate heat as well as they used to and may need to avoid particularly hot or humid situations. There is evidence that having infections makes having an exacerbation of MS more likely. There does not appear to be a link to trauma. However, emotional stress has been linked to a worsening of MS symptoms. Having MS is not the fault of people who have it; it can happen to anyone. Is there anything new that we know about multiple sclerosis (MS)? Multiple sclerosis is being studied actively in many research institutions around the world, and new knowledge is being added constantly. For example, we now know that even with early MS, the nerve fibers themselves (the axons) are affected more than we knew before. We know from MRI studies that new lesions (abnormal areas in the brain or spinal cord) occur about 5 to10 times as often as people with MS have new symptoms; that is, much of the disease occurs 'under the radar scope'. We know that myelin repair occurs in the central nervous system all the time. Some groups feel there are different types of immune or pathological processes going on that we call MS, and perhaps MS may be many different disorders that we have lumped together. Do any other diseases look like multiple sclerosis (MS)? When neurologists evaluate MS they are also considering other diagnoses. While MS is the most likely cause of typical white matter changes and symptoms in an otherwise healthy young person, there are some other diseases that we consider and occasionally diagnose. These include a vitamin B12 deficiency that can cause an MS-like illness, and rarely, , which may have symptoms that suggest MS. The MRI is very useful in ruling out many other disorders that could be confused with MS, and the blood tests and spinal fluid may also be helpful in diagnosing other diseases. What are some early symptoms of multiple sclerosis (MS)? MS varies from person to person so there is no 'standard' set of symptoms for MS. However, we know that common symptoms of MS include: Numbness or tingling in various parts of the body. Lhermitte's phenomenon, a symptom in which people feel electrical tingling or shocks down their back, arms or legs when they bend their neck forwards. Urinary symptoms, such as hesitancy when trying to urinate, or a feeling of urgency (when you have to go, you have to go). There is no way to predict which symptoms one person might develop. MS varies from person to person so there is no ‘standard’ set of symptoms for MS. However we know that common symptoms of MS include numbness or tingling in various parts of the body, weakness of one or more parts of the body, walking difficulties, dizziness, fatigue, visual blurring and occasionally double vision. Patients may also have a symptom called Lhermitte’s phenomenon, in which they feel electrical tingling or shocks down their back, arms or legs when they bend their neck forwards. Sometimes people notice hesitancy when they try to urinate or may find that 'when they have to go, they have to go’. There is no way to predict which symptoms one person might develop. The usual course of MS is to have periods of time where things are relatively stable, followed by times when, over a few days or weeks, new symptoms occur or old symptoms worsen. This relatively rapid worsening is known as an exacerbation (also known as an attack, or a relapse). In others with MS, there may be a tendency to progress in that symptoms gradually worsen over time (months to years). MS varies from patient to patient so that each individual has their own set of symptoms, problems, and their own course. There are people who have MS so mildly that they never even know that they have it. Of course, there are also others that have it severely. It is really a spectrum that ranges from mild to severe. An international panel of experts developed a classification of MS in 1999 that most neurologists use today. : Patients have attacks of symptoms/signs, with or without recovery, but between attacks have no interval worsening. : This is often after a few years of relapsing-remitting MS. The pattern changes from a relapsing pattern to progressive in between attacks, usually with fewer attacks. : Gradual onset from the beginning, no attacks. : This is a rare form, and begins with a progressive course, while later developing attacks. : Very severe, rapidly progressive MS. This is a rare form of MS. Why do I have symptoms with multiple sclerosis (MS)? MS damages the myelin sheath surrounding the nerve cells of the brain and spinal cord. Scarring from this damage can block or slow nerve impulses in areas of the brain (neurological damage). As a direct result of MS, you may lack coordination and feel tired, and have weakness, involuntary movements, muscle stiffness (spasticity), or pain. Symptoms such as these are called ""primary symptoms."" Primary symptoms of MS can make you move less. As a result, you may feel tightness, pain and weakness, especially in the muscles and joints. These symptoms, which are not a direct result of MS, are called ""secondary symptoms."" Why do people with multiple sclerosis (MS) have depression? is very common in people with multiple sclerosis (MS). In fact, symptoms of depression severe enough to require medical intervention affect up to half of all people with MS at some point during their illness. Depression may be the result of a difficult situation or stress. It is easy to understand how having MS, with its potential for progressing to permanent disability, can bring on depression. Depression might be actually caused by MS. MS may affect the insulating myelin that surrounds nerves which transmit signals affecting mood. Depression is also a side effect of some drugs used to treat MS, such as steroids or interferon. How does heat or humidity impact people with multiple sclerosis (MS)? Heat or high humidity can cause many people with to experience a temporary worsening of their symptoms. Doctors believe that this occurs because heat causes nerves (whose myelin covering has been removed by MS) to conduct electrical signals even less efficiently. For reasons that are not well understood, extremely cold temperatures and changes in temperature can also cause MS symptoms, usually , to flare. Reviewed by a Cleveland Clinic medical professional.

There are several different types of MS, including relapsing-remitting, progressive and fulminant. The severity of your condition depends on the type of MS you have. Symptoms of MS can include numbness, difficulty walking, fatigue and weakness in one or more body part. Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a central nervous system disorder — that is, it affects the brain and spinal cord and spares the nerves and muscles that leave the spinal cord. MS is an inflammatory disorder in which infection-fighting white blood cells enter the nervous system and cause injury. It is a demyelinating disorder because the myelin sheath that protects nerves is stripped off during inflammation. When this happens, the nerves cannot conduct electricity as well as they should, causing various symptoms. Symptoms may be the type that come and go over time (relapsing-remitting MS) or progress over time (progressive MS). MS can happen to just about anyone and is long-term. Are there different types of multiple sclerosis (MS)? MS varies from patient to patient so that each individual has their own set of symptoms, problems, and their own course. There are people who have MS so mildly that they never even know that they have it. Of course, there are also others that have it severely. It is really a spectrum that ranges from mild to severe. An international panel of experts developed a classification of MS in 1999 that most neurologists use today: : Patients have attacks of symptoms/signs, with or without recovery, but between attacks have no interval worsening. : This is often after a few years of relapsing-remitting MS.

Is there such a thing as benign multiple sclerosis (MS)? The term, ""benign MS,"" is not part of the international classification. It is used when people have had MS for many years without developing significant measurable disability. Recent studies have shown that it cannot be predicted early in the disease and so the term can only really be used retrospectively, after people have done very well with MS for many years. What are the risk factors of multiple sclerosis (MS)? There has been extensive research about MS over the past 50 years. While we still do not know the cause of MS, we know that it is an inflammatory disorder of the central nervous system that occurs in people with a tendency to such a problem. We know that about 350,000 people in the United States have MS, about one in a 1,000 people. We know that it is more common further north and south of the equator, though we are still unsure why this is. Females tend to get MS about three times as often as males, a rate which is similar to other immune diseases. It is more common in Caucasians, but can occur in other populations. It is not contagious nor is it infectious. There may be a link with reduced vitamin D levels and perhaps with decreased sun exposure. We know that there is a genetic component to MS. Having a mother or father with MS increases the risk of having MS to about 3 to 5% lifetime, and having an identical twin with MS increases the risk to about 30%. However, many people with MS have no close family members with the disease. There is nothing that an individual with MS either did to cause the disease to happen, or can avoid to stop the disease from following its natural course. We know that emotional stress may increase the symptoms of MS. We also know that attacks of MS are more likely after infections. There does not seem to be any association with physical trauma or surgical procedures and MS, nor do these seem to make MS worse. There has been widespread research about MS over the past 50 years. We do not know the cause of MS, but do know that it is an inflammatory disorder of the central nervous system that occurs in people with a tendency to such a problem. We know that about 350,000 people in the United States have MS, about 1 in 1,000 people. We know that it is more common further north and south of the equator.

MS is more common in Caucasians, but can occur in other populations. It is not contagious, nor is it infectious. Did I do anything to bring on the multiple sclerosis (MS) or make it worse? As far as we know there are no activities that specifically cause MS or make it worse. People with MS may not tolerate heat as well as they used to and may need to avoid particularly hot or humid situations. There is evidence that having infections makes having an exacerbation of MS more likely. There does not appear to be a link to trauma. However, emotional stress has been linked to a worsening of MS symptoms. Having MS is not the fault of people who have it; it can happen to anyone. Is there anything new that we know about multiple sclerosis (MS)? Multiple sclerosis is being studied actively in many research institutions around the world, and new knowledge is being added constantly. For example, we now know that even with early MS, the nerve fibers themselves (the axons) are affected more than we knew before. We know from MRI studies that new lesions (abnormal areas in the brain or spinal cord) occur about 5 to10 times as often as people with MS have new symptoms; that is, much of the disease occurs 'under the radar scope'. We know that myelin repair occurs in the central nervous system all the time. Some groups feel there are different types of immune or pathological processes going on that we call MS, and perhaps MS may be many different disorders that we have lumped together. Do any other diseases look like multiple sclerosis (MS)? When neurologists evaluate MS they are also considering other diagnoses. While MS is the most likely cause of typical white matter changes and symptoms in an otherwise healthy young person, there are some other diseases that we consider and occasionally diagnose. These include a vitamin B12 deficiency that can cause an MS-like illness, and rarely, , which may have symptoms that suggest MS. The MRI is very useful in ruling out many other disorders that could be confused with MS, and the blood tests and spinal fluid may also be helpful in diagnosing other diseases.

It’s never too soon or too late to think about how to access high quality care. Knowing what to look for, where to find it, and how to work effectively with your doctor and other health professionals is essential to your health and quality of life.  While there is no way to predict with any certainty how an individual’s disease will progress, four basic MS disease courses (also called types or phenotypes) have been defined by the International Advisory Committee on Clinical Trials of MS in 2013: clinically isolated syndrome, relapsing remitting, secondary progressive and primary progressive. In 2020, the same committee published a , highlighting the need for time framing the modifiers “activity” and “progression” and guidance for using the terms “worsening” or “progression” to describe the disease. Although not considered a course of MS,  has been used to classify those with abnormalities on MRI of the brain and/or spinal cord consistent with lesions of MS - not explained by another diagnosis - and who also have no past or current neurological symptoms or abnormalities found on neurological exam. Often these individuals have had an MRI because of other symptoms, such as headache, and were found to have lesions that appear similar to those seen in MS. A found a little over half of people with RIS go on to develop MS within ten years. There are no specific treatment guidelines for RIS and additional research is needed to further define what factors increase the likelihood that someone with RIS will develop MS. Monitoring of MRI and neurological symptoms, and neurological examination are generally recommended to quickly identify changes. If the diagnosis is MS, treatment can be started early. Research interest in RIS is high and , which could provide more guidance for monitoring and treatment. CIS is a first episode of neurologic symptoms caused by inflammation and in the central nervous system. The episode, which by definition must last for at least 24 hours, is characteristic of multiple sclerosis but does not yet meet the criteria for a because people who experience a CIS may or may not go on to develop MS. When CIS is accompanied by lesions on a brain MRI () that are similar to those seen in MS, the person has a high likelihood of a second episode of neurologic symptoms and diagnosis of relapsing-remitting MS. When CIS is not accompanied by MS-like lesions on a brain MRI, the person has a much lower likelihood of developing MS. The make it possible to diagnose MS in a person with CIS who also has specific findings on brain MRI that provide evidence of an earlier episode of damage in a different location and indicate active inflammation in a region other than the one causing the current symptoms. As MRI technology improves, the diagnosis of MS will be made more quickly and easily. In the meantime, individuals with CIS who are considered at high risk for developing MS may now be treated with a that has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for that purpose. Early treatment of CIS has been shown to delay onset of MS. RRMS – the most common disease course – is characterized by clearly defined attacks of new or increasing neurologic symptoms. These attacks – also called relapses or exacerbations – are followed by periods of partial or complete recovery (remissions). During remissions, all symptoms may disappear, or some symptoms may continue and become permanent. However, there is no apparent progression of the disease during the periods of remission. RRMS can be further characterized as either (with relapses and/or evidence of new MRI activity over a specified period of time) or , as well as (a confirmed increase in disability following a relapse) or . Approximately 85 percent of people with MS are initially diagnosed with RRMS. This graphic shows the kinds of disease activity that can occur in RRMS over time; however each person's experience with RRMS will be unique. Following a relapse, the new symptoms may disappear without causing any increase in level of disability, or the new symptoms may partially disappear, resulting in an increase in disability. New lesions on MRI, as shown by the arrows, often occur as part of a relapse. However, new MRI lesions indicating MS activity may also occur without symptoms of which the person is aware.  SPMS follows an initial relapsing-remitting course. Some people who are diagnosed with RRMS will eventually transition to a secondary progressive course in which there is a progressive worsening of neurologic function (accumulation of disability) over time. SPMS can be further characterized as either (with relapses and/or evidence of new MRI activity during a specified period of time) or, as well as  (evidence of disability accumulation over time, with or without relapses or new MRI activity) or . This graphic shows the kinds of disease activity that can occur in SPMS over time; however each person's experience with SPMS will be unique. SPMS follows after relapsing-remitting MS. Disability gradually increases over time, with or without evidence of disease activity (relapses or changes on MRI). In SPMS, occasional relapses may occur, as well as periods of stability. PPMS is characterized by worsening neurologic function (accumulation of disability) from the onset of symptoms, without early relapses or remissions. PPMS can be further characterized as either (with an occasional relapse and/or evidence of new MRI activity over a specified period of time) or , as well as  (evidence of disability accumulation over time, with or without relapse or new MRI activity) or . Approximately 15 percent of people with MS are diagnosed with PPMS. This graphic shows the kinds of disease activity that can occur in PPMS over time; however each person's experience with PPMS will be unique. PPMS can have brief periods when the disease is stable, with or without a relapse or new MRI activity, as well as periods when increasing disability occurs with or without new relapses or lesions on MRI. There are more than a dozen approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat all types of MS. Each drug has an indication from the FDA for the type of MS it can be used to treat. There are currently more treatments available for relapsing forms of MS than progressive forms. Scientists around the world are actively working to find more effective treatments for progressive forms of MS -- and addressing the challenges of progressive MS is a primary target of the .

c743a76e-bc6c-4d91-823c-287324eca67a,"— — Symptoms of multiple sclerosis (MS) are caused by lesions within the central nervous system. The location of the lesions determines the specific symptoms that an individual may experience. Nausea is one of a wide variety of potential symptoms of MS, but it’s not among the most common. Nausea can be a direct symptom of MS or an offshoot of another symptom. Also, some of the medications used to treat specific symptoms of MS can cause nausea. Let’s take a closer look. Dizziness and lightheadedness are common symptoms of MS. While they’re usually fleeting, they may cause nausea. Vertigo isn’t the same thing as dizziness. It’s the false feeling that your surroundings are moving rapidly or spinning like an amusement park ride. Despite knowing that the room really isn’t spinning, vertigo can be quite unsettling and leave you feeling ill. An episode of vertigo can last a few seconds or several days. It can be constant, or it can come and go. A severe case of vertigo can cause double vision, nausea, or vomiting. When vertigo occurs, find a comfortable place to sit and keep still. Avoid sudden movements and bright lights. Also avoid reading. The nausea will probably subside when the sensation of spinning stops. Over-the-counter anti-motion sickness medication may help. Sometimes, movement in your field of vision — or even the perception of movement — is enough to trigger severe nausea and vomiting in MS patients. Talk to your doctor if you experience prolonged bouts of nausea. Some medications used to treat MS and its associated symptoms can cause nausea. Ocrelizumab (Ocrevus) is an infusion treatment for both relapse-remitting and primary progressive MS. Side effects include nausea, fever, and irritation at the injection site. Oral medications for MS, such as teriflunomide (Aubagio) and dimethyl fumarate (Tecfidera), can also cause nausea. Dalfampridine (Ampyra) is an oral medication used to improve the ability to walk in people with MS. One of the potential side effects of this medication is nausea. A muscle relaxant called dantrolene can be used to treat muscle spasms and spasticity due to a variety of conditions, including MS. Nausea and vomiting after taking this oral medication could indicate serious side effects, including liver damage. One of the most common symptoms of MS is fatigue. A variety of medications are used to help MS patients overcome fatigue, many of which may cause nausea. Among them are: Depression is another symptom of MS that can lead to nausea from its treatments, such as sertraline (Zoloft) and paroxetine (Paxil). If vertigo and associated nausea become an ongoing problem, consult your doctor. Some prescription-strength medications may be able to get your vertigo under control. In extreme cases, vertigo can be treated with corticosteroids. Also, if you experience side effects like nausea from your medications, make sure you bring this up to your doctor. A change in medication may be all you need to get back on track. If you’re experiencing nausea and you have MS, you’re not alone. Many people experience it due to dizziness and vertigo, or from side effects of medication. No matter its cause, make sure you bring it up with your doctor at your next appointment. Adding or switching up your treatment plan may be all you need to get your nausea under control. — — Do I Need MS Treatment if I Rarely Relapse? 5 Things to Know Ask the Expert: How to Navigate Your MS Treatment Options Figuring out which disease-modifying therapy is best for your case of multiple sclerosis can be confusing.

Experts Clarify How to Describe MS to Improve Care and Clinical Trials What Type of MS Do You Have? Experts Clarify How to Describe MS to Improve Care and Clinical Trials An international committee of MS experts has that clarifies how to describe the different courses of multiple sclerosis and disease activity. The statement was prompted by inconsistencies in the way MS descriptors are used by the MS community. These clarifications can improve care and access to treatments, and refine the selection of clinical trial participants so that trial outcomes can be better applied to clinical care.   The statement was an effort by the International Advisory Committee on Clinical Trials in Multiple Sclerosis, which is jointly supported by the US and the European Committee for Treatment and Research in Multiple Sclerosis (). The Committee provides perspective and guidance in areas of interest to planning and implementing clinical trials for new agents for the treatment of MS.   “With this published statement, we’re encouraging the healthcare and regulatory community to use the terms as described for the different subtypes of MS and for describing disease activity,” noted Fred Lublin, MD (Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai), who is senior author of the statement and two previous papers defining MS subtypes that were published in 1996 and 2013 under the auspices of the committee. “It’s critical not just for improving patient care, but also for selecting participants for clinical trials, so you are comparing apples to apples.”   The 2013 paper defined based on current clinical course:  (an initial episode of neurological symptoms), , , and . The paper also recommended adding terms to describe an individual’s current disease state, such as “active” (shown by relapse or changes on MRI) and “progression” (shown by worsening of disability independent of relapse activity). While the time period for the activity was not specified, it was recommended that an assessment be performed at least annually.   Since the 2013 paper was published, there has been confusion in the use of the terms describing a person’s current disease state and the terms have been used without reference to a timeframe. For example, in the prescription indications for recent MS therapy approvals, neither the European Medicines Agency nor the U.S. Food and Drug Administration specified a timeframe for determining disease activity. Moreover, the agencies defined activity differently; the European Medicines Agency defined “activity” as either clinical relapse or MRI-detected inflammation, whereas the U.S. Food and Drug Administration defined “activity” only in terms of relapses.   The recently published statement reiterates the definition of “activity” as clinical relapses or imaging features of inflammatory activity, evaluated annually or over another specified interval. The definition of “progression” is reiterated as clinical evidence of disability worsening, independent of relapses, in individuals in a progressive phase, evaluated annually or over another specified interval. Also, the more general term “worsening” refers to any increase in impairment or disability as the result of residual deficits caused by relapses, or increasing disability during progressive phases of MS.   “As part of its ongoing activities, the committee plans to continue to reevaluate and refine course descriptors, especially when new evidence-based methods enable pathological distinctions between MS phenotypes, said Professor Alan Thompson, Chair of the International Advisory Committee on Clinical Trials in MS and Dean of University College London’s Faculty of Brain Sciences. “This would vastly improve prognosis, treatment choices, and the development of more selective therapies.”   Read the recently published open access statement, “The 2013 clinical course descriptors for multiple sclerosis: A clarification” by Fred D.

It’s caused by a breakdown of the protective cover (myelin sheath) around the nerves. This makes it hard for the to communicate to the rest of the body. The exact cause of MS is still unknown, but doctors do understand the long-term effects and symptoms of MS. Read on to learn more about the effects of MS on your body. According to the , tend to show up in adults 20 to 40 years of age. Women are also diagnosed with MS at least as men. MS is thought to be an autoimmune disease and a progressive neurodegenerative condition. However, and there’s currently no cure, only treatments to manage the symptoms. What we do know is that it affects the nervous system and gradually impacts the whole body. The body’s immune cells attack healthy nerve tissue over time, affecting the body’s internal systems to respond healthily. Most of the problems described above are primary symptoms associated with MS. This means that they’re directly caused by the nerve damage resulting from attacks to the myelin sheath. Some primary symptoms can be treated directly by trying to slow the nerve damage and prevent MS attacks. However, once nerve damage exists, secondary symptoms can arise. Secondary MS symptoms are common complications of primary MS symptoms. Examples include that result from weak bladder muscles, or a loss of muscle tone that results from an inability to walk. Secondary symptoms can often be treated effectively, but treating the source of the problem can prevent them altogether. As the disease progresses, MS will inevitably cause some secondary symptoms. Secondary symptoms can often be well-managed with medication, physical adaptation, therapy, and creativity. When someone has MS, their body’s immune system slowly attacks its own myelin sheath, which is composed of the cells that surround and protect the nervous system including the spinal cord and brain. When these cells are damaged, the nerves are exposed and the brain has difficulty sending signals to the rest of the body. The disconnection between the brain and the organs, muscles, tissues, and cells served by the damaged nerves causes symptoms such as: and other changes in the brain can be a direct result of MS or an indirect result from the difficulty of coping with the condition. In , nerve damage can cause tremors, seizures, and cognitive problems that closely resemble other neurodegenerative conditions such as dementia. are often the first sign of MS for many people. Double vision, blurriness, pain, and problems seeing contrast can begin suddenly and affect one or both eyes. In many cases, vision problems are temporary or self-limiting, and likely result from nerve inflammation or fatigue of the eye muscles. Although some people with MS experience permanent vision problems, most cases are mild and can be effectively treated with steroids and other short-term treatments. Rarely, people with MS may experience hearing loss or deafness caused by damage to the brainstem. These types of hearing problems usually resolve on their own, but can be permanent in some cases. According to the , up to 40 percent of people with MS have speech problems. These include: Such effects often occur during relapses or times of . Other speech problems can include changes in voice pitch or quality, nasality, and hoarseness or breathiness. Speech problems can be caused by breathing difficulties that are brought on by weak or damaged nerves that control muscles in the chest. Difficulty controlling the muscles involved in breathing can begin early in the disease and worsen as MS progresses. This is a dangerous yet rare complication of MS that often can be improved through work with a respiratory therapist. Swallowing problems are less common than speech difficulties, but can be far more serious. They may occur when nerve damage weakens muscles and hinders the body’s ability to control the muscles involved in swallowing. When , food or drink can be inhaled into the lungs and increase your risk for infections, such as . Coughing and choking when eating and drinking can be signs of swallowing problems and should be evaluated immediately. Speech or language therapists can often help with trouble speaking and swallowing. Many people with MS experience effects to their limbs. Damage to the myelin sheath often results in pain, tingling, and numbness of the arms and legs. Problems with hand-eye coordination, , , and gait may occur when the brain has trouble sending signals to the nerves and muscles. These effects may start slowly and then worsen as nerve damage progresses. Many people with MS first feel “pins and needles” and have difficulty with coordination or fine motor skills. Over time, limb control and ease of walking may become disrupted. In these cases, canes, wheelchairs, and other assistive technologies can aid in muscle control and strength. People with MS are at higher risk of developing due to common MS treatments (steroids) and inactivity. Weakened bones can make individuals with MS susceptible to fractures and breaks. Although conditions like osteoporosis can be prevented or slowed through physical activity, diet, or supplementation, weak bones can make MS balance and coordination problems even riskier. A growing body of evidence suggests that may play an important role in the development of MS. Although its exact impact on individuals with MS isn’t yet well understood, is vital to skeletal health and immune system health. MS is thought to be an immune-mediated disease. This means that the body’s immune system attacks healthy nerve tissue, which causes nerve damage throughout the entire body. Immune system activity seems to result in the inflammation responsible for many MS symptoms. Some symptoms may flare up during an episode of immune system activity and then resolve when the episode or “attack” ends. Some research is investigating whether suppressing the immune system with medication will slow the progress of MS. Other therapies try to target particular immune cells to prevent them from attacking the nerves. However, may make people more vulnerable to infection. Some nutrient deficiencies may affect immune health and worsen MS symptoms. However, most MS physicians only recommend when a specific nutrient deficiency is present. One common recommendation is a — this also helps prevent osteoporosis. and bowel functions commonly occur in MS. Such issues can include: In some cases, diet and physical therapy or self-care strategies can reduce the impact of these problems on daily life. Other times, medications or more intense intervention may be necessary. The use of a catheter may occasionally be necessary. This is because nerve damage affects how much urine those with MS can comfortably hold in the bladder. This can result in spastic bladder infections, , or . These problems can make urination painful and very frequent, even overnight or when there’s little urine in the bladder. Most people can effectively manage bladder and bowel problems and avoid complications. However, serious infections or hygiene problems may arise if these problems are left untreated or unmanaged. Discuss any bladder or bowel issues and treatment options with your doctor. MS doesn’t directly impact the reproductive system or fertility. In fact, many women find that offers a nice reprieve from MS symptoms. However, the reports that 2-4 out of 10 women will experience a relapse during the postpartum period. However, , such as difficulty experiencing arousal or orgasm, is common in people with MS. This can be caused by nerve damage or by MS-related emotional problems such as depression or low self-esteem. Fatigue, pain, and other MS symptoms can make sexual intimacy awkward or unappealing. However, in many cases, sexual problems can be addressed successfully through medication, over-the-counter aids (such as lubricant), or a bit of advanced planning. Circulatory system problems are rarely caused by MS, although weak chest muscles can lead to shallow breathing and low oxygen supply. However, lack of activity due to depression, difficulty using muscles, and a preoccupation with treating other problems may prevent people with MS from focusing on the risk of cardiovascular disease. A study published in the journal found that women with MS have a significantly increased risk of cardiovascular problems such as heart attack, stroke, and heart failure. However, physical therapy and regular physical activity may help alleviate MS symptoms and reduce cardiovascular risk. While there’s no cure for multiple sclerosis, a wide variety of medications, herbal remedies, and dietary supplements may help alleviate symptoms. can also modify the disease by preventing its progression and overall effects on your body. MS affects everyone differently. Each person experiences a unique set of symptoms and responds to treatments individually. Therefore, you and your doctors should customize your treatment regimen to address your MS symptoms specifically and alter it as the disease progresses or relapses. A carefully designed treatment plan can help make MS more manageable.

This adds to other evidence suggesting that exposure to surgery or anesthesia does not increase the risk of an MS relapse, but studies also suggest that infection or fever – if they occur because of surgery – may aggravate symptoms of MS.

Multiple sclerosis, often called MS, is a disease that affects the —the brain and spinal cord. It can cause problems with muscle control and strength, vision, balance, feeling, and thinking. Your nerve cells have a protective covering called myelin. Without myelin, the brain and spinal cord can't communicate with the nerves in the rest of the body. MS gradually destroys myelin in patches throughout the brain and spinal cord, causing muscle weakness and other symptoms. These patches of damage are called lesions. MS is different for each person. You may go through life with only minor problems. Or you may become seriously disabled. Most people are somewhere in between. Generally, MS follows one of four courses: , where symptoms fade and then return off and on for many years. , which at first follows a relapsing-remitting course and then becomes progressive. ""Progressive"" means it steadily gets worse. , where the disease is progressive from the start. , where the symptoms are progressive at first and are relapsing later. The exact cause is unknown, but most experts believe that MS is an autoimmune disease. In this kind of disease, the body's defenses, called the , mistakenly attack normal tissues. In MS, the immune system attacks the central nervous system—the . Experts don't know why MS happens to some people but not others. There may be a link, because the disease seems to run in families. Where you grew up may also play a role. MS is more common in those who grew up in colder regions that are farther away from the equator. Symptoms depend on which parts of the brain and spinal cord are damaged and how bad the damage is. Early symptoms may include: You may feel weak and stiff, and your limbs may feel heavy. You may drag your leg when you walk. Your vision may be blurred or hazy. You may have eyeball pain (especially when you move your eyes), blindness, or double vision. You may feel tingling, a pins-and-needles sensation, or numbness. You may feel a band of tightness around your trunk or limbs. You may feel lightheaded or dizzy or feel like you're spinning. Diagnosing MS isn't always easy. The first symptoms may be vague. And many of the symptoms can be caused by problems other than MS. MS is not diagnosed unless a doctor can be sure that you have had at least two attacks affecting at least two different areas of your central nervous system. The doctor will examine you, ask you questions about your symptoms, and do some tests. An is often used to confirm the diagnosis, because the patches of damage (lesions) caused by MS attacks can be seen with this test. During a relapse, to make the attack shorter and less severe. Over a long period of time, to keep down the number of attacks and how severe they are and to slow the progression of the disease. (This is called disease-modifying therapy.) You may find it hard to decide when to start taking the drugs that slow the progression of MS. The drugs may not work for everyone, and they often have side effects. You and your doctor will decide together when you should start any of these drugs. There is no cure for MS. Treatment and self-care can help you maintain your quality of life. Physical therapy, occupational therapy, and speech therapy can help you manage some physical problems caused by MS. You can also help yourself at home by eating balanced meals, getting regular exercise and rest, and learning to use your energy wisely. Dealing with the physical and emotional demands of MS isn't easy. If you feel overwhelmed, talk to your doctor. You may be depressed, which can be treated. And finding a support group where you can talk to other people who have MS can be very helpful. Health Tools help you make wise health decisions or take action to improve your health. Decision Points focus on key medical care decisions that are important to many health problems. Multiple Sclerosis: Should I Start Taking Medicines for MS? The cause of multiple sclerosis (MS) is unknown. Because a person's risk of MS is slightly higher in some families when a relative has MS, there may be a . For more information, see . Some research suggests that where you lived as a child and you have had could be triggers for MS later in life. But these links have not been proved. The symptoms of multiple sclerosis (MS) vary from person to person depending on which parts of the brain or spinal cord (central nervous system) are damaged. The and scarring caused by MS can affect any part of the central nervous system. Myelin is the insulating coating around a nerve. Symptoms may come and go or become more or less severe from day to day or, in rare cases, from hour to hour. Symptoms may become worse with increased body temperature or after a viral infection. , such as weakness, leg dragging, stiffness, a tendency to drop things, a feeling of heaviness, clumsiness, or a lack of coordination (). , such as blurred, foggy, or hazy vision, eyeball pain (especially when you move your eyes), blindness, or double vision. Optic neuritis—sudden loss of vision that is often painful—is a fairly common first symptom. It occurs in up to 25 out of 100 people who have MS. , such as tingling, a pins-and-needles sensation, numbness, a band of tightness around the trunk or legs, or electrical sensations moving down the back and legs. As MS progresses, symptoms may become more severe and may include: Worse muscle problems, and stiff, mechanical movements () or uncontrollable shaking (). These problems may make walking difficult. A wheelchair may be needed some or all of the time. Bladder symptoms, such as an inability to hold urine () or to completely empty the bladder, or a loss of bladder sensation. (impotence) and . . These are common in people who have had MS for some time. Feeling very tired (fatigue). This can be worse if symptoms such as pain, spasticity, bladder problems, anxiety, or depression make it hard to sleep. In general, multiple sclerosis follows one of four courses: , where symptoms may fade and then recur at random for many years. The disease doesn't advance during the remissions. Most people who develop MS have a relapsing-remitting course. In 8 to 9 out of 10 people with this course of MS, the relapsing-remitting phase lasts about 20 years. , which at first follows a relapsing-remitting course. Later on, it becomes steadily progressive. , where the disease is progressive from the start. , where steady deterioration of nerve function begins when symptoms first appear. Symptoms appear and disappear, but nerve damage continues. Few people have this course of MS. MS is different for every person. You may go through life with only minor problems. Or you may become seriously disabled. Most people are somewhere in between. The duration of the disease varies. Most people who get MS live with it for decades. MS usually progresses with a series of that occur over many years (relapsing-remitting MS). In many people the first MS attack involves just a single symptom. It may be weeks, months, or years before you have a relapse. As time goes by, symptoms may linger after each relapse so you lose the ability to fully recover from the relapse. New symptoms often develop as the disease damages other areas of the . Events that can mean you may have a more severe type of MS include: Frequent relapses during the first few years of the disease. Early, lasting motor problems that affect movement. Many lesions that show up on an early in the disease. Some people have a few mild attacks from which they recover entirely. This is called benign MS. Although rare, a small number of people die within several years of the onset of MS. This is called malignant or fulminant MS. Because MS may affect your ability to move and walk, it can place limits on your daily living, particularly as you age. If you or someone in your family has MS, talk to your doctor about . Knowing what to expect will help you plan for the future. Reduced ability to move and walk. This makes it necessary to use a wheelchair some or all of the time. Your risk for multiple sclerosis (MS) increases with: Geographic location, or where you lived during childhood (up to age 15). People who spend the first 15 years of their lives in colder climates that are farther away from the equator tend to be more likely to get MS than people who lived closer to the equator during those years. Family history of MS. About 15 out of 100 people who have MS have a relative with MS, most often a brother or sister. Certain genetic characteristics associated with the . These appear more frequently in people who have MS. This may mean that there are one or more that may increase the chance of getting MS. Race. People of Western European ancestry are more likely to get MS. Being female. MS is about 3 times as common in women as in men. Some of the symptoms of multiple sclerosis (MS) are similar to those of many other illnesses. See your doctor if over a period of time you have more than one symptom, such as: Blurry, foggy, or hazy vision, eyeball pain, loss of vision, or double vision. A feeling of heaviness or weakness, involuntary leg dragging, stiffness, walking problems, and clumsiness. Tingling or a pins-and-needles sensation; numbness; tightness in a band around the trunk, arms, or legs; or electric shock sensations moving down the back, arms, or legs. Inability to hold urine or to completely empty the bladder. Problems with memory, attention span, finding the right words for what you mean, and daily problem-solving. If you have been diagnosed with MS, see your doctor if: You begin having a symptom that you have not had before or you notice a significant change in symptoms that are already present. Milder MS-type symptoms can be caused by many other conditions or may occur now and then in healthy people. For example, lots of people have minor numbness in their fingers or a mild dizzy spell once in a while. Stiffness and muscle weakness can result from being more active than usual. A wait-and-see approach () is appropriate for these types of everyday aches and pains, so long as they do not continue. If your symptoms occur more often or don't go away, talk to your doctor. Talk to your doctor about what to expect from the disease and from treatment. MS is an unpredictable disease, but you probably can get some idea of what is ""normal"" and what symptoms or problems are reasons for concern. Some people who have MS want active, regular support from their doctors. Others want to manage their condition on their own as much as possible. Wherever you are in this range, find out which signs or symptoms mean that you need to see your doctor. And seek help when you need it. Health professionals who may be involved in evaluating symptoms of MS and treating the condition include: or . Consult your doctor when symptoms first start. He or she will refer you to a neurologist if needed. If you have MS, your family doctor or internist can treat your general health problems even if you see a neurologist for MS treatment. . A neurologist can decide whether your symptoms are caused by MS. He or she can also help you decide what may be the best treatment for your condition. Many university medical centers and large hospitals have MS clinics or centers staffed by neurologists and other health professionals who specialize in diagnosing and treating MS. They may be able to provide the most thorough evaluation. If you have been diagnosed with MS, at some point you may need to seek the help of: A , to assist with exercise to maintain body strength and flexibility and deal with movement problems. An , to identify ways of accomplishing daily activities if MS has caused any physical limitations. A , to improve speech, chewing, and breathing if MS has affected the muscles of the face and throat. A , to help with managing pain, maintaining strength, and adapting to physical disability. A or , to evaluate and treat , or other mood disorders, and problems with memory and concentration if these develop. A , to help with any significant chronic pain that MS may cause. A pain specialist, often as part of a pain clinic, can help find ways of reducing pain when possible and dealing with pain that doesn't go away. A , to do surgery for severe or . Diagnosing multiple sclerosis (MS) isn't always easy and in some cases may take time. Your medical history and can identify possible nervous system problems and are often enough to strongly suggest a diagnosis of MS. Tests may help confirm or rule out the diagnosis when your history and exam do not provide clear evidence of the disease. MRI and neurological exam may help doctors predict which people will develop MS after a first attack of symptoms. of the brain and spinal cord. This test is done to . (sometimes called a spinal tap). This test may be done to evaluate . Most people with MS have abnormal results on this test. . This test can often reveal abnormalities in the and in the that other tests may not detect. MS is diagnosed when it is clear from neurological tests and a neurological exam that lesions (damaged areas) are present in more than one area of the (usually the brain, spinal cord, or the nerves to the eyes). Tests will also clearly show that damage has occurred at more than one point in time. Some people have had only one episode of a neurological symptom such as optic neuritis, but MRI tests suggest they may have MS. This is known as a clinically isolated syndrome. Many of these people go on to develop MS over time. Urinary tract tests may be needed to help diagnose a problem with bladder control in a person who has MS. may be needed to identify thinking or emotional problems, which may be present without the person being aware of them. Typically, these tests are in a question-and-answer format. A blood test for JC virus antibodies may be done. This test can help you and your doctor understand your risk for getting a rare but serious brain infection called PML (progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy). Treatment can make living with multiple sclerosis (MS) easier. Your type of treatment will depend on how severe your symptoms are and whether your disease is active or in remission. You may get medicines, physical therapy, and other treatment at home. Medicines are used to treat relapses, control the course of the disease (disease-modifying drugs or DMDs), or treat symptoms. The National Multiple Sclerosis Society recommends that people with a definite diagnosis of MS and who have active, relapsing disease start treatment with medicines. This group also recommends treatment with medicine after the first attack in some people who are at a high risk for MS. If you decide not to try medicines at this time, meet with your doctor regularly to check whether the disease is progressing. Multiple Sclerosis: Should I Start Taking Medicines for MS? You and your doctor will set up a schedule of periodic appointments to monitor and treat your symptoms and follow the progress of your MS. Monitoring your condition helps your doctor find out if you may need to try a different treatment. , occupational therapy, and nonmedical treatment done at home may also help you manage symptoms and adjust to living and working situations. To learn more, see . In rare cases, MS is life-threatening. If your condition gets considerably worse, you may want to make a living will, which allows your wishes to be carried out if you are not able to make decisions for yourself. For more information, see the topic . In general, there is no way to prevent multiple sclerosis (MS) or its attacks. For people with , , and , treatment with medicine may reduce the frequency of relapses and delay disability. If you have multiple sclerosis (MS), it is important to find ways of coping with the practical and emotional demands of the disease. These are different for everyone, so home treatment varies from person to person. Home treatment may involve making it easier to get around your home, dealing with , handling specific symptoms, and getting support from your family and friends. to keep it safe and easy to get around. For example, to help prevent falls, install grab bars in the bathroom and don't use throw rugs. And try adjusting your daily schedule so that your routine is less stressful or tiring. , either on your own or with the help of a physical therapist. . At some time, most people with MS have bladder problems. Your doctor may prescribe a medicine to help you. Avoid getting overheated. Increased body temperature can temporarily make your symptoms worse. Use an air conditioner, keep your home somewhat cool, and avoid hot swimming pools and hot tubs. During warm or hot weather, exercise in an air-conditioned area rather than outdoors. Eat plenty of fruits, vegetables, grains, cereals, legumes, poultry, fish, lean meats, and low-fat dairy products. A balanced diet for a person who has MS is the same as that recommended for most healthy adults. Change how and what you eat if you are having problems swallowing. Thicker drinks make swallowing easier. Try milk shakes or juices in gelatin form. Avoid foods such as crackers or cakes that crumble easily. These can cause choking. Soft foods need less chewing. Use a blender to prepare food for easiest chewing. Eat frequent, small meals to avoid fatigue from eating heavy meals. Ask your doctor about and occupational therapy to help you manage at work and home. Make all efforts to preserve your health. Proper diet, rest, wise use of energy, and practical and emotional support from your family, friends, and doctor can all be very helpful. For more advice about coping with MS at home, contact the National Multiple Sclerosis Society at www.nationalmssociety.org. Medicines for multiple sclerosis (MS) may be used: During a , to make the attack shorter and less severe. Over a long period of time, to alter the natural course of the disease (disease-modifying drugs or DMDs). These medicines can shorten a sudden relapse and help you feel better sooner. They have been shown to affect the long-term course of the disease or to prevent disability. Strong evidence suggests that MS is caused by the causing and attacking nerve cells and myelin, which is the protective coating surrounding the nerve fibers. Medicines that change the way the immune system works can reduce the number and severity of attacks that damage the nerves and myelin. For people who have , disease-modifying therapy can reduce the number and severity of relapses. It may also delay disability in some people. Some of these medicines may also delay disease progression and reduce relapses in some people who have or . The most commonly used disease-modifying therapies are: Interferon beta (such as Betaseron), for clinically isolated syndrome (first MS attack), relapsing-remitting MS, and secondary progressive MS. Glatiramer (Copaxone), for clinically isolated syndrome and relapsing-remitting MS. Other disease-modifying medicines may also be used for MS. Your doctor will prescribe a medicine depending on the type of MS you have, your symptoms, and how your body responds. They include: Some people have only one episode of a neurological symptom such as . Yet or other tests suggest that these people have MS. This is known as a clinically isolated syndrome. Many of these people go on to develop MS over time. In most cases, doctors will prescribe medicine for people who have had a clinically isolated syndrome. These medicines, when taken early or even before you have been diagnosed with MS, may keep the disease from getting worse or extend your time without disease. Treating specific symptoms can be effective, even if it doesn't stop the progression of the disease. Symptoms that can often be controlled or relieved with medicine include: Medicines can also help with sexual problems, emotional problems, and walking problems. Sildenafil (Viagra) can help with sexual problems in both men and women. Clomipramine may also be given to improve . Dextromethorphan and quinidine (Nuedexta) is a medicine that can be used for uncontrollable outbursts of crying or laughing at strange or inappropriate times. Dalfampridine (Ampyra) is a medicine that can be used to help with walking problems. Medicine may be used only some of the time or regularly, depending on how severe or constant a certain symptom is. Changes in diet, schedule, exercise, and other habits can also help manage some of these symptoms. See . Cannabinoids are substances found in marijuana. Similar drugs can be created in a lab. Some forms of natural and man-made cannabinoids may help with symptoms such as pain and spasticity. They are not available in all areas. Talk to your doctor if you are considering cannabinoids. A variety of other medicines and biological chemicals have been tried or are being studied as therapy for MS. None of them have been clearly proved as beneficial, and none have been approved for treatment of MS. Several medicines are being tested in clinical trials. People with MS who have not responded to standard therapy sometimes choose to take part in these trials. To learn more about clinical trials, talk to your doctor or contact the National Multiple Sclerosis Society at www.nationalmssociety.org. The National Multiple Sclerosis Society recommends that people with a definite diagnosis of MS and active, relapsing disease start treatment with interferon beta or glatiramer. Most neurologists support this recommendation and now agree that permanent damage to the nervous system may occur early on, even while symptoms are still quite mild. Early treatment may help prevent or delay some of this damage. In general, treatment is recommended until it no longer provides a clear benefit. The National MS Society also says that treatment with medicine may be considered after the first attack in some people who are at a high risk for MS (before MS is definitely diagnosed). Despite the recommendation, some people find it hard to decide whether to begin disease-modifying therapy, especially when their symptoms have been fairly mild. Some may not want to bear the risks and side effects of medicine when they are not sure they need it. Some may want to see whether their disease gets worse before they start therapy. A small percentage of people diagnosed with MS may never have more than a few mild episodes and may never develop any disability, but the disease is unpredictable. Multiple Sclerosis: Should I Start Taking Medicines for MS? The need and desire for medicine vary. If your symptoms are mild, you may choose to manage them without any medicine. If you have specific symptoms that are causing problems, certain medicines may help you keep them under control. Or you may want to use medicine only during a relapse. The possible side effects of using steroids or other medicines to treat symptoms or control a relapse. Some people have only minor side effects. But others may have side effects that concern them more than their MS symptoms. The costs of treating symptoms and controlling relapses. In some cases, using medicine to control symptoms and relapses may reduce the need for hospital stays. Other personal issues that you face at work or at home. Also keep in mind that it can be hard to tell if medicine is helping. Multiple sclerosis is a disease with spontaneous remissions. This means that your condition can improve on its own, without any treatment. Just because your symptoms improve after treatment doesn't mean that a treatment is working. People with multiple sclerosis (MS) who have severe (shakiness) affecting movement may be helped by surgery. People with severe (muscle stiffness) may be helped by insertion of a spinal pump to deliver medicines when oral medicines fail. for tremor. This treatment is only considered after other options have failed. Severe and disabling tremor that occurs with the slightest movement of the limbs may be helped by an implanted device that stimulates an area of the brain. A does the surgery to implant the device. Implantation of a drug catheter or pump, for spasticity. This treatment is only considered after other options have failed. People who have severe pain or spasticity may benefit from having a catheter or pump placed in the lower spinal area to deliver a constant flow of medicine, such as baclofen. The unpredictability and variety of symptoms caused by multiple sclerosis (MS) make it a disease that people have tried to treat in many different ways. Many have been proposed as treatments for MS. None of these treatments have been shown to modify the course of the disease. Some of those most commonly used are: Diets and vitamin, mineral, herbal, or dietary supplements. (often used by ). Although clinical research has not shown all of these complementary therapies to be effective, a person with MS may benefit from safe nontraditional therapies along with conventional medical treatment. Some complementary therapies may help relieve stress, depression, fatigue, and muscle tension. And some may improve your overall well-being and quality of life. Talk to your doctor if you are interested in trying any of these complementary therapies or to MS treatment. Clinical research also has been unable to show that treatments such as ""liberation"" angioplasty for chronic cerebrospinal venous insufficiency (CCSVI), bee venom therapy, Prokarin (a caffeine and histamine combination), removal of mercury fillings (dental amalgams), and have any benefits for people who have MS. Some of these therapies may be harmful as well as expensive and are not recommended by most experts. Experimental treatments for MS involve reducing the activity of the . This may be done with medicines and biological chemicals or through methods such as total lymphoid irradiation, in which the entire lymph node system is exposed to radiation. While these methods have been used with success in the treatment of certain other medical conditions, they have failed to produce significant benefits when tested in controlled clinical trials. They remain experimental treatments for MS. , which uses immature cells from the bone marrow, has been studied. Early results suggest that stem cell transplant may delay disability, especially in people with relapsing-remitting MS. Stem cell transplant may be an option for people who have very aggressive or malignant forms of MS. It remains unproved and isn't recommended for treating relapsing-remitting MS. There is no cure for MS. So far, the only treatments proved to affect the course of the disease are approved disease-modifying therapies. Other types of treatment should replace these medicines if you are a candidate for treatment with them. Some people who have MS report that complementary therapies have worked for them. This may be in part because of the . Some complementary therapies don't treat the disease itself, but they may affect a person's sense of well-being and help the person feel better and healthier. If you are thinking about trying a complementary treatment, get the facts first. Discuss these questions with your doctor: Talk with your doctor about the safety and potential side effects of the treatment. This is especially important if you are on drug therapy for MS. Some complementary treatments in combination with drug therapy can be quite dangerous. A treatment that could be harmful to you and may or may not improve your symptoms isn't worth the risk. Because MS symptoms can come and go, you may find it hard to judge whether a particular treatment is really working. Keep in mind that if you get better after using a certain treatment, the treatment isn't always the reason for the improvement. MS may often improve on its own (spontaneous remission). An expensive, unproven treatment that may or may not help you may not be worth its cost. Beware of therapy providers or products that require a large financial investment at the beginning of a series of treatments. Even if they aren't effective in treating MS, some complementary practices (such as acupuncture, massage, or yoga) may be safe. And they may lead to healthy habits that improve your overall well-being. These might be worth trying. With a hard-to-treat disease like MS, it can be tempting to jump at the promise of an effective treatment. Be cautious about trying unproven treatments.

In , there are few or no relapses, and few or no recovery or remission periods when major symptoms improve.  Some of the burning questions that are being addressed through research include: • What factors influence the transition from relapsing stages of MS to progressive MS? • Can the disease-modifying therapies prevent, delay, or slow long-term MS progression? • What new therapies will stop progressive MS? • What causes degeneration of nerve fibers—thought to be the cause of long-term disability—and how can that be stopped or reversed? A common question is, “Why aren’t there more treatments for progressive MS?”  Virtually every therapy approved for relapsing MS has been tested, or is now in testing, in people with progressive forms of the disease. Clinical trials involving people with relapsing MS often rely on counting relapses or doing MRI scans to detect immune activity. Progression is less easily measured, and usually happens over long periods of time. This important difference makes it hard to quickly detect whether a therapy is impacting progression, and thus has made therapy development for progressive MS a challenge.   But the landscape is changing, thanks in part to National MS Society investments and collaborations: The FDA approved Ocrevus™ (ocrelizumab - Genentech, a member of the Roche Group) for the treatment of primary progressive MS or relapsing MS, based on clinical trials showing significant benefits against MS relapses and progression. The Society funded early research that laid the groundwork for this first therapy specifically approved for primary progressive MS. The FDA approved oral siponimod (brand named Mayzent, Novartis International AG) for the treatment of adults with  (an initial neurological episode) and relapsing forms of MS, including those with active secondary progressive MS. This means people who have had progression of disability but still experience acute relapses or new MRI activity. The Society has provided funding to several clinical trials of nervous system-protecting approaches: The ChariotMS trial in the United Kingdom, which will test whether cladribine tablets (Mavenclad®) can slow the progression of upper limb disability in people with advanced MS, who are rarely included in clinical trials of a phase 2 trial of oral ibudilast (MN-166, MediciNova, Inc.), in people with progressive forms of MS suggested it significantly slowed the rate of brain atrophy (shrinkage), which has been linked to cognitive and physical disability in MS. Ibudilast has been designated by the FDA as a “Fast Track Product” in terms of its development as a possible treatment of progressive MS.  A multicenter trial in the UK is testing whether a repurposed cholesterol-lowering therapy can slow the course of secondary progressive MS, with funding from the Society, the National Institutes for Health Research (UK) and the UK MS Society.   Large clinical trials are ongoing in progressive MS, including tests of oral ""BTK inhibitors,"" which affect activation of immune cells. The Progressive MS Alliance is bringing together the world’s leading experts in multiple sclerosis to change the world for people with progressive MS. recent breakthroughs in understanding and treating progressive MS. More than 30 studies investigating benefits of exercise, rehabilitation and other non-pharmaceutical strategies to enhance wellness, and address other symptoms that can interfere with quality of life. The Society launched a wellness initiative to develop strategies for increasing high-quality research and programming so people with MS can make informed lifestyle and wellness choices that help them live their best lives.  The Society-supported MS Outcome Assessments Consortium is a new measure of MS disability to improve the chances of successful clinical trials in MS, including progressive MS. Understanding what drives progression and how to stop it Researchers are exploring mechanisms that drive injury to the brain and spinal cord to expose new potential therapeutic targets along the injury pathways that may stop the damage. These include: Large-scale studies tracking people with MS to identify factors that contribute to progression risk. Advanced imaging and laboratory studies seeking to define and track the full measure of MS disease activity, MS lesions, and atrophy (shrinkage) in the brain and spinal cord. Exploring the potential of different types of stem cells in models of the disease, and ways to enhance the survival of repair cells in inflamed and scarred nerve tissue. An international research team supported by the Alliance and the Society found no difference in the behavior of OPCs derived from MS skin cells and those from healthy individuals, implying that MS does not change the inherent capacity of oligodendrocytes to repair myelin, and that the fault is more likely the brain environment.  Researchers at Johns Hopkins University studied small molecules involved in the metabolism (chemical processes that maintain cell life) of people with MS and people without MS, and found that molecules called bile acids were reduced in people with MS, particularly those with progressive disease. Bile acids have anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective properties. This team is  of bile acid supplementation in 60 people with progressive MS, with funding from the National MS Society. Collaborating researchers from the U.S. and Germany funded in part by the Society through Fast Forward reported promising early lab results from a new class of compounds that have potential for both protecting the nervous system and turning off immune attacks, possibly slowing MS progression. The tested three therapies that may have nerve-protecting properties in secondary-progressive MS (with the MS Society of the U.K.) Although none of the therapies slowed brain atrophy, the results confirm the feasibility of this innovative multi-arm trial design, enabling much quicker assessments of potential therapies for progressive MS in the future.

2e8d6a8d-1525-48b2-801d-40023e614a86,"by Michele R. Berman, MD, and Mark S. Boguski, MD, PhD Actress Selma Blair has announced that she has been diagnosed with multiple sclerosis. The 46-year-old actress made the announcement on : ""I have #multiplesclerosis. I am in an exacerbation."" She goes on to say: ""I am disabled. I fall sometimes. I drop things. My memory is foggy. And my left side is asking for directions from a broken gps."" Blair also expressed her gratitude to Netflix producers for their understanding and support in her upcoming role as Harper Glass in the sci-fi drama . ""By the grace of the lord, and will power and the understanding producers at Netflix, I have a job. A wonderful job."" Blair says she was diagnosed on August 15th of this year, but she believes that she has had symptoms for at least 15 years. She originally thought she had something simple, like a ""pinched nerve."" A friend finally talked her into seeing her brother, a Los Angeles neurologist. During the visit, she fell in front of him, leading to an MRI, which revealed the diagnosis. Blair says she is coming forth now, despite being in the thick of it, because, ""I hope to give some hope to others. And even to myself. You can't get help unless you ask ... I have probably had this incurable disease for 15 years at least. And I am relieved to at least know. And share."" Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a neuroinflammatory disease that affects myelin, nerve cell bodies, as well as the axons in the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve. The term multiple sclerosis refers to the distinctive areas of scar tissue (sclerosis or plaques) that are visible in the white matter of people who have MS. According to the , MS is thought to affect more than 2.3 million people worldwide. It most often appears between the ages 20 to 40, however, it can also affect children and older people. As with most autoimmune disorders, twice as many women are affected by MS as men. MS is more common in colder climates; the further from the equator, the higher the risk. Susceptibility to MS may be inherited. Studies of families indicate that relatives of an individual with MS have an increased risk of developing the disease. Experts estimate that about 15% of individuals with MS have one or more family members or relatives who also have MS. But even identical twins have only a 1 in 3 chance of both having the disease. This suggests that MS is not entirely controlled by genes, and other factors must come into play. The ultimate cause of MS is damage to myelin, nerve fibers, and neurons in the brain and spinal cord. But how that happens, and why, are questions that challenge researchers. Evidence appears to show that MS is a disease caused by genetic vulnerabilities combined with environmental factors. Although there is little doubt that the immune system contributes to the brain and spinal cord tissue destruction of MS, the exact target of the immune system attacks and which immune system cells cause the destruction aren't fully understood. Supporting evidence for immune system involvement in the pathogenesis of MS includes: Inflammatory T cells, B cells and macrophages typically seen in MS lesions in biopsies or at autopsy IgG and IgM oligoclonal bands found in CSF but not serum of patients with MS Gadolinium enhancement on MRI seen in early stages of patients with relapsing-remitting MS- characteristic of inflammation found with disruption of the blood-brain barrier T helper 17-type immune activation associated with active MS lesions Immunomodulatory drugs that reduce certain T cell regulatory pathways can reduce MS disease activity. Geographic: As mentioned above, MS is known to occur more frequently in areas that are further from the equator. Furthermore, people born in one area, but who move to another area before the age of 15, assume the MS risk of the area to which they have moved. Vitamin D and Sunlight: Several studies have suggested that people who spend more time in the sun and those with relatively high levels of vitamin D are less likely to develop MS. Bright sunlight helps human skin produce vitamin D. Researchers believe that vitamin D may help regulate the immune system in ways that reduce the risk of MS. People from regions near the equator, where there is a great deal of bright sunlight, generally have a much lower risk of MS than people from temperate areas such as the United States and Canada. Other studies suggest that people with higher levels of vitamin D generally have less severe MS and fewer relapses (see ). Several viruses have been found in people with MS, but the virus most consistently linked to the development of MS is Epstein Barr virus (EBV). , ""only about 5% of the population has not been infected by EBV. These individuals are at a lower risk for developing MS than those who have been infected. People who were infected with EBV in adolescence or adulthood and who therefore develop an exaggerated immune response to EBV are at a significantly higher risk for developing MS than those who were infected in early childhood. This suggests that it may be the type of immune response to EBV that predisposes to MS, rather than EBV infection itself. However, there is still no proof that EBV causes MS."" The symptoms of MS usually begin over one to several days, but in some forms, they may develop more slowly. They may be mild or severe and may go away quickly or last for months. Sometimes the initial symptoms of MS are overlooked because they disappear in a day or so and normal function returns. Because symptoms come and go in most people with MS, the presence of symptoms is called an attack or exacerbation. Recovery from symptoms is referred to as remission, while a return of symptoms is called a relapse. This form of MS is therefore called relapsing-remitting MS, in contrast to a more slowly developing form called primary progressive MS. Progressive MS can also be a second stage of the illness that follows years of relapsing-remitting symptoms (called secondary progressive MS). Relapsing-remitting MS accounts for approximately 85%-90% of cases at onset. Secondary progressive MS usually occurs 10-20 years after the onset of the disease. Primary progressive MS is characterized by progressive disability from the onset of the disease with occasional plateaus or temporary minor improvements. The mean age of onset is 40. A diagnosis of MS is often delayed because MS shares symptoms with other neurological conditions and diseases. vision problems such as blurred or double vision or optic neuritis, which causes pain in the eye and a rapid loss of vision. weak, stiff muscles, often with painful muscle spasms tingling or numbness in the arms, legs, trunk of the body, or face clumsiness, particularly difficulty staying balanced when walking bladder control problems, with incontinence or urgency mental or physical fatigue that accompanies the above symptoms during an attack changes in the ability to concentrate or to multitask effectively difficulty in making decisions, planning, or prioritizing at work or in private life Other disorders found in patients with MS include: Transverse myelitis: a condition caused by inflammation in the spinal cord. Transverse myelitis causes loss of spinal cord function over a period lasting from several hours to several weeks. It usually begins as a sudden onset of lower back pain, muscle weakness, or abnormal sensations in the toes and feet, and can rapidly progress to more severe symptoms, including paralysis. In most cases of transverse myelitis, people recover at least some function within the first 12 weeks after an attack begins. Neuro-myelitis optica: a disorder associated with transverse myelitis as well as optic nerve inflammation. Patients with this disorder usually have antibodies against a protein in their spinal cord, called the . These patients respond differently to treatment than most people with MS. ""Lhermitte's sign"": an uncomfortable ""electrical"" sensation that runs through the back and into the limbs. The sensation can be ascending or descending. It is often elicited by bending the head forward. There is no single test used to diagnose MS. Several tests are often done to rule out or confirm the diagnosis. As there are many other disorders that can mimic MS, it is very important to perform a thorough investigation before making a diagnosis. In addition to a complete medical history, physical examination, and a detailed neurological examination, an MRI scan of the head and spine should be done to look for the characteristic lesions of MS. In regions with active inflammation in MS, there is disruption of the blood-brain barrier and the dye will leak into the active MS lesion. There is currently no cure for multiple sclerosis, however, there are currently several disease-modifying medications approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in relapsing forms of MS. They come in three forms: : Interferons are signaling molecules that regulate immune cells. : Exactly how it works is not entirely clear, but research has shown that it changes the balance of immune cells in the body. It is approved only for relapsing forms of MS. : The drug prevents white blood cells called lymphocytes from leaving the lymph nodes and entering the blood and the brain and spinal cord. : administered intravenously four times a year, has been approved for especially severe forms of relapsing-remitting and secondary progressive MS. This drug has been associated with development of certain types of blood cancers in up to 1% of patients, as well as with heart damage. Therefore, this drug should be used as a last resort to treat patients with a form of MS that leads to rapid loss of function and for whom other treatments did not stop the disease. : In March 2017, the FDA approved ocrelizumab (brand name Ocrevus) to treat adults with relapsing forms of MS and primary progressive multiple sclerosis. : works by preventing cells of the immune system from entering the brain and spinal cord. It is administered intravenously once a month. It is a very effective drug for many people, but it is associated with an increased risk of a potentially fatal viral infection of the brain called progressive multifocal encephalopathy (PML). Disease-modifying medications have been shown to: Reduce the frequency and severity of clinical attacks (also called relapses or exacerbations) Reduce the accumulation of lesions (damaged or active disease areas) within the brain and spinal cord Appear to slow down the accumulation of disability Severe relapses are usually treated with a 3-5-day course of high-dose, intravenous corticosteroids, often followed by a slow taper of oral prednisone.

This approval provides another treatment option for people living with relapsing forms of MS and specifically includes people with secondary progressive MS who are continuing to experience active disease.   “We are pleased that there is a new oral treatment option for people with relapsing MS,” said Kathy Costello, MS, ANP-BC, MSCN, Associate Vice President of Healthcare Access at the National MS Society.    (.pdf)  (.pdf) DETAILS The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved Vumerity™ (diroximel fumarate, Biogen and Alkermes plc) as a disease-modifying therapy for people with relapsing forms of MS, including  (an initial neurological episode), , and active . People with active secondary progressive MS have had progression of disability but still experience acute relapses or new MRI activity.   Multiple sclerosis involves immune system attacks that cause inflammation and damage in the brain and spinal cord tissues. Vumerity is similar to Tecfidera but has a distinct chemical structure that has been shown to be better tolerated, with fewer reported gastrointestinal side effects than Tecfidera. Once in the body, Vumerity rapidly converts to the same active ingredient as Tecfidera. Because of the bio-equivalence to Tecfidera, it was not necessary for Vumerity to undergo extensive clinical trials to demonstrate benefits for relapsing MS. Although their exact mechanisms of action are not known, Vumerity and Tecfidera are thought to modulate the immune response to be less inflammatory and may have antioxidant properties that could be protective against damage to the brain and spinal cord.   Biogen Inc. and Alkermes plc announced top-line results of a five-week, Phase III study that compared gastrointestinal side effects and tolerability of Vumerity and Tecfidera. According to a press release, diroximel fumarate was better tolerated and had significantly fewer reported gastrointestinal symptoms compared to Tecfidera. The most common adverse events for both treatment groups were flushing, diarrhea and nausea. Rates of these events were significantly lower for the diroximel fumarate group, and fewer people on diroximel fumarate dropped out of the study due to side effects.   The approval of Vumerity is based largely on the FDA’s findings of safety and efficacy for Tecfidera. Twice-daily Tecfidera was shown in clinical trials to significantly reduce relapses and disease activity on MRIs, and in one trial it reduced progression of disability. The Tecfidera approval was based on results of two large-scale phase III studies, called DEFINE and CONFIRM, which were conducted in people with relapsing-remitting MS. The results were published in 2012.   Like Tecfidera, Vumerity may cause serious side effects including: allergic reaction (such as welts, hives, or difficulty breathing); PML (progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy - a rare brain infection that can lead to death or severe disability over a period of weeks or months); decreases in white blood cell count, and liver problems.   The most common side effects of Vumerity include: flushing, redness, itching, or rash; nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, stomach pain, or indigestion. Flushing and stomach problems are the most common reactions, especially at the start of therapy, and may decrease over time. Taking Vumerity with food (avoid high-fat, high-calorie meal or snack) may help reduce flushing. The (.pdf)provides full information on potential side effects.   Before starting treatment, the FDA recommends that a person’s health care provider assess a recent (within 6 months) blood cell count, and repeat the blood cell count every 6 to 12 months thereafter. Providers should test liver function before starting treatment, and during treatment if clinically indicated. Vumerity is not recommended for people with moderate to severe impairment of kidney function. Before treatment with Vumerity, women should talk to their health care providers if they are pregnant or planning to become pregnant. There are no adequate data on the developmental risk associated with the use of Vumerity in pregnant women.   Taking a disease-modifying therapy is currently the best way to reduce MS disease activity and future deterioration.

Why should a person with MS consider taking a disease-modifying therapy? A. Taking a disease-modifying therapy is currently the best way to reduce MS disease activity and future deterioration. Studies comparing people in clinical trials who started therapy earlier than those on inactive placebo suggest that early treatment offered important benefits against the accumulation of disability, which were generally not experienced to the same degree by those who started treatment later.  Selecting an MS therapy should be done by people with MS in collaboration with their MS healthcare provider, taking into account a variety of factors, including the effectiveness of any therapy they are currently using, and weighing potential risks and benefits, costs and lifestyle factors.  Q. Should I switch from my current therapy to Vumerity? A. The decision about whether to take Vumerity should be made in collaboration with your MS doctor, taking into account a variety of factors including the effectiveness of any therapy you are currently using, the potential risks and benefits, as well as costs and lifestyle factors. Important questions to be considered and discussed with your doctor in terms of Vumerity include: What is my tolerance for the risk of known side effects? What is my tolerance for the risk of adverse consequences that might emerge with longer-term use? How will my medication choice affect my ability or plans to become pregnant? What are the comparative costs of my current therapy versus Vumerity?  A. There is no specified time limit for taking Vumerity. Q. Are there any risk factors or medical conditions that would make it inappropriate for an individual to take Vumerity? A. Vumerity is not recommended for people with moderate to severe impairment of kidney function. Before treatment with Vumerity, women should talk to their health care providers if they are pregnant or planning to become pregnant. There are no adequate data on the developmental risk associated with the use of Vumerity in pregnant women. Q. Will a person taking Vumerity have to get any special medical tests or monitoring? A. Before starting treatment, the FDA recommends that a person’s health care provider assess a recent (within 6 months) blood cell count, and repeat the blood cell count every 6 to 12 months thereafter. Providers should test liver function before starting treatment and during treatment if needed.  A.The yearly cost of Vumerity was announced to be $88,000wholesale acquisition cost (WAC). The actual cost to an individual who has MS will depend on the provisions of his or her insurance coverage and the degree to which that individual will be eligible for programs designed to assist with out-of-pocket costs. Q. What is the Society's view of the cost of Vumerity? A. “Vumerity is an efficacious and tolerable treatment option for people with relapsing MS, but being priced only $500 lower than the least expensive oral disease modifying treatment, does not show the commitment to affordable access that we had hoped,” said Bari Talente, Executive Vice President, Advocacy, National MS Society.  “We know that high wholesale acquisition cost (WAC) prices for MS disease modifying treatments put a heavy burden on people with MS.

Relapsing forms of MS  includes people with  (an initial episode of neurological symptoms), , and active . People with active secondary progressive MS have had progression of disability but still experience acute relapses or new MRI activity. Vumerity is similar to dimethyl fumarate (Tecfidera, Biogen) but has a distinct chemical structure that has been shown to have fewer reported gastrointestinal side effects than Tecfidera. This approval provides another treatment option for people living with relapsing forms of MS and specifically includes people with secondary progressive MS who are continuing to experience active disease.   “We are pleased that there is a new oral treatment option for people with relapsing MS,” said Kathy Costello, MS, ANP-BC, MSCN, Associate Vice President of Healthcare Access at the National MS Society.    (.pdf)  (.pdf) DETAILS The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved Vumerity™ (diroximel fumarate, Biogen and Alkermes plc) as a disease-modifying therapy for people with relapsing forms of MS, including  (an initial neurological episode), , and active . People with active secondary progressive MS have had progression of disability but still experience acute relapses or new MRI activity.   Multiple sclerosis involves immune system attacks that cause inflammation and damage in the brain and spinal cord tissues. Vumerity is similar to Tecfidera but has a distinct chemical structure that has been shown to be better tolerated, with fewer reported gastrointestinal side effects than Tecfidera. Once in the body, Vumerity rapidly converts to the same active ingredient as Tecfidera. Because of the bio-equivalence to Tecfidera, it was not necessary for Vumerity to undergo extensive clinical trials to demonstrate benefits for relapsing MS. Although their exact mechanisms of action are not known, Vumerity and Tecfidera are thought to modulate the immune response to be less inflammatory and may have antioxidant properties that could be protective against damage to the brain and spinal cord.   Biogen Inc. and Alkermes plc announced top-line results of a five-week, Phase III study that compared gastrointestinal side effects and tolerability of Vumerity and Tecfidera. According to a press release, diroximel fumarate was better tolerated and had significantly fewer reported gastrointestinal symptoms compared to Tecfidera. The most common adverse events for both treatment groups were flushing, diarrhea and nausea. Rates of these events were significantly lower for the diroximel fumarate group, and fewer people on diroximel fumarate dropped out of the study due to side effects.   The approval of Vumerity is based largely on the FDA’s findings of safety and efficacy for Tecfidera.

It is made up of exactly the same amino acids (major components of proteins) as the interferon beta found in the human body. In controlled clinical trials in relapsing MS, those taking the medication had a reduced risk of disability progression, experienced fewer exacerbations, and showed a reduction in number and size of active lesions in the brain (as shown on MRI) when compared with the group taking a placebo. In a subsequent study of patients who had experienced a single demyelinating event in the optic nerve, spinal cord, or brainstem, and had lesions typical of MS on brain MRI, Avonex significantly delayed the time to a second exacerbation, and thus to a clinically definite diagnosis of MS. Avonex is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis, which include clinically isolated syndrome, relapsing-remitting disease (RRMS) and active secondary progressive disease (SPMS with relapses).

Genetic screening of people with primary progressive MS has shown that four rare genetic changes, which are known to cause other neurological diseases, may play a role in primary progressive MS Primary progressive MS is a less common form of MS, in which disability accumulates from the outset of the disease rather than the intermittent ‘attacks’ seen in relapsing-remitting MS Until now, genetic research has not identified any genetic changes specific to this type of MS Genetic screening of people with primary progressive MS has now identified that four rare genetic changes, known to cause other neurological diseases, may be playing a role in primary progressive MS Genetic changes related to a neurological disease called spastic paraplegia were also found to be more common in people with progressive MS These new genetic discoveries may help provide clues as to why some people develop the primary progressive form of MS and possible treatment approaches to slow or stop disability accumulation Although many genes that contribute to the risk of developing MS have been discovered, research has not yet identified genes that are specifically linked to the risk of developing the primary progressive form of MS. Now, a new international study has shown that rare changes to genes that cause other brain diseases may also play a role in primary progressive MS. Primary progressive MS is a less common form of MS, in which disability accumulates from the outset of symptoms. This type of MS tends to be diagnosed later in life than the more common relapsing-remitting form of MS. It also affects both men and women equally, whereas relapsing MS affects two – three times more women than men. To date, there have been no clues as to why some people develop the progressive forms of MS. Many large international studies have asked the question of whether a person’s genes may affect their risk of developing MS and it is now known that over 200 genes are involved in the risk of developing any kind of MS. However, genes specifically linked to the risk of developing primary progressive MS have not yet been identified. A new  sought to identify whether rare changes to genes might be linked to primary progressive MS. The researchers focused specifically on those genes known to cause other neurological disorders that have symptoms similar to progressive MS. The first stage of the study involved screening all of the genes from 38 people with primary progressive MS and 81 people without MS. This screen identified 15 genetic changes that were likely to be meaningful for progressive MS. Whilst small differences do exist between different people’s DNA codes, in this study, the researchers identified that the changes were rare DNA changes not found in the majority of people and were likely to cause damage to the functioning of certain types of cells. These genetic changes were also known to be linked to other neurological disorders. Importantly, the changes were not present in the people who did not have MS. To confirm whether or not these genetic changes were genuinely linked to primary progressive MS, the researchers investigated how commonly these changes were found in a larger group of people with primary progressive MS and people without MS. They also looked for the changes in a group of people with relapsing forms of MS, in order to identify whether the genetic changes were specifically linked to progressive MS or simply part of the genetic ‘story’ for all people with MS. In the results, four of the 15 gene changes were identified as specifically important for primary progressive MS. These changes were linked to a number of disorders with gradually worsening neurological symptoms, including spastic paraplegia, megalencephalic leukodystrophy with subcortical cysts and tuberous sclerosis. Since two of the changes were related to spastic paraplegia, the researchers proceeded to analyse whether other genetic changes linked to that disease are more common in people with primary progressive MS. They looked at 169 genetic changes related to spastic paraplegia and found that they were more common, not only in people with primary progressive MS, but also people with secondary progressive MS. The gene changes were far less likely to be found in people with relapsing-remitting MS, suggesting that these genetic changes are contributing specifically to the risk of a person developing a progressive MS disease course. Determining the role of genes in influencing whether an individual’s MS will take a progressive course is hugely important in understanding the biology of progressive MS and will help researchers to identify new treatment options that could slow or stop the accumulation of disability for people with progressive MS. The next step will be to look more closely at the biological functions of these genes and identify exactly how they make people more vulnerable to developing progressive MS.

With the right information and support, relapses can be managed effectively to maintain a healthy and active lifestyle. A relapse is a relatively sudden (over hours or days) episode of new, or worsening of existing, multiple sclerosis symptoms If you have relapse concerns talk to your MS nurse or GP as soon as possible. Relapses can be a sign that your multiple sclerosis is active so it’s important to report each one, even if you don't think you need medical treatment. Once your neurologist or MS nurse has confirmed you’re having a relapse, they should discuss your symptoms with you and decide whether you need treatment for the relapse itself or the symptoms. Not all relapses need treatment. The symptoms of a relapse will generally improve on their own. You can find out more about managing a relapse in the .

The damage to the optic nerves produces swelling and inflammation that cause pain and loss of vision; the damage to the spinal cord causes weakness or paralysis in the legs or arms, loss of sensation, and problems with bladder and bowel function. NMO is a relapsing-remitting disease. During a relapse, new damage to the optic nerves and/or spinal cord can lead to accumulating disability. Unlike MS, there is no progressive phase of this disease. Therefore, preventing attacks is critical to a good long-term outcome. The cause of NMO in the majority of cases is due to a specific attack on the aquaporin-4 (AQP4) water channel located within the optic nerves and spinal cord. Aquaporins (AQPs) are proteins that transport water across cell membranes. More than 70% of NMO and NMOSD patients test positive for an antibody biomarker in the blood called the NMO-IgG or anti-AQP4 antibody. In people with NMO who test negative for anti-AQP4 antibodies, up to a third may be positive for auto-antibodies directed against a component of myelin called myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG). People with anti-MOG related NMO similarly have episodes of transverse myelitis and optic neuritis, but recovery after attacks appears to be better than anti-AQP4 related disease.   There are an estimated 4,000 people with NMO in the United States and a quarter-million people worldwide. NMO is more common in women (greater than 80 percent) than men; NMO occurs in all parts of the world and may be the most common form of demyelinating disease in certain populations such as Africans, Asians and Native Americans. NMO can occur at any age — in children as young as 3 and adults as old as 90 — but appears most often between ages 40 and 50. NMO is considered to be an autoimmune disease (where the immune system reacts against healthy tissue as if it was a threat). In the majority of cases of NMO, the immune system recognizes the AQP4 water channel as foreign and develops antibodies (NMO-IgG or anti-AQP4 antibody) to attack AQP4 on the surface of astrocytes, which in turn damages the astrocytes. Astrocytes are supportive cells in the brain, spinal cord and optic nerves, and damage to astrocytes is believed to lead to demyelination. In cases associated with anti-MOG antibodies, it is considered that anti-MOG antibodies may trigger an attack on the myelin sheath resulting in demyelination. Symptoms are generally more severe after an NMO attack than an MS attack. NMO rarely has a secondary progressive stage as in MS; disabilities accumulate from repeated acute attacks. NMO is present across the world, especially among non-Caucasians; MS has a higher incidence in temperate climates and Caucasians. Fatigue in NMO is usually an indirect result of living with the disease and its symptoms (secondary fatigue); in MS, fatigue is both primary (caused by the disease process itself) and secondary. NMO usually affects only the optic nerve and spinal cord at the beginning of the disease, although there may be lesions present in other specific areas of the brain. MS typically affects the brain as well as the spinal cord and optic nerve. NMO-IgG (anti-AQP4 antibody) is not found in people with MS but is found in 70 percent of those with NMO. In MS, individual episodes are usually mild; their cumulative effect over time may or not not cause progressive disability. In NMO, the opposite is true and therefore early diagnosis is critical; acute episodes are usually severe and – if untreated – can have devastating, irreversible effects on function. Some people with NMO also have other autoimmune diseases such as Sjogren’s Syndrome or Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE).

An scan is the best way to locate lesions (also called plaques) in the brain or spinal cord. An MRI scan is abnormal in more than 95% of people recently diagnosed with MS. But abnormal MRI results do not always mean that you have MS. Abnormalities show up on scans from many illnesses other than MS. An abnormal finding on an MRI scan alone is not enough to diagnose MS. Your doctor will confirm a diagnosis of MS based on your symptoms, your neurological exam, and the results from an MRI and other tests. When abnormal MRI results occur along with a medical history, abnormal nervous system exam, and other test results that are typical of MS, it is very likely that you have MS. If you have already been diagnosed with MS, MRI scans can sometimes distinguish new lesions from older ones and can help your doctor(s) follow the progress of the disease. Continuing to have periodic MRI scans if you have may help identify new lesions even when you are not having symptoms from those new lesions. If you have had just one episode of MS-like symptoms and are trying to decide whether to start treatment with medicine, MRI scans can be helpful in assessing the progress of the disease. If new lesions are developing or if existing lesions are growing—regardless of whether you have had further episodes of MS symptoms—most doctors will recommend that you begin treatment.

Reaching an evidence-based prognosis for personalized treatment of multiple sclerosis , –() Personalized treatment is ideal for multiple sclerosis (MS) owing to the heterogeneity of clinical features, but current knowledge gaps, including validation of biomarkers and treatment algorithms, limit practical implementation. The contemporary approach to personalized MS therapy depends on evidence-based prognostication, an initial treatment choice and evaluation of early treatment responses to identify the need to switch therapy. Prognostication is directed by baseline clinical, environmental and demographic factors, MRI measures and biomarkers that correlate with long-term disability measures. The initial treatment choice should be a shared decision between the patient and physician. In addition to prognosis, this choice must account for patient-related factors, including comorbidities, pregnancy planning, preferences of the patients and their comfort with risk, and drug-related factors, including safety, cost and implications for treatment sequencing. Treatment response has traditionally been assessed on the basis of relapse rate, MRI lesions and disability progression. Larger longitudinal data sets have enabled development of composite outcome measures and more stringent standards for disease control. Biomarkers, including neurofilament light chain, have potential as early surrogate markers of prognosis and treatment response but require further validation. Overall, attainment of personalized treatment for MS is complex but will be refined as new data become available. Personalized treatment of multiple sclerosis (MS) depends on prognostication at baseline, a shared treatment decision between the physician and patient, and early assessment of response to therapy. Prognosis can be evaluated soon after diagnosis on the basis of demographic and environmental factors, clinical features, MRI measures and biomarkers. Individuals with poor prognostic features should be recommended high-efficacy therapies early on; studies are underway to investigate whether most patients with relapsing–remitting MS could benefit from initial aggressive therapy. During the treatment discussion between the neurologist and patient, factors such as comorbidities, pregnancy planning, patient preferences, risk tolerance, safety, cost and treatment sequencing should be considered in addition to prognosis. Early assessment of treatment response is important to identify the need to switch therapy; composite outcome measures that incorporate clinical and MRI data are best for predicting long-term disability. Personalized MS therapy is currently limited by a lack of evidence-based biomarkers; newer biomarkers, such as neurofilament light chain, have potential, but further validation and standardization of assays are required.

New information includes the ability of Aubagio to reduce the risk of relapse in people who have experienced a first clinical event suggestive of MS (clinically isolated syndrome) – this is the first such report in anMS treatment. Aubagio was approved by the FDA in September 2012 for people with relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis. Aubagio is an oral compound that inhibits the rapid proliferation of cells, including immune cells that have been implicated in MS. Investigators worldwide recruited 618 people 18-55 years of age with clinically isolated syndrome (CIS, a first clinical episode suggestive of MS) who showed two or more areas of damage on MRI scans and had experienced their neurological symptoms within 90 days prior to entering the study. Participants were randomly assigned to receive 7 mg teriflunomide, 14 mg teriflunomide, or placebo once daily for 108 weeks. The primary outcome measured was time to relapse.  A secondary endpoint was time to relapse or the occurrence of new tissue damage on MRI scans, whichever occurred first. The risk of relapse was reduced by 42.6% among those taking 14 mg of Aubagio, and by 37.2% among those taking 7 mg Aubagio, compared to those taking placebo. For the secondary endpoint, the risk of relapse or occurrence of new tissue damage was reduced by 34.9% in the 14-mg group and 31.4 % in the 7-mg group compared with the placebo group. The most common adverse events reported in the Aubagio groups were liver enzyme elevations, hair thinning, diarrhea, upper respiratory infection, and paresthesia (e.g., burning sensations, pins and needles, stabbing pains). There was one death due to suicide in the placebo arm. () Investigators worldwide recruited 1,169 people with relapsing forms of MS, and randomly assigned them to receive teriflunomide 7 mg or 14 mg, once daily by mouth, or placebo for 48 weeks. The primary endpoint was whether the study drug reduced the average number of relapses per year significantly more than placebo. Secondary endpoints included the time to disability progression confirmed for at least 12 weeks. Teriflunomide 14 mg reduced relapses by 36.3% versus placebo and 7 mg reduced relapses by 22.3% versus placebo. In the 14 mg-group, the risk of sustained disability progression was reduced by 31.5%; the lower dose did not significantly reduce progression. Three deaths occurred in the teriflunomide groups – from sepsis, suicide, and motor vehicle accident. Participants in the teriflunomide groups experienced more liver enzyme elevation, headache, and hair thinning. () Aubagio is Pregnancy Category X, as designated by the FDA, meaning that it may cause major birth defects if used during pregnancy. Aubagio is contraindicated in pregnant women or women of childbearing potential who are not using reliable contraception.

0336c46e-0b7d-4389-a011-ce727fd40e09,"MS, the coronavirus and vaccines – updated global advice MS, the coronavirus and vaccines – updated global advice A new small study has discovered molecules in the blood that are specific to people with MS, and can distinguish between relapsing remitting and progressive MS. A promising study has found some molecules in the blood which may help diagnose MS. This work could be used to develop a simple blood test to diagnose MS, as well as detect which type (relapsing remitting or progressive) of MS one has. Currently, there are no definitive tests for MS, nor its progression. Diagnosis and disease monitoring relies on several parameters, including clinical examination and MRI. These tests are costly and have a limited ability to discriminate between relapsing remitting and progressive MS. In this study, published in the highly prestigious , Associate Professor Buckland and his team from the University of Sydney and the Royal Prince Alfred Hospital have discovered some specific molecules called microRNAs. These microRNAs are present at different levels in exosomes in the blood of people with MS compared to those without. Additionally, they were able to use these exosomal microRNAs to distinguish between the different types of MS. Exosomes are small particles which are shed by all cells in the body. Cells excrete them as a method of communication, often trafficking contents of cells such as microRNAs and cellular proteins. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short bits of RNA, a DNA-like material which can regulate how cells use their genes. They can act as gene switches, telling cells to use or not to use various genes in the human body. So far over 1800 of these switches have been identified in humans. MicroRNAs in exosomes are thought to be a normal part of the way cells communicate, however in inflammatory diseases, such as MS, there is an increase in the number of these exosomes shed into the blood. During this study, the levels of miRNAs in blood exosomes of 25 people with MS (14 with relapsing remitting, 7 with secondary progressive and 4 with primary progressive) and 11 people without MS were compared. Using techniques called Next Generation Sequencing and integrative bioinformatics, the researchers sequenced the miRNAs found in the exosomes, and compared it between the different groups of people. They found combinations of miRNAs or miRNA profiles, that could differentiate those with MS and those without, but they also could differentiate between people with progressive MS and those with relapsing remitting MS. Importantly, the scientists were able to replicate their findings in a separate group of 11 people with progressive MS, validating their results. In a press release issued by the University of Sydney, Professor Michael Buckland is quoted as saying, “This is the first demonstration that micro-RNAs in the blood are informative biomarkers not only for the diagnosis of MS, but in predicting disease subtypes.” These miRNAs may be able to give us great insight into the mechanism of MS, as these molecules can cross the blood brain barrier (a membrane which normally separates the circulating blood from the brain), so may have originated from the very brain cells that are under attack in MS. But, more immediately, this work could soon be turned into a simple blood test that will allow the diagnosis of MS to be made in a more timely manner when combined with other test or clinical observations. This may allow a more rapid diagnosis, meaning people with MS may be able to begin treatment earlier. This in turn may lead to fewer relapses and a slower loss of brain volume, resulting in better outcomes for the individual with MS.

a4fda9bb-219d-4e01-9a1c-5a491b400638,"Disease Course, Diagnosis, Treatment Options, and Overall Wellness Edited by Susan Wells Courtney, MSAA Senior Writer Reviewed by Barry A. Hendin, MD, MSAA Chief Medical Officer The last few years have seen plenty of welcome news regarding pediatric multiple sclerosis (MS). In 2018, Gilenya (fingolimod) became the first disease-modifying therapy (DMT) approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in children and adolescents. Several other DMTs already approved for use in adults are in late stages of evaluation for pediatric MS. Researchers are investigating a role for stem-cell therapy, and are pursuing new classes of drugs that would restore the nerve-protecting myelin sheath that becomes damaged in MS. Experts report that the average time from onset of symptoms to diagnosis of pediatric MS is declining, which means that the medical community is considering the possibility of an MS diagnosis in young patients at an earlier time. Clinicians have more knowledge than ever about the course of MS in children and adolescents, risk factors for relapse, how to manage symptoms, and other aspects of medical management. Risk Factors for Pediatric MS Coming into Sharper Focus Clinical Trials: The Key to Progress in Treating Pediatric MS Support and Resources for Families Facing Pediatric MS Mary Karpinski, LMSW, reviews those encouraging developments when she meets with the parents of a young person recently diagnosed with MS, but the most reassuring message she delivers concerns something that can’t be seen on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or quantified in an annualized relapse rate. “I remind parents that children are incredibly resilient. I explain that I’ve found young people with MS to be particularly strong, and that they can get through pretty much anything so long as parents give them the building blocks to succeed, and do not let their own worries lead them to impose well-intentioned but overly restrictive limits on what their child can do.” Ms. Karpinski speaks from considerable experience. For the past 13 years she has served as the single point of access for young people with MS receiving care at the Pediatric MS Center of the UBMD Neurology/Jacobs Neurological Institute of the University at Buffalo. “I’ve been privileged to work with and assist many young people with MS as they’ve moved from childhood into adulthood. When parents first learn that their child has MS, one of the questions they inevitably ask is, ‘What will the future hold?’ I tell them about the many young people I’ve worked with who have earned college degrees, married, built meaningful careers, and had children of their own. Some have faced more challenges than others, and everyone’s path is different, but these children – and their parents – are the most inspiring people I have met,” the social worker says. This cover story examines the progress that has been made in helping these young people deal with MS, developments on the near horizon, the key unanswered questions about pediatric MS, and experts’ advice on enhancing the health and quality of life for young people with MS. Latest information about the course of pediatric MS Exploring how – and why – pediatric MS is similar to and different from MS in adults has been a major focus of researchers. These investigators are analyzing the commonalities and contrasts for insights into everything from the factors that trigger the onset of MS in young people, to the way therapies approved for use in adults are likely to affect the course of MS in children and adolescents. While relapsing-remitting MS is by far the most common form of the disease in newly diagnosed adults, it appears to be even more predominant in children and adolescents, representing 93% or more of all pediatric cases. Meanwhile, researchers at Partners Multiple Sclerosis Center in Boston have found that young people have relapses two to three times more often than adults, and that this difference persists over at least the first six years from onset of symptoms. However, there is evidence that young people generally recover from relapses more quickly than adults. Research suggests that pediatric-onset MS takes longer to diminish physical abilities than does adult-onset MS, and also is slower to develop into secondary-progressive MS. British researchers who examined long-term outcomes in more than 2,000 MS patients found that those who developed the disease before 18 years of age, took on average, 23.8 years to reach an Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score of 4 (on the scale, 0 represents no disability, while progression toward higher numbers leading up to 10, indicates increasing disability) versus 15.5 years for people who developed MS as adults. Similarly, time to development of secondary-progressive MS was 32 years for pediatric-onset patients and 18 years for adult-onset patients. Conversely, compared to adult-onset MS, pediatric-onset MS appears to have a greater impact on cognitive function in the years following onset of symptoms. Italian investigators who studied 48 pediatric MS patients found that 31% had some degree of cognitive impairment on initial evaluation, and that this proportion increased to 38% over five years. Meanwhile, a recent study of more than 5,700 adults with MS found that those who developed the disease as children or adolescents were roughly 1.5-times more likely to have cognitive impairment in adulthood than people whose symptoms began when they already were adults, and that this increased risk was independent of the person’s age or duration of MS. Given these findings, Emmanuelle Waubant, MD, recommends neuropsychological testing of children and adolescents who are newly diagnosed with MS. “Getting a baseline is very helpful, and can help inform approaches to working with the child’s school and other aspects of comprehensive care,” explains Dr. Waubant, a professor of neurology at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) with extensive clinical and research expertise in pediatric MS. She advises follow-up testing two-to-three years later, unless a concern in the interim warrants earlier re-evaluation. Ms. Karpinski notes that the testing can help parents identify areas of strength and need – and, as a result – better understand the challenges their child may be facing, set realistic expectations, and advocate effectively for their son or daughter. She adds, however, that it is important for parents to meet with the specialist who evaluated their child to review the test results and their implications. “The reports containing the test results can be difficult to read, both in terms of the technical language employed, and sometimes, in terms of what the evaluation identified. Rather than trying to puzzle that out on their own, parents should sit with the specialist and get the background needed to avoid misunderstandings and put the results in context,” she says. Parents also need to be aware of the heightened presence of anxiety and mood disorders in young people with MS, and to include mental-health professionals in their care team, as needed, Ms. Karpinski adds. A study of 23 young people aged 6 to 17 who had MS or another demyelinating disorder found that 48% met the criteria for a psychiatric diagnosis, with almost one-third having anxiety disorders and about 10% having depression. Another study, this one involving 45 young people, found that cognitive impairment is more common among pediatric MS patients with mood and anxiety disorders than among those without a psychiatric diagnosis. Eighty percent of the study participants who had been diagnosed with an anxiety disorder, a depressive disorder, or attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), had evidence of cognitive impairment. By contrast, 55% of the 20 participants who did not have a psychiatric disorder demonstrated cognitive impairment on testing. In exploring why the course of pediatric MS often differs from that of adult MS, researchers have noted that disease onset in young people is marked by a higher disease burden and more disease activity on MRI than is seen in adults. In a study of 41 individuals with pediatric-onset MS and 35 individuals who developed MS as adults, Dr. Waubant and colleagues found that the children had a median 21 T2-bright lesions, as opposed to six in adults, and had more T2-bright areas generally and focal points in enhancing lesions, indicating greater disease activity. Another study involving 19 children and 12 adults with MS found that the pediatric patients hadw more extensive acute damage to the axons that carry electrical impulses from the central nervous system’s main type of cell, the neuron. Those and other findings suggest that pediatric MS is more inflammatory in nature than adult-onset MS. Meanwhile, another age-related aspect of MS may offer important insights into factors contributing to onset of disease. While less than 1% of all cases of MS develop before age 10 to 12 years, the condition affects boys and girls in that age group in roughly equal proportion. By age 12 and older, however, the female:male ratio in pediatric MS shifts to 2.8:1, a gender split similar to that seen in adult-onset patients. Tanuja Chitnis, MD, a professor of neurology at Harvard Medical School and pediatric MS expert at Massachusetts General Hospital and Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston, noted in a 2013 article that this shift suggests a role for puberty in MS risk. E. Ann Yeh, MD, MA, FCRPC, says that just 15 years or so ago, the main challenge in diagnosing pediatric MS wasn’t necessarily obtaining an MRI to see what happening in a brain. Rather, she explains, the bigger issue often was what was happening in a brain. “Pediatricians, and even child neurologists, just weren’t trained to think in terms of children having MS. We were given the impression in residency and fellowship that MS did not occur in children, or that if it did, it was so rare that MS should not be high on the list of possibilities to consider when a young person presented with symptoms that could reflect a demyelinating event,” recalls Dr. Yeh. Today, as director of the MS and Demyelinating Disorders Program at The Hospital for Sick Children (SickKids) in Toronto, the physician sees dozens of children with MS from across Ontario and nearby Canadian provinces and American states. Greater awareness that pediatric MS is a real – albeit quite uncommon – condition has contributed to significant improvements in the timeliness and accuracy of diagnosis, according to Dr. Yeh, who is also a senior associate scientist in Neurosciences & Mental Health at SickKids and a professor of pediatrics (Neurology) at the University of Toronto. Factors such as increased access to MRI and the development of a diagnostic pathway by the International Pediatric MS Study Group (IPMSSG) have been particularly important in this regard, notes Dr. Yeh, who estimates that the average child with MS is now diagnosed within about six months of symptom onset. The IPMSSG guidance is intended to help clinicians evaluate young people who present with indications of a possible acquired demyelinating syndrome, meaning symptoms suggesting that the myelin sheath that coats nerves in the central nervous system has been damaged. Such symptoms may include visual loss, double vision, sensations of tingling or numbness, weakness, abnormal or uncoordinated movements, and urinary issues, similar to adults who develop relapsing-remitting MS. Acquired demyelinating syndromes (ADS) in pediatric patients include acute disseminating encephalomyelitis (ADEM), neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders (NMOSD), clinically isolated syndromes (CIS), and multiple sclerosis. Beyond distinguishing between the conditions within that group of disorders, however, pediatric neurologists also need to consider other conditions that may cause the same symptoms seen with demyelinating syndromes. “The differential diagnosis for pediatric MS is quite broad, and includes a number of ‘MS mimics’ that are different from those that have to be considered when evaluating potential adult-onset MS,” notes Dr. Waubant. To help narrow that differential diagnosis, which essentially is a list of possible causes, the IPMSSG’s 2016 evaluation pathway identifies red flags that suggest a child may not have a demyelinating syndrome. The document also recommends a protocol for employing blood tests, assessment of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), imaging, and other steps to identify specific demyelinating syndromes, including MS. The IPMSSG notes that a diagnosis of pediatric MS is warranted when a child or adolescent has two or more episodes presumed to be caused by inflammatory demyelination that do not represent ADEM and that occur more than 30 days apart. The episodes must involve more than one site in the central nervous system. The group also identifies three other, less-common scenarios that justify the diagnosis. However, Dr. Waubant notes that an intriguing, related question remains unanswered. “In the last 10 years or so, we’ve tended to see more patients with pediatric MS than we did previously. Greater awareness of the condition and improved diagnosis clearly play roles in this, but we just don’t know whether – beyond those factors – there also has been an increase in the actual number of children and adolescents who are developing MS,” she explains. Dr. Yeh agrees, and notes that as physicians become more skilled at making an early diagnosis, along with greater patient access to magnetic resonance imaging, the proportion of cases of pediatric MS that go unrecognized will be reduced. According to Dr. Yeh, “We should be able to tell what’s happening.” She adds that even accounting for such issues, “the numbers do seem to be going up.” (See “Risk Factors for Pediatric MS Coming into Sharper Focus.”) Recent study-based estimates of the incidence – or number of new cases per year – of pediatric MS vary from 0.07 to 2.9 per 100,000 children. Even the higher figure in that range represents an extremely small percentage of young people, however, and it is estimated that there are fewer than 5,000 pediatric MS patients in the United States. More treatment options and more patients receiving treatment The FDA has approved 17 DMTs for use in adults with MS. Eight, including the longest-approved agents, are administered by injection, while five are taken orally, and four are infused intravenously. Only one of those medications, the oral-agent Gilenya (fingolimod), is also approved for use in children and adolescents aged 10 years and older. The FDA expanded Gilenya’s indication to include pediatric MS patients in May 2018. Even before that approval, many pediatric MS specialists prescribed DMTs for their patients in an attempt to prevent relapses and disease progression. However, they often proceeded hesitantly because of a lack of data on the agents’ optimal dosing and safety profile in children and adolescents. Recent years have seen that hesitancy yields to a more pro-active approach, according to Dr. Waubant. “There has been a trend over time to treat pediatric MS more aggressively,” she notes, explaining that several factors are propelling the trend. One, she notes, is growing evidence that early intervention in the MS-disease process can favorably impact not only a patient’s current health, but also long-term well-being. At the same time, clinical trials, observational studies, and patient registries are providing reassuring data about the safety profiles of DMTs in children and adolescents. Expanded options, particularly in terms of route of administration, also has helped. “Teenagers very often are reluctant to consider agents that require an injection, but are willing to take an oral agent,” the pediatric MS expert notes. The fact that one agent has been approved by the FDA for use in children and adolescents, and that other DMTs approved for adults are in late stages in clinical evaluation in pediatric populations, has also made both parents and payers (insurance companies) more receptive to DMTs for young patients, Dr. Waubant adds. Gilenya secured its pediatric indication on the basis of the Phase III PARADIGMS trial, which studied more than 200 young people with pediatric MS. Other pediatric studies of DMTs already approved for use in adults include ongoing Phase III trials of Aubagio (teriflunomide) and Tecfidera (dimethyl fumaric acid), an ongoing open-label trial of Lemtrada (alemtuzumab), and completed open-label trials of Tysabri (natalizumab) and Tecfidera. However, Dr. Waubant and several of her colleagues belonging to the IPMSSG note that enrollment challenges and other obstacles mean that “Phase III trials for every newly approved therapy for adult MS in the pediatric MS population are simply not feasible.” Writing in the journal earlier this year, they noted, “In the last years, convincing evidence has emerged that the biological processes involved in MS are largely shared across the age span. As such, treatments proven efficacious for the care of adults with MS have a biological rationale for use in pediatric MS given the relapsing-remitting course at onset and high relapse frequency. There are also ethical considerations on conducting clinical trials in this age group including the use of placebo owing to highly active disease. It is imperative to reconsider study design and implementation based on what information is needed.” The group went on to propose recommendations that would enable future studies to adequately assess the safety of DMT use in pediatric patients while avoiding some of the trial-design issues that made it difficult to obtain timely, meaningful results. (See ) Such studies are all the more important given the above-referenced trend toward the increased use of DMTs in children and adolescents. An analysis of 748 pediatric MS patients receiving care at practices in the US Network of Pediatric MS Centers found that 78% had received a DMT before reaching 18 years of age. However, there are indications that the more-proactive approach being taken by clinicians at pediatric MS centers is not being uniformly adopted nationwide. An analysis of claims data for 288 children and adolescents diagnosed with pediatric MS from 2010 to 2017 found that 65% did not receive a DMT in the 12 months following their diagnosis. Other research into treatment of pediatric MS is looking beyond DMTs. Several small studies have evaluated the safety and efficacy of Rituxan (rituximab) in pediatric MS. This monoclonal antibody, which depletes certain types of B cells, primarily is used in the treatment of leukemias and lymphomas. It is not approved for use in either adult or pediatric MS, but has been employed by some clinicians to treat multiple sclerosis. Investigators are also exploring the role that stem-cell therapy may play in treating pediatric MS, and are pursuing other treatments that would have remyelinating and neuroprotective effects. “One of the greatest unmet needs in pediatric MS relates to the fact that we don’t have a sufficient understanding of why there is disease progression even with adequate control of inflammation. Figuring out a way to control that progression is super important,” says Dr. Yeh. She adds that agents with mechanisms of action different from those of current DMTs will likely be needed to halt the disease progression not driven by inflammation and, hopefully, to exercise a regenerative effect. Promoting wellness for the whole person as well as for family members “Yes, MS is a part of your life, but it needn’t define your life,” Ms. Karpinski tells the young people she works with at UBMD Neurology in Buffalo. Often, she adds, parents need to hear that message more than their children do, given a parent’s increased concerns. The concerns that parents have for a child newly diagnosed with MS are often accompanied by a tendency to be over-protective, and even to feel a sense of guilt, experts say. “Parents often ask, ‘Did I do something that put my child at risk for this?’” notes Dr. Yeh. Beyond allaying parents’ unfounded fears that they are responsible for their child’s MS, she uses the question to refocus parents on ways to optimize their daughter’s or son’s health. The pediatric neurologist explains that those steps include participating in physical activity, ensuring sufficient sleep, and eating a balanced diet while avoiding extreme eating plans not supported by scientific evidence. “I particularly stress the importance of the child staying active and leading a normal life. If parents unnecessarily limit a child’s activities because of concerns about their MS, it can have a negative impact in terms of forging friendships and developing socially,” she adds. Dr. Waubant counsels parents along the same lines, and notes the importance of having a smoke-free household, and also recommends Vitamin D supplementation. In many cases, she adds, the parents’ concerns about MS extend to their newly diagnosed child’s siblings. When asked about the chances that another of their children will also develop MS, Dr. Waubant explains to parents that people who have a first-degree relative with MS have a 2% to 3% lifetime chance of having MS. “Where is my child going to be 10 years from now?” is another question Dr. Waubant hears frequently. “I explain that children with MS are less likely to have problems with physical disability than adults and, for reasons we don’t entirely understand, children are better able to recover from relapses,” the neurologist says. She also urges parents to connect with support networks for families affected by MS. (See “Support and Resources for Families Facing Pediatric MS”) Ms. Karpinski agrees that these support groups and networks are valuable resources for parents, and can help them obtain insights into handling practical issues. One example is to work with school officials to accommodate their child’s educational needs. “School districts often have many children with a diagnosis of ADHD or seizure disorder, and so they have experience with formulating educational plans centered around those conditions. But it is not unusual for a child at our clinic to be the only student in his or her district with multiple sclerosis, and educators may not appreciate the need for certain accommodations, such as extended time for test-taking or standing permission to use the restroom,” says Ms. Karpinski. After more than a decade of working with children at UBMD, Ms. Karpinski has helped several patients make the adjustment from grammar school to high school, and then to college. Along the way, she has addressed issues ranging from compliance with medication regimens to what and how a teen with MS may want to tell classmates, or a boyfriend or girlfriend, about the condition. She also has worked with patients and parents on family dynamics and practical approaches to dealing with symptoms such as fatigue and heat sensitivity. The experience, she says, has left her in awe of children with MS. “It is a privilege to work with them, and to see them flourish. They’re just amazing people, and they give me so much hope.” Support and Resources for Families Facing Pediatric MS Learning that your child has a serious, lifelong condition can be overwhelming. When that condition is so uncommon that you do not know of anyone else in the same situation, a sense of isolation can add to a parent’s anxiety. Resources including the Multiple Sclerosis Association of America (MSAA) are available to assist. Parents may call MSAA’s toll-free Helpline at , to speak to an MSAA specialist. Parents and others also can obtain information from MSAA’s Helpline by emailing , and by using the online MS Chat feature on MSAA’s website at . MSAA’s website also has numerous other resources of interest to people of all ages who are coping with the challenges of MS. Other MS advocacy organizations also offer resources and support for young people with MS and their relatives. One group – the Pediatric Multiple Sclerosis Alliance – is dedicated exclusively to connecting, supporting, and advocating for children and adolescents with MS and their families. The Alliance’s website, at , includes a directory of centers specializing in pediatric MS, a resource center where visitors can download parents’ guides to understanding the condition, information about camps for young people with MS, and more. This organization also helps the parents of children with MS connect with one another online. Jeong A, Oleske DM, Holman J.

This mirrors the frequency of seen in other studies of people with MS. Those who developed primary-progressive MS were more likely to be men, were significantly older, and were more likely to have MS-like lesions in the spinal cord compared to those who went on to develop clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) or relapsing-remitting MS. This study provides a rare glimpse of a very early stage of disease even before progression begins, and provides additional evidence of the value of research into radiologically isolated syndrome. Finding a way to identify and track primary-progressive MS earlier may help to improve access to care for those who have it. The team (Dr. Orhun Kantarci, Mayo Clinic and Foundation, and national and international collaborators) published their findings in (). can be challenging, and it often happens in stages. The term “clinically isolated syndrome” (CIS) is used to describe a first episode of neurologic symptoms  that lasts at least 24 hours and is caused by inflammation and demyelination in one or more sites in the brain and spinal cord. Individuals who experience a CIS may or may not go on to develop definite MS. However, clinical trials of specific disease-modifying therapies have led to approvals for their use to treat CIS.   Some people have specific, “clinically silent” lesions (areas of inflamed or damaged tissue) on MRI, meaning that they are experiencing no symptoms and only have imaging findings. There has been growing research on this phenomenon, called “radiologically isolated syndrome (RIS),” which like CIS may or may not go on to develop into definite MS. There is debate as to whether people with RIS would benefit from early treatment with disease-modifying therapies.   is a relatively rare form of MS, with about 10% of all people with MS receiving this diagnosis. It is characterized by steady worsening of neurologic functioning, without any distinct relapses (also called attacks or exacerbations) or periods of remission.    This team examined data from 453 people with RIS collected from 22 investigators in five countries; a database of 210 people with MS in Olmsted County, Minnesota; and a cohort of 754 people with progressive MS.    Of the 453 people with RIS, 128 (28%) went on to develop a first neurological event consistent with CIS or relapsing MS. Of these, 15 (11.7%) developed primary-progressive MS. Those who developed primary-progressive MS were more commonly men, and older at diagnosis by approximately 10 years, than the 113 people who developed CIS/MS. The frequency of primary-progressive MS and age comparisons were similar to those identified in other groups of MS. Of the 15 who went on to develop primary-progressive MS, 12 had MRI scans of the spinal cord, and all 12 had lesions in the spinal cord, compared with 64% of those who developed CIS/MS.    The team (Dr. Orhun Kantarci, Mayo Clinic and Foundation, and national and international collaborators) published their findings in ().   This study provides a rare glimpse of a very early stage of disease even before progression begins, and provides additional evidence of the value of research into radiologically isolated syndrome.

dc235da3-fec1-4305-8ae1-7dc2d3c9ed75,"The Importance of Long-Term Treatment for Multiple Sclerosis The Importance of Long-Term Treatment for Multiple Sclerosis Treatment with a long-term, is crucial for most patients with MS, since disease activity and damage continues within the CNS even when no new symptoms are present. When a patient begins a treatment regimen early in his or her disease course, disease activity is slowed. This not only reduces the number and severity of symptom flare-ups, as well as delays the progression of the disease (and possibly delays any related disability), but also reduces the number of active lesions that appear on an MRI. A 21-year prospective study of individuals (with relapsing-remitting MS) who began therapy early in the disease found that they experienced a longer lifespan than those who did not begin treatment as early. Of those who didn’t start treatment early, MS-related pulmonary infection was the most common cause of mortality over the 21-year period. Previously, all but one* of the approved treatments were only available for individuals with relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (RMS) – largely for those with RRMS – and some are also approved for clinically isolated syndrome, prior to the diagnosis of MS. In 2017, Ocrevus™ (ocrelizumab) was approved for two types of MS: relapsing forms of MS (RMS) and primary-progressive MS (PPMS). This is the first time that a medication for MS had been approved for these two types of the disease, and the first time that any medication had been approved to treat PPMS. Ocrevus is given via intravenous (IV) infusion every six months. Additionally, in 2019, Mayzent® (siponimod) oral tablets, Mavenclad® (cladribine) oral tablets, and Vumerity™ (diroximel fumarate) oral capsules were approved to treat RMS as well as active secondary-progressive MS (SPMS), which is a more steady form of MS that follows RRMS, but still has relapses. While these are the only DMTs to be approved in recent years for active SPMS, the FDA is allowing some of the previously approved DMTs to add active SPMS to their indications. Mayzent and Vumerity are also approved for clinically isolated syndrome (CIS). *In 2000, Novantrone® (mitoxantrone), given via IV infusion, was approved for RRMS, SPMS, and worsening RRMS. However, side effects may include cardiac disease and leukemia, and for this reason, is seldom prescribed for individuals with MS. Additionally, Gilenya® (fingolimod), is the only DMT that is also approved for the treatment of children and adolescents, ages 10 through 17, with relapsing forms of MS. Young people under the age of 18 who are diagnosed with MS are referred to having “pediatric MS”; the vast majority (98 percent) of individuals with pediatric MS are diagnosed with the relapsing form of the disease. Research (including many clinical trials) is ongoing at a rigorous pace to find additional treatments for all forms of MS. Mylan’s generic version of Copaxone® (glatiramer acetate injection) Three generic versions of Gilenya® (fingolimod) capsules; while approved, these are not yet available Tecfidera® (dimethyl fumarate or DMF, formerly known as BG-12) Getting early treatment and staying on one of the long-term DMTs for MS may also delay the rate of conversion from RRMS to . As noted earlier, this form of MS that follows RRMS exhibits a steady worsening, with or without relapses (or flare-ups). If flare-ups do occur, they usually do not remit fully. As mentioned in the previous section, without treatment, approximately half of individuals with RRMS convert to SPMS within 10 years. However, with the introduction of more than 20 brand-name and generic DMTs since the first treatment became available in 1993, those taking a DMT experience a reduced or delayed conversion rate. For more information on long-term treatments for MS and how to select the treatment that is right for you, please see MSAA’s . Individuals who experience a more steady progression of the disease from the onset, without periodic relapses and remissions, may be diagnosed with . To date, only one disease-modifying therapy (Ocrevus) has been approved for the long-term treatment of this form of MS, although many experimental medications are being studied with PPMS in clinical trials. | Additional Evaluative Tools for Multiple Sclerosis Diagnosing Multiple Sclerosis and Evaluating Disease Activity MSAA is a 501(C)(3) nonprofit registered in the US under EIN: 22-1912812.Copyright ©2020 Multiple Sclerosis Association of America.Reproduction of material from any mymsaa.org pages without written permission is strictly prohibited.",83,Why get episode diagnosed by a doctor as a relapse of multiple sclerosis?,-5.374490261077881,94

PPMS can be further characterized as either (with an occasional relapse and/or evidence of new MRI activity over a specified period of time) or , as well as  (evidence of disability accrual over time, with or without relapse or new MRI activity) or . This graphic shows the kinds of disease activity that can occur in PPMS; however each person's experience with PPMS will be unique. PPMS can have brief periods when the disease is stable, with or without a relapse or new MRI activity, as well as periods when increasing disability occurs with or without new relapses or lesions on MRI. Disease activity and progression can be evaluated by neurologic examination and MRI. Monitoring your disease course at different points in time helps you and your MS care provider have important conversations about your treatment options and prognosis. For example: If you have PPMS that is active, with new MRI activity or relapses, your conversation with your MS care provider could be about starting treatment with a disease-modifying therapy to reduce the risk of a relapse, as well as rehabilitation to help improve function and mobility. If you have PPMS that is stable without activity (no new MRI activity or relapses) or progression, the conversation with your MS care provider could include the role of rehabilitation to help you maintain function, as well as other symptom management strategies that you may need. If you have PPMS that is not active (no new MRI activity or relapses) but is progressing with increasing accumulation of disability, the conversation with your MS provider could focus on the rehabilitation strategies that can help you maintain function and keep you safe and independently mobile. How does PPMS differ from the other disease courses? Although there is a lot of variability among people with PPMS, we know that as a group, they differ in several ways from people with relapsing forms of MS: Relapsing forms of MS (including relapsing-remitting MS, and secondary progressive in those individuals who continue to experience relapses) are defined by inflammatory attacks on myelin. PPMS involves much less inflammation of the type seen in relapsing MS. As a result, people with PPMS tend to have fewer brain lesions (also called plaques) than people with relapsing MS and the lesions tend to contain fewer inflammatory cells. People with PPMS also tend to have more lesions in the spinal cord than in the brain. Together, these differences make PPMS more difficult to diagnose and treat than relapsing forms of MS. In the relapsing forms, women are affected two to three times as often as men; in PPMS, the numbers of women and men are approximately equal. The average age of onset is approximately 10 years later in PPMS than in relapsing MS. People with PPMS tend to experience more problems with walking and more difficulty . In general, people with PPMS may also require more assistance with their everyday activities. The National MS Society is pursuing all promising research paths and collaborating worldwide to drive progress in research in progressive MS, for which few therapies exist.

e01b264b-5e58-495b-acd9-bdeffc0447be,"Complementary & Alternative Medicines Find Programs & Services in Your Area COVID-19 Vaccine Guidance for People Living with MS     SUMMARY Some recent studies have suggested that high intake of salt in the diet might influence MS disease activity and progression, but other studies have not confirmed that link. In work partly funded by the National MS Society, researchers took advantage of data accumulated from a previous clinical trial involving 465 people with possible early signs of MS (CIS) whose salt levels in urine were measured over the course of 5 years. They found no connection between salt intake and MS activity. The study, “Sodium Intake and Multiple Sclerosis Activity and Progression in BENEFIT,” was published in the July 2017 issue of the . Although this study does not support a link between high-salt diets and MS disease activity, research suggests that most Americans eat more salt than is recommended by federal guidelines. Reducing dietary salt is considered by most to be beneficial to the heart and circulatory system.  DETAILS Several recent studies have suggested that dietary salt (sodium chloride) could potentially influence MS disease activity and progression. For example, one study of 70 people with relapsing-remitting MS, who were followed for two years, found that higher levels of salt measured in urine samples were associated with a higher rate of relapses and larger brain MRI lesions. In addition, mice fed a high-salt diet developed a more aggressive course of EAE, a laboratory model of MS. But two studies in pediatric MS did not find a relationship between self-reported salt intake and MS risk or relapse rates. Resolving this question is important because it offers the possibility that reducing salt intake might improve a person’s overall health and their course of MS.   In work partly funded by the National MS Society, researchers set out to determine if a high-salt diet is associated with faster conversion from a first neurologic episode (known as clinically isolated syndrome or CIS) to a diagnosis of definite multiple sclerosis, or with MS disease activity. Kathryn C. Fitzgerald, ScD (Johns Hopkins School of Medicine), Alberto Ascherio, MD, DrPH (Harvard T. H. Chan School of Public Health) and colleagues took advantage of data accumulated from a previous clinical trial involving 465 participants who participated in a trial called BENEFIT (Betaferon/Betaseron in Newly Emerging Multiple Sclerosis for Initial Treatment) over 5 years. The trial compared benefits of giving interferon to individuals with CIS early versus later. Each person provided an average of 14 urine samples throughout the five-year follow-up. The researchers estimated average long-term sodium intake from the multiple urine samples, adjusting for age, sex, height, weight, where participants lived, and many other variables.   Researchers found that neither average nor high urine sodium levels were associated with conversion to definite MS. They also weren’t associated with new MRI lesions at any point in the five years, relapse rates, or progression of disability. These results suggest that high sodium intake does not play a major role in influencing MS disease course or activity in people treated with interferon, at least in the early stages of the disease.   While the study has several strengths, including its length, large sample size, and systematic collection of data, it has limitations: BENEFIT participants were treated nearly uniformly with interferon, and the results may not apply to people on other therapies or no therapy. In addition, participants in the BENEFIT trial were primarily Caucasian and resided in Europe and Canada, and it isn’t known if similar results would apply to other populations and ethnicities. The results also don’t answer the question of whether salt intake affects the risk of developing MS in the first place.   The study, “Sodium Intake and Multiple Sclerosis Activity and Progression in BENEFIT,” was published in the July 2017 issue of the .   Although this study does not support a link between high-salt intake and MS disease activity, research suggests that most Americans eat more salt than is recommended by federal guidelines. Even in the absence of direct evidence that MS immune activity is influenced by salt, reducing dietary salt is considered by most to be beneficial to the heart and circulatory system.   Diet, along with exercise, cognitive health, and other healthy behaviors can make a big difference to how you feel as you deal with MS. Multiple sclerosis is an unpredictable, often disabling . range from numbness and tingling to blindness and paralysis, and there is currently no cure for MS.

7be7295b-3273-494e-8069-d7f0c148d875,"Treatment at the First Sign of Illness Improves MS, Study Says — A long-term study shows treatments with interferon when multiple sclerosis is first suspected — even before a definite diagnosis — can result in less disease activity or progression. A long-term study following multiple sclerosis (MS) patients taking the drug interferon beta-1b suggests the earlier therapy is started, the greater the benefit. The results of the BENEFIT 11 study were published last week in . In MS, the immune system mistakenly sees myelin, the protective covering of nerve cells, as an enemy to be destroyed. When a person has an MS attack the nerves are damaged and can result in a whole slate of symptoms that depend on the location of the inflammation. The symptoms can be mild or dramatic. They can range from numbness and tingling to paralysis, cognitive issues, bowel and bladder problems, and even blindness. Read More: Where’s the New Research on Progressive MS? » For this study, researchers examined people who had suffered from clinically isolated syndrome (CIS), which is a singular neurological event resulting in symptoms similar to those seen in MS. While the patients may appear to have the disease, doctors cannot give a definite diagnosis until after a person has at least two attacks. Each attack must result in lesions, or patches of inflammation, in different spots on the brain or spinal cord. Patients who have CIS have yet to meet this requirement and not all of them will go on to be diagnosed with MS. Many will, however, so CIS is seen as a possible precursor to MS. By including these patients in this study, researchers were trying to catch MS in its earliest stage to see if treating with interferon beta-1b before the disease had time to do damage could make a difference in long-term outcomes. What Are the Safest (and Least Safe) MS Drugs on the Market? » The original study randomly assigned participants to receive either interferon beta-1b or a placebo. After either a second neurological event or two years, all patients were given interferon beta-1b. Researchers followed 278 patients over an 11-year period and found that people with CIS who received interferon beta-1b had a lower relapse rate and a longer time from first episode to receiving a definite MS diagnosis. Early in relapsing MS, the body has the ability to heal damaged myelin to near perfect condition. Because of this, symptoms a patient suffers during an attack may disappear after the episode is over. But scar tissue accumulates over time. This scar tissue does not transmit nerve impulses as effectively as the original myelin. As a result, symptoms can remain and disability can accumulate. For that reason, beginning treatment early — and taking it as prescribed — is crucial. There are currently 12 disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat MS. Each of these medications comes with possible side effects and varying levels of effectiveness. According to a published by the Multiple Sclerosis Coalition, “Early successful control of disease activity — including the reduction of clinical and sub-clinical attacks and the delay of the progressive phase of the disease — appears to play a key role in preventing accumulation of disability, prolonging the ability of people with MS to remain active and engaged, and protecting quality of life.” Interferon beta-1b came on the market in 1993 as the first FDA-approved DMT for MS. It has been sold under the brand name Betaseron since that time. In 2014, the drug got a makeover. This version of the drug, called Extavia, only has to be injected twice a month.

MS Symptoms, Causes, Diagnosis Reviewed By: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disease in which the body's immune system attacks its own central nervous system (the brain and spinal cord). In MS, the immune system attacks and damages or destroys myelin, a substance that surrounds and insulates the nerves. The myelin destruction causes a distortion or interruption in nerve impulses traveling to and from the brain. This can result in a wide variety of symptoms. Multiple sclerosis is estimated to affect 2.8 million people worldwide. Most people are diagnosed between the ages of 20 and 50, though it can also occur in young children and the elderly. Multiple sclerosis is three times more common in women than in men. In addition, nearly all women afflicted with MS get the condition before menopause. This could mean that hormones play an important role in the disease’s development. Usually, MS in men is more severe than it is in women. They typically get MS in their 30s and 40s, just as their testosterone levels begin to decline. Although MS is more common in women than men overall, one form of the disease contradicts this pattern. People with primary progressive (PP) MS are about as likely to be male as female. (The four main types of MS are described later). People who smoke are more likely to develop MS, and to develop it more severely and with a faster progression. MS is more prevalent among Caucasians than other ethnicities. MS is believed to have a genetic component as people with a first-degree relative with the disease have a higher incidence than the general population. We don't know exactly what causes multiple sclerosis, but it is believed to be some combination of immunologic, environmental, infectious, and/or genetic factors. Some theories have been proposed, though there is not enough evidence to establish any one cause. Theories as to what causes MS include: Exposure to chemical solvents such as amines, esters, ethers, and ketones Viruses such as Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and human herpes virus 6 (HHV-6) Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disorder in which the immune system mistakenly perceives its own myelin (the protective sheath around the nerves) as an intruder and attacks it, as it would a virus or other foreign infectious agent. To understand how this harms the body, it helps to understand how nerves work. A nerve can be seen by the naked eye, but it is made up of hundreds or even thousands of microscopic nerve fibers wrapped by connective tissue. Nerves conduct messages to and from the brain by way of electrical impulses. Often the nerve fibers that make up a nerve are all individually wrapped in myelin, a protective sheath that causes electric impulses to conduct down the nerve much faster than fibers that lack myelin. (The same principle is used to improve electric wires by covering them with a plastic outer layer.) In multiple sclerosis, the immune system's T cells attack the myelin sheath. By attacking myelin, the immune system in a person with MS causes inflammation and degeneration of the myelin that can lead to demyelination, or stripping of the myelin covering of the nerves. It can also cause scarring (the ""sclerosis"" in the name “multiple sclerosis”). This causes electrical impulses to travel more slowly along the nerves resulting in deterioration of function in body processes such as vision, speech, walking, writing, and memory. While multiple sclerosis is not hereditary, genetics are believed to play a role. In the U.S., the chances of developing MS are one in 750. Having a first-degree relative (parent, sibling) increases the risk to up to 5%. An identical twin of someone with MS has a 25% chance of being diagnosed with the disorder. It is thought there is an outside trigger, as genetics only makes certain people susceptible to getting MS, which is why the disease is not considered hereditary. Genes may make a person more likely to develop the disease, but it is believed that there still is an additional outside trigger that makes it happen. There are four different types of multiple sclerosis that have been identified and each type can have symptoms ranging from mild to severe. The different types of MS can help predict the course of the disease and a patient's response to treatment. The four types of MS are discussed on the next four slides. Relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RR-MS, RRMS or RMS) is the most common type of MS, affecting about 85% of MS sufferers. RR-MS is defined by inflammatory attacks on the myelin and nerve fibers causing a worsening of neurologic function. Symptoms vary from patient to patient, and symptoms can flare up (called relapses or exacerbations) unexpectedly, and then disappear (remission). Primary-progressive multiple sclerosis (PP-MS, PPMS) is characterized by steady worsening of neurologic functioning, without any relapses or remissions. There may be occasional plateaus, but overall, the progression of the disability is continuous. This form of MS occurs equally in men and women, and the age of onset is about 10 years later than in relapsing-remitting MS. Secondary-progressive multiple sclerosis (SP-MS, SPMS) is a form of MS that follows relapsing-remitting MS. Most people diagnosed with RR-MS will eventually transition to having SP-MS. After a period of relapses (also called attacks, or exacerbations) and remissions the disease will start to progress steadily. People with SP-MS may or may not experience remissions. Progressive-relapsing multiple sclerosis (PR-MS, PRMS) is the least common form of MS, occurring in about 5% of MS patients. People with PR-MS experience steady disease progression and worsening neurological function as seen in primary-progressive multiple sclerosis (PP-MS), along with occasional relapses like people with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RR-MS). Symptoms of multiple sclerosis may be single or multiple. They may range from mild to severe in intensity. They may also be long-term or short-term in duration. Multiple sclerosis is often difficult to diagnose as symptoms are so varied and can resemble other diseases. It is often diagnosed by a process of exclusion – that is, by ruling out other neurological diseases – so the diagnosis of MS may take months to years. A physician will do a complete history and neurological exam, along with tests to evaluate mental, emotional and language functions, strength, coordination, balance, reflexes, gait, and vision. Tests to Help Confirm a Multiple Sclerosis Diagnosis Cerebrospinal fluid exam (spinal tap, lumbar puncture) One of the main ways to diagnose multiple sclerosis is an MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) scan. Characteristic areas of demyelination will show up as lesions on an MRI scan. On the left is a brain MRI scan of a 35-year-old man with relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis that reveals multiple lesions with high T2 signal intensity and one large white matter lesion. The right image shows the cervical spinal cord of a 27-year-old woman representing a multiple sclerosis demyelination and plaque (see arrow). There are several aspects to treating multiple sclerosis. Modifying the disease – there are several drugs that can reduce the severity and frequency of relapses Treating exacerbations (or attacks) with high dose corticosteroids Rehabilitation both for fitness and to manage energy levels Treatment for multiple sclerosis may include drugs to manage attacks, symptoms, or both. Many medications carry the risk of some side effects, so patients need to manage their treatment with their doctors. Corticosteroids are drugs that reduce inflammation in the body and affect the function of the immune system. They are often used to manage MS attacks, but can have numerous side effects. There are several medications approved for disease modification, including the following: Many medications are used to treat and manage symptoms associated with multiple sclerosis. Here are some common multiple sclerosis symptoms, followed by the medical treatments often used to treat them. Methylprednisolone (Solu-Medrol): Solu-Medrol is given intravenously during the acute attack, sometimes followed up with an oral corticosteroid. Continued from the last slide, here are some common multiple sclerosis symptoms, followed by the medical treatments often used to treat them. : Anti-convulsants like carbamazepine (Tegretol) or gabapentin (Neurontin) are used for face or limb pain. : Anti-depressants or electrical stimulation are used for pricking pain, intense tingling, and burning. : Antibiotics are used to manage infections : Vitamin C and cranberry juice are used to prevent infections : Used for bladder dysfunction This is usually treated by increasing fluids and fiber to the diet. Often resistant to treatment. Sometimes drugs or surgery are used if tremors are severe. There has been a lot of progress over the years in managing multiple sclerosis, and research is ongoing into new therapies. There are several new avenues of current research. Scientists hope to find further associations between lifestyle and illness progression. They want to learn ways to repair and reverse the damage MS causes. And they hope to learn the ultimate cause of this disease. Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disease that progressively damages the nerves of the brain and spinal cord. Any sensory or motor (muscular) function in the body may be affected by the nerves damaged from MS. The cause of multiple sclerosis is unknown, but it is believed to be a combination of genetic, immunological, infectious, and/or environmental factors. There are four different types of multiple sclerosis and symptoms range from mild to severe. The different types of MS can help predict the course of the disease and, to some degree, the patient's response to treatment. What Is Multiple Sclerosis?

However, you have a higher chance of developing the disease if you have a close relative with MS, according to the . The general population only has 0.1 percent chance of developing MS. But the number jumps to if you have a sibling or parent with MS. Heredity isn’t the only factor in determining MS. An identical twin only has a 25 percent chance of developing MS if their twin has the disease. While genetics is certainly a risk factor, it’s not the only one. A doctor — most likely a neurologist — will perform several tests to , including: neurological exam: your doctor will check for impaired nerve function eye exam: a series of tests to evaluate your vision and check for eye diseases magnetic resonance imaging (MRI): a technique that uses a powerful magnetic field and radio waves to create cross-sectional images of the brain and spinal cord (also called a lumbar puncture): a test involving a long needle that’s inserted into your spine to remove a sample of fluid circulating around your brain and spinal cord Doctors use these tests to look for damage to the central nervous system in two separate areas. They must also determine that at least one month has passed between the episodes that caused damage. These tests are also used to rule out other conditions. MS often astounds doctors because of how much it can vary in both its severity and the ways that it affects people. Attacks can last a few weeks and then disappear. However, relapses can get progressively worse and more unpredictable, and come with different symptoms. Early detection may help prevent MS from progressing quickly.

People with active secondary progressive MS have had progression of disability but still experience acute relapses or new MRI activity. The approval was based on two identical phase 3 studies (ACLEPIOS I and II) in which participants were randomly assigned to receive Kesimpta (self-injected once a month), or daily oral Aubagio (teriflunomide, Sanofi Genzyme) for up to 30 months. The primary outcome measured was the annual rate of relapses. Secondary endpoints included time to progression of disability, rate of brain volume loss and other measures. Kesimpta reduced annual relapses significantly more than Aubagio, reduced disability worsening at three months, and reduced disease activity on MRI scans. Kesimpta is a therapy that depletes specific immune B cells. It is a monoclonal antibody that binds to a docking site (CD20) on some immune B cells and depletes them. B cells are among immune cells that have been implicated in causing nervous system damage in MS. Another B-cell therapy currently approved to treat MS is Ocrevus (Genentech). The most common potential side effects include upper respiratory tract infection, headache, injection-related reactions, and local injection site reactions. Prescribing information cautions that Kesimpta should not be administered in individuals with active infection, and live or live-attenuated vaccines are not recommended during treatment and after discontinuing treatment until B cells return. Because Kesimpta reduces B cells that make immunoglobulins to help fight infections, levels should be monitored before, during, and after treatment. Because of the risk for fetal harm, women are cautioned to use birth control during and for 6 months after stopping Kesimpta.  “We are pleased that there is a new treatment option for people with relapsing MS,” said Kathy Costello, MS, ANP-BC, MSCN, Associate Vice President of Healthcare Access at the National MS Society.   (.pdf). (.pdf) FURTHER DETAILS Multiple sclerosis involves immune system attacks that cause inflammation and damage in the brain and spinal cord tissues. In the same class as ocrelizumab (Ocrevus, Genentech), Kesimpta is a therapy that depletes specific immune B cells. B cells are among immune cells that have been implicated in causing nervous system damage in MS. Kesimpta is a monoclonal antibody that binds to a docking site (CD20) on immune B cells (lymphocytes) and depletes them.   Two identical Phase 3 trials tested Kesimpta versus oral Aubagio in more than 1800 people with relapsing-remitting MS or active secondary progressive MS for up to 30 months. Participants had to have experienced at least one relapse in the previous year, two relapses in the previous two years, or had an MRI-detected active lesion (gadolinium-enhancing) in the previous year. Participants were randomly assigned to receive Kesimpta, self-injected once a month, or daily oral Aubagio. As a control, the groups also received placebo versions of Kesimpta or Aubagio. The primary outcome measured was the annual rate of relapses. Secondary endpoints included time to progression of disability, effect on MRI-detected brain lesions, brain volume loss and other measures.   Compared to those on Aubagio, Kesimpta significantly reduced annualized relapse rates relative to Aubagio (a relative reduction of 51 to 59% in the two studies), active MRI-detected lesions (a relative reduction of 94 to 98%), new or enlarging lesions (a relative reduction of 82 to 85%), and disability progression sustained over 3 months (a relative reduction of 34.4%). According to the , brain tissue loss was not reduced significantly more in the Kesimpta group.   The most common adverse events include upper respiratory tract infection, headache, injection-related reactions, and local injection site reactions. Prescribing information contains a warning that Kesimpta should not be administered in individuals with an active infection until that infection is resolved. Live or live-attenuated vaccines are not recommended during treatment and after discontinuing treatment until B cells return. Levels of immunoglobulins, which help fight infections, should be monitored before, during, and after treatment. Because of the risk for fetal harm, women are cautioned to use contraception during and for 6 months after stopping Kesimpta.   PML (progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy) may occur when taking Kesimpta. PML is a rare, serious brain infection that can result in death or severe disability. Individuals are cautioned to tell their healthcare providers if experiencing any new or worsening neurological symptoms such as weakness on one side of the body, loss of coordination in arms and legs, vision problems, changes in thinking and memory, or confusion and personality changes.    Individuals prescribed Kesimpta are required to have blood tests to screen for the presence ofHepatitis B virus (HBV), and for serum levels of immunoglobulins. When starting Kesimpta, individuals will take injections each week for 3 weeks, and thereafter will take Kesimpta monthly.  Novartis has announced that Kesimpta should be available for prescription by September 2020.   Taking a disease-modifying therapy is currently the best way to reduce MS disease activity and future deterioration. Selecting an MS therapy should be done by people with MS in collaboration with their MS healthcare provider, taking into account a variety of factors, including the effectiveness of any therapy they are currently using, and weighing potential risks and benefits, costs and lifestyle factors.   For more information about the availability of Kesimpta and support programs from the company, individuals may call: 1-855-KESIMPTA (1-855-537-4678), 8:30 am–8:00 pm ET, Mon–Fri.

What types of MS is Kesimpta approved to treat? The FDA has approved Kesimpta for the treatment of relapsing forms of MS, including  (an initial neurological episode), , and active . People with active secondary progressive MS have had progression of disability but still experience acute relapses or new MRI activity.    Kesimpta is self-administered as a monthly under-the-skin injection. The first three doses are self-injected weekly, then switching to once monthly starting with week 4.   Q. What are the potential side effects of Kesimpta? The most common side effects include upper respiratory tract infection, headache, injection-related reactions, and local injection site reactions. The (.pdf) provides full information on potential side effects.   Q. Why should a person with MS consider taking a disease-modifying therapy? Taking a disease-modifying therapy is currently the best way to reduce MS disease activity and future disability. Studies comparing people in clinical trials who started therapy earlier than those on inactive placebo suggest that early treatment offered important benefits against the accumulation of disability, which were generally not experienced to the same degree by those who started treatment later.   Q. Should I switch from my current therapy to Kesimpta? The decision about whether to take Kesimpta should be made in collaboration with your MS healthcare provider, taking into account a variety of factors including the effectiveness of any therapy you are currently using, the potential risks and benefits, as well as costs and lifestyle factors. Important questions to be considered and discussed with your doctor in terms of Kesimpta include: What is my tolerance for the risk of known side effects? What is my tolerance for the risk of adverse consequences that might emerge with longer-term use? Does the administration schedule fit into my lifestyle? How will my medication choice affect my ability or plans to become pregnant? What are the comparative costs of my current therapy versus Kesimpta? . There is no specified time limit for taking Kesimpta.   Q. Are there any risk factors or medical conditions that would make it inappropriate for an individual to take Kesimpta? Kesimpta should not be administered in individuals with an active infection until that infection is resolved. In people with a history of hepatitis B virus infection, the virus may become reactivated, which can cause serious liver problems. Because of the risk for fetal harm, women are cautioned to use birth control during and for 6 months after stopping Kesimpta.     Q. May I start Kesimpta during the COVID-19 pandemic? Before starting on any new disease-modifying therapy, people with MS should discuss with their healthcare professional which therapy is the best choice for their individual disease course and disease activity in light of COVID-19 risk in their region. Therapies that target CD20 – including Kesimpta (ofatumumab), Ocrevus (ocrelizumab), and Rituxan (rituximab)– may be linked to an increased chance of being admitted to hospital or requiring intensive care treatment due to COVID-19. This preliminary finding requires further investigation.   Q. Will a person taking Kesimpta have to get any special medical tests or monitoring? Individuals prescribed Kesimpta are required to have blood tests to be screened for the presence ofHepatitis B virus (HBV), and to be screened for serum levels of immunoglobulins before, during and after discontinuing treatment until B cells return.   The wholesale acquisition price of Kesimpta has been announced as $83,000 per year. The actual cost to an individual who has MS will depend on the provisions of their insurance coverage and the degree to which that individual will be eligible for programs designed to assist with out-of-pocket costs.   Coverage will depend on individual insurance plans.   No.   Q. Where can I get information about the patient support that Novartis plans to provide? For more information about the availability of Kesimpta and support programs from the company, individuals may call: 1-855-KESIMPTA (1-855-537-4678), 8:30 am–8:00 pm ET, Mon–Fri. Or visit .   Q. Is Kesimpta being tested in primary progressive MS or non-active secondary-progressive MS? Not at this time. Multiple sclerosis is an unpredictable, often disabling . range from numbness and tingling to blindness and paralysis, and there is currently no cure for MS. The progress, severity and specific symptoms of MS in any one person cannot yet be predicted, but advances in and are leading to better understanding and moving us closer to .

In a large clinical trial of 1651 people with secondary-progressive MS, fewer people taking Mayzent had confirmed worsening of disability progression compared to those on placebo. Mayzent also decreased the number of relapses. According to the prescribing information, the participants with non-active secondary progressive MS did not show significant benefits. Mayzent is an FDA-approved immune system-modulating therapy, taken by mouth once daily, which was designed to be more selective than Gilenya (fingolimod, Novartis International AG International AG) and potentially have fewer risks. Mayzent is thought to act by retaining certain white blood cells in the body’s lymph nodes, keeping them out of circulation and out of the the central nervous system. Mayzent also enters the central nervous system (brain and spinal cord) where it may have direct anti-inflammatory and/or other effects. This approval provides another treatment option for people living with relapsing forms of MS and specifically includes people with secondary progressive MS who are continuing to experience active disease. The most common adverse reactions reported during clinical trials included headache, high blood pressure, and increases in liver function tests. Mayzent may increase the risk of infections, may cause macular edema (swelling in the back of the eye), and may cause transient decreases in heart rate and a decline in lung function. The prescription label will have advice about tests people should undergo before beginning to take Mayzent.  “This is an important breakthrough for people with secondary progressive MS, a type of MS that follows relapsing-remitting MS and is characterized by a worsening of symptoms and disability over time,” said Kathy Costello, MS, ANP-BC, MSCN, Associate Vice President of Healthcare Access at the National MS Society. “We are grateful that there is a new treatment option for people with active secondary progressive MS, and we are hopeful that this approval will stimulate development of more treatments for progressive MS.”   Download the full prescribing information and Medication Guide (.pdf)   The FDA has approved Mayzent (siponimod - Novartis International AG) for use in the treatment of adults with relapsing forms of MS, including (an initial neurological episode), , and active secondary MS. People with active secondary progressive MS have had progression of disability but still experience acute relapses or new MRI activity. In the clinical trial, people who had secondary progressive MS and who had experienced at least one relapse within two years before entering the study were considered “active.” Mayzent will be available as a first-line treatment, which means that there are no recommendations in the approved labeling for people to try other MS therapies before taking it. There is no requirement for first-dose monitoring in a health facility except for individuals with pre-existing heart conditions. There are recommendations for several lab and clinical tests prior to the first dose, Mayzent was approved for use in adults, and has not been tested in children with MS.   Secondary progressive MS follows an initial relapsing-remitting course. Many people who are initially diagnosed with relapsing-remitting MS eventually transition to a secondary progressive course in which there is a progressive worsening of neurologic function over time. Some people with secondary progressive MS can be characterized as either active (with relapses and/or evidence of new MRI activity) or not active, as well as with progression or without progression. The reason for these distinctions in disease course is that in the U.S., there are many disease-modifying therapies approved by the FDA for use in “relapsing forms” of MS, which includes those individuals who have secondary progressive MS and continue to have relapses and/or evidence of disease activity on MRI.   Mayzent is an FDA-approved immune system-modulating therapy that was designed to be more selective than Gilenya (fingolimod, Novartis International AG International AG). Gilenya is approved for adults and children aged 10 years or older with relapsing forms of MS to reduce the frequency of clinical relapses and to delay the accumulation of physical disability. Mayzent is thought to act by retaining certain white blood cells in the body’s lymph nodes, keeping them out of circulation and from entering the central nervous system. Mayzent also enters the central nervous system (brain and spinal cord) where it may have direct anti-inflammatory and/or other effects.   Results of a 60-month, phase III clinical trial of Mayzent, involving 1,651 people with secondary progressive MS, were published in The trial met its primary endpoint of reducing the risk of disability progression compared with inactive placebo. Overall, those taking Mayzent had a 21% reduced risk of disability progression compared to those on placebo. According to the prescribing information, Mayzent significantly reduced the risk of progression in those with active secondary progressive MS, but not in those who had non-active secondary progressive MS. Secondary endpoints suggested that those on active therapy had 23% lower average change in brain volume, reduced relapse rates, and reduced MRI-detected lesion volume.   The most common adverse reactions reported during clinical trials included headache, high blood pressure, and increases in liver function tests. The serious adverse events reported to be more likely for those taking Mayzent included nervous system disorders and infections. Mayzent is not recommended for people with certain types of heart conditions.   includes several warnings and precautions, including the following. Mayzent: reduces white blood counts, and so may increase the risk of infections, including serious infections may cause macular edema (swelling in the back of the eye) may cause harm to a fetus, so women of childbearing potential should use contraception during and for 10 days after stopping Mayzent.  The Mayzent (pages 22-25 of the document) provides advice about symptoms to be alert to and about which individuals taking Mayzent should inform their healthcare providers.   The prescribing information contains advice to health care providers about tests people should undergo before beginning to take Mayzent. These include: Genetic blood test to determine the person’s CYP2C9 genotype, because people with some variants of these genes would need a different dose of Mayzent or should not take it at all. Other blood tests including a complete blood count and liver function tests, Blood test for antibodies to varicella zoster virus (Shingles virus). In those who are negative, VZV vaccination is recommended. History of current or prior immune-suppressing medications, which may cause Mayzent to further reduce the ability to fight infections.  Most people without pre-existing heart conditions will receive a starter pack of tablets that gradually increases the daily dose over 5 days, before taking the full recommended daily dose. People with certain pre-existing heart conditions will need 6-hour or possibly longer heart monitoring when receiving their first dose of Mayzent.   For people who qualify, Novartis plans to offer patient assistance programs through The Novartis Patient Assistance Foundation: 1-800-277-2254 or https://www.pharma.us.novartis.com/our-products/patient-assistance/patient-assistance-foundation-enrollment.   Download the full prescribing information and Medication Guide (.pdf)   Mayzent is a registered trademark of Novartis International AG. Gilenya is a registered trademark of Novartis International AG     A. The FDA has approved Mayzent for the treatment of adults with (an initial neurological episode), and relapsing forms of MS, including and active secondary MS. People with active secondary progressive MS have had progression of disability but still experience acute relapses or new MRI activity. In the clinical trial, people who had secondary progressive MS and who had experienced at least one relapse within two years before entering the study were considered “active.”   A. The approval includes clinically isolated syndrome and relapsing forms of MS, including relapsing remitting MS and active secondary progressive MS. According to the prescribing information, Mayzent significantly reduced the risk of progression in those with active secondary progressive MS, but not in those who had non-active (without relapses) secondary progressive MS.   Like all clinical trials, the trial of Mayzent in secondary progressive MS limited the characteristics of people who could participate. The trial only included people who were aged 18 to 60, who had an EDSS (Expanded Disability Status Scale – a scale to assess neurological functioning used in clinical trials) score of 3.0 (meaning they were fully ambulatory but had  other functional limitations) up to 6.5 (meaning they were able to walk with the help of a walker or bilateral crutches or other devices on both sides). It is not possible to predict how a specific individual will respond to treatment. The use of Mayzent in clinical practice will help determine who is likely to benefit.   A. Mayzent is a tablet administered by mouth once daily.   Q. When will Mayzent be available by prescription? A. According to Novartis, people may talk to their MS healthcare providers now about taking Mayzent. The company expects supplies of the therapy to be available within a week of the approval. Accessing the medication also depends on issues related to an individual’s health insurance.   Q. Are there other therapies available for people with secondary progressive MS? A. Yes, depending on the type of secondary progressive MS they have. Secondary progressive MS follows an initial relapsing-remitting course. Many people who are initially diagnosed with relapsing-remitting MS eventually transition to a secondary progressive course in which there is a progressive worsening of neurologic function over time. Some people with secondary progressive MS can be characterized as either active (with relapses and/or evidence of new MRI activity) or not active, as well as with progression or without progression. Many available disease-modifying therapies are approved for use in “relapsing forms” of MS, which includes those individuals who have secondary progressive MS and who continue to have relapses and/or evidence of disease activity on MRI.   Q. Should individuals with relapsing forms of MS switch from their current therapy to Mayzent? A. The decision about whether to take Mayzent should be made in collaboration with the healthcare provider treating your MS, taking into account a variety of factors including the effectiveness of any therapy you are currently using, the potential risks and benefits, as well as costs and lifestyle factors. Important questions to be considered and discussed with your healthcare provider in terms of Mayzent include: What health conditions do I have that might discourage the switch to Mayzent? What is my tolerance for the risk of known side effects? What is my tolerance for the risk of adverse consequences that might emerge with longer-term use? How will my medication choice affect my ability or plans to become pregnant?   Q. If I have been taking another disease-modifying therapy for MS, how long will I have to wait before starting ? A.  Mayzent clears out of the system 10 days after the last dose. A decision to wait or proceed after that time needs to be made in collaboration with your MS healthcare provider   Q. Has Mayzent been proven to be more effective than other disease-modifying therapies? A. There is no evidence yet to answer this question, since Mayzent has only been compared to inactive placebo in clinical trials.   A. There is no specified time limit for taking Mayzent. As with other disease-modifying medications, Mayzent would likely be continued if the person’s MS is stable, and she/he is experiencing no adverse events or new safety issues that could be ascribed to the medication.   Q. Will people taking have to get any special medical tests or monitoring? A. Yes. The prescribing information contains advice to health care providers about tests people should undergo before beginning to take Mayzent. These include: Blood test for genetic testing to determine the person’s CYP2C9 genotype, because people with some variants of these genes would need a different dose of Mayzent or should not take it at all. Blood test for complete blood count and liver enzymes Blood test for antibodies to varicella zoster virus. In those who are negative, VZV vaccination is recommended. History of current or prior immune-suppressing medications, which may cause Mayzent to further reduce the ability to fight infections.  Most people without pre-existing heart conditions will receive a starter pack of tablets that gradually increases the daily dose over 5 days, before taking the full recommended daily dose. People with certain pre-existing heart conditions will need 6-hour or possibly longer heart monitoring when receiving their first dose of Mayzent.   Q. Will Mayzent help my mobility, prevent me from getting worse or reverse my progressive disability? A. Based on results from the clinical trials, Mayzent is likely to help stabilize a person’s disability progression. We do not know if will reverse an individual’s disability. In the phase 3 trial for secondary progressive MS, treatment with Mayzent significantly reduced the risk of progression of clinical disability. This reduced risk of progression means that as a group, people taking Mayzent were 21% less likely to demonstrate worsening of disability than people taking placebo. However, it is not possible to predict how any one individual will respond to this or any other therapy.   A. The wholesale acquisition cost (WAC) of Mayzent is $88,500 per year. However, the price to an individual who has MS will depend on the provisions of his or her insurance coverage and the degree to which that individual will be eligible for programs designed to assist with out-of-pocket costs. Coverage will depend on individual insurance plans. For people who qualify, Novartis plans to offer patient assistance programs through The Novartis Patient Assistance Foundation: 1-800-277-2254 or https://www.pharma.us.novartis.com/our-products/patient-assistance/patient-assistance-foundation-enrollment.     Q. Are there other therapies in development for progressive MS? A. Yes. The National MS Society is closely watching experimental treatments in development for people with progressive forms of MS. In addition, other studies include: Investigators at Oregon Health & Science University are conducting a Phase 2 clinical trial to determine if the oral supplement, lipoic acid, is an effective treatment for progressive forms of MS. The trial is co-funded by the Veteran’s Administration and the National MS Society. The SPRINT-MS trial of Ibudilast, an oral anti-inflammatory agent, demonstrated that it was well tolerated and significantly slowed the rate of brain atrophy compared to placebo in people with secondary progressive and primary progressive MS. This trial was a unique collaboration between NIH's NeuroNEXT Network, MediciNova, and the National MS Society. The MS-STAT2 study is underway at University College London, a multicenter trial testing whether a repurposed cholesterol-lowering therapy can slow the course of secondary progressive MS; the Society is providing funding.  The Society is also very interested in wellness research to identify exercise, dietary and other approaches that will help people who have MS live their best lives. The Society supports several clinical trials that are investigating dietary interventions for symptom management and for their potential to modify the disease process.    Based on these trial results, is there still a need to invest in additional research on progressive MS? A: Yes. We need to continue our investment in research to find solutions for progressive MS.  We welcome this development, but we must remain focused on finding more and better solutions for treating progressive MS. We will do this by our continued leadership in the International  and by funding research on progressive MS through our own research programs, and by encouraging other companies to commit to developing treatments for progressive forms of MS.   Multiple sclerosis is an unpredictable, often disabling . range from numbness and tingling to blindness and paralysis, and there is currently no cure for MS.

45e2a7c3-40e3-45c5-b12f-e198e53b9f64,"by Michele R. Berman, MD, and Mark S. Boguski, MD, PhD Actor David Lander, known for his role as Andrew ""Squiggy"" Squiggman on the sitcom ""Laverne & Shirley,"" died at the age of 73 at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, from complications of multiple sclerosis. In a to , ""David's family hopes his fans will remember him for all the laughter he brought into the world."" Lander was originally diagnosed with multiple sclerosis in 1984, a year after ""Laverne & Shirley"" ended its 8-year run. He began to experience dizziness and numbness in his hands and feet. A spinal tap revealed his diagnosis, but he kept it a secret to all but his family, as he thought it would end his career in Hollywood. In 1999, he publicly revealed his diagnosis in a memoir entitled, ""Fall Down Laughing: How Squiggy Caught Multiple Sclerosis and Didn't Tell Nobody."" In 2000, the National MS Society named Lander one of their National Ambassadors. He toured the country and became an advocate for patients with MS, speaking at conventions and fundraisers. He particularly wanted to educate patients about early intervention for those newly diagnosed. In a 2007 with , Lander explained how much the outlook on MS changed since he was diagnosed: ""When I was first diagnosed with multiple sclerosis, there was nothing you could do about it. Doctors would say, 'diagnose and adios.' Now, there are many treatments available to control this progressive disease."" His doctor originally painted a bleak picture, saying he wasn't sure that Lander would ever walk again. After trials of corticosteroid and interferon-beta-1a, Lander was able to live a very full life. In addition to his MS advocacy work, he was a scout for baseball's Seattle Mariners, did voice-over work for a number of television shows and video games, and wrote reviews of handicap-accessible areas in ballparks. We first wrote about multiple sclerosis for in December 2010. The , which included Lander, also pointed out a number of public figures (including Michelle Obama's father) who were diagnosed with the disease. Quite a bit has changed in the treatment of MS since that time. MS is a neuroinflammatory disease that affects myelin, nerve cell bodies, and the axons in the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve. The term multiple sclerosis refers to the distinctive areas of scar tissue (sclerosis or plaques) that are visible in the white matter of people who have MS. MS is the most common disabling neurological disease of young adults with symptom onset generally occurring between the ages of 20 to 40 years. In MS, the immune system cells that normally protect us from viruses, bacteria, and unhealthy cells mistakenly attack the protective myelin sheath of nerves in the central nervous system. According to the , MS is thought to affect more than 1 million people in the U.S. As with most autoimmune disorders, twice as many women as men are affected by MS. In addition, MS is more common in colder climates: the further from the equator, the higher the risk. The symptoms of MS usually begin over one to several days, but in some forms, they may develop more slowly. They may be mild or severe and may go away quickly or last for months. Sometimes the initial symptoms of MS are overlooked because they disappear in a day or so and normal function returns. Most people with MS have a relapsing-remitting form of the disease, in contrast to a more slowly developing form called primary progressive MS. Progressive MS can also be a second stage of the illness that follows years of relapsing-remitting symptoms (called secondary progressive MS). Relapsing-remitting MS accounts for approximately 85%-90% of cases at onset. Secondary progressive MS usually occurs 10-20 years after the onset of the disease. Primary progressive MS is characterized by progressive disability from the onset of the disease with occasional plateaus or temporary minor improvements. The mean age of onset is 40. A diagnosis of MS is often delayed because MS shares symptoms with other neurological conditions and diseases. Vision problems such as blurred or double vision, or optic neuritis, which causes pain with eye movement and a rapid loss of vision Muscle weakness, often in the hands and legs, and muscle stiffness accompanied by painful muscle spasms. It may be severe enough to affect walking or standing Tingling, numbness, or pain in the arms, legs, trunk, or face Clumsiness, particularly difficulty staying balanced when walking Mental or physical fatigue which accompanies the early symptoms during an attack Mood changes such as depression or difficulty with emotional expression or control Cognitive dysfunction -- problems concentrating, multitasking, thinking, learning, or difficulties with memory or judgment There is no cure for MS, but there are treatments that can reduce the number and severity of relapses and delay the long-term disability progression of the disease. Corticosteroids, such as intravenous methylprednisolone, are prescribed for courses of 3 to 5 days. Intravenous steroids quickly and potently suppress the immune system and reduce inflammation. They may be followed by tapered doses of oral corticosteroids. Clinical trials have shown that these drugs hasten recovery from MS attacks, but do not alter the long-term outcome of the disease. Plasma exchange (plasmapheresis) can treat severe flare-ups in people with relapsing forms of MS who do not have a good response to methylprednisolone. This treatment has not been shown to be effective for secondary progressive or chronic progressive MS. Current therapies approved by the FDA are designed to modulate or suppress the inflammatory reactions of the disease. They are most effective for relapsing-remitting MS at early stages of the disease. drugs (Rebif, Betaseron, others) are among the most common medications to treat MS. Interferons are signaling molecules that regulate immune cells. Potential side effects of these drugs include flu-like symptoms (which usually fade with continued therapy), depression, or elevation of liver enzymes. Some individuals will notice a decrease in the effectiveness of the drugs after 18 to 24 months of treatment. If flare-ups occur or symptoms worsen, doctors may switch treatment to alternative drugs. changes the balance of immune cells in the body, but how it works is not entirely clear. Side effects are usually mild and consist of local injection site reactions or swelling. is administered intravenously once a month. It works by preventing cells of the immune system from entering the brain and spinal cord. It is very effective but is associated with increased risk of a called progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML). Natalizumab is generally recommended only for individuals who have not responded well to or who are unable to tolerate other first-line therapies. is administered intravenously every six months and treats adults with relapsing or primary progressive forms of MS. It is the only FDA-approved disease-modifying therapy for primary progressive MS. The drug targets the circulating immune cells that produce antibodies, which also play a role in the formation of MS lesions. Side effects include infusion-related reactions and increased risk of infections. Ocrelizumab may increase the risk of cancer as well. is administered for 5 consecutive days followed by 3 days of infusions one year later. It targets proteins on the surface of immune cells. Because this drug increases the risk of autoimmune disorders, it is recommended for those who have had inadequate responses to two or more MS therapies. , which is administered intravenously four times a year, has been approved for especially severe forms of relapsing-remitting and secondary progressive MS. Side effects include the development of certain types of blood cancers in up to 1% of those with MS, as well as with heart damage. This drug should be considered as a last resort to treat people with a form of MS that leads to rapid loss of function and for whom other treatments did not work. is a once-daily medication that reduces the MS relapse rate in adults and children. It is the first FDA-approved drug to treat MS in adolescents and children as young as 10. The drug prevents lymphocytes from leaving the lymph nodes and entering the blood, brain, and spinal cord. Fingolimod may result in a slow heart rate and eye problems when first taken. Fingolimod can also increase the risk of infections, such as herpes virus infections, or in rare cases be associated with PML. is a twice-daily medication used to treat relapsing forms of MS. Its exact mechanism of action is not currently known. Side effects of dimethyl fumarate are flushing, diarrhea, nausea, and lowered white blood cell count. is a once-daily medication that reduces the rate of proliferation of activated immune cells. Teriflunomide's side effects can include nausea, diarrhea, liver damage, and hair loss. is administered as two courses of tablets about one year apart. Cladribine targets certain types of white blood cells that drive immune attacks in MS. The drug may increase the risk of developing cancer and should be considered for individuals who have not responded well to other MS treatments. is a twice-daily drug similar to dimethyl fumarate but with fewer gastrointestinal side effects. Scientists suspect these drugs, which have been approved to treat secondary progressive MS, reduce damage to the brain and spinal cord by making the immune response less inflammatory, although their exact mechanism of action is poorly understood. is taken orally and has a similar mechanism of action to fingolimod. Siponimod has been approved by the FDA to treat secondary progressive MS. Clinical trials have shown that cladribine, diroximel fumarate, and dimethyl fumarate decrease the number of relapses, delay the progress of physical disability, and slow the development of brain lesions.

Teriflunomide's side effects can include nausea, diarrhea, liver damage, and hair loss. is administered as two courses of tablets about one year apart. Cladribine targets certain types of white blood cells that drive immune attacks in MS. The drug may increase the risk of developing cancer and should be considered for individuals who have not responded well to other MS treatments. is a twice-daily drug similar to dimethyl fumarate but with fewer gastrointestinal side effects. Scientists suspect these drugs, which have been approved to treat secondary progressive MS, reduce damage to the brain and spinal cord by making the immune response less inflammatory, although their exact mechanism of action is poorly understood. is taken orally and has a similar mechanism of action to fingolimod. Siponimod has been approved by the FDA to treat secondary progressive MS. Clinical trials have shown that cladribine, diroximel fumarate, and dimethyl fumarate decrease the number of relapses, delay the progress of physical disability, and slow the development of brain lesions.

Bafiertam (pronounced bah”feer’tam) is similar to Tecfidera and Vumerity but has a distinct chemical structure. This therapy is now available for prescription. Relapsing forms of MS  includes people with  (an initial episode of neurological symptoms), , and active . People with active secondary progressive MS have had progression of disability but still experience acute relapses or new MRI activity. Although their exact mechanisms of action are not known, fumarate therapies are thought to modulate the immune response underlying MS to be less inflammatory, and may have antioxidant properties that could be protective against damage to the brain and spinal cord. Because of its similarity to Tecfidera, Bafiertam’s approval was based largely on the FDA’s findings of safety and efficacy for Tecfidera and “bioavailability” studies in healthy subjects comparing dimethyl fumarate to Bafiertam. Twice-daily Tecfidera was shown in clinical trials to significantly reduce relapses and disease activity on MRIs, and in one trial it reduced progression of disability. People prescribed Bafiertam will take a lower dose for one week, and then a maintenance dose of two capsules taken by mouth twice a day.  The price of Bafiertam has been announced as $69,480 per year. The actual cost to individuals will depend on the provisions of their insurance coverage and the degree to which they will be eligible for programs designed to assist with out-of-pocket costs.   The contains details about Bafiertam for healthcare professionals. The contains information about taking Bafiertam for people with MS.   The most common possible side effects of Bafiertam include: Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, stomach pain, or indigestion Flushing and stomach problems are the most common reactions, especially at the start of therapy, and may decrease over time. Taking Bafiertam without food may reduce the incidence of stomach problems. Possible serious side effects include: Allergic reaction (such as welts, hives, swelling of the face, lips, mouth or tongue, or difficulty breathing) PML, a rare brain infection that usually leads to death or severe disability Decreases in white blood cell counts (which can decrease the ability to fight infections). Your healthcare provider should do a blood test before you start treatment and while on therapy. Liver problems.

Lemtrada is given as intravenous infusions – for 5 consecutive days initially and for 3 consecutive days one year later. Because of its safety profile, the prescribing information indicates that use of Lemtrada should generally be reserved for people who have had an inadequate response to two or more MS therapies. “The approval of Lemtrada provides an important and immunologically powerful new therapeutic option for people with relapsing MS,” said Bruce A. Cohen, MD, Professor, Davee Department of Neurology and Clinical Neurosciences at Northwestern University’s Feinberg School of Medicine, and Chair of the National MS Society’s National Medical Advisory Committee. “Its long-lasting effects may profoundly influence the course of relapsing MS, but will require careful and sustained monitoring for side effects which people receiving the medicine must follow. Individuals with MS who are considering treatment with this medicine should thoroughly educate themselves on its potential benefits and risks,” he added. “The FDA approval of Lemtrada is a significant milestone for people living with relapsing MS in the United States,” said Dr. Timothy Coetzee, Chief Advocacy, Services and Research Officer at the National MS Society. “We are pleased that that the voices of the MS community have been recognized and that people with relapsing MS will now have access to a new, needed treatment option. MS involves immune system attacks against brain and spinal cord tissues. Lemtrada is a humanized monoclonal antibody directed at CD52 (a protein on the surface of immune cells) and it causes depletion of lymphocytes (white blood cells). It was originally approved, at a significantly higher dose, for the treatment of B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Its ability to target immune cells led investigators to test its potential as a treatment for relapsing MS. Lemtrada is given by intravenous infusion – for 5 consecutive days initially and for 3 consecutive days one year later. The prescribing information includes a boxed warning about the potential for serious or life-threatening autoimmune disorders, infusion reactions and malignancies. Lemtrada will only be available from certified prescribers, and patients will be enrolled in a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) program to ensure that ongoing periodic monitoring will be maintained to detect potential problems.  The FDA approved Lemtrada based on the results of two large, phase III clinical trials that confirmed its ability to significantly reduce relapse rates over two years over standard subcutaneous dosing of Rebif® (interferon beta-1a, EMD Serono Inc. and Pfizer). One of the studies also suggested that Lemtrada may significantly reduce worsening of disability. Alasdair Coles, FRCP (University of Cambridge) and Jeffrey Cohen, MD (Cleveland Clinic) and colleagues published the complete results of CARE-MS I and CARE-MS II in The Lancet (2012;380:2819, ). In the CARE-MS I study, data were evaluated for 563 people with early, active relapsing-remitting MS, who had never received disease-modifying therapy to treat their MS and were randomly assigned to receive Lemtrada or Rebif. After two years the relapse rate for those on Lemtrada was reduced by 55% compared to those on Rebif. Also after two years, 8% of those on Lemtrada experienced an increase (worsening) in their EDSS score (a standard scale of physical disability) compared to 11 % on Rebif – a difference that was not statistically significant. After two years 78% of those on Lemtrada remained relapse-free, which was significantly more than the 59% who remained relapse-free on Rebif. The CARE-MS II study was a two-year trial comparing Lemtrada to the standard subcutaneous dosing of Rebif. Data were evaluated for 628 people with relapsing-remitting MS who had already been treated with another MS therapy but had experienced at least one relapse on that previous therapy. After two years, the annual relapse rate for those on Lemtrada was 0.26 compared to 0.52 for those on Rebif, representing a 49% lower risk of relapses. In addition, on average fewer people on Lemtrada had an increase (worsening) in their EDSS score compared to those on Rebif (13% for Lemtrada vs. 21% for Rebif) – a 42% difference that was statistically significant. After two years, 65% of those on Lemtrada remained relapse-free compared to 47% on Rebif, which was also statistically significantly. Prescribing information for Lemtrada includes a boxed warning about the potential for serious, sometimes fatal, autoimmune conditions such as immune thrombocytopenia (a rare bleeding condition) and anti-glomerular basement membrane disease (which impacts the kidneys). It also warns about serious and life-threatening infusion reactions (reactions occurring during or more than 24 hours after the administration of the medication), increased risk of malignancies (including thyroid cancer, melanoma, and blood cancers). Autoimmune thyroid disorders occurred in 34% of people treated with Lemtrada in clinical studies. The most common adverse reactions noted in people who have taken Lemtrada include rash, headache, fever, nasal congestion, nausea, urinary tract infection, fatigue, insomnia, upper respiratory tract infection, herpes viral infection, hives, itching, thyroid gland disorders, fungal infection, pain in joints, extremities and back, diarrhea, sinusitis, sore mouth and throat, tingling, dizziness, abdominal pain, flushing and vomiting. The FDA recommends that before starting treatment: it should be determined whether the individual has been vaccinated for varicella zoster virus, and if not, tested for antibodies and vaccinated if needed 6 weeks prior to beginning treatment with Lemtrada; thyroid function tests such as thyroid stimulating hormone level should be obtained before treatment and every 3 months until 48 months after the last infusion; full blood count with differential should be obtained prior to treatment and monthly thereafter until 48 months after the last infusion; serum creatinine levels should be obtained prior to treatment and monthly thereafter until 48 months after the last infusion; urinalysis  with urine cell counts be obtained prior to treatment and monthly thereafter until 48 months after the last infusion; skin exam should occur at start of treatment and yearly thereafter to monitor for melanoma; people with active infections should consider delaying treatment until the infection is controlled. People should not have live-virus vaccines after a course of Lemtrada. Monitoring information and recommendations will be provided to individuals enrolled in the Lemtrada REMS program. Before starting treatment with Lemtrada, women should talk to their health care providers if they are pregnant or planning to become pregnant. Taking a disease-modifying therapy is currently the best way to reduce MS disease activity and future deterioration. Selecting an MS therapy should be done by people with MS in collaboration with their MS doctors, taking into account a variety of factors, including the effectiveness of any therapy they are currently using, and weighing potential risks and benefits, costs and lifestyle factors.

FAQ About FDA’s Approval of Alemtuzumab – Brand name Lemtrada™ – for Relapsing MS Lemtrada is a humanized monoclonal antibody directed at CD52 (a protein on the surface of immune cells). It depletes the number of lymphocytes (types of white blood cells). It was originally approved at a significantly higher dose for the treatment of B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Its ability to target immune cells led investigators to test its potential as a treatment for relapsing-remitting MS. The FDA has approved Lemtrada for the treatment of people with forms of MS. In other words, people who experience periodic MS attacks, such as those who have relapsing-remitting MS or secondary-progressive MS with relapses. Because of its safety profile, it is generally be reserved for people who have had an inadequate response to two or more MS therapies. Lemtrada is given by intravenous infusions – for 5 consecutive days initially and for 3 consecutive days one year later. Will my regular doctor be able to prescribe Lemtrada for me? Possibly. All infusion centers and prescribers will be required to be certified so that they are educated about the potential risks of Lemtrada and the importance of monitoring for early signs of possible safety issues. If your regular doctor undergoes the training to become certified to prescribe Lemtrada, then he or she will be able to prescribe Lemtrada. How will I get Lemtrada if my regular doctor is not certified to prescribe it? If your regular doctor is not certified to prescribe Lemtrada, individuals may contact Genzyme for information about qualified healthcare facilities. Is Lemtrada appropriate as a treatment for anyone who has relapsing MS? No. Because of its safety profile, the use of Lemtrada should generally be reserved for people who have had an inadequate response to two or more MS therapies. Individuals will be enrolled in a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) program to educate them about important health monitoring required by those who take this therapy. Lemtrada can cause serious adverse health problems, and its use requires frequent and long-term monitoring, including monthly blood tests for a minimum of five years (four years of monthly and quarterly monitoring after a person’s last infusion). Because Lemtrada has long-term implications for an individual’s lifestyle and the potential for health risks, making the decision to commit to following the safety monitoring requires careful consideration.   A process is in place to train and certify prescribers and treatment centers, and Lemtrada is expected to be available in December 2014. Individuals may contact Genzyme for information about certified prescribers and healthcare facilities. In two phase III , Lemtrada significantly reduced relapse rates over two years by 49.4 to 55% over standard subcutaneous dosing of Rebif (interferon beta-1a, EMD Serono Inc. and Pfizer). In both studies, a higher proportion of people on Lemtrada were relapse-free than those on Rebif. One of the studies also suggested that Lemtrada significantly reduced worsening of disability by 42% over Rebif. Prescribing information for Lemtrada includes a boxed warning about the potential for serious, sometimes fatal, autoimmune conditions such as immune thrombocytopenia (a rare bleeding condition) and anti-glomerular basement membrane disease (which impacts the kidneys). It also warns about serious and life-threatening infusion reactions, increased risk of malignancies (including thyroid cancer, melanoma, and blood cancers). Autoimmune thyroid disorders occurred in 34% of people treated with Lemtrada in clinical studies. The most common adverse reactions noted in people who have taken Lemtrada include rash, headache, fever, nasal congestion, nausea, urinary tract infection, fatigue, insomnia, upper respiratory tract infection, herpes viral infection, hives, itching, thyroid gland disorders, fungal infection, pain in joints, extremities and back, diarrhea, sinusitis, sore mouth and throat, tingling, dizziness, abdominal pain, flushing and vomiting. Why should a person with MS consider taking a disease-modifying therapy? Taking a disease-modifying therapy is currently the best way to reduce MS disease activity and future deterioration. Studies comparing people in clinical trials who started therapy earlier than those on inactive placebo suggest that early treatment offered important benefits against the accumulation of disability, which were generally not experienced to the same degree by those who started treatment later. Selecting an MS therapy should be done by people with MS in collaboration with their MS doctors, taking into account a variety of factors, including the effectiveness of any therapy they are currently using, and weighing potential risks and benefits, costs and lifestyle factors. Should I switch from my current therapy to Lemtrada? The decision about whether to take Lemtrada should be made in collaboration with your MS doctor, taking into account a variety of factors including the effectiveness of any therapy you are currently using, the potential risks and benefits, as well as costs and lifestyle factors. Important questions to be considered and discussed with your doctor in terms of Lemtrada include: • How am I doing on my current therapy? • What is my tolerance for the risk of known side effects? • Am I willing to pledge to long-term, monthly blood draws and other tests that will be needed to identify potential safety issues for four years after my last infusion? • What is my tolerance for the risk of adverse consequences that might emerge later? • How will my medication choice affect my ability or plans to become pregnant? • What are the comparative costs of my current therapy versus Lemtrada? Q. How does the effectiveness of Lemtrada compare to other available therapies? Lemtrada significantly reduced relapse rates over two years over standard subcutaneous dosing of Rebif. Lemtrada has not been compared to other disease-modifying therapies. Prescribing information notes that the recommended dosing of Lemtrada is two treatment courses one year apart. Are there any risk factors or medical conditions that would make it inappropriate for an individual to take Lemtrada? Lemtrada is not appropriate for someone with infection with HIV (human immunodeficiency virus). Lemtrada is rated as a Pregnancy Category C. There have been no adequate studies in pregnant women, but based on animal studies, Lemtrada may cause harm to the fetus. Will a person taking Lemtrada have to get any special medical tests or monitoring? Yes. The FDA recommends that before starting treatment: • it should be determine whether the individual has been vaccinated for varicella zoster virus, and if not, tested for antibodies and vaccinated if appropriate 6 weeks prior to beginning treatment with Lemtrada; • thyroid function tests such as thyroid stimulating hormone level should be obtained before treatment and every 3 months until 48 months after the last infusion; • full blood count with differential should be obtained prior to treatment and monthly thereafter until 48 months after the last infusion; • serum creatinine levels should be obtained prior to treatment and monthly thereafter until 48 months after the last infusion; • urinalysis  with urine cell counts be obtained prior to treatment and monthly thereafter until 48 months after the last infusion; • skin exam should occur at start of treatment and yearly thereafter to monitor for melanoma; • people with active infections should consider delaying treatment until the infection is controlled. • People should not have live-virus vaccines after a course of Lemtrada. Monitoring information and recommendations will be provided to individuals enrolled in the Lemtrada Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy program. It is recommended that individuals receive corticosteroids prior to the Lemtrada infusion and for the first 3 days of each treatment course. Patients should be given antiviral therapy to prevent herpes infection starting on the first day of Lemtrada infusion and for a minimum of two months after dosing or until blood lymphocyte count reaches a specified level. Each Lemtrada infusion is given over 4 hours, after which the person is monitored for two additional hours for any signs of adverse reactions. The actual cost to an individual who has MS will depend on the provisions of his or her insurance coverage and the degree to which that individual will be eligible for programs designed to assist with out-of-pocket costs. Coverage will depend on individual insurance plans. Where can I get information about the patient support that Genzyme plans to provide? For more information about support services, contact Genzyme at 1- 855-MSOne2One. Q. Are there other disease-modifying therapies available or in development for MS? Yes, there are now 12 disease-modifying therapies available.  about disease-modifying therapies and other treatments for MS and MS symptoms. Other potential therapies in later stages of development for relapsing MS include laquinimod, daclizumab high yield process, and ocrelizumab. about ongoing clinical trials in MS:  Why aren’t there more treatments for progressive MS? Nearly every therapy approved for relapsing MS has been tested, or is now in testing, in people with progressive forms of the disease, including primary-progressive MS and secondary-progressive MS. Up to now, clinical trials involving people with relapsing MS often rely on counting relapses or doing MRI scans to detect immune activity. The fact that there is no easy way to detect progression quickly is one reason why development of therapies for progressive MS is behind. The National MS Society is investing in better ways to detect benefits of therapies for progressive forms of MS. In addition, the is a global effort to speed research and treatments on progressive MS. Right now there are large clinical trials going on in progressive MS, including tests of Tysabri,® Gilenya,® Ocrelizumab, Siponimod, and Masitinib. a table of trials on focusing on progressive MS (.pdf) I’ve been hearing news about other new treatments in development for MS. What are some details? Oral and infrequent-dose disease-modifying therapies are just two of many exciting research avenues that address ways to stop MS progression, restore function and end MS forever. Just a few new approaches being explored include adult stem cell transplantation, large-scale clinical trials for progressive MS, trials of agents aimed at protecting or repairing the nervous system, and studies of vitamin D.

If the other approved disease-modifying medications are helpful in relapsing MS, why don’t they work in PPMS? My MS just keeps getting worse. Does everyone with PPMS become severely disabled? I’ve read about all the different symptoms that MS can cause, but since my diagnosis with PPMS my biggest problem has been with my walking. Will I develop all the other symptoms as well? What medications are available to treat primary progressive MS (PPMS)? One medication – ® has been approved by U.S. Food & Drug Administration (FDA) to treat primary progressive MS as well as relapsing forms of MS, which include clinically isolated syndrome, relapsing-remitting disease (RRMS) and active secondary progressive disease (SPMS with relapses).  In addition to this disease-modifying therapy, a wide range of symptomatic medications and rehabilitation strategies are used to manage PPMS. If the other approved disease-modifying medications are helpful in relapsing MS, why don’t they work in PPMS? The other we currently have available primarily target inflammation in the central nervous system (CNS). They have all been shown to reduce the number of acute relapses (also called attacks or exacerbations) and number of new lesions (also called plaques) on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. PPMS involves much less inflammation and more gradual destruction and loss of nerve fibers. As a result, people with PPMS tend to have fewer brain lesions than people with relapsing MS, and the lesions tend to contain fewer inflammatory cells. The available disease-modifying medications are not effective in slowing the nerve damage that occurs in PPMS.   My MS just keeps getting worse. Does everyone with PPMS become severely disabled? MS is a variable and unpredictable disease. Although PPMS is characterized by fairly steady progression, one person’s symptoms may progress differently or more rapidly than someone else’s symptoms. Because spinal cord lesions (also called plaques) are more common than brain lesions in PPMS, problems with walking are very common, but other symptoms may occur as well. The medication, ®, has been approved to treat PPMS as well as relapsing forms of MS. This medication may slow the progression you are experiencing. At the same time, ongoing and can help you stay active, maintain your safety and independence, and enhance your quality of life.  I’ve read about all the different symptoms that MS can cause, but since my diagnosis with PPMS my biggest problem has been with my walking. Will I develop all the other symptoms as well? Because people with PPMS tend to have more spinal cord lesions than brain lesions, problems with walking are very common. In fact, the onset of PPMS is usually characterized by gradually increasing walking problems and fatigue. Lesions in the brain could cause other symptoms to develop, including visual disturbance, cognitive changes, mood changes, balance problems, and tremor, among others. However, there is no way to predict this ahead of time, and your primary challenge may continue to be with walking.

People with active secondary progressive MS have had progression of disability but still experience acute relapses and/or new MRI activity. Dimethyl fumarate (dye-METH-il FOO-ma-rate) is a delayed release capsule taken twice per day. This approval means that Mylan, the generic’s maker, provided evidence that both the 120 mg (starter dose) and 240 mg (maintenance dose) generic medications are equivalent to the brand-name Tecfidera. In clinical trials, Tecfidera was shown to significantly reduce relapses and disease activity on MRIs, and in one trial it reduced progression of disability. According to Mylan, this therapy is now available for prescription. The announced wholesale price (WAC) equates to $85,709 per year. Out of pocket cost will vary. Mylan provides some cost relief to certain individuals with or without commercial insurance. “Generic options will increase affordability of and access to MS disease-modifying therapies, which are the cornerstone of MS management,” commented Kathy Costello, MS, ANP-BC, MSCN, Associate Vice President of Healthcare Access at the National MS Society.   Most common possible side effects of dimethyl fumarate include: Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, stomach pain, or indigestion Flushing and stomach problems are the most common reactions, especially at the start of therapy, and may decrease over time.

You can develop MS at any age, but most people receive diagnoses between the . There are relapsing, remitting, and progressive types of MS, but the course is rarely predictable. Researchers still don’t fully understand the cause of MS or why the rate of progression is so difficult to determine. The good news is that many people living with MS don’t develop severe disabilities. Most have a normal or near-normal lifespan. There’s no national or global registry for new MS cases. Known figures are only estimates. Recent findings from a National MS Society study estimate nearly in the United States are living with MS. This is more than double the last reported number, and the first national research on MS prevalence since 1975. The society also estimates that 2.3 million people live with MS globally. About are diagnosed each week in the United States, says the MS Discovery Forum. Rates of MS are higher . It’s estimated that in (below the 37th parallel), the rate of MS is between 57 and 78 cases per 100,000 people. The rate is twice as high in northern states (above the 37th parallel), at about 110 to 140 cases per 100,000. The incidence of MS is also higher in colder climates. People of Northern European descent have the highest risk of developing MS, no matter where they live. Meanwhile, the lowest risk appears to be among Native Americans, Africans, and Asians. A 2013 study found only of all diagnosed MS cases are in children. Far more women have MS. In fact, the National MS Society estimates MS is more common in women than men. MS is , but researchers believe there may be a genetic predisposition to developing the disease. About of people with MS have one or more family members or relatives who also have MS, notes the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke. In the case of identical twins, there’s a 1 in 3 chance for each sibling to have the disease. Researchers and neurologists still can’t say with certainty what causes MS. The ultimate cause of MS is damage to myelin, nerve fibers, and neurons in the brain and spinal cord. Together these make up the central nervous system. Researchers speculate that a combination of genetic and environmental factors is at play, but it’s not fully understood how. The relationship of the immune system and the brain, however, could be considered a culprit. Researchers suggest the immune system could mistake normal brain cells for foreign ones. One thing the MS community knows for certain is that the disease is . CISis considered to be of MS, but it may or may not progress to MS.To get a diagnosis of MS: A person has to experience a neurologic episode (typically lasting 24 hours or more) that resulted in damage to the central nervous system. People who are at high risk of developing MS are found to have MRI-detected brain lesions. There’s a chance of receiving an MS diagnosis within a few years, estimates the National MS Society. Meanwhile, people at low riskdon’t have MRI-detected brain lesions. They have a 20 percent chance of receiving an MS diagnosis in the same amount of time. RRMS is characterized by clearly defined relapses of increased disease activity and worsening symptoms. These are followed by remissions when the disease doesn’t progress. Symptoms may improve or disappear during remission. Approximately of people receive a diagnosis of RRMS at first, says the National MS Society. SPMS follows an initial RRMS diagnosis. It sees disability gradually increase as the disease progresses, with or without evidence of relapse or changes in an MRI scan. Occasional relapses may occur, as will periods of stability. Untreated, about of people with RRMS transition to SPMS within a decade of the initial diagnosis, estimates a 2017 study. About 90 percent of people transition within 25 years. PPMS is diagnosed in about of people with MS, estimates the National MS Society. People with PPMS experience a steady progression of the disease with no clear relapses or remissions. The rate of PPMS is equally divided between men and women. Symptoms usually begin between the ages of 35 and 39. A high percentage of MS cases don’t progress. These may fit into a subgroup with a “very stable benign” form of the disease, per a presented in 2017. Researchers say it’s possible for people to remain in the RRMS phase for 30 years. At the other end of the spectrum, a 2015 study found about of people with MS develop a more aggressive course of the disease. It’s known as highly active relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (HARRMS). Symptoms vary a great deal from one person to another. No two people have the same combination of symptoms. This, of course, complicates identification and diagnosis. In a , one-fifth of European women surveyed received misdiagnoses before eventually receiving an MS diagnosis. The average woman was found to go through about five visits with a healthcare provider over the course of six months before reaching a diagnosis. According to the , symptoms can impact the mind, body, and senses in a number of ways. These include: There’s no single “MS test.” To receive a diagnosis, your doctor needs to collect your medical history and perform a neurological examination and a series of other tests. Tests may include: Since the exact cause of MS is still unknown, there’s no known prevention. There’s also no cure for MS yet, but treatments can manage symptoms. MS medications are designed to lessen the frequency of relapses and slow the progression of the disease. There several approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to treat MS. They include: These medications aren’t approved for use during pregnancy. It’s also unclear if MS medications are excreted through breast milk. Talk to your doctor about your MS medications if you’re considering becoming pregnant. People with MS can safely carry a baby to term. Pregnancy doesn’t generally affect MS in the long term. MS has been found to affect decisions about pregnancy, though. In a , 36 percent of women participants decided not to have children at all or postponed the timing of getting pregnant due to their MS. While people with MS often experience during pregnancy, about have a relapse within six months of giving birth. MS is an expensive disease to treat. A found the total lifetime costs per person with MS to be $4.1 million. The average yearly healthcare costs range from $30,000 to $100,000 based on the mildness or severity of the disease.

Individuals taking Gilenya are advised treatment without first talking to their MS healthcare providers. Healthcare providers are advised to inform their patients of this information before initiating Gilenya, and to observe patients after treatment cessation for evidence of relapse so that it can be treated appropriately.   The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has issued a indicating that – in rare cases – when treatment with Gilenya (fingolimod, Novartis AG) is stopped, MS disease activity can become much worse than before the medicine was started or while it was being taken.   This warning is based on 35 cases of severely increased disability accompanied by the presence of multiple new lesions on MRI that occurred 2 to 24 weeks after Gilenya was stopped. Most experienced this worsening in the first 12 weeks. Of these cases, six eventually returned to the level of disability they had before or during treatment, but most experienced partial or no recovery.   The FDA advises that people taking Gilenya without first talking to their MS healthcare providers. As with other MS disease-modifying therapies, treatment with Gilenya may have to be stopped for various reasons, such as side effects/adverse reactions, pregnancy, or because the medicine is not working. Individuals should contact their healthcare providers immediately if they experience new or worsened symptoms of MS after treatment is stopped, including new or worsened weakness, decreases in mobility, or changes in cognitive function, vision, or balance. The FDA advises healthcare providers to inform patients before starting treatment about the potential risk of severe increase in disability after stopping Gilenya, and to carefully observe patients who stop therapy for evidence of an MS relapse so that it can be treated appropriately.   Multiple sclerosis is an unpredictable, often disabling . range from numbness and tingling to blindness and paralysis, and there is currently no cure for MS.

fcf8df43-af3b-4d59-bb99-0559ea3926a1,"Many effective medications are available for the treatment of multiple sclerosis (MS). These types of drugs may be prescribed for three different categories of MS treatment. The first area of treatment is to slow MS activity and progression; the second area is to reduce the severity and duration of a relapse; and the third area is to treat the symptoms of MS individually. All of these medications are prescribed by a physician – usually a neurologist who specializes in MS. Individuals considering a change to their present treatment regimen should always consult their physician. are also referred to as disease-modifying therapies (DMTs). Presently, these include more than 20 approved brand-name and generic DMTs to slow MS activity and progression, each of which is approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for relapsing forms of MS in adults – and some are also approved for clinically isolated syndrome, prior to the diagnosis of MS. Newer approvals also include other forms of MS, as noted in the details to follow. In 2017, Ocrevus™ (ocrelizumab) was approved for two types of MS: relapsing forms of MS (RMS) and primary-progressive MS (PPMS). In 2019, Mayzent® (siponimod) oral tablets, Mavenclad® (cladribine) oral tablets, and Vumerity™ (diroximel fumarate) oral capsules, were approved to treat RMS as well as active secondary-progressive MS (SPMS), which is a more steady form of MS that follows RRMS, but still has relapses. Mayzent and Vumerity are also approved for clinically isolated syndrome (CIS).These are the only DMTs to be approved in recent years for active SPMS. While both are approved for RMS and active SPMS, Mayzent is also approved for clinically isolated syndrome (CIS). Another DMT, Ocrevus™ (ocrelizumab), is the only DMT that is also approved for primary-progressive MS. Additionally, Gilenya® (fingolimod), is the only DMT also approved for the treatment of children and adolescents, ages 10 through 17, with relapsing forms of MS. Young people under the age of 18 who are diagnosed with MS are referred to having “pediatric MS”; the vast majority (98 percent) of individuals with pediatric MS are diagnosed with the relapsing form of the disease. In nearly all instances, these drugs are prescribed individually, so a patient only takes one DMT during any time period. Of these 20-plus approved brand-name and generic medications, eight are given at home via injection; four are given by a medical professional via intravenous (IV) infusion; and nine* are taken orally. *Please note that these nine oral medications include three approved generic versions of Gilenya® (fingolimod) capsules, which are not yet available. helps to control the sudden flare-up of symptoms, also referred to as exacerbations or attacks. Relapses usually range in length from a few days to a few months before subsiding. While such treatments may be able to shorten the length of the relapse and lessen its severity, treating a relapse does not appear to affect the long-term progression of the disease or its symptoms. is another equally important area in the overall treatment of MS. Symptoms vary greatly from one individual to another, and each symptom needs to be addressed by healthcare professionals who specialize in MS. In addition to medications prescribed for a specific symptom, other treatment therapies – such as rehabilitation, counseling, and exercise, for example – may be recommended by the healthcare team to increase the effectiveness of managing certain symptoms. Most of these medications are available by prescription only, but even with over-the-counter medications, anyone considering making a change to his or her present regimen should consult a physician. Some of the medications listed may cause side effects, and these can be managed by one’s medical professional through adjusting dosage, switching drugs, or adding other medications.

Recommended revisions are expected to speed the diagnostic process and reduce the chance of misdiagnosis. The panel was convened under the auspices of the International Advisory Committee on Clinical Trials in MS, sponsored by the National MS Society and the European Committee for Treatment and Research in Multiple Sclerosis. The team published their findings in. The entire contents of the paper can be accessed free, with registration.   This graphic summarizes the new diagnostic criteria.  “Treating MS early and effectively is our best current way to limit permanent damage to the nervous system, so speeding the diagnosis of MS with improved accuracy is an important goal,” commented Bruce Cohen, MD, Professor, Davee Department of Neurology and Clinical Neurosciences, Northwestern University, and chair of the Society’s National Medical Advisory Committee. “Efforts like the work of this international panel illustrate the National MS Society’s role as a convening force to push forward progress that not only improves clinical care, but also identifies research gaps and opportunities,” noted Bruce Bebo, PhD, Executive Vice President of Research at the Society. “The paper highlights the need for research to identify additional biological markers of MS and its subtypes. This gap impedes progress on several fronts, making it a critical target for the global MS research community,” he continued.   DETAILS Multiple sclerosis can be difficult to diagnose because there is no single test that can determine that a person has MS. The process of diagnosis involves obtaining evidence from a clinical examination, medical history, lab tests and MRI imaging of the brain and sometimes the spinal cord. These tests are intended to rule out other possible causes of a person’s neurological symptoms and to gather data consistent with MS. A key principle for diagnosing MS is to uncover evidence that demonstrates lesions in the central nervous system (brain and spinal cord) showing “dissemination in space” (DIS – suggestions of damage in more than one place in the nervous system) and “dissemination in time” (DIT – suggestions that damage has occurred more than once).   New research evidence and evolving knowledge since the previous 2010 “McDonald Criteria” for diagnosing MS compelled a 30-member international panel of MS experts to consider whether revisions would improve the speed and accuracy of the diagnosis of MS while reducing the possibility of misdiagnosis. The International Panel on Diagnosis of Multiple Sclerosis met in 2016 and 2017 under the auspices of the International Advisory Committee on Clinical Trials in MS, sponsored by the National MS Society and the European Committee for Treatment and Research in Multiple Sclerosis. The panel was co-chaired by Jeffrey Cohen, MD (Cleveland Clinic) and Alan Thompson, MD (University College London). The panel reviewed prior diagnostic criteria and evidence published since the 2010 McDonald Diagnostic Criteria were established, to help inform evidence-based recommendations likely to speed the diagnostic process and reduce the incidence of misdiagnosis.   The result was a paper published online in , “Diagnosis of multiple sclerosis: 2017 revisions of the McDonald criteria.” The entire contents of the paper can be accessed free, with registration.   MS is best diagnosed by a clinician with MS-related expertise with support of imaging and other tests. Dissemination of lesions in the nervous system in space and time are required, but the revisions provide additional avenues for obtaining supporting evidence of dissemination. The need to ensure there is no better explanation for the individual’s symptoms remains an essential consideration. The McDonald Diagnostic Criteria apply to individuals experiencing a typical -- CIS. (CIS is a first episode of neurologic symptoms typical of an MS relapse in a person not known to have MS.) In individuals with typical CIS: CSF oligoclonal bands -- Positive findings of oligoclonal bands in the spinal fluid can substitute for demonstration of dissemination of lesions in time in some settings. Types of lesions – Both asymptomatic and now symptomatic MRI lesions can be considered in determining dissemination in space or time. (This does not include MRI lesions in the optic nerve in a person presenting with optic neuritis.) Site of lesions – Cortical lesions have been added to juxtacortical lesions for use in determining MRI criteria for dissemination of lesions in space.    Brain MRI should be obtained during the MS diagnostic process, unless not possible. Spinal MRI should be obtained when additional data are needed to confirm the diagnosis. When spinal fluid is used as part of the diagnostic process, paired serum and CSF samples be analyzed to confirm that oligoclonal bands are unique to the CSF. At the time of diagnosis, the should be indicated, and whether the course is active or not, and progressive or not; and the type and course of MS should be re-evaluated periodically as the disease evolves.  Recent studies suggest misdiagnosis of MS is not uncommon. The paper emphasizes that if an individual does not have typical CIS, or is a member of a population in which MS is less common (such as children, older individuals, or non-white populations), additional testing can help gather additional evidence needed to firm up whether the person indeed has MS or something else that may require different treatment and management.     What About People Diagnosed Using Previous McDonald Criteria? Anyone who was diagnosed using previous versions of the McDonald Criteria will also meet the criteria for MS as laid out in the 2017 McDonald Criteria.   The panel recommended that the 2017 McDonald Criteria be validated in a variety of studies and populations, and that research continue on biomarkers, imaging and other advances that may help refine the diagnostic process in the future.

9e84144c-e92c-439c-b3c7-241a17851de1,"— Neuromyelitis optica (NMO) is a chronic health condition that affects nerves in the eyes, spinal cord, and sometimes brain. It’s also known as Devic disease or Devic syndrome. It may cause vision loss, muscle weakness, and other symptoms. Read on to learn more about this condition, including how it’s diagnosed and treated. NMO is believed to be an autoimmune condition, where the body’s own immune system attacks healthy cells. In NMO, the immune system attacks the central nervous system (CNS) and optic nerves. Your CNS includes your spinal cord and brain. Your optic nerves carry signals between your eyes and brain. When your immune system attacks your CNS and optic nerves, it can cause inflammation and nerve damage. This can produce symptoms such as eye pain, vision loss, and muscle weakness. NMO is more common in people of Asian, African, and Native American descent. Women account for more than of cases of NMO. NMO symptoms most often appear in but may develop at any age. They may include: muscle weakness or paralysis in your arms and legs Most people with NMO develop a relapsing form of the disease. They experience multiple episodes of NMO symptoms known as relapses. These may occur months or years apart. People with relapsing NMO tend to partially recover between relapses. Many of them eventually develop lasting vision loss and muscle weakness or paralysis that persist between relapses. A smaller number of people with NMO develop a monophasic form of the disease. They experience a single episode of symptoms that may last for several months. They may also have lasting vision loss and muscle weakness. Contact your doctor right away if you develop NMO symptoms such as eye pain, vision loss, muscle weakness, loss of sensation, or loss of control of your bowel or bladder. To make an NMO diagnosis, your doctor will ask you about your symptoms and medical history and conduct a physical exam. The following tests can help your doctor to make an NMO diagnosis: , to assess your eye function and structure , to assess your strength, coordination, sensation, thinking, memory, vision, and speech , to create pictures of your spinal cord, brain, and optic nerves , to collect a sample of fluid from around your brain and spine for testing , to check for certain antibodies that are found in many people with NMO About of people with NMO produce a type of immune molecule known as anti-AQP4 antibodies. Your NMO treatment options will partly depend on whether or not you produce these antibodies. Your doctor may prescribe several NMO treatments to help reverse recent symptoms or prevent future attacks. Immediately following an NMO attack, your doctor may treat symptoms by injecting you with high doses of the corticosteroid methylprednisolone (Solu-Medrol). If corticosteroids don’t improve your symptoms and you have anti-AQP4 antibodies, you may receive a plasma exchange (PLEX) to lower your antibody levels. During this procedure, a healthcare provider removes blood from your body with an IV. Your plasma (the liquid part of your blood) is then separated from cells and replaced with a synthetic substitute. The healthcare provider then returns the blood to your body with an IV. The process may take hours and may be repeated several times over several days. To prevent relapses, your doctor may also prescribe immune-suppressing medications. If you produce anti-AQP4 antibodies, you may receive intravenous immune-suppressing medications including eculizumab (Soliris) or inebilizumab (Uplizna) to prevent future attacks. Several other immune-suppressing drugs are used off-label to reduce the risk of recurrence. These include azathioprine (Imuran, Azasan), rituximab (Rituxan), or mycophenolate mofetil (Cellcept). Your doctor may prescribe other medications, rehabilitative therapy, and lifestyle changes to help manage symptoms or complications of NMO. Talk to your doctor to learn more about the potential benefits and risks of your treatment options. NMO is similar to multiple sclerosis (MS) in several ways. Both conditions are autoimmune disorders that affect nerve cells in the CNS and optic nerves. They may produce similar symptoms, such as vision loss and muscle weakness. the specific immune cells and autoimmune processes that are involved in NMO aren’t the same as those involved in MS people with MS don’t have anti-AQP4 antibodies, while 70 percent of people with NMO do some of the treatments that work for MS don’t work for NMO NMO relapses also tend to produce more severe symptoms than MS relapses NMO tends to cause irreversible health problems more quickly than MS, although both conditions can cause lasting damage over time NMO affects some people with the condition more severely than others. The condition may eventually cause lasting health problems, such as vision loss, muscle weakness, and issues with bowel and bladder control. It may affect your ability to see, get around, and complete day-to-day tasks. In severe cases, complications of the disease can make it difficult to breathe. Your doctor and other members of your treatment team can help you develop a plan to manage your symptoms, improve your quality of life, and support your ability to complete daily tasks with NMO. medications to help limit relapses, relieve symptoms, and treat complications physical therapy to help maintain or improve your strength and mobility occupational therapy to help you adapt to changes in how your body functions Your doctor may encourage you to meet with a social worker to help you access social support services such as disability benefits. Your doctor may also refer you to a professional counselor or patient support group to help meet your mental health and social support needs. Let your doctor or other members of your treatment team know if your symptoms change, you have concerns about your treatment plan, or you’re finding it difficult to manage the challenges of living with NMO. It’s difficult to predict how NMO will develop in any one person. The condition causes more severe symptoms in some people and sometimes leads to potentially life threatening complications. According to the authors of a review article in , early treatment is important for reducing the risk of disability and death from NMO. Getting treatment may help limit relapses, prevent complications, and improve your long-term outlook. The authors of the review report that roughly of people with NMO who don’t get treatment die within 5 years of their first episode. If you have NMO, eating a well-balanced diet is important for promoting good overall health. A registered dietitian can help you develop a healthy eating plan that’s sustainable for you. eating a variety of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean protein limiting your intake of foods that are high in saturated fats or sugar, such as processed meats, pastries, and sweets drinking 6 to 8 cups of water or other sugar-free fluids per day avoiding or limiting your intake of alcohol and caffeine Some NMO treatments may affect your appetite or weight. Talk to your doctor if you’re concerned. Your doctor or dietitian may recommend changes to your dietary habits if you develop urinary frequency, constipation, or other challenges with your bladder or bowel habits. If you receive a diagnosis of NMO, your long-term outlook will partly depend on the form of NMO that you develop, the treatment that you receive, and your overall health. Following your recommended treatment plan may help limit relapses, prevent complications, and keep you healthier for longer. Talk to your doctor to learn more about your treatment options and outlook with this condition. — What’s the Difference Between Neuromyelitis Optica and MS?

A single retrospective case control study in 47 MS patients receiving VZV vaccination showed improvement in 29.8%, deterioration in 8.5%, and no change in 61.7%. Four patients developed a mild vaccine-associated chickenpox. The significance of this study is unclear at the present time. Q: Is there any evidence that vaccinations either cause or precipitate relapses of MS? There does not appear to be any evidence that vaccinations cause or precipitate relapses in people known to have MS. A practice advisory from the American Academy of Neurology (Rutschmann et al 2002) found strong evidence against an increased risk of MS exacerbation after influenza immunization. There is limited data related to other specific vaccinations increasing relapse rate. A randomized blinded trial of influenza vaccination in patients with relapsing MS showed no difference in attack rate between treated and placebo treated patients (Miller et al 1997). At the Mellen Center we recommend that patients get the influenza vaccination shot (not the FluMist live inactivated vaccine) annually. Our opinion is that the risk of influenza in the MS population outweighs any risk of the influenza vaccine. Note that each year’s vaccine varies, and so this may change depending on information emerging with future vaccination cycles. Q: What are the recommendations for vaccinations in adults now? Attached is the recommended Adult Immunization Schedule for the United States for 2016. There are no additional vaccination recommended for the MS population (see below for specific medications and vaccination recommendations). Our recommendation is that MS patients receive the standard schedule of vaccinations for their age and other individual characteristics unless they are on specific medications with an impact on response to vaccination (see below). MS patients should try to avoid live attenuated vaccines where possible (see below). Attachment - Q: Should any specific vaccinations or types of vaccinations be avoided and if so why? Inactivated vaccines are generally considered safe for people with MS including those taking a disease modifying therapy. Live attenuated vaccines are generally not recommended for a person with MS because their ability to cause disease is weakened but not totally inactivated. We note that this is a theoretical risk and that there is no high quality evidence showing an increased risk in the MS population of live attenuated vaccines at this time. Q: Do any of the DMTs we use have an effect on the safety or efficacy of vaccination? Corticosteroids, particularly long term daily use, might have an impact on the efficacy or response to vaccination. However, organ transplantation patients on long term steroids do not show an impaired immune response to influenza or pneumococcal vaccinations (Briggs 1980). The response has not been evaluated in MS patients, but generally corticosteroids are not used in an ongoing fashion other than as intermittent pulse therapy in MS. When patients with MS are treated with a course of steroids, at the Mellen Center we recommend deferring immunization until 6 weeks after steroids are completed. Interferons do not seem to interfere with immune responses in MS patients and may have an antiviral effect. In a prospective study of 88 MS patients treated with interferon beta-1a and 77 untreated patients with MS, similar proportions (93 and 90% respectively) developed protective immune responses after receiving seasonal influenza vaccination (Schwid et al 2005). There is no evidence that glatiramer acetate affects the safety or efficacy of vaccination (glatiramer acetate package insert). There is no evidence of an effect of natalizumab on the safety or efficacy of vaccination. A study evaluating immune responses in MS patients going onto fingolimod vs placebo showed that while most patients mounted an effective immune reaction, there was a lower response rate compared with placebo patients (Kappos et al 2015). Teriflunomide treated patients generally mounted an effective immune response to immunization with seasonal influenza vaccine (Bar-Or et al 2013). Patients with MS treated with daclizumab mount normal immune response to influenza vaccination (Lin et al 2016). See below for specific discussions of fingolimod and alemtuzumab. Other than specific recommendations for certain DMTs, there is no overall increase in safety risk for MS patients from vaccinations. Rituximab has been used off label for refractory MS and for neuromyelitis optica. At present there is no literature on vaccinations and rituximab specific to MS. Results of immunization in patients with rheumatic conditions on rituximab vary from preserved response to immunization (Bingham 2010, Arad 2011, rheumatoid arthritis patients) to reduced (Albert 2006, lupus patients). These studies are confounded by the immunological abnormalities in the patients prior to treatment. In light of the lack of data, at the Mellen Center we would recommend required immunizations be given 6 weeks prior to initiation of rituximab if possible. Q: Should any vaccines be used before starting DMTs and if so under what circumstances? Fingolimod (Gilenya), a sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor modulator approved for relapsing MS, may increase the risk of dissemination and potentially life threatening varicella zoster (VZV infections). At the Mellen Center we check for VZV antibodies before initiating fingolimod therapy. If immunity is not demonstrated by elevated VZV titers, we initiate chicken pox (two-step) vaccination prior to initiating fingolimod. Optimally checking for the development of VZV antibodies prior to beginning medication would be prudent. Having elevated VZV titers does against developing zoster infections (anecdotal communication). At the Mellen Center we recommend waiting 1 month after last VZV immunization to initiate fingolimod. Alemtuzumab (Lemtrada) is a humanized monoclonal antibody directed against CD52. CD52 is a cell surface antigen present on T and B cells. Alemtuzumab depletes circulating T and B cells for variable amounts of time; over months T and B cell lines repopulate, with B cells usually repopulating over 6 months and T cells over 12 months. Because of this profound immunological effect, should not be used after initiation of alemtuzumab due to an increased risk of infection. Live attenuated vaccines include: Live Attenuated Flu Vaccine (LAIV, nasal spray), MMR, chickenpox, and Zostavax (herpes zoster). Vaccines which are not live include: tetanus toxoid boosters and injectable influenza vaccine. One study showed retained immune competence related to prior vaccination after treatment with alemtuzumab (McCarthy C, et al 2013). We recommend that any required vaccinations be given 6 weeks before initiating alemtuzumab to ensure an adequate immunological response before lymphocyte depletion. A similar recommendation is reasonable for other major immunosuppressive regimen (e.g. cyclophosphamide, bone marrow transplantation, rituximab, etc.). Q: Should patients having a relapse avoid immunizations? There is limited data on this group of patients. The National MS Society advises that people experiencing a serious relapse affecting the ability to carry out activities should defer vaccination until 4 - 6 weeks after the onset of the relapse. Q: What about the use of shingles vaccine (Zostavax, live-virus to prevent shingles) in older patients with MS? There is no high quality evidence about shingles vaccine in the MS population. At present at the Mellen Center we recommend patients have this vaccination unless on immunosuppressing medications. This is consistent with recommendations from the National MS society. The CDC does not have specific recommendations for travel vaccination for the MS patient. Care should be taken with patients on strong immunosuppressing regimens similar to that for bone marrow transplant patients. Most patients with MS will not conform to this designation. Reviewing the data for travel immunization in immunocompromised individuals may be helpful in those patients on alemtuzumab, cyclophosphamide, rituximab, daclizumab or other major immunosuppressing medication regimens. At the Mellen Center we advise our patients travelling to at risk countries to seek infectious disease counselling before travelling. Ms relapse risk not increased; not recommended if immunosuppressed Insufficient data in MS, consider before immunosuppression Possibly associated with reduced risk of MS; no restrictions MS relapse risk not increased by vaccine; not recommended with immunosuppressive therapy; initiate prior to starting fingolimod if no immunity National MS Society recommendations on MS and vaccination The Academy of Neurology, in collaboration with the Immunization Panel of the Multiple Sclerosis Council for Clinical Practice Guidelines, published a summary of evidence and recommendations regarding immunizations and MS. They concluded that: The evidence supports strategies to minimize the risk of acquiring infectious diseases that may trigger MS relapses (also called attacks or exacerbations). The influenza, hepatitis B, varicella and tetanus vaccines are safe for people with MS. Decisions about the potential benefits and risks of any given immunization should be made in consultation with your healthcare providers, including your family physician and neurologist. People who are experiencing a serious relapse that affects their ability to carry out activities of daily living should defer vaccination until 4-6 weeks after the onset of the relapse. Inactivated vaccines are generally considered safe for people with MS, including those who are taking an interferon medication (Avonex®, Betaseron®, Extavia®, Plegridy™, Rebif®), Aubagio®, Copaxone®, Gilenya®, Glatopa®, Lemtrada®, Novantrone, Tecfidera® or Tysabri®. Live, attenuated vaccines are generally not recommended for a person with MS because their ability to cause disease has been weakened but not totally inactivated. People on therapies that suppress the immune system, such as Cytoxan, Imuran, Novantrone, Rheumatrex® and/or chronic corticosteroid therapy, should consult their neurologist before taking any live-virus vaccine. A person should not receive a live-virus vaccine following a course of Lemtrada. MS experts are not in agreement about the risks for a person with MS whose close family member receives a live-virus vaccine. The family should discuss with the neurologist how best to handle this situation. 2015-2016 Injectable Seasonal Flu Vaccine (includes H1N1) The 2015-16 inactivated seasonal influenza (flu) immunization is manufactured by several different companies under different brand names. Each is a single injection that provides immunity to three or four different flu viruses. Trivalent vaccines protect against three types of flu: the A/California/7/2009 (H1N1) pdm09-like virus; the A/Switzerland/971/2013 (H3N2)-like virus; the B/Phuket/3073/2013-like virus (a B/Yamagata lineage virus). Quadrivalent vaccines protect against the same three viruses plus an additional B virus (B/Brisbane/60/2008-like virus). The 2015-16 inactivated seasonal flu immunization is recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for everyone over 6 months of age. The seasonal flu vaccine has been studied extensively in people with MS and is considered quite safe, regardless of the disease-modifying therapy they are taking. However, individuals being treated with Lemtrada® should be given the inactivated flu vaccine six weeks before receiving their Lemtrada infusion. A high-dose inactivated flu vaccine (Fluzone High Dose) is available for people over age 65. The Centers for Disease Control does not specifically recommend the high-dose vaccine for people over age 65 and the high-dose vaccine has not been studied in people with MS of any age. For these reasons, the National MS Society continues to support influenza vaccination (flu shots) for people with MS but recommends that only the standard dose be used. If additional data for Fluzone high dose in MS patients become available, the recommendation may be revised. FluMist is a live-virus flu vaccine (sometimes called LAIV for ""live attenuated influenza vaccine”) that is delivered via a nasal spray. This live-virus vaccine is not recommended for people with MS. Recommended for all children, adolescents, and adults at risk of contracting this potentially lifethreatening disease. In 2002 the National Academy of Sciences’ Institute of Medicine (IOM) determined that there is no association between hepatitis B vaccination and the onset of MS. Designed to prevent the HPV 6, 11, 16 and/or 18-related cervical cancer, cervical dysplasias, vulvar and vaginal dysplasias, and condyloma acuminate in girls and women ages 9 to 26. One case report (Waldemann et al., 2009) described the onset of acute disseminated encephalomyelitis following the second immunization with Gardasil and Sutton et al. (2009) reported five patients who presented with multifocal or atypical demyelination syndromes within 21 days of the second or third immunization (three of whom had previously experienced clinical isolated episodes of neurological dysfunction). However, a recent large-scale study of patient registries in Denmark and Sweden (see below) found no increased risk of developing MS among nearly 800,000 who received this vaccine. Use of Gardasil should be preceded by a discussion between patient and physician regarding benefits and risks. A live-virus vaccine to prevent shingles. MS neurologists do not recommend live-virus vaccines for people with MS because these vaccines can lead to an increase in disease activity. However, Zostavax is an exception because most people have had chicken pox earlier in their lives and therefore already have the virus in their bodies. Each person needs to discuss the potential benefits and risks of this vaccine with her or his healthcare provider. While this vaccine has not been studied in people with MS, it should be made available to any person with MS directly exposed to smallpox as the risks associated with not getting vaccinated would be too great. This vaccine should be considered by people with MS who have never had chicken pox, lack evidence of prior immunity, and are considering starting an MS medication that has the potential to suppress cell mediated immunity – for example, Gilenya (fingolimod) and Lemtrada (alemtuzumab). The vaccine should be taken six weeks before starting the MS therapy. Studies of Vaccine Safety and Effectiveness in People with MS Some, but not all, immunizations have been evaluated for safety and efficacy in people with MS: A study by the Vaccines in Multiple Sclerosis Study Group published in 2001 in the New England Journal of Medicine found that vaccination for tetanus, hepatitis B or influenza did not appear to increase the short-term risk of relapses (also called attacks or exacerbations) in people with MS. A study by the National Immunization Program of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, published in the Archives of Neurology in 2003, found that vaccination against hepatitis B, influenza, tetanus, measles, or rubella did not increase a person’s risk of developing MS or optic neuritis (which is often a first symptom of MS). A small, unblinded study, published in the Archives of Neurology in 2011, of people with relapsingremitting MS who received the yellow fever vaccination prior to travel, found a significantly increased risk of MS relapses during the six weeks following the vaccination when compared to the remainder of the two-year follow-up period. For people with MS who must travel to areas where yellow fever is common, the increased relapse risk needs to be carefully weighed against the likelihood of exposure to yellow fever – which is a potentially fatal illness. A study of nearly four million girls and women identified in nationwide patient registries in Denmark and Sweden, published in JAMA, found no increased risk of developing MS among nearly 800,000 who received quadrivalent human papillomavirus vaccine (Gardasil), designed to prevent cervical cancer. A review of data from the complete electronic medical health records of Kaiser Permanente Southern California between 2008 and 20011, published in JAMA Neurology, found no long-term association of vaccines with MS or any other acquired central nervous system demyelinating disease.

This study was inspired by the observation that MS relapses are less frequent during later pregnancy, a time when estriol is at high levels. The trial, led by Rhonda Voskuhl, MD (University of California, Los Angeles), compared disease activity in those given oral estriol (Trimesta,TM Synthetic Biologics), in combination with glatiramer acetate (Copaxone,® Teva Neuroscience) with those taking glatiramer acetate and placebo. The combination of estriol and glatiramer acetate appeared to be safe over the two-year study period, but further studies will be necessary to confirm long-term safety of estriol for use in relapsing MS. The trial demonstrated a 32% reduction in the relapse rate at two years in the group receiving the combination of glatiramer acetate and estriol compared to the glatiramer only group. However, additional trials with larger numbers of patients are needed to confirm this result. Trends in some of the secondary outcomes measures including cognition and fatigue look promising, but need to be followed up in future studies. The trial, in Lancet Neurology online on November 24, 2015, was funded by the National MS Society, the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, and private donors.  : MS affects women two to three times as often as men and pregnancy has been shown to provide some protection from MS relapses in women. These findings along with a series of others prompted the National MS Society to launch a special five-year, $10 million research initiative in the late 1990’s to explore the importance of the meaning behind these observations. Among the results from the 50 projects supported through this initiative was the possibility that the female hormone estriol may help protect women from MS relapses. Understanding gender differences and the protection provided by pregnancy is still an active area of research investment and interest in the MS community.   Estriol levels naturally rise during later pregnancy, a time when many women’s MS disease activity declines. This led some to suspect that estriol may be responsible for this easing of symptoms during pregnancy. Rhonda Voskuhl, MD (University of California, Los Angeles) and others explored this lead in mice with an MS-like disease. Later, with National MS Society support, Dr. Voskuhl conducted a small, early-phase trial of estriol in 12 women with relapsing-remitting MS. Results suggested that estriol might decrease disease activity. Phase 2 trials such as the one reported in this published paper are designed to provide information about a therapy’s safety and potential effectiveness, but longer, larger Phase 3 studies are needed to confirm potential benefits and risks and to gain approval from drug regulators such as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.   : Estriol is one of several estrogen sex hormones in the body. Some forms of estrogen are available for prescription as methods of birth control and for the treatment of symptoms associated with menopause. Estriol has been used in Europe and Asia as a treatment for symptoms of menopause. The oral form of estriol used in this trial is not available in the United States.   :  Investigators recruited 164 women with relapsing-remitting MS between the ages of 18-50 at 16 sites across the U.S. All participants had recently begun standard glatiramer acetate therapy (injected daily under the skin) and were randomly assigned to also take estriol in pill form, or inactive placebo, for two years. The dosage of estriol used in this trial was four times that customarily used for treating menopausal symptoms.   The primary outcome measure for this trial was the effect of the treatment combination on confirmed relapse rates at the end of the second year. Secondary outcomes included several clinical and MRI (magnetic resonance imaging), measures of disability progression, cognitive function and fatigue. There were also laboratory and gynecological tests built into the study to monitor for potential safety issues that have been associated with the use of estriol and other estrogen hormones, including breast and endometrial (uterine) cancers.   Detailed results of this phase 2 trial were in Lancet Neurology online on November 24, 2015 and were communicated by the study’s authors. The trial was funded by the National MS Society, the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, and additional private donors. Synthetic Biologics, a Maryland pharmaceutical company, provided the estriol for the trial at no charge. Preliminary results were originally presented at the 2014 Annual Meeting of the American Academy of Neurology.   : The combination of glatiramer acetate and estriol appeared safe over the two-year trial period, and there were few severe adverse events experienced by those in either treatment group. Women taking estriol had significantly more irregularities in their menstrual cycles.   At the end of two years, there was a reduction in the annual relapse rate between the estriol group (0.25) and the placebo group (0.37) that achieved only a modest (p=0.077) level of “statistical significance,” a calculation used to determine whether differences relate to chance alone or to the impact of the therapy being tested. This means the study needs to be repeated with a larger number of participants before a definitive conclusion about the effectiveness of estriol can be made. There were no statistically significant differences in secondary outcomes related to the number or size of brain lesions measured by MRI, measures of disability, or quality of life.   There was a benefit suggested for the estriol group in cognitive testing compared to those on placebo after the first year, but this benefit was not seen during the second year of the study. In addition, there was a significant reduction in a measure of fatigue at two years that was not apparent after the first year.   : “While the outcomes of this trial are intriguing, important questions remain regarding the potential benefits and long-term safety of high dose estriol for MS,” said Bruce Bebo, PhD, Executive Vice President, Research at the Society. “These results contribute to our understanding that the pregnancy effects in MS are more complex than previously appreciated. We applaud Dr. Voskuhl’s diligence and persistence in completing this trial. The Society continues to support research in this important area of gender differences and pregnancy in MS, since it may provide clues to improving treatment for women and men with all forms of the disease.”   Copaxone is a registered trademark of Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd.

In MS, the myelin sheath, a fatty tissue that surrounds and protects nerve fibers, is damaged. Inflammation also occurs which further destroys the sheath and eventually the nerves that it encompasses. This leads to areas of multiple scarring or sclerosis which can slow down or even block nerve signaling that is responsible for muscle coordination, strength, sensory information, and visual responses. Multiple sclerosis is chronic, however not contagious, and depending upon the severity of damage which occurs, can be debilitating. Most researchers of MS believe that it is an autoimmune disease in which the body mistakenly identifies its own tissues as foreign. This results in a response by the immune system to send antibodies and white blood cells to target the myelin sheath. It is still unclear as to why this action takes place, but it may be caused by a combination of genetic predisposition and exposure to a virus or bacterium. The virus entering the body may carry with it a protein that mimics the proteins of myelin, therefore causing an inappropriate reaction. This may be triggered by such situations as a viral infection of a cold ,flu, or even changes within the body following pregnancy. More than 300,000 people in the United States and over 1 million people worldwide are diagnosed with MS. The disease generally strikes women twice as often as men, between the ages of 20 to 40. The signs and symptoms of MS can vary widely depending on the individual and the specific nerves that may be affected. Some symptoms include abnormal sensations such as tingling, weakness or numbness in the arms or legs and possibly...

Pathophysiology of (MS) is a chronic inflammatory autoimmune demyelinating disease of the central nervous system, affecting the brain and spinal cord. MS affects approximately 400,000 people in the United States alone. The onset of MS is usually between 20 and 40 years of age and is more common in women; men may have a more severe progressive course (Luzzio, 2013). Life expectancy is shortened in persons with MS, and the survival rate is linked to disability. Death usually results from secondary complications but can also be due to primary complications unrelated to MS. The occurrence rate of MS is affected by gene-environment interactions in susceptible individuals (Huether & McCance, 2012). Definition of Disorder is a progressive, inflammatory, demyelinating disorder of the central nervous system (CNS), which can affect the peripheral nervous system (PNS) as well. This disorder affects movements, sensation, and bodily functions (National Society [NMSS], 2012). There are several types of MS, these include: mixed (general), spinal, and cerebellar. General MS affects both the CNS and PNS, while spinal and cerebellar affect the CNS.

Symptoms may be mild, such as numbness in the limbs, or severe, such as paralysis or loss of vision. The progress, severity, and specific symptoms of MS are unpredictable and vary from one person to another. Today, new treatments and advances in research are giving new hope to people affected by the disease. (MS) affects women more than men. The disorder is most commonly diagnosed between ages 20 and 40, but can be seen at any age. MS is caused by damage to the myelin sheath, the protective covering that surrounds nerve cells. When this nerve covering is damaged, nerve signals slow down or stop. The nerve damage is caused by inflammation. Inflammation occurs when the body’s own immune cells attack the nervous system. This can occur along any area of the brain, optic nerve, and spinal cord. It is unknown what exactly causes this to happen. The most common thought is that a virus or gene defect, or both, is to blame. Environmental factors may play a role. You are slightly more likely to get this condition if you have a family history of MS or live in a part of the world where MS is more common.

It causes damage the myelin sheath, the material that surrounds and protects nerve cells (Marieb, 2012). This damage slows down the process in which the brain relays messages to the rest of the body, leading to a variety of symptoms. Some of the most common include pain and numbness; fatigue; walking, balance, and coordination problems; bladder and bowel dysfunction; vision problems; cognitive dysfunction; emotional changes and depression (National Society, n.d.). Though the exact cause of MS is unknown, it’s widely thought to be an autoimmune disease. Autoimmune diseases arise from an overactive immune response of the body against substances and tissues normally present in the body (Marieb, 2012). In other words, the body actually attacks its own cells. The immune system mistakes some part of the body as a pathogen and attacks it. The disease affects women more than men, often beginning sometime between the ages of 20 to 40. Recently, a study found that the incidence of MS appears to be higher in African American women than in caucasians, contradicting previous findings (Langer-Gould, Brara, Beaber, & Zhang, 2013).

What Is the Prognosis and Life Expectancy for MS in Adults, Teens, and Children? Is It Fatal? When Should You Seek Medical Care for Multiple Sclerosis? Multiple sclerosis is caused by damage to tissues surrounding nerve fibers. () is a condition that results from damage to myelin, the tissues surrounding nerves of the brain and . Damage to the myelin is a result of an autoimmune disease in which the body produces an immune response against its own tissues. is more common in women than in men. Symptoms and signs of are extremely variable and range from mild to severe, and may include: Some people with MS may have no symptoms to mild symptoms; about 30% of those affected will have significant disability after 20-25 years with the condition. The average age of onset for MS is about 34 years of age; but children and teens also get the condition. There is no cure for MS, but disease-modifying drugs can reduce the symptoms, delay disability, and reduce progression of the condition as seen on . The body's immune system attacks nerve sheaths, causing multiple sclerosis.. Multiple sclerosis (MS) can be thought of as an immune-mediated inflammatory process involving different areas of the () at various points in time. As the name suggests, the condition affects many areas of the central or CNS. Normal nerves are surrounded by a myelin sheath to insulate and protect them from damage. This sheath also allows effects how fast nerve signals get from the brain or spinal cord (CNS) to the affected body part. As this sheath is destroyed, the nerve conduction to that body area or part decreases or is interrupted completely. The destruction is caused by the body's immune system attacking the myelin sheath. The reason that the body's immune system attacks the sheath is not understood fully, but it is believed to be related to a combination of a genetic predisposition and acquired or environmental influences. What Are the Signs and Symptoms of Multiple Sclerosis? The signs and symptoms of MS in adults, children, and teens are similar; however, children and teens with the disease (pediatric MS) also may have and complete that adults with MS do not experience. Moreover, symptoms in people with multiple sclerosis differ from person to person. Visual, sensory, and motor signs and symptoms are all part of MS; however, there is a wide range of symptoms that can appear. Some people have mild cases of MS with little or no disability over the years. Others have more severe types of MS, requiring confinement to a wheelchair or bed. Over 30% of those affected with MS will have a significant disability after 20 to 25 years. Still, others may live their entire lives symptom-free (some individuals without multiple sclerosis symptoms are found incidentally to have multiple sclerosis lesions by MRI or individuals in whom an examination of their brain after death unexpectedly reveals that they were affected by the disease). This variability makes it difficult in some cases to diagnose multiple sclerosis. Often the signs and symptoms are mistaken as being psychiatric in origin. 5 Early Warning Signs and Symptoms of Multiple Sclerosis The of multiple sclerosis are often . Large number of people with multiple sclerosis develop optic neuritis (inflammation of the , which is an extension of the central nervous system), described as a painful vision loss. If a patient is diagnosed with optic neuritis early, treatment could change the course of the disease. Before the actual loss of vision, the patient may have visual changes described by many people as blurred or hazy vision, flashing lights, or alterations in color. The tissues around the eye and moving the eye may be painful. Most people recover over several months. Others are left with permanent visual defects. Double vision occurs when the eyes move in different directions and is another common symptom of multiple sclerosis. Multiple Sclerosis Pictures, Symptoms and Treatment What Are the Common Signs and Symptoms of Multiple Sclerosis? Multiple sclerosis commonly affects the cerebellum, the portion of the brain responsible for balance and fine motor coordination. Consequently, people with multiple sclerosis often have difficulty maintaining their balance when walking and performing delicate tasks with their hands. The unexplained dropping of a cup or other objects, or unusual weakness can occur. Electrical-type pain sensations in the chest, abdomen, arms, or legs There appears to be a relationship between multiple sclerosis, higher temperatures, and the worsening of symptoms. occur in about 5% of people with multiple sclerosis. Those with MS may complain of disturbances, , or may feel that they are experiencing changes in attention span or memory. Many symptoms of multiple sclerosis lead to other complications, such as infections of the bladder (urinary infections), kidney, or blood. Any area of the body can be involved, making this disease difficult to distinguish from other nervous system disorders. What Are the Signs and Symptoms of Multiple Sclerosis in Children and Teens (Pediatric MS)? The signs and symptoms of multiple sclerosis in children and teens are similar to those experienced by adults; however, they also may have seizures and extreme or lethargy. Children with MS are considered to have the form of MS known as relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis. The central nervous system is made up of the brain and spinal cord. They process information from our environment and control voluntary muscle movements to allow the body to do certain things. When you touch something hot, for example, signals are sent from sensory nerve endings in your hand up long nerves in your arm, eventually reaching the spinal cord. From there, the signal is transferred up your spinal cord to your brain, where the information is processed. Your brain then sends a signal back down the spinal cord to the nerves in your arm. These nerves cause the muscles in your arm to contract, pulling your hand away from the heat. This system works efficiently, unless there is a disease process affecting the nerve pathways in the spinal cord and brain. MS is one of the diseases that can affect these pathways. The nerves in the body are covered by a fatty substance called myelin (myelin sheath). The myelin sheath insulates the nerves and allows them to transmit information to and from the brain in a fraction of a second. If the myelin is disrupted in any way, the transmitted information is not only delayed, but it may also be misinterpreted by the brain. This autoimmune destruction of the myelin sheath leads to areas of (also known as plaques) in the brain and spinal cord. These plaques disrupt the transmission of information by nerves in the CNS and lead to the symptoms seen in MS. At What Age Can Multiple Sclerosis Start? Who Has MS? MS is more common in individuals of northern European descent. Women are more than twice as likely to develop multiple sclerosis as men. Multiple sclerosis usually affects people between the ages of 20 and 50 years, and the average age of onset is approximately 34 years. Multiple sclerosis can affect children and teens (pediatric MS). It has been estimated that 2%-5% of people with MS develop symptoms prior to age 18. What Is Multiple Sclerosis? MS Symptoms, Causes, Diagnosis Diagnosing multiple sclerosis is difficult. The vague and nonspecific nature of this disease mimics many other diseases. Doctors combine history, physical exam, laboratory work, and sophisticated medical imaging techniques to arrive at a diagnosis. More often than not, a specialist is required to make a diagnosis. Examples of tests and procedures used to diagnose MS include: A (), blood chemistry, , and often spinal fluid evaluation ( or “”) are all routine laboratory tests used to rule out other conditions and help confirm the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis. An MRI, which creates an image of the brain or the spinal cord, is used to search for changes within the brain or spinal cord that are unique to multiple sclerosis. What Medications Are Used for the Treatment of Multiple Sclerosis? There are several treatment options for multiple sclerosis. Listed examples below are US FDA-approved drugs to treat multiple sclerosis. These are known as disease-modifying therapies for MS. Disease-modifying therapies have been found through clinical trials to reduce the number of relapses, delay the progression of disability, and limit new disease activity that is observed on MRI. Examples of drugs used to treat MS include: Beta interferons, for example: (Mavenclad) oral tablets is a drug used to treat two forms of multiple sclerosis; relapsing forms that include relapsing-remitting disease and active secondary progressive disease in adults. Generally, cladribine is used in people with MS who have tried other that were not tolerated well or ineffective. People with clinically isolated syndrome not take cladribine. () is a agent that has been approved by the FDA to treat multiple sclerosis. Treatment with mitoxantrone requires monitoring of cardiac function, and there is a fixed limit to the dose that can be administered to patients. It also carries the long-term risk of . For these reasons, Novantrone is typically reserved for patients with more aggressive forms of multiple sclerosis. New research and treatment methods are currently being investigated and are expected to offer some hope to people with multiple sclerosis. In particular, new research studies have shown that skin patches containing myelin peptides may be a promising therapy. Consult your healthcare team for options. What Drug Therapies Are Used for the Treatment and Symptoms of Multiple Sclerosis? In addition to drugs that target the disease process, other medications used to relieve certain symptoms of MS. Muscle relaxants, for example, () Selective reuptake inhibitor () The oral phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors, for example, (), (, Adcirca), and ) (, Staxyn ODT) What Is the Prognosis and Life Expectancy for MS in Adults, Teens, and Children? Is It Fatal? Most people with the form of MS progress to a stage where relapses become much less frequent, but they continue to accumulate disabling symptoms. This new phase of the disease is termed secondary progressive multiple sclerosis. Symptoms of this type of MS are intermittent and worsen neurologic symptoms, which can last several days or weeks before returning to their original state of health. Some people, however, are left with residual deficits (residual disability) after some attacks. A few people have a form of MS. In this type, people have relapses superimposed on a pattern of continuous progression of disability. Rarely, people with multiple sclerosis have a pure progressive () forms of the disease. Their disability progresses in the absence of attacks over time. Most people with MS usually die from diseases such as or heart attacks, especially in those who are bedridden. Currently, there is no cure for multiple sclerosis. As of yet, no true way of preventing multiple sclerosis has been found. When Should You Seek Medical Care for Multiple Sclerosis? The symptoms of multiple sclerosis are very variable and differ from patient to patient. They can also be confused with symptoms of many other conditions. You should talk with your physician if you or someone you know has any of the signs and symptoms associated with multiple sclerosis or if you have any concerning symptoms. Several of the symptoms of multiple sclerosis may be severe enough to send the patient to a hospital's emergency department. Go to the nearest Emergency Department if you have any of the following symptoms: Visual changes and painful eye movements. Optic neuritis, one of the most common early signs of multiple sclerosis, causes these symptoms. If you experience personality changes or sudden loss of strength in the arms and legs. These symptoms are common with multiple sclerosis, but they can also be signs of other serious diseases that require urgent treatment such as , infection, or chemical imbalances. Managing Symptoms of MS with Diet, Exercise, and Alternative Treatments Some people with MS explore alternative forms of therapy and treatments, including many who are already taking drugs for the disease. Some people with multiple sclerosis have benefited from: Restorative, maintenance, and preventive rehabilitation Talk to your healthcare team about alternative treatments for MS.

What Your Symptoms Mean Multiple Sclerosis or Mimic? What Your Symptoms Mean Diagnosing multiple sclerosis (MS) correctly can be a complicated process. MS varies from person to person and there is no ‘standard’ set of symptoms. Seeking a prompt evaluation for MS symptoms is vital, not only for diagnosing and treating the disease, but also for ruling out other conditions with symptoms that mimic those of MS. Some of the common symptoms of MS can include: Urinary symptoms, such as hesitancy when trying to urinate, or a feeling of urgency Lhermitte's phenomenon, a symptom in which people feel electrical tingling or shocks down their back, arms, or legs when they bend their neck forwards Neurologists at Cleveland Clinic Florida’s Egil and Pauline Braathen Center utilize modern tools and expertise to effectively diagnose MS early on, slow the disease’s debilitating advance and, in some cases, delay the long-term progression to severe disability. And the multidisciplinary team of specialists at the center provides the comprehensive care that allows patients with MS to spend more time living their normal lives and less time in a doctor’s office. Karen Nater Pineiro, MD is a Neurologist in the Pauline M. Braathen Neurological Center at Cleveland Clinic Florida. She received her medical degree from the San Juan Bautista School of Medicine in Puerto Rico. Dr. Nater Pineiro went on to complete her residency as well as a fellowship in Multiple Sclerosis at the University of Maryland in Baltimore. Her specialty interests include Multiple Sclerois, Neuromyelitis Optica, Devic's Disease, Optic Neuritis, Transverse Myelitis, Acute Disseminated Encephalomyelitis, Sarcoid and Inflammatory/Autoimmune Encephalopathies Spasticity management. Let’s Chat About Multiple Sclerosis or Mimic? What Your Symptoms Mean Welcome to our Online Health Chat “Multiple Sclerosis or Mimic? What Your Symptoms Mean"" with Karen Nater Pineiro, MD. We are thrilled to have her here today for this chat. Let’s begin with the questions. My mother passed away from what I was told was an MI brought on from severe MS. I now have Sarcoidosis and am wondering if it is possible she actually had neurosarcoidosis. She never saw any ""specialist"" just our primary, who back then did just about everything. I have numbness (was told is SFN), I also have random dizziness and trouble walking. When just standing still, I sway and have to hang on to something. Walking ,I'm always bumping into things as I'm unbalanced. All this has me thinking of my mother. When I had a MRI as few years ago there was no lesions so no diagnosis. Is it possible to be either MS or neurosarcoidosis with no lesions? Sarcoidosis triggers a strong immune response in some patients. It's most often a systemic disease and not a neurologic one. Very rarely, it can cause Peripheral nervous system or, even less often, the Central Nervous System. It's not hereditary and/or genetic. It will be very unlikely to have MS with no lesions but we need to evaluate clinical and radiographic findings. Can migraines be caused by NMO and mimic diseases? Migraines are unfortunately very common in the general population and not ""caused"" by NMO. We however don't know exactly what cause migraines and many patients with other neurologic conditions suffer from migraines. Therefore, a possible correlation may exist but not specific for NMO. Treatment for migraines is symptomatic regardless of the cause. Are there different symptoms for different types of MS? And how do the symptoms vary? MS is a heterogeneous disease. It can present with many different symptoms and those can evolve over time. Sometimes it's related to specific anatomic region in which demyelination occurred. For example, demyelination of the ON leading to painful visual loss. However this is not always the case and ""MS lesions/demyelinating plaques"" don't necessary correlated with patients’ symptoms. Relapsing Remitting MS is the most common type. Symptoms ""come and go"" but can leave residual deficits. However there are other types, including Progressive, in which patients accumulate symptoms/disability gradually over time. We focus on symptom management along with prevention of relapses and disability. What other conditions (that don't show on MRIs) could mimic MS with the specific symptom of numbness (not the full, no feeling at all type, but rather diminished sensation) gradually spreading to most parts of the body in random order (i.e. leg, back, arm, genitals, face, throat, etc.) and remaining there? Do nonspecific foci in the white matter ever turn into more MS-looking spots? and/or cause any MS-like symptoms? MS mimickers include infectious, inflammatory and other autoimmune processes. I recommend that you discuss with a neurologist your symptoms along with any workup. Again, a constellation of multiple symptoms don't means that a patient suffers from MS. MRI is a diagnostic tool but it's not meant to be used as ""a test for MS"". MS is diagnosed based on clinical, radiographic and other supporting criteria. Abnormal MRIs need to be interpreted on clinical context. Abnormal spots can be seen in migraines, microvascular disease among others. We also don't know when those ""Spots"" occurred and patient may have born with those. Therefore, we follow MRI on time if indicated. I was diagnosed with Sarcoidosis in 2010 based on symptoms and chest Xray. A 2015 muscle biopsy showed denervation, and granulomas suggestive of Sarc. I've had progressive symptoms suggestive of secondary Autonomic Dysfunction for years. I've been on 10mg of Prednisone 4x/week, 15mg of Meloxicam and other OTC anti-inflammatories for some time now. A recent PET scan did not show inflammation and my lungs are clear. My Drs. are now looking at other causes for my ongoing leg pain/weakness and muscle spasms. In the past six weeks or so, my activities are greatly curtailed to the point of being housebound and giving up my therapies since activity triggers AD-type episodes...muscle spasms, headaches, dizziness, nausea, sweating, shaking, severe SOB, presyncope, etc. Given the current lack of inflammation, could this still be a complication of Sarcoidosis, or more likely something else, like MS? Are there any definitive tests to distinguish between the two? How would the treatment be different? I strongly encourage you to follow up with a neurologist. Sarcoidosis can rarely cause neurologic complications. Those can affect the peripheral nervous system (nerves, muscles) and, even less frequent, the Central Nervous System. You may need electrodiagnostic studies or other workup. However, I can't adequately assess specifics and strongly encourage you to make an appointment with a neurologist and bring your medical records for their review. How likely is it that an individual can have both multiple sclerosis and sarcoidosis simultaneously? Both of those diseases are very rare. Therefore, we don't have specific statistics. Treatment is different for those. You should discuss your findings with an MS expert to be confident you have the right diagnosis and treatment. Is there anything behind the internet rumors that MS is actually advanced Lyme disease, and upon autopsy Lyme spirochetes are actually found in MS patients? Are there specific tests would you recommend to rule in/out MS vs Lyme? MS is an autoimmune disease that seems to be multifactorial. Over the years, multiple viruses and bacteria have been considered including, EBV, VZV and more recently Lyme. We don't believe it's an infectious process in itself and therefore is not caused by Lyme. There seems to be a lot of non-scientific literature about Lyme disease over the internet. Please remember that our bodies carry multiple viruses and bacteria that are not necessary implicated in diseases. Is MS one of the many autoimmune disorders? Are there hereditary links? Thanks, pdc. MS is not congenital/hereditary. There is however about a 3% chance of having a first line relative with other autoimmune disease. However, we believe MS has a multifactorial etiology- meaning it needs multiple ""hits"" for you to actually develop the disease. Hi, I am a 59-year-old female diagnosed with MS based solely on symptoms and brain MRI. Lumbar puncture, VEP and BAEP were normal. MRI showed the radiologist noted on the report that lesions are radiating laterally from corpus callosum in a pattern consistent with Dawson's fingers. The neurologist that I sought out for a second opinion wrote on his report that the lesions did NOT clearly appear in pattern of Dawson's fingers. He felt that I probably do not have MS. He relocated before my follow-up so no other opinions as to a different diagnosis were given. I have constant numbness and tingling in arms, hands, legs and feet. I also have concerning confusion and memory issues. I was given an ambulatory 48 hour E.E.G test and that was abnormal. I am understandably seeking an accurate diagnosis. Is there any place where I could mail my brain MRI for evaluation? Any other suggestions? Thank you. As stated before, MRI findings need to be interpreted within clinical context. Radiologists are trained to ""read an MRI"" and they sometimes suggest probabilities but remember they don't have the clinical history. Neurologists interpret MRIs based on the clinical information. It seems you need to get a second opinion. We'll be more than happy to review your records and MRI. We can review the MRI but again, this will be in the context of a complete neurologic evaluation during an office visit as indicated. Over ten years ago, an MRI resulted in a lesion ""consistent with MS"" but the neurologist did not give me an MS diagnosis and felt he could do nothing more for me. To this day, I continue to have periodic episodes (as I call them) whereby I have tingling in my legs and feet, left side of my face and the fingers of one hand. This is accompanied by a specific headache and extreme fatigue. However, it takes several weeks to get an appointment and of course, I'm usually not in the middle of an episode when the appointment day comes along. So the doctor never sees me at my worst. Any thoughts on how to proceed? Thank you. MS can be difficult to diagnoses and MRI is not a ""test for diagnosis"". Sometimes, we need to follow the patient over time for clinical and radiographic evolution. You should schedule regular follow up appointments. Headaches sometimes can be very severe, and not necessary means that you suffer from MS. What are “evoked potentials” and what are they used for? ""Evoked potentials"" is a test to measure the electrical conduction of specific regions/areas. For example Visual Evoked potentials are used to ""measure"" the velocity at which the ON transmit the ""evoked/provided"" input. Abnormalities in those can suggest demyelination among many other things. Keep in mind that evoked potentials are also used to diagnose other diseases/processes as those only document abnormal transmission. Can an MS diagnosis ever be made with normal brain and spine MRIs? Do you ever find that MRIs show normal for many years, and then many years later as symptoms progress, abnormalities consistent with MS show? Many years ago MS was a clinical diagnosis. However with the advent of MRI techniques, we now included MRI lesions in the diagnosis criteria. Rationale being that it will be very unlikely to have a normal physical examination and MRI. Remember that MS is a diagnosis of exclusion. A constellation of multiple symptoms can represent MS just after other diagnosis are ruled out and fulfill clinical and radiographic criteria. When we suspect MS and MRI is normal, we can consider CSF, visual field/OTC/VEP among others. Most often, we follow clinically and radiographically over time (repeat MRIs). Does MS pose any health risks to becoming pregnant? No. Most MS patients are women, and usually diagnosed during reproductive ages. Most of them have uncomplicated pregnancies. The hormonal changes associated with pregnancy seems to be somewhat protective, and usually patients don't have MS relapses during pregnancy. Patients however can have attacks/relapses during pregnancy especially if they had an aggressive course beforehand. Patients can also experience relapses soon afterwards. Why would a patient have success for many years with rituximab in the treatment of NMO and then have it not be effective and additionally cause too much reduction of immune system? NMO is not a homogenous disease, that's why it's labeled NMO- SD (spectrum disorders). It unfortunately can have a very aggressive course and can be refractory to treatment. Rituximab has the best data on most cases. However we know that some patients can have relapses even on Rituximab. You should continue close follow up care with an expert on Neuro-inflammatory disorders (MS/NMO,etc) such as we have at the Mellen Center for MS at Cleveland Clinic. What does Cleveland Clinic provide for MS patients? We offer a comprehensive approach to MS. This implies that we address all issues related to the disease- from diagnosis to treatment management. Patients with MS can have a constellation of symptoms that include urinary urgency, spasticity, and cognitive decline among others. We have a team of providers that specialized in the care of those conditions. Further, most MS patients benefit from rehabilitation services including PT/TO- trained specifically of neurologic disturbances- we offer those within our Center. I was finally diagnosed with MS in 2007. My neurologist found a lesion in my spinal cord and advised me to have MRI's every three months for two years. Needless to say, a thoracic MRI had not been performed and the periodic weakness that I had been experiencing for YEARS was not addressed properly and now I have great difficulty walking. What type(s) of exercise do you recommend? I have access to a family pool. Any input on this. I am still able to walk with a walker. The fatigue is not helpful. Thank you! Sometimes patient with MS can have residual deficits including weakness, paresthesias, electric sensation in the spine (Lhermite sign). I encourage you to establish a good exercise and stretch routine avoid overheat and prevent spasm. Follow up with the neurologist that diagnosed you as he may be able to evaluate if you have any spasticity that may benefit from medication. Lastly, pool exercises are very good as they avoid heat intolerance. To make an appointment with Karen Nater Pineiro, MD, Neurologist or any of the other specialists in the Pauline M.

Multiple sclerosis (MS) literally means “many scars,” which refers to the lesions that accumulate in the brain and spinal cord throughout the course of the disease. These scars, or lesions, consist mostly of dead nerve cells, whose axons have been denuded of the myelin sheaths that normally protect them and permit the conduction of nerve impulses. MS is a chronic, degenerative disease that usually begins in young adulthood and most visibly destroys muscular control, although many other brain functions are affected. Most people will live with MS for decades after their diagnosis. MS reduces life expectancy after onset (as measured by current diagnostic criteria) by only about 10-15 years, and about half of the patients survive 30 years or more from onset. THE CLINICAL PICTURE: SYMPTOMS, DISEASE COURSE, VARIATION, AND DIAGNOSIS MS, as defined by ongoing central nervous system (CNS) lesion formation and increasing cumulative damage, is now recognized as a disease that is active in most patients most of the time. Disease activity has reversible and irreversible sequelae; irreversible sequelae ultimately lead to progressive impairment and disability in most patients. MS takes a variety of forms, distinguished by the clinical pattern of disease activity (, ). Accumulated deficit can produce sustained worsening in both relapsing and progressive MS.

Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. Varieties of MS Autopsy studies indicate there are individuals without any known clinical history who have neuropathologic changes typical of MS. It is difficult to get an accurate estimate of subclinical disease, but one recent review suggested asymptomatic MS might account for up to 25% of all cases. This is the major MS subtype. Approximately 85% of patients with a diagnosis of MS start out with relapsing MS. Overall, this subtype accounts for 55% of MS. Relapsing MS patients show a high rate of inflammatory lesion activity (gadolinium-enhancing lesions). This category represents a subset of relapsing patients who have few attacks and make an excellent recovery. They show minimal impairment and disability, even after 20-30 years. The proportion of MS patients with benign disease is controversial. Reasonable studies suggest 10-20% of people with MS fit into this category. This subtype accounts for 10% of MS. Patients show gradual worsening from onset, without disease attacks. These patients tend to be older and often present with a spinal cord dysfunction without obvious brain involvement. This subtype is the least likely to show inflammatory lesion activity on MRI (gadolinium-enhancing). Unlike the other subtypes of MS, men are as likely as women to develop primary progressive MS. This subtype accounts for 5% of MS. Patients show slow worsening from onset, with superimposed attacks. Recent studies suggest these patients are similar to primary progressive patients. This is the major progressive subtype and accounts for approximately 30% of MS. Relapsing MS patients usually transition to secondary progressive disease. They show gradual worsening, with or without superimposed relapses. Natural history studies of untreated relapsing MS indicate 50% of patients will be secondary progressive at 10 years and almost 90% by 25 years. This form of MS shows a lower rate of inflammatory lesion activity than relapsing MS, yet the total burden of disease continues to increase. This most likely reflects ongoing axonal loss. Also referred to as Marburg variant MS, this is the most severe form of MS. Significant disability develops much more rapidly than usual, over weeks to months. Pathologic changes are widespread and destructive. These cases are rare and generally occur in young people. This refers to patients who present with an isolated CNS syndrome (optic neuritis, incomplete transverse myelitis, brainstem or cerebellar lesion), which is often the first MS attack. Clinical, MRI, and CSF studies indicate that such patients with normal brain MRI and CSF have a low risk of developing MS. In contrast, those with abnormal MRI have a high risk of developing MS. NOTE: CSF = cerebrosinal fluid; MRI = magnetic resonance imaging ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001. Multiple Sclerosis: Current Status and Strategies for the Future.

SOURCE: Adapted from Lublin and Reingold, 1996. lapsing MS, worsening occurs in most patients during acute attacks with incomplete recovery. In progressive MS, the dominant pattern is a gradual accumulation of neurologic deficits, with slow clinical worsening. Disease activity and progression have both clinical and subclinical components. Clinical disease activity and progression are judged by observation and neurologic examination. Subclinical components refer to pathological changes that are not observable in a clinical examination but are observed using a variety of laboratory tests, predominantly neuroimaging parameters. Relapses are variously referred to as acute attacks, exacerbations, or disease flare-ups. They involve the acute, or sudden onset, of focal neurologi- ""2 Clinical and Biological Features.""

Examples of typical MS relapses include blurring of vision in one eye (optic neuritis), persistent numbness or tingling of a body part (sensory system relapse), weakness of a body part (motor system relapse), or loss of coordination (cerebellar system relapse). Early in the MS disease process, relapses are likely to involve sensory, motor, cerebellar, or visual system abnormalities ( , ). Later in the disease process, relapses are likely to involve bladder, bowel, cognitive, and sexual function abnormalities. Acute disease attacks are a characteristic feature of the relapsing-remitting MS subtype. Relapses also occur in patients with progressive relapsing disease and in a number of patients with secondary progressive disease. The only clinical disease subtype in which relapses never occur is primary progressive MS. Areas of the CNS often affected by MS. Reprinted with permission from University of Delaware. Sensory problems (numbness or tingling of a body part) ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001. Multiple Sclerosis: Current Status and Strategies for the Future. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. Relapses generally consist of three phases. There is a period of worsening, with onset of new deficits or increasing severity of old deficits. This is followed by a period of stability, with no change in deficits. The final phase is the period of recovery, with variable degrees of improvement in deficits. Most patients recover within six weeks, although for some, improvements can continue over months. Recovery can be complete return to baseline status, partial return, or no improvement. However, some degree of improvement is typical, particularly early in the disease. Relapsing patients then remain clinically stable until the next disease attack. To be considered a relapse, deficits must persist for a minimum of 24 hours. This avoids confusion with deficits lasting only minutes to hours, which are believed to be a consequence of impaired nerve conduction through old lesion areas rather than the formation of a new lesion. Alternatively, new abnormalities that last seconds to minutes, such as Lhermitte's sign (a tingling sensation radiating down the arms, neck, or back on neck flexion), or paroxysmal attacks (stereotypic neurologic deficits occurring multiple times a day that last less than a minute) are also considered relapses if they occur repeatedly over several weeks. Sequential relapses are considered distinct only when they occur at least 30 days apart with a month of clinical stability in between. Although clinical relapses always produce changes in a patient's condition, they are not always associated with changes on neurologic examination. Maximal deficit in an MS relapse typically develops over several days but in some cases can develop much faster, over hours or even minutes, or much more slowly, over a period as long as several weeks. Physiologic factors such as temperature, pH, or electrolyte balance can temporarily disrupt nerve conduction and produce neurologic abnormality. A relapse must be distinguished from a which is a neurologic deterioration associated with a physiologic change such as infection or fever. This condition can last for days, mimicking a true relapse. Pseudoexacerbation deficits disappear once the precipitating factor has been corrected. They reflect a temporary disruption in nerve conduction, rather than the formation of a new lesion. Approximately 85 percent of MS patients begin with relapsing-remitting disease. MS relapses can involve a single neural system, as in optic neuritis, or several anatomically distinct systems at the same time, for example, combined motor and sensory problems. Attacks involving single neural systems are somewhat more common in the first MS relapse. Most patients experience their second attack within two to three years of the first, but 5 percent of patients remain free of relapses for 15 years or more. In most cases, there is substantial recovery from the first relapse; only 4 percent of patients show no improvement. The average relapse rate is one to two attacks a year, but this rate normally declines over time. The longer a person has MS, the less likely it is that relapses will be followed by complete recovery and the more likely it is that relapses will be associated with residual deficits and increasing disability.

Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. Relapse features have prognostic significance (). In the first few years after disease onset, the number and type of relapses, as well as the degree of recovery, help predict future disease course. Relapses that involve visual, sensory, or brainstem systems have a better prognosis than those that involve cerebellar, motor, or sphincter systems. In the first two years of disease, a low relapse rate with excellent recovery indicates a better prognosis than a high relapse rate with poor recovery. Relapses restricted to single neural systems are prognostically better than those involving multiple systems. The relapse rate also has prognostic significance in the later stages of MS. With a disease duration of five or more years, an increasing relapse rate, polyregional relapses that involved multiple systems, and incomplete recovery from relapses indicate a worse prognosis. The relapsing form of MS is characterized by acute disease exacerbations. In contrast, progressive MS is characterized by slow deterioration and increasing neurological deficits. There are three forms of progressive MS. Approximately 15 percent of MS patients show slow deterioration from onset. In the second form, 10 percent have either primary progressive MS and never experience acute disease attacks or progressive relapsing MS (5 percent), and have occasional subsequent attacks. The third form, secondary progressive MS, is the major progressive subtype. These are relapsing patients who begin to slowly worsen 5 to 15 years after the first relapse. Once relapsing patients enter a progressive phase, they either stop having relapses or continue to experience exacerbations superimposed on slow worsening. Documentation of a progressive course requires at least six months of observation. Observation over a year or two is often necessary to be confident of progression, since deficits can accumulate at a very gradual rate. The major defining feature of progressive MS is slow deterioration that occurs independently of acute disease relapses and does not reflect residual deficits from acute disease attacks. An analysis of the disease course among 1,844 patients indicated that the presence or absence of relapses during the progressive phase does not significantly affect the progression of irreversible disability (4 percent of ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001. Multiple Sclerosis: Current Status and Strategies for the Future. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. patients in this study had been treated for up to one year with beta-interferon, but this did not affect the study results). Progressive MS patients can be clinically stable for up to several years at a time and can even show slight improvement for a period of time. Ultimately, however, all progressive MS patients develop disability with limited ability to walk. Progressive MS is a more severe form than benign or relapsing-remitting MS and has a worse prognosis. Clinical parameters such as relapses and progression underestimate the actual damage to tissue that occurs in MS. When macroscopically normal-appearing brain tissue is looked at under the microscope, one can detect inflammation, gliosis (scarring), and myelin damage. Chemical studies of normal-appearing brain tissue often reveal changes in organelles such as lysosomes, in enzymes, and in myelin constituents. In addition, a number of the new research neuro-imaging techniques can detect changes in brain and spinal cord areas that appear free of lesions on conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Some of these abnormalities are detectable several months to years before they can be seen with conventional MRI. Changes in normal-appearing brain tissue are generally pronounced in MS patients with severe impairment. As a group, secondary progressive MS patients show more abnormalities in normal white matter and brain tissue than relapsing patients. (White matter corresponds to brain regions where axons are ensheathed in myelin; gray matter corresponds to brain regions that are rich in cell bodies.) Primary progressive patients often show subtle but diffuse changes in normal-appearing brain areas. Even conventional MRI indicates that most new lesion formation is clinically silent, meaning that clinical exam does not reveal any corresponding symptoms. Approximately 80 to 90 percent of new brain lesions do not produce identifiable relapses. They might, however, be associated with subtle cognitive changes or other neuropsychological changes that are not detected in clinical examination. The total lesion burden increases in MS patients, on average, 5 to 10 percent per year, reflecting in large part the development of clinically silent lesions. (This does not apply to patients on the disease-modifying therapies discussed later in this section.) Atrophy of both brain and spinal cord can be detected even in patients with minimal symptoms. Atrophy can progress without obvious lesion formation, most likely reflecting loss of axons. MS patients show an accelerated rate of age-related brain and spinal cord atrophy that is three- to tenfold higher than the rate in control populations. Spinal cord lesions are generally similar to those in the brain except for the absence of “black holes” (see discussion in of T1-weighted lesions). Spinal MS lesions rarely cover more than half of the cross-sectional area of the cord or exceed two vertebral segments in length. They are found more often in the cervical spinal cord (neck region) than thoracic region (midback) and are most ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001.

MRI involves application of a magnetic field to the body that causes nuclei with odd numbers of protons, such as hydrogen nuclei, to behave like tiny magnets. These protons align themselves either parallel or antiparallel to the applied external magnetic field. The net magnetization induces an electric current that forms the basic MR signal. An MR image is formed by determining the spatial distribution of the signal and reconstructing the data into detailed images. The signals are picked up by a very sensitive antenna and forwarded to a computer for processing. Two time constants, T1 and T2 relaxation times, are important in determining the appearance of MR images. T1, or the longitudinal relaxation time, is the time constant when 63 percent of the original longitudinal magnetization is regained as the nuclei return to alignment with the external magnetic field. T2 or the transverse relaxation time, is the time constant when the transverse magnetization decreases to 37 percent of its original value as the nuclei lose alignment with each other following the initial application of an external magnetic field (a radio-frequency pulse). By altering the imaging parameters and pulse sequences used, differences between tissues with intrinsically different proton densities and T1 and T2 relaxation times can be highlighted or obscured. Image contrast can be either T1 weighted or T2 weighted in order to emphasize the differences between normal and pathological tissues. For example, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is dark on T1-weighted images and bright on T2-weighted images. White matter is bright on T1-weighted images, whereas a matter is dark but not as dark as CSF. common in the midcervical region. Disease activity is much less frequent in the spine than in the brain. In summary, the clinical manifestations of MS possibly represent only the “tip of the iceberg,” with most of the CNS damage occurring much earlier and being detectable only when the accumulated damage overwhelms the ability of the CNS to compensate. The mechanisms through which CNS tissue is damaged or destroyed are discussed in greater detail later in the chapter. At the present time, neuroimaging provides the best assessment of disease activity in MS (, ). A number of neuroimaging techniques can measure distinct pathologic changes and thereby provide markers for different aspects of the MS disease ""2 Clinical and Biological Features.""

Magnetic resonance imaging is a technique that creates cross-sectional images of the brain using a magnetic field and radio waves (). It is a versatile, powerful, and sensitive tool for measuring abnormalities in the brain. This is especially valuable with MS, because so much of the pathological activity of the disease is neurologically asymptomatic. Indeed, until neuroimaging results proved otherwise, the disease appeared to be quiescent during remissions. Neuroimaging has revealed a previously unsuspected level of activity and pathology throughout the course of disease. Contrast agents are used in MRI in cases where contrast between two tissues is poor. The contrasting agent, gadolinium, is normally excluded from the brain by the blood-brain barrier.

Gadolinium-enhancing activity on MRI correlates with clinical relapses and predicts increased risk or further disease activity. However, since most new brain MRI lesions are clinically silent, gadolinium-enhanced lesions are seen more often than clinical relapses. In T2-weighted images, MS lesions appear as very bright white areas against a gray or more neutral background and are the most readily visualized MS lesions by MRI. They reflect lesions with different pathology and of various ages, and reversible as well as irreversible abnormalities. T2-weighted hyperintense lesions can be used to measure the total lesion volume (burden-of-disease). The variable pathology, which is not distinguished in T2 burden-of-disease measures, is probably a determinant of associated disability. Only a modest relationship has been observed between T2 burden of disease and clinical disability in relapsing and secondary progressive MS. However, in patients with clinically isolated syndromes who are in the early stages of MS, T2 burden-of-disease has been correlated with the development of MS, as well as the clinical subtype of MS and disability 10 years later. The magnitude of T2 burden-of-disease changes very early in the disease process and may be valuable for predicting subsequent course. Atrophy of both brain and spinal cord can be detected in MS patients, including relapsing patients with minimal neurologic deficits. Both axon and myelin loss contribute to tissue atrophy. Recent studies suggest that CNS atrophy may be the best neuroimaging correlate for clinical disability (reviewed in 1999 by Trapp et al.). A number of different methodologies are used to measure atrophy. Current advances involve measurement of the whole brain and improved automation, but the optimal technique has not been decided. Axonal injury can be measured on proton MR spectroscopy by estimating -acetyl aspartate (NAA) levels in brain tissue. NAA is a molecule that is virtually confined to axons and neurons. Levels of NAA can fluctuate, suggesting that they can be used to measure reversible as well as irreversible damage. Persistent reduction of NAA on MR Spectroscopy correlates with axon loss, damage, or dysfunction. Reduced NAA is found not only within MS lesions but also in the normal-appearing white matter of relapsing-remitting, secondary progressive, and primary progressive MS patients. The reduction in NAA is more severe in secondary progressive MS than in relapsing MS. In addition, NAA decrease in cerebellar white matter has been correlated with clinical ataxia. NAA can be measured in a discrete region of interest within the brain. Recently, whole-brain NAA has been measured in MS. This appears to be a more meaningful neuroimaging marker to evaluate axon damage. MR spectroscopy can also be used to measure lipid changes within both lesions and normal- ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001. Multiple Sclerosis: Current Status and Strategies for the Future. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. appearing brain tissue, but these studies are very preliminary and NAA measurements are the major focus of current MR spectroscopy studies in MS. Also referred to as black holes, T1-weighted hypointense lesions have lower signal intensity than the surrounding white matter. T1 hypointense lesions are most common in the supratentorial region (cerebral hemispheres). They are much less common in the infratentorial (brainstem and cerebellum) region and are not reported in the spinal cord. Compared to T2-weighted lesions, they represent more severe tissue pathology, with axon loss, demyelination, and extracellular edema. In postmortem studies of progressive MS, T1-weighted hypointense lesions correlate strongly with axon density measurements. T1-weighted hypointense lesions show a stronger correlation with disability than T2-weighted hyperintense lesions. Magnetization transfer imaging (MTI) can be used to study global brain function or to measure changes within a local region of interest. Populations of bound and soluble protons produce different signals in response to the external magnetic field. The magnetization transfer ratio (MTR) is the ratio of the different signals produced by these two populations. It is reduced in MS and is believed to reflect both demyelination and axon loss, thereby producing an index of tissue destruction. MTR measurements are correlated with MS disability, as measured by the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS; see ), as well as cognitive measures. MTI shows great promise as a disease marker. Lower MTR values occur with disease worsening in relapsing, secondary progressive, and primary progressive MS patients and even in patients with clinically isolated MS syndromes. In primary progressive patients who have a relatively small T2 burden of disease, MTR is significantly reduced, suggesting that axon damage is significantly greater in this clinical subtype. Differences in MTRs are associated with different lesion pathology. Lesions that are more destructive (as indicated by T1 hypointensity) have reduced MTR values. Lesions that remain hypointense show a persistent reduction in MTR, whereas lesions that become isointense recover in MTR. New lesions in secondary progressive patients have a lower MTR than those in relapsing patients. The decline in MTR over three years is significantly greater in secondary progressive MS than in relapsing MS, supporting a relationship between MTR changes and disease progression. MTR measures allow more significant lesions to be detected and may provide a better potential correlate with clinical disability. Reduction in MTR can precede the development of new lesions on conventional MRI. Diffusion-weighted MRI is sensitive to the diffusion, or random motion, of water molecules in tissue. It can detect subtle pathological changes that are not seen on conventional MRI. This technique ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001. Multiple Sclerosis: Current Status and Strategies for the Future. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. might allow detection of pathological change in white matter tracts, including demyelination and loss of axons, by quantifying anisotropy through a measure of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). DTI can identify significantly altered diffusion properties in normal-appearing white matter. Lesions with the highest diffusion are the more destructive black holes, while the greatest change in anisotropy is seen in acute inflammatory lesions. Coincident with new lesion formation, diffusion-weighted imaging has shown changes in contralateral normal-appearing white matter. High-field-strength magnets, which are 4 tesla (T) or higher, increase the signal-to-noise ratio (conventional imaging machines are 1.5 T). They allow enhanced detection of small (less than 5 mm) MS lesions, particularly those aligned along blood vessels. Both MR spectroscopy and MTI can be conducted on high-field machines with enhanced sensitivity. Functional magnetic resonance imaging, or fMRI, is a technique for determining which parts of the brain are activated by different types of sensation such as sight or sound, by different types of tasks such as moving one's fingers or legs, or by different mental tasks such as adding sums, reading, or memorizing. This “brain mapping” is achieved by using an MRI scanner to measure changes in blood flow to different areas of the brain. When a particular brain region is activated, blood flow into the region increases. The incoming arterial blood is rich in oxygenated hemoglobin, and there is a corresponding decrease in local deoxygenated hemoglobin. Changes in the MRI signal are derived from regional changes in the concentration of deoxygenated hemoglobin, which is a paramagnetic molecule (reviewed in Hirsch et al.). The fMRI signal is, thus, determined by the balance between oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin. FMRI can provide second-by-second images of changes in response to different stimuli and during performance of mental tasks. It provides a unique tool for assessment of neural circuits involved in loss and recovery of function, as well as for measuring the circuits underlying symptoms that are as difficult to study as cognitive changes, fatigue, pain, and sensory disturbances. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is the fluid that circulates around and within the brain and spinal cord. CSF provides a vehicle for removing waste products of cellular metabolism from the nervous system and is believed to be nutritive for both neurons and glial cells and to function as a transport system for biologically active substances such as releasing factors, hormones, neurotransmitters, and metabolites. Sampling this fluid thus provides an index to substances active in the CNS and possibly those involved in MS pathology. ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001. Multiple Sclerosis: Current Status and Strategies for the Future. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. A number of potential CSF disease markers have been reported in MS, including markers that are proposed as distinguishing between different types of MS (). For the most part, these are markers of tissue damage or immune disturbance. None are currently used in routine clinical practice, since they have not proved useful enough to justify serial lumbar punctures. There has been particular interest in the specificity of oligoclonal bands in MS. Oligoclonal bands are produced by the overrepresentation of particular anti-bodies that can be visualized when CSF proteins are separated by gel electrophoresis where they appear as separate bands of protein on a gel matrix. Each of the bands contains a single type of antibody produced by a single clone of B cells. Oligoclonal bands are for the CSF of MS patients, but they are not to MS patients. For example, they are also found in the CSF of patients with other inflammatory status, such as viral brain infections. In MS, however, the particular antigens that elicit each antibody band are unknown. Investigators have recently used molecular approaches such as phage display libraries to probe MS oligoclonal immunoglobulin G (IgG) bands for sequence information related to their antigenic target. These are powerful methods that should allow for the identification of antigenic targets for the oligoclonal IgG. A main question, however, is whether the oligoclonal IgG bands represent an immune response directed against the etiologic agent of MS or merely constitute a by-product of immune system activity. In other words, upregulation of the antibody response and the heterogeneous distribution of antibodies into oligoclonal IgG bands could be a result of B-cell hyperactivity rather than an immune response to a specific etiologic pathogen. A variety of blood, urine, and mucosal fluid disease markers have been studied in MS, but none of them have provided a reliable disease marker. Again they are either markers of tissue damage (such as S-100) or immune activation (such as neopterin). Blood markers have included matrix metalloproteinases and their tissue inhibitors, circulating adhesion molecules, levels of various cytokines and their receptors, different subpopulations of cells, a variety of antibodies including antiviral and autoreactive antibodies, S-100 levels, and neopterin levels. Urine disease markers have included myelin basic protein-like material, free light chains, neopterin, gliotoxin, and neuron-specific enolase. Mucosal fluid cells and immunoglobulins have also been studied. The diagnosis of MS is based on both clinical parameters, such as medical history and neurological examination, and paraclinical parameters such as MRI, CSF oligoclonal banding, and evoked potentials. There is no MS-specific diag- ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001. Multiple Sclerosis: Current Status and Strategies for the Future. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. nostic test, and the intermittent nature of the disease and high variability in presenting symptoms make diagnosis difficult (listed in ). The presentation of MS can be monosymptomatic or have multifocal signs and symptoms, and many neurodegenerative disorders are similar to MS in their presentation. The general diagnostic criteria, established in 1965 by a committee sponsored by the National MS Society (the MS Society), state that a diagnosis of “clinically definite” MS (CDMS) requires clinical evidence of two or more white matter lesions on at least two occasions. In 1983, these criteria were expanded by Poser et al. to include the use of paraclinical parameters, and they have since become the standard MS diagnostic criteria (). In July 2000, an international committee met to further revise these criteria, in particular to make MRI information a more integral component and to incorporate diagnostic criteria for primary progressive MS. The results of that meeting, however, were not available at the time of this writing. The failure of the Poser criteria to incorporate primary progressive MS has recently been addressed by revised criteria that define definite, probable, and possible levels of diagnostic certainty. These criteria are based on clinical findings, CSF abnormalities, brain and spinal cord MRI abnormalities, and evoked potentials. Using these criteria, at least one year of clinical progression must be documented before a diagnosis of primary progressive MS can be made. MRI reveals neuropathological damage in 70 to 95 percent of people with MS and, because of its sensitivity, is the most helpful paraclinical diagnostic test. However, the use of MRI in MS diagnosis has led to concern that its high sensitivity combined with limited MS specificity leads to misdiagnosis, since other conditions including myelopathy and disseminated encephalomyelitis can cause MRI lesions similar to MS lesions. Thus, it is important that imaging be used in combination with clinical data for the diagnosis of MS. Recently, several sets of criteria for the definition of “MRI-definite” MS have been suggested (). Patients with clinically isolated syndromes are particularly difficult to diagnose, and Barkhof et al. and Fazekas have identified criteria that are relevant to such cases. Although assessment of spinal cord damage using MRI remains behind the development of brain methodology, it can be useful in diagnosing patients suspected of MS, particularly in cases with equivocal or negative brain MRI results. Spinal cord imaging increases the diagnostic sensitivity of MRI and might also enable earlier diagnosis. When demyelination or sclerosis (scarring) occurs, the conduction of nerve impulses along axons is slowed or interrupted. Impaired conductance is reflected in an increased latency of evoked potentials or an increase in the amount of time that elapses between the presentation of a sensory stimulus and the resulting ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001. Multiple Sclerosis: Current Status and Strategies for the Future. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. change in the brain's electrical field. Evoked potentials are measured by placing small electrodes on the head in the region corresponding to the stimuli presented ( ). Abnormal evoked responses to different types of stimuli provide clues to the location of plaques or lesions and are useful in detecting “clinically silent” lesions that do not produce easily observable symptoms. However, abnormal evoked responses are not unique to MS. For example, although abnormal visual IgG antibodies are composed of light and heavy polypeptide chains. Free light chains are found in patients with chronic infections or inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, but also in healthy individuals particularly following strenuous exercise. Cytokines are intercellular signaling proteins produced by cells of the immune system and CNS. They are involved in various aspects of disease processes, particularly inflammatory responses. Oligoclonal bands are produced by the overrepresentation of particular antibodies. They are of the CSF of MS patients, but not to it. Antiviral antibodies are produced by B cells in direct response to an antigen's presence, and certain antiviral antibodies are increased in the CSF of some patients with MS. Immunoglobulins are produced by plasma cells and are integral in adaptive immune responses. Polyclonal increases of IgG occur in chronic infection and inflammation. White blood cells responsible for cell-mediated immune responses to antigens, including viral infections. Adhesion, costimulatory, and other surface of MS. molecules Upregulated adhesion molecules in blood and CSF indicate sustained potential for inflammation in the CNS throughout the clinical spectrum A major component of myelin, MBP is increased in the CSF of some, but not all, MS patients following a demyelinating episode.

Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. evoked potentials are common in MS, they also occur in compressive lesions of the visual pathway and spinocerebellar degeneration. Evoked potentials can aid in the localization of lesions, confirm clinically ambiguous lesions, and confirm the organic basis of symptoms. In addition, changes in evoked potentials can be used to measure disease progression and the effectiveness of therapeutic treatment, including treatments designed to improve conduction. Continued S-100 protein is an astroglial-specific protein that binds calcium. When a brain lesion occurs, S-100 is released into both the CSF and the blood. As a marker of brain damage, NSE reflects the severity of disease in patients with intracerebral hematoma, subarachnoid hemorrhage, head injury, and certain tumors. A major constituent of glial filaments in differentiated CNS astrocytes, GFAP has been used for the diagnosis of astrocytic tumors, the study of astrocytic gliosis, and CNS regeneration and transplantation. Neurofilaments are important for axonal structure, transport, and regeneration. Accumulation of neurofilaments in motor neurons can trigger a neurodegenerative process and may be a key intermediate in the pathway of pathogenesis leading to neuronal loss. A modulator of axon outgrowth and cell adhesion that adapts its structure to requirements during development by alternative splicing and posttranslational modification. CNTF appears to promote remyelination, as well as formation of oligodendroctyes. Highly cytotoxic for astrocytes and oligodendrocytes, gliotoxin may represent an initial pathogenic factor leading to the neuropathological features of MS, such as blood-brain barrier involvement and demyelination. A marker of immune activation, neopterin is increased in CSF of relapsing-remitting patients and correlates with a decrease of -tryptophan, reflecting interferon-gamma-mediated activation of macrophages. Matrix metalloproteinases are enzymes that can dissolve the extracellular matrix of the blood-brain barrier. ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001. Multiple Sclerosis: Current Status and Strategies for the Future. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. Combinations of various types of evidence are used to diagnose MS under the Poser criteria. More than one combination of clinical and paraclinical evidence can support a diagnosis within a single category. Laboratory-supported diagnosis requires one of two possible immune disturbances in CSF: IgG oligoclonal bands or intrathecal IgG production. NOTES: CSF, Cerebrospinal fluid. OB, Oligoclonal bands.

Evoked Potentials as a Diagnostic Tool in MS Strobe light flash or reversible checkerboard pattern flash on a computer screen Series of clicking noises or tone bursts played into earphone On the scalp along the vertex and on each earlobe Evaluation of sensory nerve tracts in spinal cord, thalamus, and sensory cortex Mild electrical stimulus via electrodes on wrists or knees On the scalp, each wrist (medial nerve), and the knees (peroneal nerve) The use of evoked potentials as a diagnostic tool has greatly declined since the advent of the MRI, which provides a more comprehensive picture of disease activity. In at least some cases of progressive MS, visual evoked potentials show changes over time where none are detected in MRI scans. In May 2000, the Quality Standards Subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology concluded that although visual evoked potentials are useful to identify patients at increased risk of developing clinically definite MS, somatosensory evoked responses are only useful for that purpose, and there is insufficient evidence to recommend brainstem auditory evoked potentials as a diagnostic tool. Although MS is postulated to have an underlying immune-mediated pathogenesis, there is as yet no biologic marker that is disease specific and can be used for diagnostic purposes. Similarly, there is insufficient evidence to allow detection of any putative disease-related infectious agent as a basis for defining the disease. Thus, MS continues to be defined by sets of criteria that have been ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001. Multiple Sclerosis: Current Status and Strategies for the Future. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. developed based on clinical and pathologic observations. MS may well be heterogeneous when viewed from the perspective of genetics, pathogenic mechanisms, clinical phenotypes, and immunopathology. To be considered a truly distinctive variant of MS, any putative distinct disease subtypes defined in one of these categories would have to be correlated with the distinctive features identified in each of the other categories. Cases classified as MS are recognized where disease distribution is mainly in the spinal cord, hind brain (cerebellum or brainstem), or cerebrum. Different animal models have distinct topographic distributions, some of which seem to have distinct immunopathologies. For example, Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus, the demyelinating disease that afflicts mice, is mainly a spinal cord disease. There is an apparent overrepresentation of specific phenotypes in certain geographic regions. For example, MS that is relatively restricted to the optic nerve and spinal cord is more common in Japan than in other countries. The Devic's pattern of MS features a predominance of spinal cord and optic nerve involvement. The pathology is considered more destructive than classical MS, and the prognosis is worse. At issue is whether these differences reflect different immunopathogenic mechanisms in a given individual, even when the disease trigger, or initiating event, is not distinct among such individuals. Even in identical twins with MS, the disease course can be markedly different. A number of immunomodulatory agents have been shown in double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter Phase III trials to benefit patients with relapsing MS ( ; see also 1999 review by Rudick ). These agents help clinical disease features (they decrease the number of attacks, the severity of attacks, and sustained worsening on neurologic examination) as well as MRI disease features (they decrease the formation of new lesions, the number of contrast-enhancing lesions, the total burden of disease, and brain atrophy). Although all of these drugs have side effects, they are manageable in most patients. The benefit of treatment is sustained for at least several years. It is not yet known whether these agents prevent, reduce, or delay transition from relapsing to progressive MS, but preliminary data suggest that this may be the case. Throughout this report, the term “disease-modifying therapy” is used to distinguish these agents from other medications used to relieve the symptoms of MS that do not alter either the frequency of relapses or the rate of progression. Beta-interferon (IFN-Î²) is an anti-inflammatory regulatory cytokine with antiviral, antineoplastic, and immunomodulatory activity. It has a number of effects on the immune system that would be beneficial in MS. For example, it decreases cell migration into the CNS, inhibits T-cell proliferation and expression of cell activation markers, inhibits inducible nitric oxide synthase (the enzyme that produces nitric oxide, a potentially damaging substance), and enhances ""2 Clinical and Biological Features.""

There are two types of recombinant (artificially made) beta-interferon. Beta-interferon-1a (Avonex, Rebif) is a duplicate of human beta-interferon. Beta-interferon-1b (Betaseron) has three molecular differences from human beta-interferon: it is not glycosylated, there is an amino acid substitution at position 17, and there is no “N-terminal” methionine. The three available beta-interferon therapies are given in different amounts and dosing schedules (). There are well-recognized side effects (most commonly flu-like reactions), which occur maximally during the first weeks or months of therapy. Flu-like reactions can be minimized by initiating therapy with a dose escalation schedule and consistent use of anti-inflammatory premedication during the first few weeks of therapy. *Rebif has been approved for the treatment of relapsing-remitting MS by the European Commission but has not been approved by the Food and Drug Administration in the United States because of the Orphan Drug Act. If tentative approval is received, Rebif could enter the U.S. market in 2003, when the exclusivity periods for Avonex and Betaseron end. ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001. Multiple Sclerosis: Current Status and Strategies for the Future. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. Glatiramer acetate (Copaxone) consists of random polymers of four amino acids, designed to mimic myelin basic protein, an important component of CNS myelin. Glatiramer acetate is believed to work by activating antiinflammatory regulatory T cells, which then migrate into the CNS to inhibit local immune reactions. Glatiramer acetate has an excellent side effect profile. Patients may experience injection site reactions, but they tend to be quite minor. Some 10 to 15 percent of patients experience at least one immediate postinjection reaction characterized by chest tightness, palpitations, flushing, and anxiety within a few minutes of injection. The reaction lasts only minutes and is not dangerous. Mitoxantrone (Novantrone) is a cytotoxic agent that interferes with DNA synthesis and repair, and suppresses a variety of immune system cells. It also enhances suppressor cell activity. It is given as an intravenous infusion over 5 to 15 minutes, every three months. Mitoxantrone is fairly well tolerated at low doses. In the recent Phase III trial, both the low (5 mg/m) and high (12 mg/m) doses showed efficacy, but the high dose gave the best overall results. Mitoxantrone should not be given at a cumulative dose of 140 mg/m or higher because of concerns about cardiotoxicity, which also means that this drug can be used for only a few years. Currently available treatments are highly effective in preventing the type of MS damage that can be visualized using MRI. They are moderately effective in preventing and reducing the severity of relapses, but they are generally disappointing in preventing long-term disability—the most important goal of treatment. This might reflect the timing of treatment, and there has been a recent emphasis on starting therapy at the time MS is first diagnosed. This type of early therapy is likely most effective in delaying or preventing long-term disability, although this effect has not yet been clearly demonstrated through empirical research studies (Richard Rudick, personal communication). Clearly, much remains to be done in the development of therapies for people who suffer from MS. Two recent studies, the interferon beta-1a (Avonex) prevention study (CHAMPS, Controlled High Risk Subjects Avonex Multiple Sclerosis Prevention) and the interferon beta-1a (Rebif) early treatment (ETOMS, Early Treatment of Multiple Sclerosis) trial, have compared the use of disease-modifying therapy with placebo in patients after their first attack who also have an abnormal brain MRI. These are patients at high risk for MS, but who do not meet current criteria for a definite diagnosis. In both studies, early treatment with a disease-modifying agent significantly delayed onset of a second clinical attack over the two-year study period. Patients who received treatment also showed significantly less MRI disease activity over the next two years. These two trials have led to a reassessment of when disease-modifying therapy should be started. The National MS Society consensus statement endorsed treatment of patients as soon as a definite diagnosis of relapsing MS is made. If new diagnostic criteria are formulated for an MRI-based diagnosis at the time of a first attack, it is likely that the use of disease-modifying therapy will expand to include these early patients. ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001. Multiple Sclerosis: Current Status and Strategies for the Future. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. Beta-interferon and glatiramer acetate have been tested mainly in relapsing MS. It is more controversial whether they benefit progressive MS. Several Phase III trials have examined beta-interferon therapy in patients with secondary progressive MS, with conflicting results. The European Secondary Progressive Study on beta-interferon-1b (Betaseron) showed a significant effect on slowing progression. In contrast, the North American Secondary Progressive beta-interferon-1b study and the European SPECTRIMS beta-interferon-1a (Rebif) study showed no significant effect on progression. These trials did, however, show positive results on secondary outcomes such as relapse rate and MRI disease parameters. The European study, which showed a treatment effect on progression in contrast to the two negative studies, included secondary progressive patients who had a shorter disease duration, were still experiencing relapses, and had contrast-enhancing brain MRI lesions. Considered as a whole, these studies suggest that in the earlier stages of MS, when there is still a significant inflammatory component (reflected in clinical relapses and gadolinium-enhancing lesion activity), beta-interferon may have a positive effect on clinical progression. In the later, nonrelapsing, progressive stages of MS, where there appears to be ongoing atrophy relatively independent of contrast-enhancing lesion activity, beta-interferon does not seem to slow progression. The European Phase III trial of Mitoxantrone enrolled both relapsing and secondary progressive MS patients. The drug had a positive effect on progression as indicated by a decrease in the EDSS impairment scale at the end of the study (change of -0.13 compared to +0.23 in the placebo group, p = .038) (for EDSS scale, see ). An ongoing trial (IMPACT Study) in secondary progressive MS is testing double-dose interferon beta-1a (Avonex) once a week. There have been no major treatment trials in primary progressive and progressive relapsing MS. There currently is an ongoing three-year Phase III trial of glatiramer acetate in primary progressive MS (the Promise trial). Each of the currently available disease-modifying treatments has shortcomings, including partial efficacy for patients as a group and potential adverse effects. There are four reasons why treatments fail—nonadherence on the patient's part, adverse side effects, production of neutralizing antibodies, and nonresponsive disease (reviewed by Cohen at al., 1999). Patient adherence is a factor in the efficacy of any medication, but particularly so when a patient's hopes exceed the outcome—which is particularly salient for therapies that are preventive, but not restorative. The primary principles to increase adherence are appropriate selection of patients for treatment, availability of adequate medical support throughout treatment, and perhaps most importantly, patient education before and during treatment. MS patients need to be fully informed that the therapy can prevent relapses and the accumulation of disability, ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001. Multiple Sclerosis: Current Status and Strategies for the Future. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. but that it will not improve preexisting manifestations. In addition, some patients are averse to self-injection and will not be persuaded to inject themselves with any medication (unless, perhaps, they are convinced of a substantial and certain benefit, which many MS patients are not). Health care financing policies vary widely among different countries and even within countries such as the United States and Canada. This will also influence patient adherence. In countries such as France where the costs of MS therapies are fully covered by the state, cost is unlikely to influence adherence, but in countries where patients must assume the full costs of MS disease-modifying therapies themselves, many of them will decide that they cannot afford to pay more than $10,000 (U.S.) annual expense for the modest health benefit they might gain. Adverse effects are a common reason for discontinuing treatment, but they are generally not serious health threats. The most common side effect of glatiramer acetate is irritation at the injection site, although it is typically mild. The most common side effects of beta-interferon are flu-like symptoms, and these usually resolve after three to six months. (Depression is also a possible side effect and is discussed in greater detail in .) Although only 4 percent of actively treated patients withdrew from beta-interferon clinical trials because of side effects, in clinical practice, 11 percent discontinue within four months of initiating treatment (reviewed in 1999 by Mohr et al.). (The percentage of patients who discontinue treatment because of side effects might, however, decline as physicians become more experienced in managing these side effects.) Defining nonresponsive disease in individual patients is difficult, because unfortunately patients can continue to experience relapses after initiation of disease-modifying therapy with beta-interferon or glatiramer acetate. Comparison of pre- and post-treatment relapse rates is fraught with problems, and it is often difficult to identify whether an individual patient is responsive to therapy. At a minimum, a patient's level of neurological impairment and disability should remain stable on therapy. Persistent gadolinium-enhancing or T2 lesion accrual should be considered a worrisome feature, even in the absence of clinical evidence of activity or worsening. Finally, neutralizing antibodies, which can interfere with the effects of interferons, appear in up to 20 percent of patients after two years of beta-interferon treatment. They do not appear to be an issue with glatiramer acetate. Increased neutralizing antibodies appear to be associated with reduced clinical benefit, although there is still some controversy about this point. For example, it is still not known what levels of neutralizing antibodies are clinically significant, how often they persist, and what is the most reliable method of measuring them. More research is needed on testing for neutralizing antibodies in MS patients treated with beta-interferons and how to best use the results to properly manage patient treatment.

Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. Disease-modifying therapies are expensive, costing roughly $8,000 to $10,000 (U.S.) per year. Several studies have indicated that their costs outweigh their benefits, but these analyses have been heavily criticized. Forbes and colleagues argued that it is not cost-effective to treat progressive MS patients with interferon beta-1b in Britain and that the money spent on interferon beta-1b would be better spent on other services, such as supportive care and simple interventions to reduce the burden of patients' symptoms. Analyses of cost-effectiveness of medical treatment often use quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) to measure health benefits (see ). The estimated costs of beta-interferon treatment per gain in QALY for relapsing-remitting MS range from 809,000 British pounds ($1,140,000 U.S.) to 2,038,400 British pounds ($2,870,000 U.S.). The estimates are considerably lower in Canada (406,000 to 490,000 Canadian dollars, or $270,000-$330,000 U.S.). For secondary progressive MS, the estimated costs of beta-interferon treatment per gain in QALY range from 874,600 British pounds ($1,230,000 U.S.) to 1,024,000 British pounds ($1,440,000 U.S.). While disease-related expenditures are relatively easy to calculate, the benefits of these expenditures are not so easy to calculate, particu- Quality-adjusted life-years are a health status measure that includes both quantity and quality of life in a single outcome measure. Multiplying life expectancy by a quality-of-life adjustment fraction, or utility, results in a QALY value. Utilities represent the level of quality or value associated with a particular health state, and range in value from 0, representing death, to 1, representing optimal health. Utilities are determined in two ways: by researchers through literature searches for previously conducted utility studies or by direct measurement of utility values based on the assessment of people's values for different levels of health. The use of QALYs for resource allocation has been widely criticized as discriminatory against the elderly and the disabled by placing less value on extending their lives due to the lower potential for health status improvement. The determination of utility values that accurately reflect the many ways quality of life can be affected is difficult in part because one of the underlying assumptions of QALYs— that the severity of a disease state or disability and the corresponding value represent a fixed quantity—is unlikely to be true. The effect of health status on quality of life depends in large part on an individual's unique perspective. Although the use of QALYs is one of the current standards for such evaluations, it is a crude attempt to express a qualitative, subjective reality in quantitative terms and has been criticized as being of limited value in this respect. ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001. Multiple Sclerosis: Current Status and Strategies for the Future. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. larly in long-term diseases where treatments might slow the progress of disease, but neither cure it nor restore impaired functions. In addition to the limitations inherent in the use of QALYs, there are other problems with the conclusion that disease-modifying therapies are not cost-effective. The studies done to date have been criticized for using poor economic methodology in interpreting the data. In a year 2000 review of immunomodulatory drugs used to treat MS, the British National Health Service committee on health technology assessment concluded that the cost-effectiveness of these drugs is simply not known. The committee cited a lack of quality clinical trials for each drug, including methodological limitations, poor reporting of data, small sample sizes, short duration, inconsistent treatment regimes and outcome measures, and uncertainty about the clinical significance of reported benefits. The latter criticism might, however, change. New data about these drugs are emerging at such a rapid pace that conclusions about their benefits should be reconsidered as new data from clinical trials become available. In general, cost-effectiveness analysis should be considered skeptically. Cost-effectiveness is a highly politicized issue in which economic principles are often misapplied. Indeed, the United States health care system often favors economically inefficient delivery of some products—for example, liver transplants—in that health care providers are willing to underwrite additional costs to gain market share. Further, cross-national comparisons have little merit because of differences in national health care systems, as well as other economic and social factors. Finally, although economic analysis reveals important financial trade-offs, all societies hold certain social values that outweigh economic considerations. For many people, the health and well-being of their loved ones and themselves is among the deepest of these values. Ultimately, the pathogenic mechanisms underlying MS will have to be better understood to design rational therapies. Physiology of Myelin and Axons: Normal Function, Demyelination, and Repair The integrative activity of the nervous system, which underlies motor, sensory, cognitive, and psychological behavior, depends on electrical signaling between neurons. Each neuron encodes its message in the form of action potentials (small all-or-none electrical impulses) that are carried to other neurons via axons, the cable-like fibers that extend from neuron cell bodies. Many axons within the brain and spinal cord are myelinated. ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001. Multiple Sclerosis: Current Status and Strategies for the Future. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. The myelin sheath provides a high-resistance, low-capacitance insulator that increases the reliability and speed of action potentials conducted along axon fibers. Myelin is what makes the white matter of brain white. It is a multilayered sheath formed by the oligodendroglial cells, or oligodendrocytes, that insulate axons ( ). Each segment of the myelin sheath surrounds the axon in a segmented fashion, with segments (called internodes) periodically interrupted at nodes of Ranvier. The internodal axon is normally surrounded by myelin sheaths whose thicknesses are related to the caliber of the ensheathed axon. In normal Oligodendrocyte making myelin. The processes of a given oligodendrocyte wrap themselves around portions of the surrounding axons. As each process wraps itself around, it forms layers of myelin. Each process thus becomes a segment of the axon's myelin sheath. SOURCE: National Institutes of Health Office of Science Education. ""2 Clinical and Biological Features.""

Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. myelinated fibers, the action potential does not travel in a continuous manner. On the contrary, it jumps from one node of Ranvier to the next, in a manner known as “saltatory” (derived from the Latin word for “jumping”). Saltatory conduction is a rapid process, with the impulse taking only 20 one-thousandths of a second to jump from one node of Ranvier to the next; as a result, myelinated fibers conduct impulses with a high velocity. Significantly, voltage-dependent sodium channels are clustered at the nodes of Ranvier but are relatively more scarce in the internodal axonal membrane. In contrast, potassium channels, which exist in low density at nodes, are more abundant in the internodal and paranodal axonal membrane, under the myelin sheath. Therefore, loss of the myelin sheath exposes relatively inexcitable axonal membranes; the consequence is that nerve impulses are conducted more slowly or not at all. Axonal Conduction Is Impaired in Demyelinated Axons Following damage to the myelin, conduction velocity is reduced, and conduction slows along the demyelinated axon ( ). Studies using evoked potentials to examine human subjects with MS have demonstrated that this slowing of conduction does not, in itself, necessarily produce clinical deficits. In addition, however, conduction failure can occur in demyelinated axons. When conduction failure occurs, the axon potential is not propagated from one end of the fiber to the other, and information is lost. This produces a clinical deficit. Conduction failure in demyelinated axons is now known to result not only from loss of the insulating myelin, but also from the molecular organization of the axon membrane. Following damage to the myelin, internodal parts of the axon membrane (which had previously been covered by myelin) are uncovered. Myelinated Axons Exhibit Complex Molecular Architecture Prior to the last decade, axonal dysfunction in demyelinating diseases was considered to be due entirely to the loss of the myelin insulation. According to this schema, after the myelin is damaged, there is a “short circuit,” and impulse conduction is slowed or fails. It is now known that although the schema described above is partially correct, it is not the whole story. The axon itself exhibits an elegant molecular architecture, and following damage to the myelin, this architecture is disrupted. The molecular architecture of the axon is manifest by the placement of specialized protein molecules, called ion channels, within the membrane of the axon. Sodium channels act as tiny molecular batteries, which produce the depolarization that is necessary for the generation of action potentials. In contrast, potassium channels act as molecular brakes, damping electrical activity. Within myelinated axons, these two types of ion channels have a complementary structure. Sodium channels are clustered in high density in the axon membrane at small gaps in the myelin called nodes of Ranvier, where they support the produc- ""2 Clinical and Biological Features.""

Their numbers there are too low to support secure conduction, which contributes to conduction failure. Potassium channels, on the other hand, tend to be located in the internodal parts of the axon membrane, beneath the myelin sheath; as a result of this, they are masked by the Pathogenesis.

The unmasking of potassium channels by demyelination thus introduces another factor that tends to interfere with the conduction of action potentials. Molecular Plasticity in Demyelinated Axons Underlies Restoration of Impulse Conduction Given that impulse conduction fails in demyelinated axons and that this contributes to clinical deficits, how do remissions occur? It is now clear that demyelinated axons possess a remarkable capability to rebuild themselves at the molecular level. In the weeks following demyelination, demyelinated axons acquire, within regions where myelin has been lost, a density of sodium channels that is high enough to support action potential conduction even in the absence of insulating myelin. The demyelinated nerve fibers insert additional amplifiers (sodium channels) in their membranes so that they are able to conduct action potentials reliably even though there is a short circuit. This is a striking example of neuronal plasticity, in this case at the molecular level. Although this molecular plasticity has been clearly demonstrated in laboratory experiments, a number of important questions remain: How do neurons “know” that their axons have been demyelinated and that there is a need to activate the machinery for synthesis of sodium channels? How do neurons control the synthesis and deployment of sodium channels? What turns on the genes for sodium channels and ensures that the correct types of sodium channels (there are nearly a dozen different types, which are like different types of batteries) are produced following demyelination? Also, how are sodium channels transported and inserted into the correct parts of the axon membrane so that they can function normally? These questions have important therapeutic implications and are currently under study. The presence of axonal degeneration in MS was recognized even in the early descriptions of this disease, but its presence has recently been reemphasized (). Axonal transection might be the structural basis for acquisition of permanent (nonremitting) neurological deficits, making it an especially important part of the pathology of MS. A corollary of this proposition would be that neuroprotective interventions that limit axonal injury should prevent, or at least lessen, the acquisition of new, permanent signs and symptoms in MS. As a step toward the development of neuroprotective strategies in MS, it will be important to delineate the mechanisms that underlie axonal injury in this disorder. Is it a consequence of demyelination? Alternatively, is the axonal damage a by-product of the inflammatory or immune processes involved in triggering demyelination? What is the nature of the “injury cascade” that leads from the ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001. Multiple Sclerosis: Current Status and Strategies for the Future.

Understanding the pathogenesis of the process might lead to the development of new therapeutic targets for MS. These questions are being approached in models of other neurological diseases such as trauma and cerebrovascular disease, including stroke, and should be actively pursued in MS research as well. Axonal transection during inflammatory demyelination. According to this schema, axonal transection during (A) is a consistent feature of inflammatory demyelinating lesions. This results in degeneration of the distal axonal segment (B) and irreversible loss of neuronal function.

This model posits that axonal viability depends upon oligodendrocyte-derived trophic effect.

MS is defined as a demyelinating disease because the myelin sheaths and their parent cells, the oligodendroglia, are major targets of immune-mediated damage (). The classical lesions are discrete plaques of demyelination, which, depending on disease stage, are associated with varying evidence of inflammation. The clinical signs, which are episodic and are not clinically predictable, are presumably related to the location of the lesions, although clinically “silent” demyelinating lesions also occur. These predominantly white matter lesions occur in multiple brain regions and appear at different times throughout the disease. Common syndromes correlated with lesions in specific areas include visual deficits, weakness and spasticity, eye movement abnormalities, and ataxia (). Lesions are often described as active or chronic, depending on whether there are signs of active inflammation, usually associated with ongoing demyelination, or whether the lesion is stable and does not show signs of inflammatory activity. Disruption of the blood-brain barrier that normally insulates the brain from pathogenic blood-borne substances is an early event in the development of MS lesions (). Antigen-specific T cells enter the nervous system, and when they encounter and recognize their specific antigen, a cascade of cytokine expression begins that contributes to the damage of the blood-brain barrier. This can be detected on contrast-enhanced MRI. Examination of active demyelinating lesions in autopsy cases of MS reveals structural and immunopathological abnormalities related to demyelination and abnormalities of oligodendrocytes. The inflammatory response is dominated by lymphocytes and macrophages, but the data on the relative numbers of CD4+ and CD8+ cells are still not settled. A plaque is characterized by loss of myelin sheath and infiltration by macrophages (which show myelin basic protein and myelin-associated glycoprotein immunoreactivities).

Clinical Pathological Correlations in Common Syndromes of MS Often related to the involvement of the optic nerve as occurs in optic neuritis Frequently associated with plaques involving connections between the brainstem nuclei subserving eye movements One of the consequences of lesions involving the spinal cord or descending motor tracts in the white matter of internal capsule or brainstem Usually the result of lesions in cerebellum or its input-output pathways inflammatory responses amplify, macrophages are filled with lipids, myelin damage occurs, and there is apparently some collateral damage to axons. Scattered B cells and plasma cells are also sometimes associated with these lesions. Immunocytochemical analysis has suggested that there may be leakage of immunoglobulins and complement from vessels at the margins of active plaques. There is evidence for upregulation of a variety of cytokines within MS plaques including various interleukins (IL-1, 2, 4, 6, 10, and 12); beta-interferon; tumor necrosis factor (TNF); and transforming growth factor (TGF). Cytokines are intercellular signaling proteins produced by cells of the immune system and CNS. Their involvement in any disease is complex. They can initiate, sustain, or terminate various aspects of disease processes and are particularly involved in inflammatory responses. Specific chemokine receptors are expressed by infiltrating cells in demyelinating MS brain lesions and in CSF. These results imply pathogenic roles for specific chemokine-chemokine receptor interactions in MS and suggest new molecular targets for therapeutic intervention. Some investigators have emphasized that the pattern of pathology suggests a dying-back oligodendrogliopathy (those parts of the cell, such as the most distal process, farthest from the cell body are the most vulnerable). During the active stages of disease, the number of oligodendrocytes can be reduced near the demyelinating foci. Subsequently, there might be partial recruitment of oligodendrocyte precursors that may, in part, repopulate the margins of the plaque and contribute to remyelination. Trapp and colleagues have emphasized that the relapsing-remitting course is intimately related to the inflammatory demyelination and classical plaques, while more chronic progressive forms of the disease are linked to transection, or severing, of axons at sites of inflammation and demyelination. They have shown that severed axons were a consistent component in the lesions of individuals with MS and suggest that the number of these injured axons is correlated to the magnitude of the inflammation within the lesion. Axonal damage might be a pathological correlate of irreversible neurological deficits that occur in patients with progressive MS. In individuals with chronic MS, plaques are often sharply demarcated with scattered lipid-containing macrophages and little evidence of ongoing myelin destruction. Demyelination can be incomplete. The density of axons may be significantly reduced. There is usually astrogliosis within these lesions. It is not clear exactly how the axonal damage that occurs at later stages plays into this complex evolving pathology, but the extent of axonal damage appears to be a critical determinant of whether a person recovers from an attack or not. Lack of recovery from attacks and disease progression are more likely when axons are more severely damaged and repair mechanisms fail. ""2 Clinical and Biological Features.""

The tight seal of the cells lining the blood vessels forms a blood-brain barrier that keeps many substances out of the brain. Leaky blood vessels in the body allow many molecules to cross through to other tissues, but the tight construction of the vessels in the head guards against entry of most molecules into the brain. Normally, only certain molecules, for example, blood gases such as oxygen and small nutritional molecules, can cross the blood-brain barrier, but this barrier breaks down when the brain is injured or in certain diseases, such as MS.

A correlation between demyelination and axonal degeneration observed at autopsy is supported by imaging studies, including those that compare the concentrations of -acetyl aspartate. For example, one study measured the levels of NAA, an amino acid found only in neurons that serves as a biological marker for integrity of the axon and neuronal cell body. The brains of MS patients showed significantly greater side-to-side differences in levels of NAA, indicating decreased neuronal integrity on the side of the brain with lower NAA levels. There was a correlation between this asymmetry in motor function and the asymmetry of NAA concentrations in the internal capsule. Insights into processes that lead to demyelination and axon damage can be obtained by analyzing T1-weighted image hypointensities, proton spectroscopy, MTI, and DTI and by correlating these measures with clinical and pathological findings. Gliosis is a prominent feature of the MS lesion, but it is best regarded as a secondary phenomenon. Whenever the CNS is damaged, it undergoes an injury response, usually called reactive gliosis or glial scarring. The response is broadly the same whatever the source of injury, although the details vary somewhat with different types of pathology. The glial reaction to injury includes recruitment of oligodendrocyte precursor cells, stem cells, microglia, and astrocytes. Formation of the glial scar after CNS injury generally occurs over a period of weeks. Microglia are typically the first cell types to enter the lesion. In the normal brain, they are quiescent with short, branched processes. Following injury, they exhibit various changes, including activation, cell division, and migration to the injury site. During activation, microglia display conspicuous functional plasticity, which involves changes in cell morphology, cell surface receptor expression, and production of growth factors and cytokines, and they become, in general, more macrophage like. Microglia can be either neurotoxic or neurotrophic. The final glial scar is made up mainly of a meshwork of tightly interwoven astrocyte processes, attached to one another by tight junctions and gap junctions and surrounded by extracellular matrix (reviewed in 1999 by Fawcett and Asher). (Astrocytes are irregularly star-shaped, background structural cells of the nervous system.) Gliosis is usually restricted to the area of demyelination, but it sometimes extends beyond that area. There is no specific way to identify the presence and extent of gliosis in MS lesions through MRI, although the T1 signal might be more sensitive to gliosis than the T2 signal. The role of astrocytes in gliosis is not completely known. Since there is evidence that glial scars can inhibit both axon growth and myelination, it is clearly important to know what causes them to form, what cells are involved, why they are inhibitory, and how to manipulate them. Finally, although gliosis is generally considered harmful, there is also evidence that the gliotic ensheathment of demyelinated axons might favor the restoration of nerve conduction.

Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. The relapsing-remitting form of MS appears to be related to the demyelination of axons during relapses, followed by the remodeling and remyelination with consequent restoration of conduction that underlies remission. Remyelination is carried out by surviving oligodendrocytes or by the proliferation of progenitor cells that are then stimulated to become oligodendrocytes. Molecular remodeling of demyelinated axons, in terms of their redistributing their sodium channels along the axon, might act as a form of adaptive plasticity; this process may represent a target for future therapies. In contrast, the progressive form of the disease, which appears clinically as an unremitting accumulation of deficits, might reflect the superimposition of axonal injury or degeneration on multiple chronic foci of demyelinated axons. The finding that axonal damage can occur frequently in MS and the suggestion that these lesions contribute to persistent neurological deficits are important issues in MS research. Thus, it will be important to understand the mechanisms whereby axons are damaged and to define ways of protecting axons, which may be vulnerable to degeneration, in part due to their proximity to inflammatory and demyelinating foci. It will also be important to search for molecules that promote the regrowth of injured axons to their appropriate targets. Some of the lessons from studies of the repair of spinal cord injury are likely to be relevant here. Moreover, because abnormal patterns of ion channels have been found within neurons whose axons are undergoing demyelination, it will be important to understand the factors that influence the regulation of these channels. These lines of research, involving strategies can restore conduction in demyelinated axons represent opportunities to restore that protect axons from degeneration or promote repair, and those agents that functions and could have significant implications for therapy. Similarly, future therapeutic approaches might involve replacement of oligodendroglia with pluripotent stem cells (discussed further in ). Progenitor cells, those either already present in an individual or provided from another source by injection, can produce myelin in demyelinated foci in experimental animals. Future experimental therapeutics will involve approaches directed at restoring oligodendrocytes to ensheath axonal processes and to induce physiological modeling of axons to restore conduction. The most striking pathology in MS is the immune system's attack and destruction of the body's own myelin sheath, which is why it is believed to be an autoimmune disease, although this has not yet been definitively proven (). The pathogenic trigger that first causes the immune system to attack myelin is unknown, but the immunopathology, or pathological activity of the immune system, that ensues after that initial attack is becoming clearer. ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001. Multiple Sclerosis: Current Status and Strategies for the Future. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. The immune system defends the body against foreign invaders such as bacteria and viruses. It does so by recognizing that foreign invaders have special markers distinguishing them as “non-self,” compared to the body's own tissue (or “self”) (). Normally, the immune system reacts only to non-self invaders, not to its own tissues. Unfortunately, this process is not foolproof. Autoimmunity is an immune response mounted against antigens that are naturally produced within the body, or self-antigens, to cause lasting tissue damage. In the strictest sense, an autoimmune disease must meet several criteria. First, the disease must be reproduced by transfer of autoantibodies or autoreactive T lymphocytes (T cells) from affected to unaffected individuals. Second, the self-antigen that elicits the immune attack must be identified. Third, this antigen (or a closely related one) should cause a similar disease in an animal model. (Scientifically, it would be best to show that the antigen caused the disease in humans, but it would be unethical to intentionally infect humans, hence, the compromise for evidence in animals). It is now feasible to transfer human genes into animals in an attempt to satisfy these criteria. One of the first so-called transgenic studies that introduced certain human genes into an animal without MS led to the development of a disease resembling MS. Among the newly added genes were those for a specific type of histocompatibility antigen and for a particular type of T-cell receptor that binds to a fragment of a myelin protein (myelin basic protein). This type of study begins to confirm the autoimmune nature of MS. Human autoimmune diseases, however, are generally classified as such without meeting these three stringent criteria. Circumstantial evidence often is marshaled for classification. For example, patients are classified as having autoimmune disease if they have high levels of autoantibody or autoreactive T cells, or because there is a correlation between the level of immune activity and disease severity. Some examples of autoimmune diseases are listed in . Why does the immune system have autoreactive lymphocytes? During development, the immune system randomly builds a vast repertoire of cells that respond to a multitude of foreign antigens. At the same time, the immune system must weed out those cells that react to self-antigens. Most self-reactive B cells and T cells are removed early during development. Other regulatory mechanisms exist to keep self-reactive lymphocytes unresponsive later on. These are among the normal regulatory mechanisms resulting in immunological tolerance to most self-antigens. Even though there are usually small numbers of autoreactive lymphocytes in a normal adult, most do not cause disease, and some might even serve a (currently unknown) beneficial purpose. With autoimmune disease, however, there are large numbers of autoreactive immune cells. Autoimmune disease thus can be thought of as a failure of normal regulatory mechanisms that guard against autoimmunity. ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001. Multiple Sclerosis: Current Status and Strategies for the Future. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. The causes of autoimmune response in MS and most other autoimmune diseases are unknown but likely include a combination of genetic susceptibility and exposure to environmental agents. For most autoimmune diseases, the actual genes and environmental agents are unknown. Gender also plays a role because women are disproportionately affected by autoimmune disease. The reasons for the gender difference are also unknown but appear to relate to distinct immune environments in women and How can genes and environment trigger autoimmune pathology? Genes control many properties of the immune system. Theoretically, autoimmune disease can occur if any of the genes controlling the immune system's ability to distinguish self from non-self are defective. The genes often suspected of predisposing to autoimmune disease encode proteins, such as histocompatibility antigens, that participate in this complex process of self versus non-self recognition. Environmental or infectious agents can stimulate pathological autoimmune reactions through at least two possible mechanisms: molecular mimicry, superantigens, and bystander damage (). Molecular mimicry occurs when a bacterial or viral epitope—the fragment of an antigen that elicits an immune response—is very similar to a self-epitope. This can occur following an infection where an immune cell targeting an epitope on a bacterium subsequently cross-reacts with a self-antigen. Superantigens are proteins from bacteria or retroviruses that lead to widespread activation of T cells. Unlike most antigens, which activate only a specific T cell, superantigens activate approximately one out of every ten T cells. Because of their generic ability to activate so many types of T cells, superantigens may inadvertently activate autoreactive T cells, which then attack self-tissues. In bystander damage, a virus upregulates a nonspecific immune response that then leads to pathology; for example, proinflammatory cytokines might activate Th1 cells or macrophages that contribute to the immunopathology. Once damage occurs, new cellular epitopes become exposed and trigger an immune response in a process called epitope spreading, which can also lead to autoimmune pathology. During an immune response against a particular epitope, the number of lymphocytes that recognize the epitope normally multiplies. Yet, in epitope spreading, the immune response escalates to target other epitopes on the same antigen or on related antigens. In this way, an initially nonpathological autoimmune response expands to produce a pathological response. The underlying basis for epitope spreading in autoimmune diseases is poorly understood. Another way to produce a pathological autoimmune response is for autoreactive lymphocytes to gain access to a target antigen from which they are ordinarily separated. The brain is one example of an anatomical sanctuary site, because it is protected by the blood-brain barrier of the central nervous system. Normally, T cells that might react against myelin do not pass across this barrier into the central nervous system. In MS, however, T cells become activated, which enables them to penetrate the blood-brain barrier and reach their targets—myelin antigens—thereby generating an autoimmune response. ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001. Multiple Sclerosis: Current Status and Strategies for the Future. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. One of the first pathological processes leading up to MS attacks is thought to be activation of autoreactive T lymphocytes, or T cells, and their migration into the central nervous system. However, T cells and the inflammatory molecules they secrete are not the only players. Many cells and molecules of the immune system—likely unleashed by T-cell activation—participate in demyeli- Interactions between major cell components of the immune system. This simplified outline shows interactions that occur in response to a foreign antigen. The antigen could be an epitope from a virus particle, bacterium, or other foreign agent. The antigen-presenting cell (APC) ingests the antigen (or in the case of an infecting virus, it may already be within the cell) and processes it into peptide fragments. The major histocompatibility complex (MHC, the cell surface structure characteristic of each individual) presents this target to a resting T cell. Binding of the peptide-MHC complex by the T-cell receptor activates the T cell. In the case of a CD8+ cell, it becomes a cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL), which will destroy any cells that have the same peptide-MHC complex on their surfaces. In the case of a CD4+ cell, the activated cell produces and secretes various cytokines that recruit and activate nonspecific effector cells (such as macrophages) or stimulate antigen-bound B cells to produce antibodies. When T and B lymphocytes are activated by a specific antigen, they undergo proliferation, producing more cells with their same antigen specificity. This serves to amplify the immune response against the foreign antigen. ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001.

Although no virus has yet been shown to contribute to the etiology of MS, there are several ways in which this could occur, and one of these is shown in this figure. Activated T cells cross the blood-brain barrier following activation by a microbe with a structural similarity to a component of the myelin sheath. Once inside the brain, these cells attack self-antigens, such as the various myelin proteins that are attacked in MS. NOTE: MBP = myelin basic protein. SOURCE: Steinman and Oldstone, 1997.

The key features of this cascade are not fully understood, including the precise ordering of events, the antigens targeted by T cells, and the contributions of B lymphocytes, or B cells, and other cells of the immune system. Yet, as this section explains, much insight has been gained into the immunopathology of MS. This knowledge has been—and continues to be—fundamental for devising therapies targeted to the immunopathology of MS (). ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001. Multiple Sclerosis: Current Status and Strategies for the Future. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. As much as a century ago, researchers observed that T cells were particularly abundant in MS lesions. Over time, using modern immunologic techniques, they managed to isolate and characterize a particular type of T cell, the autoreactive T cell, from the blood and CSF of MS patients. These and related findings gave credence to the hypothesis that autoreactive T cells played a dominant role in MS. After all, immunologists have long known that T cells are capable of orchestrating a multifaceted autoimmune attack. However, this was not enough to explain MS pathology. First, elevations in certain types of autoreactive T cells were not unique to MS patients. Second, and more critically, T cells were necessary but not sufficient to cause demyelinating disease in animal models. The transfer of myelin-specific T cells into normal animals initiated only inflammation, not demyelination. This suggested that other immune cells, particularly antibody-producing B cells () and macrophages, might also play key roles, even if autoreactive T cells launched the process. An important component of the myelin sheath, MBP is located on the cytoplasmic face of the myelin membrane, and constitutes 30-40% of myelin protein by weight. Myelin-associated oligodendrocytic basic protein (MOBP) Structurally similar to MBP, but expressed exclusively in the CNS myelin. Possibly involved in myelin compaction. PLP constitutes approximately 50% by weight of myelin protein. PLP spans the myelin membrane, providing increased stability.

Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. The prime autoantigen that elicits the autoimmune response in MS is not known. While there are many candidate autoantigens, as yet none is preeminent. Much MS research focused on myelin basic protein (MBP), located at the inner surface of the myelin membrane. Clinical studies were shaped by research on experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE), the classic animal model of demyelinating disease. In many species, MBP acts as a classical encephalitogenic autoantigen (an antigen capable of serving as the focus of an inflammatory attack in the brain). EAE research further established that in some strains of mice and rats, the autoimmune response to MBP displays two unique features. First, in the initial stages of the immune response in EAE, T cells react only to very small regions of the MBP molecule (“epitope dominance”), even though they later react to many more regions of the molecule (“epitope spreading”) (see ). Second, the encephalitogenic T cells in EAE use an unusually narrow repertoire of genes for their antigen receptors. (T cells recognize their target antigen by its capacity to bind to specific receptors on their surface membrane, called T-cell receptors [TCRs]). These two features raised hopes for developing immune-based therapies because a more limited range of therapies might succeed in combating MS in early stages. Unfortunately, these features turned out to be much less prominent in humans with MS. First, human T cells respond to a broader set of MBP epitopes. While there might be a relatively dominant epitope in the central portion of the MBP molecule, there are clearly many other target epitopes along the full sequence of this large polypeptide. Second, MBP-specific T cells use multiple genes for their TCRs, which allows for large variability among individuals. Generally, it appears that the T-cell response against myelin proteins differs greatly between individual patients, a property that suggests the potential need for individually designed immune therapies. Several research teams have attempted to identify MBP-specific T cells in MS patients. Unfortunately, these attempts did not show significant increases in MBP-specific T-cell counts in MS patients compared to healthy blood donors. However, when more definitive assay systems were used, increased frequencies of activated MBP-specific T cells were found in MS patients. These studies relied on complex methods and were influenced by numerous factors that complicate the interpretation of results. More direct assays, such as those that use binding of oligomeric class II-peptide complexes to specific T cells, might resolve the problem. To add a further degree of complexity, MBP does not appear to be the only autoantigen in MS: there are a number of additional myelin and nonmyelin proteins that are potential autoantigens in MS. Earlier hypotheses had implicated MBP on the basis of two lines of research. First, studies of EAE had suggested that MBP was indeed the most important, if not the only, encephalitogenic myelin autoantigen. Second, due to its particularly convenient molecular properties, MBP was the only myelin protein available both at high purity and in large ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001. Multiple Sclerosis: Current Status and Strategies for the Future. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. quantities. However, thanks to modern biotechnology, even minor myelin proteins are now available in large quantities and can be studied for their encephalitogenic capacity. Later studies established that many, if not all, myelin proteins are potentially encephalitogenic. Especially interesting among these newly recognized autoantigens is myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG). In contrast to MBP, which lies on the inside of the myelin sheath, MOG lies on the surface. As one of the few myelin proteins accessible to humoral autoantibodies, MOG is a target for demyelinating immunoglobulins (see next section). In addition, MOG is a very effective autoantigen in rodents and in primates for encephalitogenic T cells. Some studies even demonstrated increased frequencies of MOG-reactive T cells in MS patients. These findings clearly warrant general confirmation. It is also important to investigate whether different subtypes of MS, which are distinguished by divergent clinical, genetic, and morphological features, are associated with enhanced T-cell responses against different target autoantigens. Thus far, research has spotlighted one class of T cells—those with a TCR termed Î±Î². Î±Î² T cells are the major class of immune cells centrally involved in adaptive immune responses against infections and tumors. Much less attention has been given to other T-cell classes (Î³Î´ T cells and NK1 T cells), which may function both as effector cells in autoimmune attacks and as suppressor cells that dampen autoimmune responses. There are reports linking the presence of Î³Î´ T cells in the brain (presumably) with the induction of heat shock proteins in MS lesions. Certain members of this broad class of proteins are a normal component of the myelin sheath, yet they are also found outside the CNS as well as in pathogens. The role of heat shock proteins in the development of the MS lesion is unknown, but there are various possibilities. Some of these proteins might act as a target autoantigen, as has been shown in autoimmune diabetes. They might also reflect inflammatory stress inflicted on local CNS cells, or they might be determinants of beneficial anti-inflammatory control mechanisms. Even though the precise pathological roles of T cells and their autoantigens are unresolved, this line of research has generated many approved or emerging therapies. These include vaccination strategies, which use either attenuated myelinspecific T cells or peptides representing myelin-specific T-cell receptors as vaccines to strengthen the body's own regulatory responses against pathogenic T cells (reviewed in Zhang et. al., 1998). Also under development are “altered peptide” therapies that use peptide analogues of myelin protein segments to induce autoreactive T cells to produce protective, rather than pathogenic, cytokine mediators. Cytokines, as discussed later, are a functionally diverse set of signaling molecules produced by T cells. *Each (Î± and Î²) refers to a polypeptide chain that forms the T-cell receptor. ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001. Multiple Sclerosis: Current Status and Strategies for the Future. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. B cells (also known as B lymphocytes) have been detected in MS lesions for many years, although less consistently than T cells. While most MS research naturally focused on T cells, evidence also has accumulated for participation by autoreactive B cells. It now appears that both types of lymphocytes actively contribute to MS immunopathology. Autoreactive T cells are thought to launch inflammation and, through their release of cytokines, to stimulate B cells to secrete antibodies that cause demyelination. This is consistent with animal studies finding that EAE can be produced only by injecting myelin-specific T cells in combination with myelin-specific antibodies. Without injecting the antibodies, demyelination does not occur. In MS patients, levels in cerebrospinal fluid of the type of protein known to consist of antibodies (immunoglobulin) are often higher than in healthy people. The increased immunoglobulin is due to production by only a few different clones of B cells that have been induced to proliferate. B cells from the CSF of MS patients have been reported to contain mutations in the DNA sequences that encode antibodies, which is consistent with the notion of an antigen-driven selection of antibodies with high-affinity antigen-binding sites. Such events are commonly observed in immune responses against foreign antigens such as bacterial infections, as well as in humoral autoimmune responses. However, no foreign antigen or autoantigen responsible for the generation of oligoclonal bands in MS has yet been identified. One recent study using sophisticated immunocytochemistry furnished direct evidence of a pathologic role for autoantibodies. For the first time, MOG-specific antibodies were demonstrated to be bound to myelin debris in active MS lesions. If confirmed and extended to a larger group of patients, this finding would suggest that B-cell-derived autoantibodies might induce myelin destruction. On the other hand, although anti-MOG antibodies are found in the CSF of MS patients, they are also found in CSF of patients with other neurological diseases that are not demyelinating. Thus, despite tantalizing leads, the role of anti-MOG antibodies in MS patients is still unclear. Cytokines are soluble proteins produced and released by T cells, macrophages, and certain other cell types. Interferons (IFN- Î±, Î², and Î³), interleukins (including IL- 1, 4, 6, 10, 12, and 13), TGF-b, and the neuropoietic cytokines (such as ciliary neurotrophic factor and leukemia inhibitory factor) are all different types of cytokines. They generally act as intercellular signaling molecules that regulate *Neuropoietic cytokines are the family of neural growth factors that act on both the nervous and the hematopoietic or immune systems.

Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. and carry out immune functions, but their repertoire is complex. Some function as pro-inflammatory, others as anti-inflammatory agents. Some even have divergent functions during different phases of disease. Cytokines, including the subset known as chemokines (for ), also alter the permeability of the blood-brain barrier or act on neural cells. Thus, particular cytokines can initiate, sustain, or terminate inflammatory disease processes. Proinflammatory cytokines and other secretory products of immune cells are proposed in several neurological diseases—including MS—to be toxic to neurons and oligodendrocytes if they are secreted in sufficiently high concentrations over a sustained period of time. In MS, the initial entry of autoreactive T cells into the CNS is thought to trigger the local production of cytokines and chemokines, which in turn begins the inflammatory process and enhances the permeability of the blood-brain barrier. A more permeable blood-brain barrier allows infiltration into the CNS of more immune cells which in turn contribute to the ongoing inflammation. Thus, understanding the roles of cytokines and their temporal sequence of activation is crucial to modifying the course of MS. Much of our present understanding of cytokine action in demyelinating disease comes from studies of animal models, including EAE. A large body of research is being compiled on the expression and possible function of cytokines as pro- and anti-inflammatory mediators in MS. Some studies have used in situ immunocytochemistry and in situ hybridization to visualize gene expression in lesions, whereas others have relied on the activation of inflammatory cells (T cells, B cells, macrophages) in vitro. Much of the research is comparing material from MS patients with or without treatment with immunomodulatory agents, especially glatiramer acetate and beta-interferon. Pro-inflammatory cytokines within active MS lesions have been localized to both infiltrating immune cells and glia. Longitudinal studies have linked clinical exacerbation and remission to high and low expression, respectively, of proinflammatory cytokines, especially TNF-Î³. For example, secretion of TNF-Î³ and cell adhesion molecules by inflammatory cells is upregulated immediately prior to relapse. Yet, not all findings could be verified in all patient groups studied. Understanding of cytokines and their diverse roles throughout the course of disease, although still incomplete, has nevertheless spawned new treatments. One explanation for the success of glatiramer acetate and beta-interferon relates to their control over cytokine expression: they can induce T cells to switch from a pro-inflammatory phenotype (Th1) to an anti-inflammatory phenotype (Th2). T cells that are switched to an anti-inflammatory phenotype release a variety of cytokines, such as IL-10, that reduce inflammation. CNS. CNS tissues were traditionally thought to be exempt from active immune reactivity, but it is now known ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001. Multiple Sclerosis: Current Status and Strategies for the Future. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. that the brain is subject to immune surveillance and can be the site of immune responses. Only activated and not resting T cells can cross the blood-brain barrier and interact with local CNS cells. Local glial cells can be stimulated by proinflammatory cytokines to express immunologically active molecules, such as the major histocompatability complex (MHC) products, cytokines, and chemokines required for local immune responses. Neurons are capable of suppressing immune responses within the CNS. Thus, immune responses are more likely to occur in areas of neuronal degeneration than in intact CNS tissues. Immune reactivity within the CNS must hence be viewed as the balance between the proinflammatory signals contributed by activated T cells and other inflammatory cells entering the brain and the anti-inflammatory signals from functional neurons. Epidemiologists define what causes a disease and what puts an individual at risk of getting this disease. They look for correlations such as whether Caucasians are more likely to have MS than Asians or whether residents of one county are more likely to get MS than residents of another. These correlations lead to hypotheses or working models as to which factors actually cause MS and which are only associated with it. These hypotheses or models can then be tested experimentally. Epidemiological studies have limitations, but for a complex disease like MS, they can rule out some factors and highlight others. They are the first step toward finding a biological mechanism for MS, or possibly a cure. Most epidemiological studies of MS have been observational and retrospective; researchers collected the information (for example, ethnicity, age of onset) from an individual (or from records) that had been diagnosed with MS. Such studies rely on an individual's ability to accurately recall information from years ago, for example, the infections that she or he had before the age of five. Other sources of data, such as death certificates, can contain incorrect information. Despite these shortcomings, a few factors consistently correlate with MS prevalence. Determining how these factors lead to an increased risk of MS has proven more difficult. The risk of MS increases with increasing distance from the equator. In the United States, this is seen as a gradient of risk, with higher risk in northern regions and a lower risk in the south. In Australia, the prevalence of MS increases similarly from lower, subequatorial latitudes to the more southerly latitudes. Studies on migrating populations, although inconclusive, offer tentative support for the hypothesis that environment influences MS risk. Individuals who have moved from a region with one risk level to a region with a higher or lower risk, in general, adopt the risk level of their new home. This is especially true for individuals moving from a low-risk to a high-risk area. Studies carried out in the 1960s and 1970s suggested that this geographical effect had a defined susceptibility period before age 15. Although these data still ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001. Multiple Sclerosis: Current Status and Strategies for the Future. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. appear in the MS literature and have led to several hypotheses about the effects of puberty or early dietary effects on MS risk, the sample numbers are too small to support such a tight cutoff. A later and larger study assayed the effects of migration by comparing location at birth with location at approximately 24 years of age. Although individuals did adopt the risk of their new home, the age values in that study are not precise enough to add to the argument for or against a cutoff. Most recently, a study comparing the prevalence of MS among native-born Australians and Australian immigrants from the United Kingdom (thereby providing a rough control for genetic background) suggests that rather than being established around age 15, environmental risk factors operate over many years and into early adulthood. Although the migrational studies suggest an environmental correlation with MS, the root cause of this latitude effect is unknown. Differences in diet or sunlight have been proposed, but neither has been supported by rigorous studies. Alternatively, the geographical distribution of MS could result from the migration either of a viral agent or of individuals (perhaps originally Scandinavians) who carried a pool of susceptible genes. Ethnicity is another definite risk factor. MS is more prevalent among Caucasians than other groups. In a study of 5,305 U.S. veterans with MS, Caucasian males had twice the risk of MS as African-American males. Other factors can modulate the effect of ethnicity on risk of MS. MS is almost absent among black Africans. African Americans, however, show a low risk of MS; this might be due to genetic mixing with Caucasian Americans or to an environmental effect. MS occurrence among Asians is also quite low. Again, Asian Americans show an intermediate risk for MS between Asians and Caucasian Americans. A discussion of the role of genetics in MS can be found in the next section. When applied to a complex disorder such as MS, conclusions derived from epidemiologic data of this type must be interpreted cautiously because inapparent explanations may be present. For example, a higher-than-expected incidence of MS observed in South Vietnamese immigrants (a low-risk group) residing in France (a moderate-risk area) superficially suggest a modifying role of the environment on MS. However, this immigrant population was in fact racially mixed and contained substantial numbers of individuals with mixed French and Asian ancestry. Thus, the higher-than-expected MS incidence in these immigrants could have been due to either genetic or environmental factors. Neither factor can be ruled out. A similar argument could explain the incidence of MS in West Indian immigrants residing in Great Britain. On the other hand, the increased incidence of MS observed in Japanese-Americans compared to individuals residing in Japan is not easily explained by racial admixture and does support a role of the environment on MS risk. As in other autoimmune diseases, women are much more likely to get MS than men, suggesting that hormonal or genetic factors are involved. The ratio of women to men with MS is about 2:1. Among both sexes, the age of onset for ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001. Multiple Sclerosis: Current Status and Strategies for the Future. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. MS ranges between 10 and 59 years, with the highest incidence occurring among individuals in their mid-20s to early 30s, depending on the population examined. Males tend to have a slightly later mean age of onset than females. This results, at least in part, from an increase in the percentage of males with the primary progressive variant. This form of MS has a later onset than other types and affects approximately 15 percent of patients. The ratio of males to females with primary progressive MS is approximately 1:1. Epidemiological studies have provided conflicting data as to whether an infectious agent (viral or bacterial) either causes or triggers MS. The occurrence of MS epidemics has suggested that an infectious agent might be at work. The two MS epidemics cited most often, one in the Faroe Islands and one in Iceland, were directly preceded by the influx of foreign troops during World War II. Both, however, are open to multiple interpretations. Coincident with the stationing of foreign soldiers, the population of the Faroe Islands received increased medical services and changed its diet. The Icelandic epidemic, on the other hand, began shortly after the arrival of that island's first neurologist. In both cases, the increased prevalence of MS might have resulted from an increased level of detection or a combination of other factors, such as nonspecific immune stimulation resulting from the introduction of a variety of infectious agents into previously unexposed populations. No infectious agent has been associated with either of these MS clusters. Another area of investigation has explored whether environmental factors contribute to the onset of MS or the probability of MS attacks. Some studies suggest that MS attacks are more likely to occur in the spring and fall than in the winter or summer. Such a finding, if true, suggests that a relationship exists between some viral infections and the risk of exacerbations. Many patients with MS are also at heightened risk for urinary tract, pulmonary, or skin infections, yet the relationship between these potentially preventable infections and the course of MS has never been adequately studied. Additional research in this area is needed. Perhaps the most clear-cut epidemiologic link to MS attacks is the effect of pregnancy and the postpartum period. Pregnancy is associated with a decrease in the risk for MS attacks, particularly during the third trimester. The postpartum period is, conversely, associated with a significant increase in risk. An immunosuppressive state in the pregnant mother is created by increased numbers of regulatory T cells (Th2 cells) which, presumably, dampen the autoimmune reaction that produces attacks of MS. The explanation for the increase in attack risk during the postpartum period is less clear but might involve immunostimulation by prolactin, the hormone responsible for milk production. The absence of supporting evidence does not prove that a virus is connected with the disease. Unrelated individuals (in the case of the adoptee and conjugal studies) may differ in their susceptibilities to infectious agents. Researchers have isolated a variety of viruses from individual MS patients, but to ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001. Multiple Sclerosis: Current Status and Strategies for the Future. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. date, no one virus has been isolated from all MS patients examined. It might, however, be the case either that MS is not one single disease or that there are multiple ways to trigger it. Researchers continue to look for causative infectious agents. (See section below on infectious causes of MS for further discussion.) The aggregation of MS in some geographic areas, ethnic populations, or families could be explained by a common environmental exposure, a shared genetic background, or a combination of both environmental and genetic susceptibility. It is likely that in MS, as in other complex disorders, both factors contribute. It is also possible that the relative contributions of environment versus genetics might vary in different situations, depending on the degree to which an individual is genetically susceptible and the specific environmental context. The role of genetic factors in MS is discussed in the next section. MS is not considered a genetic disease in the classic sense because it usually occurs sporadically. However, population and family studies are consistent with a principal pathogenic role for genetic risk factors in MS etiology. This genetic component is indicated primarily by the increased relative risk to siblings of affected individuals compared with the general population. Familial aggregation (Î»s) is measured by estimating the ratio of the prevalence (frequency) in siblings versus the population prevalence of the disease. A Î»s of 1 represents no familial clustering of the trait. For MS, the Î»s is estimated to be between 20 (0.02/0.001) and 40 (0.04/0.001). Half-sibling1 and adoption studies confirm that genetic, and not environmental, factors are responsible for familial aggregation. In addition, twin studies from different populations consistently indicate that a monozygotic twin of an MS patient is at higher risk (25 to 30 percent concordance) for MS than a dizygotic twin (2 to 5 percent), providing additional evidence for a significant but complex genetic etiology. Finally, the frequent occurrence of MS in some ethnic populations (particularly those of northern European origin) compared to others (African and Asian groups), irrespective of geographic location, also provides evidence for a complex genetic etiology. Overall, adoption and family studies suggest that being related to a person with MS is a greater risk factor than living with someone with MS. A simple genetic model for the inheritance of MS is unlikely to be valid. Such a single-gene hypothesis is at odds with concordance data in twin and family studies and with the observed nonlinear decrease in disease risk as the genetic distance from the relative with MS is increased. It is likely that susceptibility is determined by multiple independent genetic loci (polygenic inheritance), each with a relatively modest contribution to overall risk. It is also possible that there are different genetic causes of susceptibility to MS (genetic heterogeneity). Finally, the genes that contribute to MS susceptibility are likely to be normal, common variants (or alleles) of genes rather than obviously defective mutations. ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001. Multiple Sclerosis: Current Status and Strategies for the Future. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. Most individuals who carry such susceptibility genes would have no obvious deleterious consequences. For example, the DR2 gene (described below) is the most important genetic contributor to MS susceptibility identified to date. Approximately half of patients with MS have this gene, but so do 15 to 20 percent of healthy Caucasians. Thus, only approximately 1 in 250 people who have DR2 develop MS. The cumulative action of several susceptibility genes, each with weak effects and limited penetrance, is thought to underlie genetic susceptibility to MS. (Penetrance refers to the likelihood that a person carrying an allele will develop specific manifestations caused by that gene.) The effects of individual susceptibility genes may also be influenced by interactions with other genes and by specific environmental exposures. Locus heterogeneity is also likely, meaning that there are different susceptibility genes in different MS patients. The possibility that MS is a heterogeneous disease with different causes or pathological processes adds an additional level of complexity to the analysis. In addition to MS, similar issues are present in other autoimmune diseases such as diabetes mellitus that are genetically complex, and common research tools will be needed to decipher specific disease genes in these different conditions. The genetic region most clearly associated with MS susceptibility is the major histocompatibility complex (MHC, or HLA [human leukocyte antigen] in humans) locus on the short arm of chromosome 6 (6p21) (). This association has been seen in different population studies that have relied primarily on sporadic patients. Formal genetic linkage to 6p has also been found in several recent whole-genome scans of multiple affected MS families. Many of the MHC genes are extraordinarily variable or polymorphic, reflecting the importance of genetic variation of these critical antigen-presenting molecules in the maintenance of a heterozygous advantage and the need to effectively present a diverse array of antigens if immune homeostasis is to be maintained. Immune homeostasis refers to the capacity of the immune system to respond appropriately to a diverse number of infectious pathogens and tumors without initiating unhealthy responses against self-constituents (auto- The major histocompatibility complex is a chromosomal region that contains more than 100 genes, many of which make proteins involved in the immune system. It is named for the role it plays in rejecting tissue transplants ( means tissue). In humans, this region resides on chromosome 6 and is called the human leukocyte antigen gene complex. The terminology is slightly confusing because ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001. Multiple Sclerosis: Current Status and Strategies for the Future. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. MHC and HLA also refer to the proteins that some of these genes make. In this report, the term “MHC molecules” is used to indicate the proteins. The role of the immune system is to differentiate between self and non-self. This allows it to tell the difference between, for example, muscle tissue (self) and an invading virus (non-self) and to respond appropriately. To do this, the immune system relies on several different proteins that specifically bind antigens. This process is analogous to a lock and key. The “lock” is an antibody, a T-cell receptor, or an MHC molecule. The “key” is an antigen, which can be a carbohydrate, lipid, nucleic acid, or protein—anything that binds specifically to a component of the immune system. This discussion focuses on T-cell receptors and MHC molecules. T-cell receptors sit on the surface of T cells and bind to antigens outside the cell. (In the case of T-cell receptors and MHC molecules, antigens are small protein fragments.) Binding to an antigen signals the T cell either to die, to do nothing, or to become active. The signal context, such as whether the antigen is self or non-self, determines which of these signals is relayed. However the T cell cannot bind the antigen alone. It needs the help of an MHC molecule. MHC molecules sit on the surface of other cells. The MHC molecule, like two outstretched arms, holds onto an antigen and presents it to a T-cell receptor. There are two major classes of MHC molecules. MHC I molecules, which are expressed on most cell types, present antigens to CD8+ T cells. MHC II molecules, which are expressed on special antigen presenting cells (APCs), present antigens to CD4+ T cells. In humans, there are three main class I molecules, HLA-A, HLA-B, and HLA-C, and three main class II molecules, HLA-DP, HLA-DQ, HLA-DR. Each arm of the MHC molecule is made up of a separate protein. In the case of MHC I molecules, there is an Î±-chain (A, B, or C) that pairs with the protein b2microglobulin. An MHC II molecule is made up of an Î±-chain and a Î²-chain (for example, DP-Î± and DP-Î²), but the story becomes more complex. Each MHC molecule can bind many but not all of the thousands of antigens that confront the immune system. The immune system relies on diversity among the MHC proteins to help stack the odds in its favor. The gene for each MHC protein chain comes in different varieties, or alleles. One of the MHC Î²-chains has more than 150 alleles. Each of these alleles produces a slightly different protein. The proteins vary just enough that although they all function as MHC proteins, they can bind different antigens. Any one person will have two alleles, at most, for a particular MHC protein (there are two copies of each gene in human cells), but across a population of individuals, this variety becomes more important. For example, in Gambia, West Africa, 25 percent of HLA-B genes are the HLA-B53 allele, compared to less than 1 percent in Europe. HLA-B53 is very effective at presenting an antigen from the parasite that causes malaria to CD8+ T cells. Researchers hypothesize that because HLA-B53 can protect people from the most severe forms of malaria, it is more prevalent in Gambia. Having a particular MHC allele can also be a disadvantage, as researchers have shown in the case of HLA-DR2 and MS. (HLA-DR2 actually designates both a specific DR-a chain allele and a DR-b chain allele.) Scientists still do not understand how HLA-DR2 predisposes individuals to MS, but this might have to do with the MHC molecule's ability to present specific antigens (for example, a fragment of myelin basic protein) to T cells.

Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. immune responses). In Caucasian MS populations of northern European descent, the critical MS-associated genetic region is thought to reside near the class II locus and is comprised of a group of genes with specific polymorphisms (alleles) that tend to occur in certain fixed combinations, termed haplotypes. In molecular terms, the “DR2” haplotype is designated as HLA-DRB1*1501, DQA1*0102, DQB1*0602. DR molecules are comprised of alpha and beta chains (encoded by A and B genes, respectively), and the polymorphisms are predominantly present in the beta chain. Of the more than 100 beta-chain sequence variations identified in humans, only one (1501, also designated as DR2) is associated with MS. How can the DR2 association with MS be explained? The DR2 molecule itself may have a propensity to bind peptide antigens of myelin and stimulate disease-inducing T cells. DR2 is known to bind with high affinity to a region of MBP (spanning amino acids 89-98) thought to be “immunodominant” in humans. X-ray crystallography of the DR2-MBP peptide complex revealed that the DR2 molecule contains a distinctive hydrophobic pocket in its antigen-binding region, created by a unique alanine residue at the B71 position into which glutamic acid at position 93 of MBP is tightly bound, anchoring the MBP-DR2 complex. In a larger sense, the structure of the antigen-binding domain of DR2 molecules likely facilitates binding of many peptides containing certain amino acid residues, specifically aromatic amino acids. Glatiramer acetate (copolymer 1), a currently available disease-modifying therapy for MS, is a random synthetic protein composed of four amino acids, including tyrosine. The tyrosine residues of processed copolymer peptides likely also bind to the hydrophobic pocket of DR2, perhaps interfering with presentation of this key MBP peptide to encephalitogenic T cells. It is surprising that no data exist on the interaction of DR2 and the response to glatiramer acetate in MS. Another possibility is that the DR2 molecule does not itself predispose to MS but that another nearby gene (perhaps another HLA gene such as DQ) is responsible. DR2 is also linked to other diseases. Besides MS, narcolepsy is the disease most strongly linked to DR2. In various studies, the HLA region has been estimated to confer somewhere between 10 percent and half of the inheritability of MS. To date, no other genes of major effect have been identified in genomic screens. Several studies appear to demonstrate that a deletion mutation in the CCR5 chemokine receptor gene (a coreceptor for HIV) on chromosome 3 confers a later age of onset or a more benign course of MS; this mutation is also associated with protection against HIV. This is particularly important because the expression of CCR5, which is increased in MS brain lesions, is thought to attract inflammatory cells into tissue. Another locus on chromosome 19q22 near apolipoprotein C1 has been linked to MS in several genomic screens, but the estimated Î»s is only 1.4. A polymorphism near the gene for myelin basic protein on chromosome 21 was reported to be linked to MS in a family from Finland, but not in other populations. Some studies have suggested linkages or ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001. Multiple Sclerosis: Current Status and Strategies for the Future. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. associations with the TCR beta-chain locus on chromosome 7, the immunoglobulin heavy-chain locus on chromosome 14, and a region on chromosome 5, but others have not found similar linkages. The inability to confirm some genetic regions as containing MS susceptibility genes might reflect the small genetic contribution of these putative genes or genetic heterogeneity; alternatively, the original claim might have been spurious. As noted above, it is likely that an additive model consisting of multiple independent genes, each with small effects, explains the non-MHC genetic contributions to MS. It should be emphasized, however, that the identification of specific genes that have even very minor genetic effects on MS can have an enormous payoff, both in terms of helping to decipher the underlying biology of MS and in pointing to new potential treatments. For example, the genetic studies discussed earlier that identified a role for the CCR5 chemokine receptor suggest that therapies aimed at this receptor could be investigated in people with MS. Perhaps the strongest indication that MS is a heterogeneous disorder comes from HLA studies showing an absence of DR2 association in particular ethnic groups or perhaps in some clinical variants. In Japanese patients, one form of MS (“Western type”) is characterized by disseminated CNS involvement and is associated with the DR2 haplotype. In contrast, a more restricted form of MS in which optic nerve and/or spinal cord involvement predominate (“Asian MS”) is not associated with DR2. Lesions in the non-DR2-associated condition are frequently more severe and necrotizing than in the disseminated form. In one report, the Asian MS form was genetically associated with an HLA gene named DP (the DPB1*0501 allele). Another area of uncertainty is the strength of the association between primary progressive MS (PPMS) and DR2. A number of (relatively) small studies failed to show any association between PPMS and DR2, although a recent larger study from northern Ireland appeared to show an association; it is possible that PPMS represents more than one underlying disorder. Evidence for genetic heterogeneity is not limited to case-control HLA association studies but is also derived from formal linkage studies. Analysis of the MHC locus in an American multiple affected member MS data set confirmed the significant genetic linkage to this region (lod score of 4.60), and the specific association with the DR2 allele; however 25 percent of the families that were DR2 negative showed no linkage to the HLA region on 6p21. This indicated most likely the presence of locus heterogeneity in familial MS in Caucasians. A related *Lod scores are based on the ogarithm of the ds of linkage between two genes. A score of 3 or more is considered evidence of a genetic linkage between a known gene (or gene marker) and another unknown gene that underlies a trait (such as MS). That information thus indicates that the trait has a genetic basis and localizes the gene to a specific chromosomal region. ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001. Multiple Sclerosis: Current Status and Strategies for the Future. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. observation in MS-prone Caucasian families is that the phenotypic expression of MS aggregates within families in some cases, suggesting that some clinical manifestations of MS are influenced by an individual's genetic background. The extent to which distinct clinical forms of MS are associated with different susceptibility genes, as may be the case in EAE (see discussion of animal models), is not known. Also unknown is whether specific genes interact with certain causative agents or triggers. Genetic studies have the potential to answer these questions, particularly when the information is analyzed in combination with epidemiologic, clinical, and neuroimaging data. There are several human and animal diseases of known etiology or pathogenesis that resemble either the clinical or the pathological features of MS (). Animal diseases that resemble MS are discussed under animal models. CNS demyelinating diseases include those mediated by immune responses, infection, and toxins, as well as inherited disorders. Infectious agents can induce direct injury of oligodendrocytes and their myelin membranes, as well as indirect injury via the immune system. A variety of toxins, such as diphtheria, lysolecithin, cuprizone, and ethidium bromide, have been associated with demyelinating lesions. Many of these toxins induce lysis of the oligodendrocyte, with demyelination as a secondary effect. In addition, nutritional deprivation can be associated with demyelination in the central and peripheral nervous system. Immune-Mediated and Virus-Induced CNS Demyelinating Diseases Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM), also known as post vaccination encephalomyelitis, occurs as a consequence of vaccination with neural antigens. EAE, the most widely used animal model of MS, is the animal counterpart of this human disease. ADEM is characterized pathologically by widespread perivenular inflammation and demyelination. The uniformity of lesions differs from the multi-age lesions found in even the most acute case of MS. Post vaccination immune-mediated damage can also affect the peripheral nervous system. Since there is no standard laboratory-based test to diagnose the human disorder, the most reliable descriptions of the clinical spectrum of the disease are derived from collections of cases in which epidemiologic and statistical studies support the association of a triggering stimulus and disease. Such criteria are best met by cases associated with immunization with CNS tissue containing vaccines, for example, original Pasteur rabies vaccine. This vaccine complication can occur at all ages. A clinical hallmark of the rabies vaccine-associated form of ADEM is its uniphasic course evolving over days to several weeks. ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001. Multiple Sclerosis: Current Status and Strategies for the Future. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. CNS Demyelinating Diseases That Resemble MS ADEM is characterized pathologically by widespread perivenular inflammation and demyelination. Multifocal CNS lesions can occur as a component of an array of systemic collagen vascular disorders including systemic lupus eryhemtosus and polyarteritis nodosa. The CNS manifestations may be the presenting feature. The peripheral nervous system is also frequently involved. PML is caused by the JC virus, which infects and destroys oligodendrocytes with minimal associated immune response. It typically occurs in immunosuppressed or immunocompromised individuals and is common in AIDS. The disease can feature a subacute progressive or relapsing clinical course. The imaging and pathologic features can be distinguished from classical MS. HTLV-1 (human T-cell lymphotropic virus type I) infection is sometimes associated with a neurological syndrome called HTLV-1-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP). Patients with HAM/TSP have a progressive myelopathy, usually with spastic paraparesis, sensory disturbance, bladder dysfunction, and occasionally, optic neuritis. These inherited disorders are characterized by specific gene defects that result in either inadequate formation or excess breakdown of myelin. There may be a prominent inflammatory response in the region of myelin breakdown, but this is considered to be secondary to tissue breakdown. To date, therapeutic attempts with immunomodulatory agents in the leukodystrophies, specifically, adrenoleukodystrophy, have been ineffective. Toxic optic neuropathy, subacute myelo-optic neuropathy (SMON) Outbreaks of toxic optic neuropathy and SMON have been described in Cuba and in Japan.11,12,99 Sporadic cases of toxic optic neuropathy likely account for the disorder tobacco-alcohol amblyopia. Conversely, one need consider whether deficiency syndromes could underlie development of demyelinating syndromes; deficiency of vitamin B12, a cofactor in myelin formation, has also been implicated.

Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. ADEM, or postinfectious encephalomyelitis, has been implicated as a consequence of a wide array of viral infections, although for many, the epidemiologic data are not strong enough to support a causal link. Measles virus epidemics have, however, been convincingly linked to ADEM. Postinfectious encephalomyelitis (PIE) is thought to be autoimmune in nature rather than secondary to a direct virus injury for the following reasons: (1) encephalitis appears after the rash clears; (2) there is generally little or no evidence of infectious virus or viral genome in the CNS at the time of the demyelinating disease; and (3) there is evidence of increased reactivity against myelin antigens during the demyelinating disease. Postinfectious encephalomyelitis is generally uniphasic. Immune system disturbances, which are known to occur following measles virus infection, might underlie the immunopathological response of post-infectious encephalomyelitis. A new direction for studies of PIE involves the possibility of establishing a model for this disease in transgenic mice that express the CD46 measles virus receptor. Molecular cross-reactivity, or molecular mimicry, has been demonstrated between myelin antigens and an array of viruses. Homologous sequences from viruses have been used to induce EAE (for example, hepatitis virus antigens). The extent of T-cell receptor degeneracy (meaning that the same receptor can respond to a wide sequence of peptides) and T-cell receptor heterogeneity in humans suggests that a wide array of exogenous agents could induce such a disease mechanism. As in MS, the putative infectious trigger could be different in individual MS patients depending on their immunogenetic makeup and the status of their immune system at the time of infection. A remaining challenge in MS is to determine whether any infectious agents detected in the CNS of such cases also persist in the CNS without causing harm or whether they are responsible for generating a pathogenic immune response. ADEM cases are usually sporadic, and it is sometimes difficult to identify the initiating factor. Relapsing cases of ADEM have been described, especially in younger-age patients. For some cases, characteristic pathologic material has been available. Similarly, the EAE model can be manipulated to produce a relapsing chronic disorder by selecting animals with specific immunogenetic backgrounds and timing their immunizations so that the underlying systemic immune response is amplified or the blood-brain barrier is altered. Such variables could also determine the nature of the response of humans when they are exposed to potential disease-inducing antigens. JC virus, a member of the papovavirus family, is a common pathogen in humans, although the *JC refers to the initials of the individual from whom the virus was isolated in 1970. ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001. Multiple Sclerosis: Current Status and Strategies for the Future. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. primary disease caused by this virus is not characterized. Common symptoms include hemiparesis, aphasia, focal seizures, and visual disturbances. JC virus is thought to reactivate in immunosuppressed hosts, especially individuals with AIDS, producing the opportunistic infection PML. The disease involves a progressive CNS syndrome with symptoms and signs that suggest white matter involvement. Demyelination is usually most prominent in the occipital lobes of the cerebral hemispheres. The histopathology is characterized by the presence of oligodendrocytes with intranuclear inclusion bodies filled with papovavirus infectious particles, indicating that this disease involves a direct, lytic infection of the oligodendrocyte; that is, the oligodendrocyte is broken apart after being infected with the virus. Enlarged astrocytes are also seen, suggesting that the JC virus can transform these cells. Demyelination is a result of the direct oligodendrocyte infection by JC virus. Thus, in PML the immune response is considered to be protective rather than pathogenic. This retrovirus is common in the tropics as well as Japan, and is usually associated with asymptomatic disease. HTLV-1 infection is infrequently associated with a T-cell leukemia or lymphoma or a neurological syndrome called HTLV-1-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP). Patients with HAM/TSP have a progressive myelopathy usually with spastic paraparesis, sensory disturbance, bladder dysfunction, and occasionally, optic neuritis. The CSF generally shows a lymphocytic pleocytosis with elevated IgG and oligoclonal IgG bands directed against HTLV-1. Necrotizing lesions with inflammation in the white matter are present in the spinal cord. HAM/TSP can resemble MS clinically. In fact, a case of HAM/TSP might be diagnosed as MS if it were not for the presence of HTLV-1 antibody and the observation that the HTLV-1 genome can be detected in the CNS. The pathogenesis of HAM/TSP remains unclear. There are numerous CD8+ T cells that recognize the virus, suggesting that this immune response might foster white matter disease. Infected glial cells are a possible source of inflammatory pathogenic cytokines and might also be the target for these cytolytic T cells. In addition, there is some evidence that molecular mimicry plays a role in disease pathogenesis. Host genetic factors, for example, HLA type, might also be important in determining susceptibility to HAM/TSP after infection. It has not been proven that MS is caused by an infectious agent, but various data, including the inflammatory nature of the disease, epidemiological studies, and a heightened immune response against several pathogens, suggest an infectious etiology (reviewed in 1998 by Kastrukoff et al.). Demyelinating diseases that clinically and pathologically resemble MS can be caused by viral agents or ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001. Multiple Sclerosis: Current Status and Strategies for the Future. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. Koch’s Postulate on Causation of Disease by a Pathogen The pathogen is always present in pathologically affected tissue. It would be rare to consistently isolate a pathogen from all cases of the disease that it causes because of shortcomings in isolation procedures. The pathogen is not present in tissues from controls. Pathogens can have a variety of clinical manifestations, from asymptomatic disease to varied diseases. Host restriction may prevent experimental transmission. immunopathological responses (). Infectious agents might be able to cause demyelination either directly, as a result of oligodendrocyte lysis, or indirectly, by means of an immunopathological response. Demyelination mediated by an immunopathological response can occur by a number of mechanisms. For example, the infectious agent can induce a pathogenic cross-reactive immune response (molecular mimicry), or the release of myelin antigens can stimulate an immune response that is directed against white matter antigens and becomes more broad over time (epitope spreading). (See for a summary of autoimmunity and disease.) There are clear limitations to using classical criteria to implicate a pathogen isolated in MS as a causal agent for the disease, as shown in . These issues make it especially difficult to establish the significance of a positive isolation from tissues of a patient with MS. However, all cases in which an infectious agent causes a disease will clearly not fit standard criteria, and individualization of the requirements is sometimes necessary. Because of these limitations, it is prudent to consider criteria that may be more appropriate and realistic. One could consider the following additional guidelines in analyzing disease causation by a pathogen: consistent transmission or isolation of the pathogen; cure or effective treatment of the disease following elimination of the pathogen; absence of the disease in geographic regions where the pathogen is not present. It may also be appropriate to consider particular molecular signatures related either to the genes of the pathogen or to the transcription expression profile associated with a particular pathogen. Many pathogens have been implicated over the years as etiological agents in MS (). ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001. Multiple Sclerosis: Current Status and Strategies for the Future. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. Agents Isolated or Implicated in the Etiology of MS Some of these claims have been doubted for the following reasons: contamination (for example, spirochete), artifacts of isolation methods (for example, simian cytomegalovirus), and normal flora (for example, herpes simplex-1 [HSV-1]). Although some of these agents are clearly capable of inducing a CNS demyelinating syndrome that resembles MS, it remains uncertain whether particular cases in which a pathogen is isolated represent a rare MS-like case or whether the pathogen may actually be a common cause of MS. There are various possible explanations of why so many pathogens have been isolated in MS but no single pathogen has been consistently observed. First, there might be a variety of pathogens that can independently cause MS (i.e., the disease is multifactorial), perhaps inducing heterogeneous forms of the disease. Second, MS might not be an infectious disease. The isolations of different pathogens might all be artifactual or related to rare events associated with a particular pathogen. Third, the relationship of the pathogen to MS might be a relatively minor one, possibly through interactions with genetic factors. Finally, the true pathogen might not yet have been identified. Thus far, there is inadequate evidence to either accept or reject suggestions that any particular pathogen is causally related to MS. A variety of members of the herpes group of viruses (for example, simian cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, HSV-1, and human herpesvirus-6 [HHV-6]) have been implicated in the etiology of MS. Members of this group of viruses remain attractive candidates as etiologic agents in MS since they are common pathogens that are known to persist and reactivate from a latent stage (and therefore could trigger the attacks and remissions seen in MS) and in some cases can induce focal demyelination in animals (see discussion of animal models of virus-induced demyelination). The most recent herpesvirus candidate to generate attention is HHV-6. HHV-6, a common pathogen, is the cause of the childhood disease, roseola (exanthem subitem). This virus is associated with febrile seizures in children, can invade the CNS, and can persist in peripheral blood mononuclear cells and the spinal fluid. In some cases, HHV-6 induces an MS-like disease, which raises the issue ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001. Multiple Sclerosis: Current Status and Strategies for the Future. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. of its broader involvement in MS. Some recent studies of HHV-6 have found no or rare evidence of HHV-6 genome in MS CSF (as well as little, if any, evidence of genome from several other members of the herpesvirus group). One recent study reported that there was an increased incidence of HHV-6 (as well as HSV and varicella-zoster virus) genome in CNS tissue from MS cases compared to tissues from controls; however, the differences were not statistically significant (see Sanders). Some investigators have argued that the cell type that is infected by HHV-6 differs in MS CNS compared to controls and, therefore, that the virus plays a role in the pathogenesis of MS. The interpretation of HHV-6 studies may be complicated because HHV-6 infection and the localization of the virus may be altered secondary to inflammation associated with MS or to immunosuppressive treatment of MS patients; therefore, a change in localization of HHV-6 in MS CNS compared to control CNS may be unrelated to any pathogenic role of HHV-6 in MS. Although HHV-6 may not induce the white matter lesions of MS, it remains a possibility that HHV-6 contributes to the demyelination seen in some cases of MS. The recent identification of CD46 as a cellular receptor for HHV-6 and the availability of transgenic mice that carry CD46 provide an opportunity to develop an experimental model of HHV-6-induced CNS disease pathogenesis. A recent study found that CSF from MS patients was culture-positive for and PCR (polymerase chain reaction)-positive for this agent more commonly than CSF from patients with other neurological disease. In addition, there was evidence of increased antibody against chlamydia in MS CSF, as well as evidence that MS CSF oligoclonal IgG bands were absorbed by chlamydia antigens. This work clearly needs confirmation. Members of the public awaiting cures for specific diseases often express impatience with the fact that most research on the biological basis of disease is based on animal studies, complaining that the time and money spent on animal studies would be better invested in clinical trials. However, animal studies are not simply interchangeable with clinical studies. Ultimately, every biologically active substance exerts its effects at the cellular and molecular levels, and the evidence has shown that this is remarkably consistent among mammals, even those as different in body and mind as rats and humans. Thus, animals can serve as models for basic biological processes in humans and can provide information about how drugs work that would not be obtainable in clinical studies. Animal models in which both spontaneous and induced disease occur have contributed greatly to our knowledge of the pathogenesis of diseases, and in the future, they will be increasingly used to aid in the assessment of various treatment modalities. A variety of animal models have been used to study the pathogenesis and experimental treatment of diseases that share features with MS (). ""2 Clinical and Biological Features.""

Immunization of mice, rats, or primates with myelin proteins (MBP, MOG, PLP) or other autoantigens (PLP). CREAE is a chronic, relapsing type of EAE In contrast to T cells, there is no technology available to routinely clone autoantigen specific B cells. As an alternative approach, B-cell “monoclonal” mice have recently been generated by gene replacement transgenesis Genetic engineering is used to produce animals that express particular human genes hypothesized to be involved in MS A variety of viruses can induce CNS demyelination, including Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus, mouse hepatitis virus, and herpes simplex virus Most of our present knowledge of myelin-specific autoimmunity and, more generally, of immune reactivity within the CNS emanates from experimental animal models. It should, however, be noted that there is a diversity of distinct models, defined by the animal species, the target autoantigen, and the mode of induction. Three basic types of animal models have been developed to understand the disease mechanisms underlying MS: EAE, virus-induced demyelination, and genetically modified animals. EAE models have served, in many respects, as the prototype for current thinking on the pathogenesis of MS. This paralytic disease is characterized by the presence of inflammation and demyelination in the CNS. It is an autoimmune syndrome induced in different susceptible strains and species, generally by intradermal immunization with myelin antigens (natural or synthetic) or by adoptive transfer of T lymphocytes reactive against myelin proteins. The antigens capable of inducing EAE vary depending upon the strain and species of animal, the adjuvants employed, and perhaps also the history of environmental exposures experienced by the animal. EAE should be considered not as a single model but rather as a heterogeneous family of related disorders. Each of the EAE variants reflects different aspects of human MS, and conversely, there is no one EAE model that represents the entire complexity of MS (). As is the case in MS, susceptibilities to EAE are determined as complex genetic traits. In both disorders, the most evident susceptibility locus resides within the HLA locus. Also in both disorders, locus heterogeneity is extensive (i.e., different loci and genes). Different genes can act at specific stages of the ""2 Clinical and Biological Features.""

Comparison Between Multiple Sclerosis and EAE SOURCE: Larry Steinman, presentation to the committee, November 17, 1999. EAE or Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV) disease process, influencing severity, recovery, susceptibility to relapse, remyelination, and other elements of the phenotype. Knowledge of the extensive heterogeneity in disease susceptibility and modifier genes in these MS models should provide targets for study in human MS. Even within genetically identical littermates, the immune response following immunization with whole myelin is heterogeneous, with different antigenic targets dominating in different individuals. When groups of genetically identical animals are housed in different facilities, the resulting clinical syndromes can be markedly different, presumably reflecting the effects of different individual microenvironments. Studies of EAE established that the pathogenic agents of the disease are CD4+ T cells, which produce cytokines of the proinflammatory Th1 pattern (IFN-Î³ and TNF-Î±, but no IL-4) upon stimulation. The precursors of these T cells are contained within the normal immune repertoire, but they unfold their pathogenic potential only on activation, by either specific antigens, microbial superantigens, or mitogens. In EAE induced in the Lewis rat strain (and H-2 mice) by immunization ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001. Multiple Sclerosis: Current Status and Strategies for the Future. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. with MBP, the encephalitogenic T cells recognize almost exclusively single, circumscript epitope segments of the MBP in the molecular context of MHC class II (clonal dominance). This dominance can be gradually lost over time, a phenomenon referred to as determinant spreading. Furthermore, in these models, the T-cell receptor for most autoreactive T cells is based on a highly simplified repertoire of structural genes, such as the VÎ²8.2 gene for the TCR Î²-chain. These unusual features of antigen recognition have raised hopes with regard to immunospecific therapies. Unfortunately, however, they seem to be limited to only a few experimental models. Most EAE models, as well as the human myelin-specific T cells, do not show either striking epitope dominance or T-cell receptor biases. To date, attempts to identify possible functions of CNS-specific T-cell classes distinct from CD4+ T cells have not led to consistent pictures. Evidence from T-cell transfer models and TCR transgenic mice suggests that CD8+ T cells might help control and limit an ongoing CD4+ dependent EAE process. Most acute EAE models show profuse inflammatory CNS reactions with a conspicuous absence of large-scale demyelination, implying that MS-like demyelination is not caused directly by myelin-specific T cells but must be brought about by other mechanisms. B cells are the best-characterized effectors of this function. Large, confluent inflammatory demyelinated lesions can be produced in rats by transferring encephalitogenic T cells along with a monoclonal antibody against myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein. The T cells cause inflammation, thereby opening the blood-brain barrier to the autoantibodies, which enter the CNS where they bind to myelin and destroy it via complement- or phagocyte-dependent mechanisms. “Simple” immunization of rodents with MOG can also produce the same result. In addition to producing humoral autoantibodies, brain-specific B cells target and present myelin antigens to specific T cells. During this presentation process, the B cells may stimulate the activation of specific T cells, with a possible tendency to shift them from Th1 (pro-inflammatory) to Th2 cytokine (anti-inflammatory) profiles. The roles of autoreactive B cells in the pathogenesis of EAE are incompletely understood, mostly because of technical shortcomings. In contrast to T cells, there is no technology available to routinely clone autoantigen-specific B cells. As an alternative approach, B-cell “monoclonal” mice have recently been generated by gene replacement transgenesis. The germline repertoire of immunoglobulin genes in these mice has been replaced by the mature, rearranged gene encoding a MOG-specific autoantibody. Most, if not all, of the B cells in these mice express immunoglobulin receptors that are autoreactive to MOG. The mice spontaneously produce high titers of anti-MOG autoantibodies in their blood. There is no natural, spontaneous animal model resembling MS. The immunological conditions leading to relapses ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001. Multiple Sclerosis: Current Status and Strategies for the Future. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. and remissions of inflammatory demyelinating disease over time are most commonly examined in chronic relapsing versions of EAE. These episodic courses depend on the modes of immunization as well as on genetic factors innate to the host animals. Although the conditions that trigger relapses in CREAE models are not yet well understood, models are expected to provide clues to these essential aspects of MS, especially when refined by the use of suitable transgenic animals. It has recently been shown that a chronic relapsing EAE in a primate, the common marmoset, is more like MS than other EAE models. This form of EAE, induced in marmosets by immunization with MOG, produces lesions that are almost indistinguishable from fresh, acute human MS plaques. In both the human disease and this animal model, a zone of myelin destruction is seen at the margins of lesions; within the lesions, myelin sheaths are replaced by vesiculated membranous elements. MOG-specific antibodies, thought to be related to the deposition of antigen-specific antibody, are present over the vesiculated myelin. In both settings, oligodendrocytes were spared, and there was some evidence of myelin repair. Axonal pathology, however, was more conspicuous in MS cases than in this animal model. It has been suggested that processes mediated by T-cells initiate the demyelinating lesions and that other effector mechanisms are the principal offenders in damaging the myelin sheath. Mechanisms that initiate the lesion might be immunologically distinct from those that propagate disease. Antibodies might play an important role in these processes. The marmoset EAE model has also confirmed the encephalitogenic potential of autoreactive T-cell clones, whose precursors are preformed in the healthy immune repertoire. At the same time, however, these experiments also show that all T-cell clones are not equally autoaggressive. Experimental animal models of MS are based almost exclusively on the use of rodents, mostly rats and mice. Unfortunately, rodent and human immune systems differ to such a large degree that not all observations made in rodent EAE can be directly translated to human MS. An important disadvantage of animal models is that they do not necessarily mirror the cellular or molecular pathology of MS. Some types of EAE, for example, produce brisk demyelination, whereas others produce little demyelination. Which is the best model? Since these features of MS are not yet fully understood, it is dificult to know how faithfully any given animal model of MS illustrates the human disease. In addition, these models are not very tractable for studies on the electrophysiology and biophysics of neuronal function, a serious limitation in a disease such as MS in which symptoms and signs arise from impaired nerve function. Powerful research methods are now available for studying the physiology and ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001. Multiple Sclerosis: Current Status and Strategies for the Future. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. biophysics of normal or injured nerve cells. These methods permit neuroscientists to study electrical signaling in both normal and injured neurons, but they require that these nerve cells, with reproducible abnormalities, be reproducibly located, within fractions of a millimeter, in specific parts of the nervous system so that they can be studied. In MS and in most currently available animal models, the pathology is patchy, and the location of demyelinated and injured neurons varies from case to case. For the electrophysiologist who studies neuronal signaling by precisely placing tiny microelectrodes within neurons, studying the physiology of demyelinated or otherwise injured neurons when their location varies from animal to animal is, indeed, a challenge. A model in which focal demyelination, or axonal injury, can be produced at specific locations that are consistent from animal to animal would be a great improvement. Viruses can cause demyelination in several ways, the most straightforward of which is for viruses to lyse, or break open, oligodendrocytes, the myelinproducing cells. In some cases, however, the immune system is also involved. The mechanism by which virus-induced immune-mediated demyelination is carried out is not clear, but roles for molecular mimicry, bystander damage, and superantigen activation of T cells have all been proposed (see ). The best developed models of virus-induced demyelination are those caused by certain strains of TMEV and the mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) (reviewed in Kastrukoff et al.). Probably the most fruitful of the remaining models are those of semliki forest virus (SFV) and herpes simplex virus (HSV) (). The advantages of SFV are its small, simple genome and ease of mutagenesis. Although the HSV genome is large and complex, the wealth of molecular information related to this virus and the ability to manipulate the viral genome make it an attractive model system, as well. The DA strain of TMEV produces an inflammatory demyelinating disease of the spinal cord with lesions that resemble MS. A variety of experimental studies of TMEV-induced demyelination suggest that as in MS, the immune system fosters demyelination. The inflammatory, demyelinating, and multifocal lesions of TMEV infection are mediated at least in part by T cells directed against viral antigens. The inflammatory response directly contributes to tissue damage in this MS-like model, since susceptibility is determined in part by immune response genes and immunosuppression abrogates demyelination. One to two weeks after inoculation with the DA virus, there is a brisk inflammatory response in the brain with high levels of virus. This is generally a subclinical process since the mouse usually appears normal. After three weeks, the brain pathology virtually disappears, but mice develop a progressive spastic para- ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001.

Animal Viruses That Induce Demyelination The TO subgroup strains of TMEV produces an inflammatory demyelinating disease of the spinal cord with lesions that resemble MS. A variety of experimental studies of TMEV-induced demyelination suggest that the immune system fosters the white matter disease. The many different strains of MHV lead to a plethora of different diseases, including hepatitis, as well respiratory CNS disorders. The presence and extent of demyelination depend on the viral genotype, dosage, and route of inoculation, as well as the strain, age, and immune status of the infected mouse. Virus persists in glial cells of demyelinated mice. Experimental infection of mice and rats with specific strains of SFV leads to demyelination; other strains induce an encephalomyelitis. Demyelination depends on the specific strain of virus, the mouse strain, and the immune status of the host. Virus persists in the central nervous system. The role of the immune system in the demyelinating disease remains unclear. Many strains of HSV produce a diffuse encephalitis in mice, but certain virus strains induce an inflammatory demyelinating disease in particular strains. Other strains of mice have multifocal demyelination that can relapse or persist in varied areas of the brain. The role of the immune system in this model is unclear but appears to contribute to the destruction of CNS tissue. Maedi visna is found only in sheep. There is no experimental rodent model of maedi visna infection, and therefore one needs to investigate sheep. The absence of markers for the sheep's immune system and of genetically modified sheep with knockouts of different arms of the immune system are clear limitations of the maedi visna model. The pathology of disease varies from an encephalomyelitis to a pure inflammatory demyelination that resembles MS.37 Virus persists during the disease with a restricted expression in microglial cells. It remains unclear whether demyelination is a result of direct viral lysis or is mediated by the immune response. CDV produces a variety of CNS diseases in dogs, including acute and chronic encephalitis and demyelinating disease. Virus persists in the chronic disease and appears to be present in oligodendrocytes in some cases. Work with this model has been limited since dogs are required as the host. The pathogenesis of the demyelinating disease remains unclear. paresis associated with an inflammatory demyelinating disease of the spinal cord. Although the titers of DA virus decrease over the first few weeks, virus persists in the central nervous system for the life of the mouse. The persistent virus is said to have a restricted, or incomplete, expression. In other words, viral genome is present, but the levels of infectious virus are low, with relatively little viral capsid ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001. Multiple Sclerosis: Current Status and Strategies for the Future. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. protein produced. (The capsid is the protein shell surrounding the viral DNA or RNA and is generally required for viral infectivity.) Advantages of the TMEV model include the simplicity of its genome, the detailed structural information about the virus, the ease with which it can be genetically manipulated, and finally, the extensive knowledge about the genes and immune system of mice, the natural host of TMEV (see .). Despite all that is known about TMEV and despite the ease in manipulating this simple virus, the pathogenesis of the demyelinating disease is not yet fully understood. It is clear that viral persistence in the oligodendrocytes and microglia is critical to the development of TMEV-induced demyelination; that is, an ongoing virus infection is always associated with the white matter disease. It is also clear that the immune system contributes to the late demyelinating disease, but exactly how remains poorly understood. Part of the difficulty in dissecting the role of the immune system in the pathogenesis of TMEV (as well as some of the other animal models of virus-induced demyelination) is that it changes over time. Early after infection, the immune system controls the virus infection, but later in Advantages of the TMEV Model of Virus-Induced Demyelination The following features of TMEV make it an attractive model for studies of virus-induced immune-mediated demyelination: with only four structural proteins in the infectious particle. The genome is only approximately 8,100 nucleotides in length. Three strains are completely sequenced. The crystallographic structure of three strains of the virus has been solved, so that the location of every amino acid in the infectious particle is known. The B-cell epitopes that are the targets for neutralizing antibody have been identified and located on the infectious particle. Some of the epitopes on the virus that trigger proliferation of immune CD4+ T cells and some that act as targets for an antivirus cytolytic T-cell response are also known. Some components of the receptor for the virus have been identified. Infectious clones of the virus are available so mutations can be quickly engineered into any region of the genome. There is extensive knowledge about mouse genetics and immunology. The mouse, which is the natural and experimental host of TMEV, provides a special benefit in studies of the pathogenesis of TMEV-induced demyelinating disease because so much is known about mouse genetics and the immune system. In addition, many genetically engineered mice are available, including those in which specific genes for different components of the immune system have been “knocked out.” ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001. Multiple Sclerosis: Current Status and Strategies for the Future. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. the disease, it contributes to the demyelination. In addition, during the disease there appears to be a critical “balance” of the immune response that is necessary for the induction of demyelination: an inadequate immune response early in the disease can lead to the death of the mouse within the first couple of weeks and before the appearance of demyelination, while a very forceful immune response early can lead to clearance of the virus so that no virus persists and white matter disease fails to develop. In other words, viral persistence and demyelination occur only in association with a certain level of the antiviral immune response. CD4+, as well as CD8+, T cells might be mediators of the late demyelinating disease. DA virus infection induces demyelination in both CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell knockout mice, suggesting that both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells mediate the late demyelinating disease. The targets for these immunopathogenic CD4+ and the CD8+ T cells are unknown. There is some evidence for epitope spreading, in which an increasing number of myelin antigenic epitopes become the target for a CD4+ T-cell response. However, epitope spreading appears to begin after demyelination has become established, so it is unclear how important this mechanism of immunopathology is to DA-induced demyelination, especially early in the white matter disease. Mouse strains that are resistant to DA-induced demyelinating disease mount an antivirus cytolytic T-cell response and clear the virus. Mouse strains that are susceptible to the late disease do not mount this response, presumably allowing for virus persistence. L*, a small protein synthesized by demyelinating strains of TMEV via alternative translation, is critical for TMEV persistence and demyelination. L* inhibits the antivirus cytolytic T-cell response in susceptible mouse strains through an, as yet, unknown mechanism. Certain cells, for example, oligodendrocytes, may have cell-specific RNA-binding proteins that bind to the viral genome (as well as some nonviral messenger RNAs) and regulate whether L* or the viral capsid proteins are synthesized. The more L* that is synthesized, the more the expression of the virus is restricted. TMEV induces apoptosis in certain cells, including neurons and macrophages. The relationship between apoptosis and DA-induced demyelination remains an open question. There are many different strains of mouse hepatitis virus that lead to a plethora of different diseases, including hepatitis as well as respiratory and CNS disorders. JHM, S, and A59 strains of MHV induce demyelination. The extent of demyelination depends on the virus, including its geno-type, dosage, and route of inoculation, as well as on the condition of the infected mouse, including its strain, age, and immune status. Intracerebral inoculation of the JHM strain into weanling mice leads to demyelination in the mice that survive encephalitis. Virus persists in glial cells of demyelinated mice. At present, there are some notable limitations to MHV pathogenesis studies. MHV has a remarkably large viral genome (32 kb), making this a complex ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001. Multiple Sclerosis: Current Status and Strategies for the Future. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. pathogen. A system for efficient and rapid mutagenesis has not yet been perfected, and therefore manipulation of the viral genome is not straightforward. Investigators initially thought that demyelination occurred as a result of viral lysis of oligodendrocytes independently of the immune system. More recent studies, however, suggested that it does contribute to the demyelination (reviewed in 1996 by Houtman et al.). For example, investigators found that C57BL/6 mice that are immunosuppressed by gamma irradiation before being exposed to the JHM virus develop less severe demyelination. Adoptive transfer of JHM virus-infected splenic T cells to the infected irradiated mice leads to the development of significant demyelination. Other studies in rats showed that transfer of T cells from rats that have JHM virus-induced demyelinating encephalomyelitis leads to the development of experimental allergic encephalomyelitis-like lesions. Studies in CD4+ and CD8+ knockout mice demonstrated that both T-cell types are needed for clearance of the virus; however, CD4+ T cells contribute to central nervous system inflammation and demyelination. A suggestion of the latter study was that the CD4+ T cells influenced the expression of cytokines, specifically the RANTES cytokine, and led to macrophage entry into the CNS; treatment of the infected mice with anti-RANTES antibody resulted in a decrease in macrophage infiltration and demyelination. These studies and conclusions require confirmation. The committee notes that the following animal models of virus-induced demyelinating disease are particularly likely to yield clues to the pathogenesis of MS: The HAM/TSP syndrome resembles MS. Because the principles relevant to this human disease might be similar to those in MS, investigating the pathogenesis of this disease could reveal insights into MS pathogenesis. The development of a widely available animal model for HAM/TSP is a high priority. PIE is of special interest since recurrences following this acute inflammatory white matter disease are so similar to MS attacks that the two diseases are indistinguishable, indicating a close relationship between PIE and MS. The availability of transgenic mice that carry a receptor for measles virus might provide an experimental model for the study of PIE. The pathological lesions of TMEV are similar to MS plaques; therefore, continuing delineation of the mechanism by which the immune system contributes to the virus-induced demyelination might lead to a better understanding of the pathogenesis of demyelinating disease. ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001. Multiple Sclerosis: Current Status and Strategies for the Future. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. Research on the MHV-induced demyelination model is presently limited by difficulties with site-directed mutagenesis methods. A high priority for research with this virus should be the generation of an infectious MHV cDNA clone and a refinement of mutagenesis techniques. Molecular genetic manipulation has become one of the most important tools for evaluating gene function in living organisms. These tools of molecular biology have extended the reach of researchers to a new level of understanding of neurodegeneration mechanisms. The development of animal models for neurodegenerative disorders by means of genetic engineering has revolutionized experimental neurology. The identification and cloning of genes involved in diseases such as Alzheimer's, Huntington's, and amyotropic lateral sclerosis provided the keys to develop mice that overexpress the human genes involved in these diseases (reviewed in 1999 by Brusa). The nonobese diabetic (NOD) mouse is genetically susceptible to diabetes, and transgenic NOD mice have been developed to allow examination of the role of possible autoantigens in the development of diabetes, which like MS involves an inflammatory autoimmune pathology. The NOD mouse has also identified candidate molecules and processes that have influenced research in EAE and MS. Mutant mice have provided insights into all aspects of biology for generations, but only in the last two decades has it been possible to modify the expression of selected genes, an essential breakthrough for analyzing the role of specific genes in complex processes and diseases such as MS. In addition, identification of the genes that are activated or inactivated in both pathological and repair processes in the CNS will likely reveal new and unexpected targets for uniquely selective disease-modifying therapies in MS. “Reverse genetics” and “forward genetics” offer contrasting approaches to the analysis of gene function. Forward genetics is an approach to identify genes that are not already implicated in a particular disease or process. Reverse genetics is an approach to identify the role of genes whose involvement in the disease or process being studied is already implicated. In forward genetics, large numbers of mice are mutagenized (using techniques that mutagenize genes at random); their resulting phenotypes are analyzed to select mutants that exhibit spontaneous MS. The mutated genes in the selected mutants are then positionally cloned and identified. The homologous human clones can also be identified, a task that is becoming vastly simpler as the human genome project nears completion. The advantage of this approach is that the screen is not biased in any way and can reveal genes beyond those already known to be involved in MS. Another advantage of forward genetics is that once a gene is identified in a disease process, one can quickly do a screen for suppressors and ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001. Multiple Sclerosis: Current Status and Strategies for the Future. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. enhancers of the phenotype. This will yield the entire biochemical pathway (as opposed to just one step) involved in disease pathogenesis. One limitation to the forward genetics approach is that only a small percentage of the mutated genes will result in a phenotype relevant to MS. Consequently, large numbers of mutants have to be screened, which is generally expensive, time-consuming, and labor intensive. Yet the rewards—especially for complex diseases and processes that have resisted traditional approaches—are unparalleled. In reverse genetics, mutant strains of mice that either overexpress or lack specific genes are generated through a variety of techniques. The classic approach to creating transgenic mice is to inject a foreign gene (“transgene”) into a fertilized egg, thereby inducing overexpression of the transgene. The egg bearing the transgene is implanted into a host mother. Progeny bearing DNA encoding the transgene are screened, as are the corresponding levels of RNA and protein. This transgene is randomly incorporated into a mouse chromosome and ultimately leads to production of the protein of interest. This approach has been used to transfer human genes (such as those for T-cell receptor, HLA DR2, and CD4) into mice to see if they develop spontaneous MS. One limitation of “knockin” mice is that genes can be inserted in uneven copy numbers in “replicate” animals or might be integrated into disparate sites in the genome. Gene expression can also be altered through knockout experiments. Knockout mice, or null mutants, are created using embryonic stem cells and homologous recombination to produce a cell line in which a certain gene has been removed, or ablated. When transferred into an early mouse embryo, these cells can participate in the generation of all cell lineages including germ cells, thereby transmitting their genotype to the next generation. Alternatively, embryonic stem cells can be used to create so-called knock-in mice by inserting a gene into a particular locus. The transgenic gene-targeting approaches described above all rely on irreversible changes to the genome that are present from the onset of development throughout an animal's life. The function of the gene must be deduced from the phenotype of animals that have been deficient for the product of the disrupted gene throughout development. Yet, many genes play different roles at different stages of development and in different tissues. This presents serious drawbacks (reviewed in 1998 by Gingrich and Roder and in 1999 by Muller). First, an animal with a gene alteration that lethally disrupts development obviously cannot be studied as an adult—even though the gene might play another critical role, for example, in neural repair. This is particularly relevant to MS because many of the genes that regulate embryonic neural development also regulate neural repair in adults. Another limitation of transgenic models is that changes in the regulation of other genes could yield misleading phenotypes, in part because of differences between effects of the gene at different developmental stages, gene redundancy (other genes might also play the role of the missing gene), or adaptive mecha- ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001. Multiple Sclerosis: Current Status and Strategies for the Future. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. nisms that compensate for the missing gene. Even apparently unaltered phenotypes would thus not prove that the gene was not involved in the disease or process being studied. Another limitation of this approach is that in physiological responses, gene products tend to be produced in waves, whereas in transgenics, expression is usually “on” from the time of development. Alternative approaches in which one gene, or parts of it, can be inactivated or activated in specific tissues or at specific times (“conditional” and “inducible” mutants) have recently been developed in this rapidly expanding array of genealtering techniques (reviewed in Brusa, 1999; Gingrich and Roder, 1998; and van der Neut, 1997). This second generation of transgenic technology derives from the possibility of modulating the suppression of a transgene with external stimuli, by using a “biological switch” that can turn the foreign gene on and off. Gene expression patterns in the nervous system are highly regionalized. For example, the enzymes involved in producing neurotransmitters and their receptors differ from one subpopulation of neurons to another. Other proteins are more widespread, such as the intermediate filament proteins NF (neurofilament) or GFAP (glial fibrillary acidic protein), or are ubiquitous, such as N-CAMs (neural cell adhesion molecules) and integrins. Thus, it would be particularly advantageous to develop tissue-specific mutants for MS research. The development of inducible systems will become an important tool in the many diverse aspects of research on the disease mechanisms and possibilities for repair in MS, including the potential administration of gene therapy. Transgenic overexpression of cytokines or gene targets of cytokines in the CNS offers a relatively non-intrusive mechanism to assess the role of individual cytokines in CNS development, function, and response to insult. A common technique for assessing the effects of a particular cytokine in EAE is to induce its expression directly in the CNS. This allows researchers to ask whether expression of the cytokine induces CNS pathology similar to that seen in MS. Directed expression of transgenes in the CNS relies on promoters that normally control the expression of CNS-specific genes. This includes the GFAP gene promoter, which drives expression in astrocytes, as well as the neurofilament promoter (neurons), and the myelin basic protein promoter (oligodendrocytes). To date, no one has isolated a microglial-specific promoter. Only MBP promoters have been used to overexpress gamma-interferon in the CNS. Phenotypes of transgenic mice range from a lethal, “jimpy”-like hypomyelinating mouse, through progressive demyelinating disease, to mice with no outward phenotype that nevertheless showed progression from EAE to a *A point mutation in the gene coding for myelin proteolipid protein causes male offspring of jimpy mice to have little or no myelination. Affected mice develop severe tremors and die prematurely at approximately 30 days. ""2 Clinical and Biological Features."" Institute of Medicine. 2001. Multiple Sclerosis: Current Status and Strategies for the Future. Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10031. chronic demyelinating disease in contrast to control mice that recovered from EAE-induced demyelination. It is of interest that the same laboratory observed both extremes using the same constructs. This might be because the transgenes were unevenly integrated at different loci, since levels of expression did not obviously correlate with phenotype in one case. Asymptomatic transgenic mice did, however, show enhanced glial responses to CNS injury, and exacerbated ischemic infarction (Lambertsen et al., unpublished). These asymptomatic mice presumably reflect sub-threshold levels of cytokine. Nevertheless, crossing an asymptomatic MBP promoter-driven gamma-interferon transgenic mouse with MBP or MHC class I mice produced a more extreme jimpy phenotype. This might provide a clue to cytotoxic effects of beta-interferon-Î³ on oligodendrocytes, being perhaps dependent on local interferon-Î³ titers becoming sufficiently high to stimulate MHC I induction. It is not known whether similar mechanisms account for oligodendrocyte pathology in TNF-Î± and interferon-Î± transgenic mice. The IL-3 and IL-12 transgenic mice provide a useful counterpart, there being no obvious suggestion of a direct effect on oligodendrocytes., These mice illustrate the potential for direct macrophage and microglial attack on oligodendrocytes, which might occur in TNF-Î± transgenic mice. It is not clear from any of these experiments whether activation of immune cells took place within the CNS or following cytokine exit to the periphery. A systemic effect must account for the fact that overexpression of the antiinflammatory cytokine IL-10 protected animals from EAE in two separate preparations. The fact that IL-4 transgenic mice did not show similar resistance might reflect insufficient expression within the CNS or strain background differences, given that IL-4 knockout exacerbated disease in another study. Most recently, a transgenic mouse has been “constructed” that expresses T-cell receptor genes from a human MBP-specific T-cell clone, along with relevant human MHC class II determinants and MBP. Under certain conditions, this “humanized” mouse developed spontaneous EAE that indeed showed inflammation with some demyelination. In recent years, there have been many advances in the use of transgenes (including gene knockouts), as well as even more sophisticated models that make use of tissue-specific and time-dependent regulators. These models should facilitate the development of rational therapies and the transfer of knowledge from animal models to the prevention and treatment of human disease. However, although temporally regulated targeting controlled by the administration of an environmental inducer has become feasible with high efficiency for some organs, it remains to be further improved for other tissues, particularly the brain. New generations of inducible promoters will more faithfully mimic the in vivo kinetics and dynamics of cytokine production. Knock-in mice, in which ""2 Clinical and Biological Features.""

Multiple sclerosis is a chronic and often disabling disease of the nervous system, affecting about 1 million people worldwide. Even though it has been known for over a hundred years, no cause or cure has yet been discovered—but now there is hope. New therapies have been shown to slow the disease progress in some patients, and the pace of discoveries about the cellular machinery of the brain and spinal cord has accelerated. This book presents a comprehensive overview of multiple sclerosis today, as researchers seek to understand its processes, develop therapies that will slow or halt the disease and perhaps repair damage, offer relief for specific symptoms, and improve the abilities of MS patients to function in their daily lives. The panel reviews existing knowledge and identifies key research questions, focusing on: Research strategies that have the greatest potential to understand the biological mechanisms of recovery and to translate findings into specific strategies for therapy. How people adapt to MS and the research needed to improve the lives of people with MS. Management of disease symptoms (cognitive impairment, depression, spasticity, vision problems, and others). The committee also discusses ways to build and financially support the MS research enterprise, including a look at challenges inherent in designing clinical trials. This book will be important to MS researchers, research funders, health care advocates for MS research and treatment, and interested patients and their families. 3 Characteristics and Management of Major Symptoms 5 Strategies for Future Research on Disease Mechanisms 7 Building and Supporting the Research Enterprise Appendix D: Kurtze's Expanded Disability Status Scale Appendix F: U.S. Social Security Administration's Criteria for Qualifying as Disabled from MS Appendix G: Treatments That Have Been Claimed to Be of Benefit in MS You're looking at OpenBook, NAP.edu's online reading room since 1999.

The team is led by Kristen Krysko, MD, a of the National MS Society and Emmanuelle Waubant, MD, PhD (University of California, San Francisco). The team conducted a review of studies on breastfeeding and MS disease activity. The goal of this type of “meta-analysis” is to provide a big-picture view of multiple smaller studies. Researchers identified 24 studies for this review, which involved 2,974 women, but excluded 8 studies from the final analysis due to lack of data. The studies were published between January 1980 and July 2018 and all specifically looked at the association between breastfeeding and postpartum relapses. The results show that – across these studies – breastfeeding was associated with a 43% lower rate of postpartum relapses. A stronger benefit was shown with breastfeeding exclusively rather than nonexclusively (supplementing with formula feeding). The authors point out that it is not possible to exclude the possible influence of factors that may bias some study findings, such as previous disease activity. They also note that even in light of the protective benefits of breastfeeding, postpartum relapse rates are fairly high, and that additional strategies are needed to prevent postpartum relapses. It is important to point out that this study shows an association between breastfeeding and lower postpartum relapses but does not prove that breastfeeding will prevent relapses. These findings also highlight the need for more high-quality research on and MS, such as understanding how long the benefit of breastfeeding lasts. Women with MS who are planning to have children and their partners should consider a discussion about breastfeeding, relapses and disease modifying therapies with their MS healthcare provider.

While the wait may be frustrating, each test will help eliminate or confirm other potential causes for your symptoms. A number of conditions cause symptoms similar to those of MS. All of these should be investigated. Some, like (PML) virus and , can be identified with an MRI. Blood tests can help provide clues to other MS mimics, such as: Tingling or numbness in your arms, hands, legs, and feet are common symptoms of both MS and . Lyme disease is a tick-borne infection that can spread to the central nervous system. With Lyme disease, you’re likely to also have a skin rash. While not 100 percent accurate, and Western-blot blood tests can detect the presence of Lyme disease infection in the blood. Although some symptoms are the same, the treatments for MS and Lyme disease are different. Early-stage Lyme disease can often be cured with a course of oral antibiotics. is an inflammatory autoimmune disease that can affect your central nervous system. Symptoms that lupus and MS share include: Like MS, there isn’t a single test for lupus. A blood test that is positive for and other antibodies may indicate lupus or some other autoimmune disease, but not MS. Treatment for lupus depends on your symptoms. , better known as Devic’s disease, is a rare immunological disorder that is strikingly similar to MS. The two conditions share many symptoms, including: A test called the NMO-IgG blood test will be negative in people with MS, but positive in of people with Devic’s disease. Devic’s disease doesn’t respond to the same disease-modifying medications as MS. It can be treated with steroids and other immune-suppressing drugs. Certain vitamin deficiencies, such as a lack of , can cause symptoms that mimic those of MS. , common in both B-12 deficiency and MS, is damage to the protective covering that surrounds nerve fibers within the central nervous system. Symptoms of vitamin B-12 deficiency include numbness and tingling in the hands and feet, weakness, and fatigue. Copper, , and deficiencies can also cause neurological symptoms. A simple blood test can check the levels of essential vitamins in your blood. Your doctor can walk you through treatment plan with supplements and dietary changes. To reach the diagnosis of MS, your doctor must find: damage in two distinct areas of the central nervous system that the areas of damage developed at two different points in time Generally, a series of tests are needed to meet the criteria for diagnosis. In addition to symptom history and blood tests, your doctor might also order the following tests. An is painless, noninvasive, and can produce detailed images. Performed both with and without contrast dye, an MRI can identify lesions on the brain and spinal cord. The images can show if the lesions are old, new, or currently active. In addition to diagnosis, an MRI can help monitor disease progression. Although can’t rule out or confirm MS, it can help with diagnosis. Spinal fluid is obtained from a needle inserted between the bones of your lower spine. In people with MS, the spinal fluid sometimes contains elevated levels of IgG antibodies or proteins called oligoclonal bands, which could also be caused by some other diseases. About of people with MS have no spinal fluid abnormalities. This involves staring at a screen with an alternating checkerboard pattern. This helps determine if there’s any impairment of your optic nerve pathways. After diagnosis, the next step is to discuss treatment options with your doctor. There’s a growing list of disease-modifying drugs designed to reduce relapses and slow disease progression in relapsing MS. These drugs haven’t been shown to work for progressive types of MS. These powerful drugs must be taken consistently to be effective, and they can have serious side effects. Be sure to discuss the pros and cons of each with your doctor. Other symptoms, such as fatigue, can also be treated. Your doctor can refer you to local resources to learn about MS. You may find it helpful to join an MS support group, either or in person. Although everyone’s experiences with MS are different, it might help to share your experiences with others. There’s no cure for MS, so management is a lifetime commitment. In addition to your general doctor, you’ll also need a neurologist on your healthcare team to evaluate symptoms and monitor disease progression. Sometimes MS can lead to severe disability, but most people continue to have a good quality of life and can expect a normal lifespan. — — Medically reviewed by Multiple sclerosis can be difficult to diagnosis.

It affects quality of life and correlates with worsened disease outcome. Out approach is to try to systematically identify and treat this problem early and effectively. Q: How common are cognitive disorders present in MS? The prevalence of cognitive impairment in MS is estimated to be between 40 and 65 percent (Bobholz and Rao, 2003; Benedict, Zivadinov, 2011). The cognitive abilities most often affected include episodic memory (recall of previously studied information, like a shopping list or story), working memory (temporary on-line maintenance and manipulation of information), divided attention (multi-tasking ability), and speed processing. Language, executive, and visuospatial functions are relatively spared. However, there is considerable variation in the neuropsychological presentation of MS patients. For example, one study identified six distinct cognitive profiles among patients with relapsing MS entering a trial of interferon-β1a (Fischer, 1999). The largest subgroup, which included 34% of the sample, was cognitively intact. Only 2% showed global cognitive impairment across multiple cognitive domains. The remainder showed circumscribed deficits in two to three cognitive domains. At the Mellen Center, we specifically inquire about the presence of cognitive symptoms at each visit. This is done both in our previsit screening questionnaire and as part of our review of symptoms for each visit. If this is an issue for the patient or their families, we inquire more deeply into this issue. Q: What other factors need to be considered when a patient states they have cognitive problems? (Differential diagnosis) Early in the process of cognitive evaluation for MS patients, other facts should be considered. Standard assessment of laboratory parameters used for general cognitive disorders should be undertaken (For example, thyroid indices and vitamin B12 level). The patient should have an assessment for depression to ensure that the problem is not primarily related to an emotional disorder (see below). Questions about sleep disturbance should be asked as sleep disorders are common in MS and may affect cognitive abilities. The medication the patient is taking should be evaluated for negative impact on cognition. Q: Do physical disability, disease course, and disease duration correlate with cognitive dysfunction in MS? Level of physical disability, as measured with the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS), has at best a modest correlation with severity of cognition in MS. This is not surprising since the EDSS is heavily influenced by non-cognitive signs and symptoms, such as ambulation. Several studies have shown that cognitive dysfunction is greater in secondary progressive than in relapsing-remitting MS (Gaudino, Chiaravalloti et al.,2001). Cross-sectioning studies have found only a modest relationship between duration of the disease and the extent of cognitive impairment. As noted above, this is likely due to the inter-patient variability in the presentation of cognitive disorders. It is important to note that cognitive changes can occur early in the course of the disease (Deloire, Salort et al.,2005) and, in some patients, may never occur. Longitudinal neuropsychological studies of MS patients studied over an extended period of time suggest that approximately 5-10 percent of patients experience a discernible worsening of cognitive functioning over the course of a year (Amato et al., 2001). Unlike patients with progressive dementias, MS patients with cognitive impairment can be stable for years. In addition, recent cases reports have noted cognitive impairment as a sole manifestation of relapse of MS, with cognitive declines correlating with new lesion formation on MRI imaging. For the above reasons we also do not assume that patients with physical disabilities are cognitively impaired, now do we assume that those without physical impairment are cognitively intact. Q: Do abnormalities detected on brain MRI scans correlate with cognitive dysfunction in MS? Compared to demographic and disease variables, neuroimaging indices correlate relatively well with cognition in MS. Several studies have demonstrated an inverse relation between cognitive performance and the number of volume of lesions on conventional MRI, including T2-weighted or fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) imaging (Rovaris and Filippi, 200). Regionally specific relations between lesion volume and cognition have been reported. For example, one study showed specific relations between frontal lobe involvement and executive functions, like conceptual reasoning (Arnett, Rao et al., 1994). Some studies have suggested that brain atrophy is a better predictor of cognitive impairment in MS than lesion volume (Bermel, Bakshi et al., 2002; Benedict, Weinstock-Guttman et al., 2004). Longitudinal studies have shown a relation between progressive brain atrophy and cognitive changes patterns in MS (Hohol, Buttman et al., 1997). There are occasional patients with subacute cognitive changes that correlate with the presence of new lesions, so that a new complaint of cognitive dysfunction may prompt further imaging to assess for disease activity (Pardini, 204). Recent studies indicate that cortical lesions are not only present in early clinical MS, but may be as common as white matter lesions (Lucchinetti 2011). Such lesions and associated tract degeneration may underly some component of the cognitive dysfunction in MS. Note that in addition there are patients with prominent cognitive symptoms with limited lesion burden or atrophy on brain imaging. In such patients, we would assess carefully for other factors such as medication, sleep disturbance, and depression masquerading as cognitive deficits (See below). Q: Do cognitive disorders correlate with other factors related to MS (for example, depression, fatigue, sleep disorders)? Emotional problems, sleep disorders, and fatigue are significantly more common in individuals with MS than in the general population. Although the relationship among these symptoms may be complex, depression has been reported to affect cognitive test performance in the areas of rapid information processing, working memory, and executive function in MS patients (Arnett, Higginson et al., 2001). Although subjective reports of fatigue do not necessarily correlate with observable deficits in cognitive function, decrements in cognitive performance occur during sustained mental effort and after completion of cognitively challenging tasks in MS patients (Krupp and Elkins, 2000; Schwid, Tyler et al., 2003). It is reasonable to assume that patients' performance may be compromised if they are significantly depressed, fatigued, or sleep deprived during cognitive testing. There are many medicines used in MS care that may have a negative impact on cognition. We assess these medicines in our patients with cognitive deficits and consider whether they can be changed to alternative medicines or whether they can be weaned off. Medicines that have such an impact include steroids (particularly IV high dose solumedrol), anticholinergics such as oxybutynin, tricyclic antidepressants, sedatives, beta blockers, muscle relaxants, etc. In addition, the chronic use of marijuana and related substances can have a negative effect on cognition. Sleep disorders may be seen with MS and may affect daytime cognitive performance. We do inquire about sleep at the Mellen Center and consider expert evaluation depending on symptoms presented (for example, snoring, restless leg, periodic leg movements, repeated awakenings, etc). There are documented events where subacute cognitive impairment is the only clinical manifestation of a relapse documented by a decline in neuropsychological function and imaging findings of new lesion formation. A subacute decline in cognition should prompt both a search for factors such as infection, new medications, or emerging illness, or imaging to assess for new lesion activity. Q: How can cognitive disorders be detected in the clinical setting? A: We note that patient self-report of cognitive deficits in unreliable. Patients with MS who are depressed will report cognitive impairment, while patients with cognitive deficits may under report their deficits. An informant (family member, close friend) is critical to assist in giving history to document cognitive impairment. One method for identifying cognitive dysfunction is to administer rating questionnaires to patients and their family members. One such scale is the MS Neuropsychological Screening Questionnaire (MSNQ), a 15-item self-informant-report inventory (Benedict, Cox et al., 2004). Results suggest that informant ratings of cognitive problems are more likely to correlate with objective neuropsychological tests than patient self-reports. Unfortunately, informant ratings are not always available in the clinical setting. An alternative approach is to use a brief cognitive screening examination. One commonly used test, the Mini-Mental State Examination, has been found to be insensitive to the cognitive impairments in MS. Performing extensive cognitive testing can be too time consuming for centers with limited staff, yet performing an annual cognitive screen may be necessary as part of ongoing MS care. Langdon and others (2012) extensively reviewed the literature on neuropsychological measures in MS. They determined that the Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT), with the possible addition of the California Verbal Learning Test-Second Edition and the Brief Visuospatial Memory Test-Revised learning trials, is a reasonable screen. Their expert panel judged these studies to be preferred over others when rated on psychometric qualities (reliability, validity, and sensitivity), an international application, ease administration, feasibility in the specified context, and acceptability to patients. The SDMT consists of single digits paired with abstract symbols. The patient must say the number corresponding with each symbol. The test can be administered and scored within 5 minutes. It is a sensitive test of information processing speed that is preferentially affected in MS patients. It is well validated against multiple MRI measures and has minimal practice effect. One problem with the standard SDMT is that there are not multiple versions, so as a repeated measures test this would be subject to a training effect. The California Verbal Learning Test-Second Edition comprises a 16 item word list, with four items belonging to each of 4 categories. This is read aloud 5 times in the same order to the patient at a rate slightly slower than 1 per second. This test can be completed in 5-10 minutes including instructions, testing, and responses. This test has also been validated with brain MRI measures. The Brief Visuospatial Memory Test-Revised Learning T1-3 requires the patient to inspect a 2x3 stimulus array of abstract geometric figures. There are three learning trials of 10 seconds, then the stimulus is removed and the patient is required to draw the array from memory. This study also correlates with a variety of MRI measures. Other measures which could be used include the PASAT, MOCA test, and others. At the Mellen Center we screen both with items on a self-reported quality of life scale as well as in our review of symptoms. We have not systematically used screening tools in out entire population though this would be a reasonable approach as well. Q: What is the role of neuropsychology in ascertaining and monitoring cognition? The brief cognitive screening batteries described above could be administered by a non-neuropsychologist to determine if an MS patient is experiencing some form of cognitive dysfunction. Such a result is of limited importance, however, if not tied into specific clinical management. For this to happen, it is common to refer MS patients for a comprehensive neuropsychological assessment performed by a board certified clinical neuropsychologist. Such as assessment typically entails three to four hours of testing and includes a clinical interview. Comprehensive assessments can provide detailed baseline and follow-up data as well as information that pertains to complex matters such as differential diagnosis (e.g. MS dementia versus Alzheimer's disease in an elderly patient), guidance for rehabilitation or therapies, or determination of disability status. Neuropsychology testing can be particularly helpful if work or school related performance has been questioned, potentially leading to recommendation for accommodations (for example, breaks between tasks, more time for examinations, quieter workspace, part time work, etc.) Referral to a clinical neuropsychologist, board-certified by the American Board of Clinical Neuropsychology, is recommended. Q: What non-medication interventions exist for cognitive dysfunction? Non pharmacologic treatment for cognitive impairment in MS, variously described as cognitive retraining, cognitive remediation, or cognitive rehabilitation among other labels, includes three main approaches: (1) restorative therapies that aim to improve specific abilities, (2) compensatory approaches that aim to circumvent cognitive problems through the use of cognitive strategies, and (3) adaptive approaches that aim to circumvent cognitive problems through the use of external aids and modifications (Amato and Zipoli, 2003). Recent studies have begun to assess interventions specifically designed to improve targeted aspects of learning and memory in MS (Chiaravalloti, DeLuca et al., 2005). A recent Cochrane Review found low level evidence for the benefit of neuropsychological rehabilitation in MS patients (Rosti-Otajarvi 2004). Variations in study design and conduct precluded a strong recommendation for such rehabilitative strategies. In addition to the direct treatment of cognition, it is useful to detect and treat comorbidities such as depression and fatigue that can influence cognition and quality of life (Amato and Zipoli, 2003; Bagert, Camplair et al., 2002; Bakshi, 2003). Cognitive-behavioral counseling based in neuropsychological principles has been shown to improve insight and social skills, leading to a reduction in disinhibition and social aggressiveness in cognitively impaired MS patients (Benedict, Shaprio et al., 2001) In addition, a single study indicated reduced brain atrophy in patients actively exercising, which might have an impact on cognition (Lovera, 2010). Compensatory strategies may be helpful. These include a simplified schedule of activities, reminder lists or other strategies, reducing clutter in the household, among others. Where available, vocational rehabilitation may be useful to counsel the patient on alternatives or adaptions which might assist them in the workplace. In general populations, various preventive strategies to spare cognition have been supported by epidemiological or clinical trials data. These may be worth discussing with patients concerned about preventing cognitive decline: Treating hypertension, diabetes, and other vascular risk factors Data on brain training is limited at the present time. Q: What medication approaches are there for cognitive dysfunction? Treatment of cognitive problems in MS has received relatively little clinical or empirical attention in the past. However, recent years have seen the emergence of studies of pharmacologic interventions that have undergone rigorous scientific scrutiny in well-designed clinical trials (Doraiswamy and Rao, 2004). Prevention of cognitive impairment in MS is an important target of therapy. Some disease-modifying medications have been shown to have a beneficial effect on cognition (e.g., Fischer, Priore et al. 2000). Pharmacologic strategies used to treat cognitive impairment in other disorders may have a beneficial effect on MS. A randomized, placebo-controlled study demonstrated a modest but statistically significant benefit of the cholinesterase inhibitor donepezil on memory test performance in MS (Krupp, Christodoulou et al., 2004). However, a larger multicenter study of donepezil did not confirm this finding (Krupp et al 2011). It may also be helpful to minimize, when possible, the use of medications with potential adverse cognitive consequences, such as bladder-control medications with anticholinergic effects (Tsao and Heilman, 2005). A randomized multicenter study of memantine 10mg bid in MS patients with cognitive symptoms shows more fatigue and neurological adverse events than patients on placebo and no positive effect on cognition. Higher doses of memantine may have more cognitive side effects in this population as well. Other medications considered for use in this population have not been tested in a randomized trial way. These include activating antidepressants, stimulants, and modafinil. There is limited data to support the use of these medications in this situation. Q: What do families need to think of when there are cognitive disorders? Independent of the severity of physical disability, cognitive dysfunction can have a major impact on employment and activities of daily living in MS (Rao, Leo et al., 1991). Severity of cognitive impairment, as measured by neuropsychological testing, is predictive of ability to drive (Schultheis, Garay et al., 2002), employment status (Benedict, 2005; Rao, Leo et al., 1991), success in rehabilitation (Langdon and Thompson, 1999), and social skills (Knight, Devereux et al., 1997). It is critical that patients and family members receive accurate information and psychosocial counseling to assist them in coping with these sometimes intractable consequences of MS. There are specific recommendations available on the assessment and management of cognitive impairment in MS which may be useful to families and patients with such impairment (Benedict Zacharia, et al., 2006). Specific considerations to discuss with families include safety (to avoid falls, wandering, injury); financial oversight; and driving safety. Bobholz, JA and Rao, SM (2003).

According to a company press release, the study met primary and most secondary endpoints, significantly reducing the annual relapse rate in adults with relapsing MS. Side effects were said to be similar to those reported from previous studies of ponesimod and for this class of therapy. These include potential to cause a temporary slowing of heart rate, anxiety, dizziness, breathlessness, raised liver enzymes, influenza, sleeplessness and swelling of the lower legs.  Further details will be presented at the 2019 Congress of the European Committee for Treatment and Research in MS in September.

Ofatumumab is self-administered as a monthly under-the-skin injection. According to a company press release, the studies met their primary and key secondary endpoints, significantly reducing the annual relapse rates compared to Aubagio. Details about side effects were not provided in the press release. Safety is said to be in line with those observed in a previous phase 2 study, which reported chiefly injection-site reactions as the most common adverse event. Further details will be presented at the 2019 Congress of the European Committee for Treatment and Research in MS (ECTRIMS) in September. The company plans to apply to drug regulatory agencies by the end of this year.   DETAILS Multiple sclerosis involves an immune system attack on the brain and spinal cord. Ofatumumab is a monoclonal antibody that binds to a docking site (CD20) on immune B cells (lymphocytes) and depletes them. B cells are among immune cells that have been implicated in causing nervous system damage in MS. One B-cell therapy currently approved by the FDA to treat MS is Ocrevus (Genentech). In an earlier phase II study in people with relapsing MS, ofatumumab significantly reduced disease activity seen on MRI scans -- May 15, 2018; 90 (20).   Two identical phase 3 studies (ACLEPIOS I and II) were conducted for up to 30 months and involved 1,882 people with relapsing MS. Participants were randomly assigned to receive under-the-skin injections of ofatumumab, self-administered once a month, or teriflunomide, 14 mg once daily, for up to 30 months. The primary outcome that was measured was the annual rate of relapses. Secondary endpoints included time to progression of disability, rate of brain volume loss and other measures.   According to a company press release, the study met primary and key secondary endpoints, significantly reducing the annual relapse rate in adults with relapsing MS.

Ofatumumab is self-administered as a monthly under-the-skin injection. According to a company press release, the studies met their primary and key secondary endpoints, significantly reducing the annual relapse rates compared to Aubagio. Details about side effects were not provided in the press release. Safety is said to be in line with those observed in a previous phase 2 study, which reported chiefly injection-site reactions as the most common adverse event. Further details will be presented at the 2019 Congress of the European Committee for Treatment and Research in MS (ECTRIMS) in September. The company plans to apply to drug regulatory agencies by the end of this year.   DETAILS Multiple sclerosis involves an immune system attack on the brain and spinal cord. Ofatumumab is a monoclonal antibody that binds to a docking site (CD20) on immune B cells (lymphocytes) and depletes them. B cells are among immune cells that have been implicated in causing nervous system damage in MS. One B-cell therapy currently approved by the FDA to treat MS is Ocrevus (Genentech). In an earlier phase II study in people with relapsing MS, ofatumumab significantly reduced disease activity seen on MRI scans -- May 15, 2018; 90 (20).   Two identical phase 3 studies (ACLEPIOS I and II) were conducted for up to 30 months and involved 1,882 people with relapsing MS. Participants were randomly assigned to receive under-the-skin injections of ofatumumab, self-administered once a month, or teriflunomide, 14 mg once daily, for up to 30 months. The primary outcome that was measured was the annual rate of relapses. Secondary endpoints included time to progression of disability, rate of brain volume loss and other measures.   According to a company press release, the study met primary and key secondary endpoints, significantly reducing the annual relapse rate in adults with relapsing MS. It also met the secondary endpoint of delaying the time to disability progression. Details about side effects were not provided in the press release.

Cognitive functions are harder to measure than clinical disability and MRIs, so they are not routinely evaluated in clinical practice. The concept of ‘no evidence of disease activity’ (NEDA) has recently emerged as an important outcome measure for MS in research studies or clinical trials. It means no relapses or disability progression and no new white matter lesions are identified with MRI. However, it is not known if maintaining NEDA has a positive impact on cognition or brain atrophy (shrinkage). A research team from Italy carried out a study to evaluate the correlation between NEDA status, cognitive functions and brain shrinking. They followed 42 people with relapsing remitting MS for two years and found that only 30.8% of them achieved NEDA status. About half of those with NEDA status still had deterioration of some cognitive functions. The recommendation from this study is to include cognitive evaluation in the NEDA measure to comprehensively assess disease progression.

Fingolimod is used to prevent episodes of symptoms and slow the worsening of disability in adults and children 10 years of age and older with relapsing-remitting forms (course of disease where symptoms flare up from time to time) of multiple sclerosis (MS; a disease in which the nerves do not function properly and people may experience weakness, numbness, loss of muscle coordination, and problems with vision, speech, and bladder control). Fingolimod is in a class of medications called sphingosine l-phosphate receptor modulators. It works by decreasing the action of immune cells that may cause nerve damage. Fingolimod comes as a capsule to take by mouth. It is usually taken once a day with or without food. Take fingolimod at around the same time every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take fingolimod exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor. Fingolimod may cause the heartbeat to slow in adults and children, especially during the first 6 hours after you take your first dose, and after the first dose when the dose is increased in children. You will receive an electrocardiogram (ECG; test that records the electrical activity of the heart) before you take your first dose and again 6 hours after you take the dose. You will take your first dose of fingolimod in your doctor's office or another medical facility. You will need to stay at the medical facility for at least 6 hours after you take the medication so that you can be monitored. You may need to stay at the medical facility for longer than 6 hours or overnight if you have certain conditions or take certain medications that increase the risk that your heartbeat will slow or if your heartbeat slows more than expected or continues to slow after the first 6 hours. You may also need to stay at a medical facility for at least 6 hours after you take your second dose if your heartbeat slows too much when you take your first dose. Tell your doctor if you experience dizziness, tiredness, chest pain, or slow or irregular heartbeat at any time during your treatment, especially during the first 24 hours after you take your first dose. Fingolimod may help control multiple sclerosis but will not cure it. Do not stop taking fingolimod without talking to your doctor. If you do not take fingolimod for 1 day or longer during the first 2 weeks of treatment, for 1 week or longer in the third and fourth weeks of treatment or for 2 weeks or longer after the first month of treatment, talk to your doctor before you start taking it again. You may experience slowed heartbeat when you start taking fingolimod again, so you will need to restart the medication in your doctor's office. Before taking fingolimod, tell your doctor and pharmacist if you are allergic to fingolimod, If you have had a serious allergic reaction to fingolimod or any of the ingredients in fingolimod capsules (rash, hives, swelling of the face, eyes, mouth, throat, tongue, lips, hands, feet, ankles, or lower legs), your doctor will probably tell not to fingolimod. Also, tell your doctor if you are allergic to any other medications, or any of the ingredients in fingolimod capsules. Ask your pharmacist or check the Medication Guide for a list of the ingredients. tell your doctor if you are taking medications for irregular heartbeat such as amiodarone (Nexterone, Pacerone), disopyramide (Norpace), dofetilide (Tikosyn), dronedarone (Multaq), ibutilide (Corvert), procainamide, quinidine (in Nuedexta), and sotalol (Betapace, Sorine, Sotylize). Your doctor will probably tell you not to take fingolimod if you are taking one or more of these medications. tell your doctor and pharmacist what prescription and nonprescription medications, vitamins, nutritional supplements, and herbal products you are taking or plan to take during your treatment with fingolimod. Be sure to mention any of the following: beta-blockers such as atenolol (Tenormin, in Tenoretic), carteolol, labetalol (Trandate), metoprolol (Lopressor, Toprol-XL, in Dutoprol, in Lopressor HCT), nadolol (Corgard, in Corzide), nebivolol (Bystolic, in Byvalson), propranolol (Inderal LA, Innopran XL), and timolol; diltiazem (Cardizem, Cartia, Tiazac, others); chlorpromazine; citalopram (Celexa); digoxin (Lanoxin); erythromycin (E.E.S., Ery-Tab, PCE, others); haloperidol (Haldol); ketoconazole; medications for heart problems; methadone (Dolophine, Methadose); and verapamil (Calan, Verelan, in Tarka). Also tell you doctor if you are taking any of the following medications, or if you have taken them in the past: corticosteroids such as dexamethasone, methylprednisolone, and prednisone; medications for cancer; and medications to weaken or control the immune system such as mitoxantrone, natalizumab (Tysabri), and teriflunomide (Aubagio), Your doctor may need to change the doses of your medications or monitor you carefully for side effects. Many other medications may also interact with fingolimod, so be sure to tell your doctor about all the medications you are taking, even those that do not appear on this list. tell your doctor if you have or have had any of these conditions in the last six months: heart attack, angina (chest pain), stroke or mini-stroke, or heart failure. Also tell your doctor if you have long QT syndrome (condition that increases the risk of developing an irregular heartbeat that may cause fainting or sudden death) or irregular heart rhythm. Your doctor may tell you not to take fingolimod. tell your doctor if you have ever fainted, had a heart attack, stroke, or mini stroke, or if you currently have a fever or other signs of infection, if you have an infection that comes and goes or that does not go away, and if you have or have ever had diabetes; sleep apnea (condition in which you briefly stop breathing many times during the night) or other breathing problems; high blood pressure; uveitis (inflammation of the eye) or other eye problems; a slow heartbeat; low levels of potassium or magnesium in your blood; skin cancer, or heart or liver disease. Also tell your doctor if you have recently received a vaccine. tell your doctor if you are pregnant or plan to become pregnant, or are breastfeeding. You should use birth control to prevent pregnancy during your treatment and for 2 months after your final dose. If you become pregnant while taking fingolimod or within 2 months after your final dose, call your doctor. do not have any vaccinations during your treatment with fingolimod or for 2 months after your final dose without talking to your doctor. Talk to your child's doctor about vaccinations that your child may need to receive before beginning his or her treatment with fingolimod. tell your doctor if you have never had chicken pox and have not received the chicken pox vaccine. Your doctor may order a blood test to see if you have been exposed to chicken pox. You may need to receive the chicken pox vaccine and then wait one month before beginning your treatment with fingolimod. plan to avoid unnecessary or prolonged exposure to sunlight and UV light (such as tanning booths) and to wear protective clothing, sunglasses, and sunscreen. Fingolimod may make your skin more sensitive to the dangerous side effects of sunlight, and may increase your risk of developing skin cancer. Unless your doctor tells you otherwise, continue your normal diet. Take the missed dose as soon as you remember it. However, if it is almost time for the next dose, skip the missed dose and call your doctor before you take the next dose. You may need to be monitored as you restart your medication. Do not take a double dose to make up for a missed one. Fingolimod may cause side effects. Tell your doctor if any of these symptoms are severe or do not go away: Some side effects can be serious. If you experience any of these symptoms, call your doctor immediately: rash, hives, itching; swelling of the face, eye, mouth, throat, tongue or lips; or difficulty swallowing or breathing sore throat, body aches, fever, chills, cough, and other signs of infection and during treatment and for 2 months after your treatment headache, neck stiffness, fever, sensitivity to light, nausea, or confusion during treatment and for 2 months after your treatment painful, burning, numb, or tingling feeling on skin, sensitivity to touch, rash, or itching during treatment and for 2 months after your treatment sudden severe headache, confusion, changes in vision, or seizures blurriness, shadows, or a blind spot in the center of your vision; sensitivity to light; unusual color to your vision or other vision problems changes to an existing mole; a new darkened area on skin; sores that do not heal; growths on your skin such as a bump that may be shiny, pearly white, skin-colored, or pink, or any other changes to your skin weakness on one side of the body or clumsiness of the arms or legs that worsens over time; changes in your thinking, memory, or balance; confusion or personality changes; or loss of strength nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, abdominal pain, yellowing of skin or eyes, or dark urine Fingolimod may increase the risk of developing skin cancer and lymphoma (cancer that begins in the cells that fight infection). Talk to your doctor about the risks of taking this medication. A sudden increase episodes of MS symptoms and worsening of disability may occur within 3 to 6 months after you stop taking fingolimod. Tell your doctor if your MS symptoms worsen after stopping fingolimod. Fingolimod may cause other side effects. Call your doctor if you have any unusual problems while taking this medication. Keep this medication in the container it came in, tightly closed, and out of reach of children. Store it at room temperature and away from excess heat and moisture (not in the bathroom). It is important to keep all medication out of sight and reach of children as many containers (such as weekly pill minders and those for eye drops, creams, patches, and inhalers) are not child-resistant and young children can open them easily. To protect young children from poisoning, always lock safety caps and immediately place the medication in a safe location – one that is up and away and out of their sight and reach. http://www.upandaway.org Unneeded medications should be disposed of in special ways to ensure that pets, children, and other people cannot consume them. However, you should not flush this medication down the toilet. Instead, the best way to dispose of your medication is through a medicine take-back program. Talk to your pharmacist or contact your local garbage/recycling department to learn about take-back programs in your community. See the FDA's Safe Disposal of Medicines website (http://goo.gl/c4Rm4p) for more information if you do not have access to a take-back program.

The results were announced in a March 27, 2014 press release from Synthon BV. The company has submitted an application to the FDA for approval of GTR to treat MS, and plans to submit an application to European regulatory authorities as well, according to the press release. Glatiramer acetate is a synthetic compound that simulates myelin basic protein, a component of the myelin that insulates nerve fibers in the brain and spinal cord. This therapy seems to block myelin-damaging T-cells through a mechanism that is not completely understood. Currently glatiramer acetate is available as and is approved by the FDA to reduce the frequency of relapses in patients with relapsing-remitting MS and for use in individuals who have experienced a first clinical episode (clinically-isolated syndrome) and have MRI features that are consistent with MS. This study compared a generic form of glatiramer acetate with Copaxone. Participants were randomly assigned to receive GTR (20 mg/day injected under the skin), Copaxone (20 mg/day injected under the skin), or inactive placebo (injected daily under the skin) for nine months. In an ongoing extension study, participants who complete the first 9 months are being treated with GTR (20 mg/day) for 15 months. The primary goal of the study was to compare the effectiveness of GTR, Copaxone and placebo for reducing disease activity seen on MRI brain scans. Other objectives included comparing the effectiveness of reducing relapse rates, improving scores on clinical scales, and safety. Disease activity was equally reduced in both the Synthon GTR and the Copaxone groups, and significantly reduced when compared with the placebo group, according to the press release. According to the press release, there were similar results for the other study objectives, but details of these results are not provided. Reported adverse reactions were similar between the GTR and Copaxone groups and in line with those known to be associated with Copaxone. Full details of the study are expected to be submitted for publication in a peer-reviewed medical journal and presented at future scientific meetings. Synthon submitted an Abbreviated New Drug Application for the approval of GTR as a generic therapy to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in November 2011, and plans to submit an application to European drug regulatory authorities as well.  “We look forward to seeing the complete data from this study,” says Timothy Coetzee, PhD, Chief Advocacy, Services, and Research Officer of the National MS Society. “Having additional treatment options is important for people with MS, since everyone responds to therapies differently.”   Multiple sclerosis is an unpredictable, often disabling . range from numbness and tingling to blindness and paralysis, and there is currently no cure for MS.

Top-line results were announced in August 2019, and details have now been published in the peer-reviewed New England Journal of Medicine. Novartis has applied for approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Ofatumumab is a monoclonal antibody that binds to a docking site (CD20) on some immune B cells and depletes them. B cells are among immune cells that have been implicated in causing nervous system damage in MS. One B-cell therapy currently approved to treat MS is Ocrevus (Genentech). Two identical phase 3 studies (ACLEPIOS I and II) were conducted for up to 30 months. Participants were randomly assigned to receive ofatumumab, self-injected once a month, or daily oral teriflunomide for up to 30 months. As a control, the groups also received placebo versions of ofatumumab or teriflunomide. The primary outcome measured was the annual rate of relapses. Secondary endpoints included time to progression of disability, rate of brain volume loss and other measures. The studies achieved the primary outcome, meaning that ofatumumab reduced annual relapses significantly more than teriflunomide. Disability worsening at three and six months, and disease activity on MRI scans, were also reduced significantly more in the groups receiving ofatumumab. Brain tissue loss was not reduced significantly more in the ofatumumab group. Adverse events that occurred in at least 10% of participants in groups taking ofatumumab included injection-related reactions, headache, upper respiratory tract infection, and urinary tract infection. Appendicitis occurred in 8 people in ofatumumab groups and 2 in the teriflunomide groups; this had not occurred in previous studies. Novartis has applied to the FDA for approval of ofatumumab to treat MS, and a decision is expected in September 2020. “Ofatumumab versus Teriflunomide in Multiple Sclerosis” is published by Stephen L.

cd12ec52-6dbe-427a-8026-55df746bf070,"Complementary & Alternative Medicines Find Programs & Services in Your Area COVID-19 Vaccine Guidance for People Living with MS     Preliminary Results Announced from Clinical Trial of “Anti-LINGO-1” Myelin Repair Strategy in Peopl Preliminary Results Announced from Clinical Trial of “Anti-LINGO-1” Myelin Repair Strategy in People with Optic Neuritis A phase II study of the “anti-LINGO-1” repair strategy in people with optic neuritis, which is often the first clinical episode of multiple sclerosis, met its primary endpoint, announced Biogen Idec in a press release on January 8. Treatment improved nerve impulse conduction in the eyes in a study of 82 people who had experienced a first episode of this inflammation of the optic nerve, although it is not yet clear if this improvement reflects repair of damage. The trial was sponsored by Biogen Idec. Also ongoing is a study of this compound in 419 people with relapsing forms of MS. Phase II studies such as this one are designed to provide indicators of safety, benefits and optimal dosing, but larger, longer phase III studies are required to support applications for marketing approval from drug regulatory agencies such as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. In MS, immune attacks lead to the loss of myelin that coats and protects nerve fibers in the brain and spinal cord. Repairing the nervous system was just a dream a few years ago. Today it holds significant promise as a strategy to restore the function that MS has taken from people; and reducing or stopping MS progression. This remarkable progress is due in large part to the National MS Society’s comprehensive efforts and multi-million dollar research investments. Today the Society is supporting 87 research projects in nervous system repair, with multi-year commitments totaling over $35 million. The human trials of anti-LINGO leverage research aimed at stimulating the body’s natural healing abilities. LINGO is a protein seen in nerve cells and cells that make nerve-insulating myelin (oligodendrocytes). Blockading this protein with a monoclonal antibody called anti-LINGO has been shown to promote myelin repair in animal models. In in people with relapsing-remitting or secondary-progressive MS, no serious adverse safety events were reported. Assessing visual outcomes in acute optic neuritis – inflammation of the optic nerve that often presents as the first clinical episode of MS – shows promise as a possible model for screening compounds for their ability to protect the nervous system and repair myelin. The optic nerve is one of the few locations in the central nervous system that can be assessed directly and noninvasively. For this phase II study, investigators recruited 82 people who had experienced a first episode of acute optic neuritis at 33 sites in Europe, Canada, and Australia for this trial, called the RENEW trial. Participants received intravenous infusions of 100 mg/kg anti-LINGO-1 or inactive placebo every four weeks for 24 weeks. The primary endpoint of the study was whether treatments improved optic nerve impulse conduction, as measured by visual evoked potential tests. Evoked potential tests measure the electrical activity of the brain in response to stimulation of specific sensory nerve pathways. They are able to detect the slowing of electrical conduction that may be caused by myelin damage along these pathways even when the change is too subtle to be noticed by the person or to show up on neurologic examination. Preliminary results reported in the press release suggest that 34% of the participants who completed the study showed improvement in optic nerve impulse conduction in the anti-LINGO-1 group, compared to on placebo, although it is not yet clear if this improvement reflects repair of damage.. No effect was shown on secondary endpoints, including change in thickness of the optic nerve fiber layers and visual function. Three serious adverse events were reported in those onanti-LINGO-1 and not in those on placebo, including two patients with hypersensitivity reactions occurring around the time of infusion and one elevation in liver enzymes, which resolved after treatment was discontinued. Otherwise the treatment was well tolerated. Analysis of this study is ongoing and full results will be presented at a medical meeting later this year, according to the press release. The SYNERGY study, which is assessing the safety and effectiveness of anti-LINGO-1 in 419 people with relapsing forms of MS, is ongoing and has completed enrollment. Full results from these studies will help to determine if anti-LINGO-1 can repair damage and restore function in people with MS. about research to repair the nervous system in MS. Multiple sclerosis is an unpredictable, often disabling . range from numbness and tingling to blindness and paralysis, and there is currently no cure for MS. The progress, severity and specific symptoms of MS in any one person cannot yet be predicted, but advances in and are leading to better understanding and moving us closer to . An estimated 1 million people live with MS in the United States. Most are diagnosed between the ages of 20 and 50, and it affects women three times more than men. © 2020 The National Multiple Sclerosis Society is a tax exempt 501(c)3 nonprofit organization.

The National Multiple Sclerosis Society and the United States Network for Pediatric MS Centers invite you to a monthly Difficult Case Webinar to discuss difficult cases of pediatric MS or other suspected demyelinating diseases. Calls are scheduled on alternating first Mondays or Fridays each month. Pediatric MS generally refers to onset of multiple sclerosis before 18 years of age. Approximately 3-5% of all individuals with MS will experience disease onset before the age of 16 (; ; ; ). Two recent consensus reports – one by  and one by the  provide helpful insights into the diagnosis and management of MS in the pediatric population. The Free-access Neurology supplement on Pediatric Demyelinating Disorders, from the International Pediatric MS Study Group published in 2016, provides a comprehensive review of pediatric demyelinating disorders including MS. A recent discussed genetic and environmental risk factors in pediatric MS. Environmental risk factors may include past exposure to Epstein-Barr Virus and second-hand tobacco smoke exposure (; ; ). Vitamin D appears to play an important role in immune function. A low vitamin D level is associated with an increased risk of developing MS. In someone already diagnosed, low vitamin D may increase the risk of relapse. (;  ). Low dietary iron may increase the risk of MS in children (). The gut microbiome has been implicated in smaller studies, but still needs validation in larger cohorts (). Obesity may increase the risk of developing MS in patients with genetic susceptibility to MS (i.e. with HLA-DRB1*15 alleles) (; ; ). 15-20% of MS patients report having a family member with MS. Children with a first-degree-relative with MS (i.e. parent or sibling) have a 2-4% increased risk of developing MS. (; ). Though no single gene has been shown to cause MS, many single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) across the genome have been associated with an increased risk in children and adults (). One susceptibility allele in particular, HLA-DRB1*15, has been associated with an increased risk of MS in children of European ancestry (. There also appears to be an interaction between negative DRB1*15 status and remote HSV-1 infection in increasing MS risk (). Maternal illness during pregnancy, pesticide exposure due to paternal occupation and the use of pesticides in the household during pregnancy may increase the likelihood that the unborn child will go on to develop MS. Cesarean section may decrease the chance of developing MS in childhood by 60%. (). Ancestry seems to play a role in adult MS; place of birth, regardless of ancestry, appears to factor more into pediatric MS (). The onset of puberty seems to increase the risk of developing MS in girls, who are 2-3 times more likely than post-pubertal boys to develop MS. There is no gender difference prior to puberty (; ; ). Later age at menarche may decrease the risk of developing MS (). Children experience 2-3 times more frequent relapses than adults with early MS (). This increased relapse frequency appears to persist over at least the first 6 years of the disease (). Children tend to be polysymptomatic at presentation but recover from relapses more quickly than adults, on average over 4 weeks compared to 6-8 weeks in adults (). Pediatric patients with MS are more likely to experience more frequent relapses compared to adults with MS, however disability accrual is slower in children compared to their adult counterparts (). Approximately one-third of children show evidence of significant cognitive impairment early on (), with significant progression within two years (), and over half demonstrate a decline in cognitive indices over 5 years. However, a subset of patients can show improvement over time, suggesting that early intervention may mitigate the cognitive impact of pediatric-onset MS (). Progression of motor disability (as measured by ) occurs more slowly in children than in adults (; ). Pediatric MS patients show disability at a younger age than their adult counterparts ( ). Pediatric MS patients have a higher T2 lesion burden than adults (). Post-mortem comparison found more extensive axonal injury in the demyelinating lesions of pediatric brains than adults. Therefore, childhood MS appears to be more inflammatory (). As is true in adults, children with two discrete demyelinating events separated in time and space meet criteria for a . The challenge lies in distinguishing MS from the numerous  in children that can also present with transient demyelinating episodes. The Pediatric International Study Group () proposed  for monophasic acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM – an essential feature of which is the presence of encephalopathy), variants of ADEM associated with a repeat episode, neuromyelitis optica (NMO), clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) and pediatric MS, and the group updated those definitions in . The International Study Group has also proposed a minimum  for use in pediatric patients with an initial inflammatory demyelinating event. This  (modified from ; ; ; ) demonstrates a diagnostic pathway for a child who has experienced an acute CNS demyelinating event who then has a second episode of neurologic dysfunction. Note that a subset of patients with ADEM (which is typically self-limited disease) experience relapses in disease activity. Some of these patients are subsequently reclassified as MS based on the nature of the clinical events, laboratory findings, and MRI changes. While the risk of developing MS following an episode of ADEM in childhood is <10%, the risk after an episode of CIS has been shown to be 26% to 62% in several studies that utilized the International Study Group criteria (; ; ). Classification of first and subsequent episodes of acquired CNS demyelination, along with its differential diagnoses, clinical features and outcomes, were reviewed by  Many of the disease modifying therapies prescribed for adults with MS are also prescribed for pediatric MS. These include conventional first line therapies like interferon beta 1A (Avonex®, Betaseron®) and Glatirimer acetate (Copaxone®). Safety and efficacy of these self-injected disease modifying MS drugs have been demonstrated in small retrospective studies, case studies and unblinded controlled trials , , ). Lack of tolerability or continued progression of disease despite these therapies may necessitate the use of other newer therapies. Pediatric MS is considered highly active, characterized by more frequent relapses, rapid lesion accrual early in the disease course and more cognitive and physical disability than in adult-onset MS (). In a cohort study comparing initial treatment with newer DMTs versus injectables in children with MS/CIS, newer DMTs provided better disease control, though long-term safety data are needed (). Due to the highly active nature of pediatric MS, and earlier age of conversion to secondary progressive MS, treatment with a high-efficacy DMT has been recommended ().   In 2018 the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved the use of the oral MS therapy fingolimod (Gilenya®, Novartis AG) for the treatment of children and adolescents 10 years of age or older with relapsing MS. Other oral therapies for MS, including dimethyl fumarate (Tecfidera®) and teriflunomide (Aubagio®), are currently under investigation in clinical trials for the treatment of pediatric MS.    An observational study of natalizumab (Tysabri®) showed that the safety and efficacy in children was similar to that seen in the adult MS population ().   In addition to the FDA-approved therapies used in pediatric MS, another treatment that is not FDA-approved for MS, known as rituximab (Rituxan®), has been studied in small trials of pediatric patients, demonstrating both safety and efficacy. Rituximab is widely used in other pediatric autoimmune disorders and has a favorable safety profile (). Ultimately, starting or switching a disease modifying therapy in children and adolescents requires an in-depth discussion between the provider, child and family. It should include the goals and expectations of the child and family, how the drug is expected to control MS and the side effects, risks, alternatives and any monitoring that must be performed before and during therapy. In this way, providers, patients and families can participate in a shared decision-making process to determine the therapy that best meets the individual needs of each patient. The International Pediatric MS Study Group has written a series of articles highlighting the advances, unanswered questions and challenges in diagnosing and treating MS in children. These articles have been published as a  in the journal, .    A publication from the MS International Federation (MSIF) summarizes the   In any patient diagnosed with pediatric MS, poor academic performance, difficulty with peer relations,  low self-esteem, difficulty with accepting the diagnosis and depression are all important considerations. While a detailed psychosocial evaluation by a trained professional should always be pursued,  can provide additional crucial information, resources and networks for both patients and their families who are faced with this complex and life-long disease.

For some, these treatments reduce the number and severity of attacks and slow disease activity.   We are making significant progress in stopping MS: The Society joined with NIH to launch a therapy trial of the re-purposed therapy ibudilast in primary-progressive and secondary-progressive MS. suggest that ibudilast significantly slowed the rate of brain atrophy (shrinkage), which has been linked to cognitive and physical disability in MS.This therapy has been designated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration as a “Fast Track Product” in terms of its development as a possible treatment of progressive MS. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved the expansion of the use of the oral MS therapy Gilenya® (fingolimod, Novartis AG) and adolescents 10 years of age or older with relapsing MS. This is the first therapy specifically approved to treat pediatric MS. The Alliance is an unprecedented global collaboration of MS organisations, researchers, health professionals, the pharmaceutical industry, companies, trusts, foundations, donors and people affected by progressive MS, working together to address the unmet needs of people with progressive MS ─ rallying the global community to find solutions. The mission is to accelerate the development of effective treatments for people with progressive forms of multiple sclerosis to improve quality of life worldwide. There is increasing understanding that malfunctioning mitochondria, the tiny energy producers of cells (like battery packs), may contribute to nervous system damage in MS, opening up possibilities for preventing that damage.  An international team has reported the feasibility and safety of using a patient’s own altered blood cells to reduce immune responses against specific components of myelin. The National MS Society-launched MS Outcome Assessments Consortium and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration continue to clear a pathway for a new tool for improving and speeding clinical trials in MS. This team already has generated a new database containing nearly 2500 patient records from the placebo arms of nine MS clinical trials is now available for research by qualified investigators.  Identifying the causes of MS, and the underlying mechanisms and biological pathways involved in MS injury to the brain and spinal cord, will expose new targets for the development of treatments to stop the damage that causes disability. Diagnosing progressive disease based on biomarkers, in addition to clinical presentation would enable the testing of therapies earlier, promising better ways of protecting the nervous system from MS injury. High impact research areas include: Clarifying the destructive and protective roles of the adaptive and innate immune system, including both infiltrating and compartmentalized cells Determining the causes of tissue injury at different stages of disease, and whether neurodegeneration and demyelination can be independent events in MS Determining how evolving MRI sequences relate to pathological changes in the central nervous system Leveraging big data and transformative technologies to identify and interrogate relevant biological pathways and clinical/demographic features that influence disability progression Ensuring access to human central nervous system tissues/cells from MS patients and healthy controls for the purpose of gaining a thorough understanding of the neuropathology of MS Determining the specific pathologic underpinnings of MS progression Identifying objective indicators of disease activity that mark the transition to progression, measure treatment impact, and predict an individual’s course and response to therapy Determining mechanisms underlying the causes of progression in the absence of acute inflammation or relapses, the transition from relapsing to secondary progressive MS, and whether primary progressive and secondary progressive MS have similar biological underpinnings Developing better animal models that recapitulate human pathology to inform the study of the mechanisms underlying MS and progression Developing tools that allow better treatment decision making and personalized medicine, including therapy risks/benefits Testing approaches for the prevention and treatment of MS progression including repurposed/repositioned FDA-approved therapies, impact of early aggressive treatment vs. step therapy, and cell-based therapy  Read more about our successes and goals for stopping MS. Understanding and stopping MS in its tracks requires a better understanding of the role that the immune system plays in the inflammatory attacks on myelin and, very possibly, in the injury to axons (the wire-like nerve fibers) that contributes to longer-term disability. We Support academic and commercial research leading toward clinical trials of new therapies to stop damage and progression of disability; we are feeding the pipeline in several ways and pursuing therapies for EVERYONE with MS. Understanding the processes that lead to tissue damage in MS is crucial to our focus on reversing this damage to regain function through nervous system and myelin repair.

This study has been published in JAMA Neurology (). An April 28, 2015 press release notes that safety and effectiveness were maintained over two years in an extension study, results of which have not yet been published. Synthon has filed Abbreviated New Drug Applications with the U.S. FDA for approval of GTR as a generic glatiramer acetate. Glatiramer acetate is a synthetic compound that simulates myelin basic protein, a component of the myelin that insulates nerve fibers in the brain and spinal cord. This therapy seems to block myelin-damaging T-cells through a mechanism that is not completely understood. Currently glatiramer acetate is available as and is approved by the FDA to reduce the frequency of relapses in patients with relapsing-remitting MS and for use in individuals who have experienced a first clinical episode (clinically-isolated syndrome) and have MRI features that are consistent with MS. In April 2015, a generic equivalent of Copaxone called “Glatopa”™ (Sandoz, a Novartis company, developed in collaboration with Momenta Pharmaceuticals) was . This study compared another generic version of glatiramer acetate with Copaxone. Participants were randomly assigned to receive GTR (20 mg/day injected under the skin), Copaxone (20 mg/day injected under the skin), or inactive placebo (injected daily under the skin) for 9 months. The primary goal of the study was to compare the number of active MS lesions on MRI brain scans in those who were given GTR, Copaxone, or placebo during months 7, 8, and 9.  The results show that this MRI measure of disease activity was significantly reduced in both the Synthon GTR and the Copaxone groups when compared with the placebo group within a range that indicates equivalence. Reported adverse reactions were similar between the GTR and Copaxone groups and in line with injection site reactions and others known to be associated with Copaxone. The results were announced in a March 27, 2014 press release from Synthon BV and have now been published in JAMA Neurology (). In an ongoing extension study, participants in any of the groups who completed the first 9 months were being treated with GTR (20 mg/day) for 15 months. An April 28, 2015 press release notes that safety and effectiveness were maintained over the entire two-year period, but full details will be submitted for publication in a peer-reviewed medical journal and presented at future scientific meetings. In November 2011, Synthon filed an Abbreviated New Drug Application with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for a once daily 20mg/ml formulation of marketing approval of GTR as a generic equivalent to glatiramer acetate. In early 2014, the company filed an application for a three times a week, 40mg/ml formulation. “We look forward to hearing the results of the FDA’s determination of the equivalence of this medication,” says Dr. Bruce Bebo, Executive Vice President, Research at the National MS Society. “Generic options can help to increase access to comprehensive, quality healthcare for everyone living with MS.” Copaxone is a registered trademark of Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd.

e5f20083-ab02-4f86-9c3d-e88ce0c81c57,"Complementary & Alternative Medicines Find Programs & Services in Your Area COVID-19 Vaccine Guidance for People Living with MS     Preliminary Results from Phase 2 Clinical Trial of Sex Hormone Estriol in Women with MS Show Interes Preliminary Results from Phase 2 Clinical Trial of Sex Hormone Estriol in Women with MS Show Interesting Results that Call for Further Study Early results from a Phase 2 clinical trial that tested the ability of the sex hormone estriol (TrimestaTM, Synthetic Biologics), in combination with Copaxone® (glatiramer acetate, Teva Neuroscience), in women with relapsing-remitting MS offer valuable insights  which invite further study of this hormone as a potential approach for treating women with multiple sclerosis. Lead investigator Rhonda Voskuhl, MD (University of California, Los Angeles) and colleagues reported these findings today at the Annual Meeting of the American Academy of Neurology. This study was funded by the National MS Society, additional private donors, and the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke. Synthetic Biologics, a Maryland pharmaceutical company, provided the estriol for the trial at no charge. MS affects women two to three times as often as men. This demographic observation along with a series of other gender differences prompted the National MS Society to launch a special five-year, $10 million research initiative to explore the importance of the meaning behind these observations as they apply to the MS disease process. Among the findings from the 50 projects supported through this initiative was the possibility that the female hormone estriol may help protect against the immune attacks that underlie MS. Read more about this success. Estriol levels naturally rise significantly during later pregnancy, a time when many women’s MS disease activity declines. This led some to suspect that estriol may be responsible for this easing of symptoms during pregnancy. Dr. Voskuhl and others explored this lead in mice with an MS-like disease. Later, with National MS Society support, Dr. Voskuhl conducted a small, early-phase trial of estriol in 12 women with relapsing-remitting MS. Results suggested that estriol might decrease disease activity. The phase 2 study of estriol combined with Copaxone that was reported today was a direct result of this initiative. Phase 2 trials such as this one are designed to provide information about a therapy’s safety and potential effectiveness, but longer, larger Phase 3 studies are needed to confirm potential benefits and risks and to gain approval from drug regulators such as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Estriol is one of several estrogen sex hormones in the body. Some forms of estrogen are available for prescription as methods of birth control and for the treatment of symptoms associated with menopause. Estriol has been used in Europe and Asia as a treatment for symptoms of menopause. The oral form of estriol used in this trial is not available in the United States. Investigators recruited 164 women with relapsing-remitting MS between the ages of 18-50 at 16 sites across the U.S. All participants were on standard Copaxone therapy (injected daily under the skin) and were randomly assigned to also take estriol in pill form, or inactive placebo, for two years. The primary outcome measured was the effects of the treatment combination on relapse rates. Secondary outcomes included several clinical and MRI (magnetic resonance imaging), measures of disability progression and cognitive function. There were also  laboratory and gynecological tests built into the study to monitor for potential safety issues associated with the use of estriol and other estrogen hormones, including breast and endometrial (uterine) cancers. The preliminary results showed that the combination of Copaxone and estriol appeared safe over the two-year trial period, and there were no severe adverse events experienced by those in either treatment group. After the first year of the study, those on the combined therapy had a significant reduction in relapse rates compared to those on Copaxone plus placebo, and secondary cognitive testing suggested possible benefit for those on the combined treatment. However, after the second year of the study, there was no statistical difference in relapse rates between those on Copaxone combined with estriol versus those on Copaxone combined with placebo. Since these are preliminary results that were presented at a medical meeting, without peer review as of yet, we are likely to learn more about the significance and implications of the study’s results when the full findings are published in a peer-reviewed medical journal. “These preliminary results are intriguing and invite further research,” noted Timothy Coetzee, PhD, Chief Advocacy, Services, and Research Officer of the National MS Society. “We look forward to seeing the full data when it is published in a medical journal, which should help determine next best steps for the possible development of estriol as a potential therapy for women with MS.”   Multiple sclerosis is an unpredictable, often disabling . range from numbness and tingling to blindness and paralysis, and there is currently no cure for MS.

77314a19-dc77-4bf7-b9c7-5cc6306a7733,"New Drug Shows Promise in Treating Secondary Progressive Multiple Sclerosis — Half of all people with MS are ultimately diagnosed with secondary progressive MS. This new treatment is the first to slow progression of the disease. Is a breakthrough treatment for secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (SPMS) finally on the horizon? It’s still too early to answer that question, but in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, a new Novartis drug called siponimod (BAF132) was able to delay progression of the disease in people with SPMS, many of whom had already reached a stage of advanced disability. The study, funded by Novartis, included 1,651 participants from 31 countries. The results were recently published in the peer-reviewed journal . After three months of use, siponimod was able to slow down the disease’s effects by 21 percent and reduced the risk of six-month disease progression by 26 percent. Participants who took a daily oral dose of siponimod also lost less brain volume, had fewer brain lesions, and reduced their number of annual relapses by 55 percent. However, siponimod didn’t improve how well the participants could walk. The results of this study show that siponimod “can delay disability progression in typical established SPMS patients, where other approaches tested so far have been unsuccessful,” Dr. Ludwig Kappos, a professor at University Hospital of Basel in Switzerland and the principal study investigator, said in a . “These data are all the more impressive when considering that the majority of patients already had advanced disability when starting treatment.” Other experts are more cautiously optimistic, pointing out that siponimod was tested against a placebo and for a relatively short amount of time. “There’s an indication that siponimod could be useful in SPMS, but we need more studies,” said Dr. Jaime Imitola, director of the Progressive Multiple Sclerosis Multidisciplinary Clinic and Translational Research Program at The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center. SPMS is an advanced form of MS, an autoimmune disease that disrupts the normal flow of information in the brain as well as between the brain and body. Symptoms vary from person to person, but numbness and tingling, trouble walking, extreme fatigue, dizziness, pain, depression, and even paralysis. The estimates that more than 2.3 million people have MS worldwide. At least two to three times more women than men are affected. The majority of people with MS initially receive a diagnosis of relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS). They experience occasional periods of time in which their symptoms improve or may even go away for a while. But within a decade of initial diagnosis, of people with RRMS progress to SPMS. With this form of MS, symptoms no longer wax or wane, but stick around — and get steadily worse. While researchers are always looking for new treatments for SPMS, so far other potential drugs haven’t produced . Of the 15 medications approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treatment of RRMS, for SPMS. Siponimod is what’s known as a “disease-modifying therapy.” This is a type of drug that works to keep a disease from getting worse. By binding to lymphocytes, a type of white blood cell, and blocking them from entering the central nervous system, siponimod is able to reduce the inflammation that’s responsible for so many SPMS symptoms. “The challenge is going to be how to determine who is going to respond to this medicine and who will not,” said Bruce Bebo, PhD, executive vice president of research at the National Multiple Sclerosis Society. “It looks like the younger and closer to the conversion to SPMS you are might be factors that contribute to a response to therapy. But until [siponimod] is used more broadly, it will be hard to know for sure.” Bebo expects the risks and side effects of siponimod to be similar to the immunosuppressive drug fingolimod (Gilenya), which has a similar mechanism of action. These include a slightly higher risk for infection, slowed heart rate, macular edema, and liver damage. Novartis plans to file for approval of siponimod for SPMS with the FDA this year, which means it could be available in late 2019 or early 2020. In the meantime, Imitola stresses that it’s important for patients with MS to get a prompt diagnosis and start treatment with a MS specialist as soon as possible. “Why wait until a patient is declared to have SPMS, around 10–15 years after relapses, to reduce progression?” Imitola asked. “If you stop the disease in its tracks early on with potent medications, then a patient may never get to SPMS. That is the goal. It’s clear that the next generation of MS medications are changing the natural history of the disease. We need more medications that tackle the neurodegeneration in MS.” — Understanding Secondary-Progressive Multiple Sclerosis Promising Treatments and Clinical Trials for Relapsing-Remitting MS Understanding Secondary-Progressive Multiple Sclerosis Secondary-progressive MS (SPMS) is a form of multiple sclerosis.

He and his wife Terri, a kindergarten teacher in Milwaukee Public Schools, were enjoying their two year old daughter, Lauren, and expecting their second daughter, Meredith, to arrive that summer. Jeffrey's life was full: By day he worked hard in the courtroom; by night he spent time with his family, practiced amateur speed skating, and taught law as an adjunct professor at Marquette University. There was no time for MS. Jeffrey began to experience episodes of mental blankness. He would lose his presence of thought, leaving him unable to recall what he had just said and not knowing what to say next. A jarring and frightening experience for anyone! These episodes became so frequent that Jeffrey eventually retired from his position at the law firm. He soon discovered that he was not alone; as one-half of all people with MS experience similar cognitive issues. He found that these symptoms are often not touched upon at the time of diagnosis, leaving patients at a loss to understand and manage their symptoms of confusion, forgetfulness, and inability to concentrate. Jeffrey decided he would break the silence and talk about the ""elephant"" in the room. In his books, Facing the Cognitive Challenges of Multiple Sclerosis, 2nd Edition and Mental Sharpening Stones: Manage the Cognitive Challenges of Multiple Sclerosis, Jeffrey tackles the sometimes painful issue of cognitive struggles for people with MS, from the patient's perspective. Jeffrey is also an outspoken volunteer advocate regarding cognitive disability and MS. His efforts, on behalf of the National MS Society, Wisconsin Chapter, have helped to secure funding for an MS early diagnosis program for indigent women in Wisconsin, as well as an income tax check-off for voluntary giving to fund MS programs and services. He has been a guest on , NPR, numerous webcasts and national television and talk radio shows.  Jeffrey was inducted into the and , and has spoken and been interviewed world-wide regarding the MS cognition topic.  He authored numerous articles for U.S and international publications, and in 2014 his first MS book was translated into Polish and in 2015 his second MS book was translated into Dutch.  All of Jeffrey's royalties from his MS books are directly donated to the Society. In 2017, Jeffrey's MS Walk team [Team SUMMIT] well surpassed the cumulative total of raising $100,000.00 for the National MS Society. Jeffrey continues to enjoy ice speedskating and spending family time with his wife, Terri, two adorable daughters, Lauren and Meredith. © 2020 The National Multiple Sclerosis Society is a tax exempt 501(c)3 nonprofit organization.

7207aea3-d653-444d-aae4-f89c8848638e,"Multiple Sclerosis (MS) causes different symptoms in different people at different times. No two people living with MS experience it the same way, and the type and severity of symptoms will also be affected by whether people are tired, hot, fighting infection or just feeling ‘under the weather’. Here you can find information about some of the more common symptoms. Most people will only experience a small number of these. The combination, severity and frequency will be different for everyone.  Outside influences can exacerbate symptoms – hot weather may make fatigue worse and an infection can cause a temporary worsening of existing symptoms, or give rise to a symptom previously not experienced. New symptoms may not always be down to your MS. It is important to remember that not every ache and pain is connected to MS and, if a new symptom persists, you should seek medical advice. In multiple sclerosis, the protective covering of the central nervous system – myelin – is attacked and damaged, causing interruption to the usual flow of impulses along nerve fibres. Because this damage occurs at various sites, the symptoms each person experiences can vary enormously. These areas of damaged myelin are referred to as ‘lesions’ or ‘plaques’. Symptoms can come and go; some are much more responsive to treatment and others can be more difficult to manage. Sometimes damage is temporary and the body is able to make a partial repair but at other times the damage is more severe and becomes permanent. Most symptoms can be treated. In some people with MS, problems with balance can cause unsteadiness, clumsiness, and affect limb movement and posture. Areas of the brain involved in balance and movement can be affected by the inflammation associated with MS. Messages from the brain to the body can be disrupted, resulting in a loss of coordination. Muscle spasms, fatigue, tremor, numbness and neuropathic pain in the legs can also cause balance problems, as walking becomes more tentative. See the relevant sections below for more information on these. Once these are managed any balance issue may be eased. For some people, problems with balance are short-term, for others they may last longer. There are no specific medications for balance. However, it is important to make sure that any balance issues are not being caused by something else. For example, relating to another symptom or an inner ear infection. If muscle weakness is affecting you, your MS nurse can refer you to a neuro-physiotherapist who can develop an exercise programme to assist you in addressing this. Bladder problems are one of the most common symptoms in MS. In fact, problems with the bladder are common, whether a person has MS, or not. There is no need to feel embarrassed, and talking to your GP and MS nurse, is the first step to addressing this symptom. Urgency – the need to ‘go’ with little or no warning Frequency – having to ‘go’ more than eight times per day or hesitancy Retention – you can empty the bladder, but have a feeling of incompletion Many people with MS will experience bowel problems to some degree – constipation and difficulties emptying the bowel are the most common. The other problem area is incontinence and lack of control over the bowel opening. Again, a referral to a continence advisor will help to find ways in which to deal with problems in all these areas. Many people experience a combination of these symptoms. There are medications and treatments available to help with bladder issues (2). Your GP and MS nurse can also refer you to a continence advisor (3) to help you find ways to deal with bladder problems. Almost half of people with MS will have cognitive problems (4). These will range from fairly mild on a day-to-day basis to an increased worsening during a relapse. Initially, people may not realise that their cognitive problems are associated with their MS. The most common problems affect memory, information processing, problem solving, word-finding and concentration.  There are a number of things you can do to manage these such as Avoiding jobs which need concentration when fatigued or stressed Speak to your MS nurse about whether you would benefit from such a referral.  Symptoms can become more pronounced if you are tired, upset or anxious and sometimes it is difficult to distinguish between cognition, depression and fatigue. It is important you talk to your GP and MS nurse about what you are experiencing. The National Institute of Care Excellence (NICE) stated in their guidelines for the management of MS (5), that people with persistent memory or cognitive problems are considered for referral to both an occupational therapist and neuropsychologist to assess and manage these symptoms. Fatigue is more than tiredness, it is a feeling of complete exhaustion and a common symptom of MS. It is an invisible symptom that is difficult to describe and whilst not obvious to other people, it can be quite difficult to manage. There are a number of ways in which people learn to live with their fatigue and find ways to manage it effectively. ‘Energy is a limited resource. Manage your use of it carefully. One big effort in a day is enough – two is too many and three is setting yourself up to fail.’ There are a number of ways in which people manage their fatigue (5). Initially, other things should be considered to make sure fatigue isn’t being caused by anxiety, depression, anaemia, thyroid disease, or even difficulties with sleeping. Sometimes a drug called amantadine may help ease symptoms of fatigue. Other things that may help are gentle exercise like yoga, cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) and mindfulness. All of which are suggested in the NICE guidelines section on easing the symptoms of MS (5). Some MS therapy centres offer fatigue management courses. It is worth asking your GP or MS nurse if this is something offered within your hospital trust. ‘Being well rested can make a huge difference to overall wellness – listen to your body!’ Foot drop is a symptom experienced by some people with MS and is caused by a weakness in the ankle that causes the foot to drag along the ground or hang down when walking. People who experience foot drop are more vulnerable to tripping and falling. Strengthening exercises as recommended by a physiotherapist The use of an ankle splint to hold the foot in a rigid position. A referral to an orthotist would be required Using functional electrical stimulation (FES). FES uses small electrodes either stuck to the surface of the skin or implanted under the skin, to deliver small electrical impulses to activate the muscles and support the foot’s movement into a more natural position for walking (6). The FES device is activated by a pressure sensor worn in the shoe. A physiotherapist referral would be required Some people with MS experience a temporary worsening of symptoms in heat (7) – for example during warm weather, or while taking a bath. You might feel fatigued, or experience an increase in pain, or feel your cognitive symptoms are worse. A change in body temperature can also give rise to Uhthoff’s Sign – causing blurred vision. See the ‘Sensory’ section for more details. Although uncomfortable, such symptoms are temporary and will resolve when the body is cooled down. If you are sensitive to heat, there are a number of strategies to help keep cool in hot weather including taking regular cold drinks, wrapping a damp towel around your neck, and putting ice in a tray of water in front of a fan to create an air-conditioning effect. Loss of mobility is defined as any limitation of movement caused by different factors, such as lack of motor coordination, muscle weakness, spasticity (muscular rigidity and spasms), balance problems and fatigue, all of which are associated with MS. Mobility difficulties can cause general problems with day to day living and make tasks such as getting in and out of a car and going up and down stairs difficult and frustrating. ‘Take the advice from the experts, I was too stubborn to use my sticks so I had loads of falls.’ Depending on what may be attributing to the mobility issue, there may be various treatments available, from spasticity medications and fatigue management, to seeing a physiotherapist and learning about exercises and stretches that may help. Fampridine was licensed to help improve walking speed, but is not recommended in the 2014 NICE guidelines for the treatment of MS (5) as it was found to not be a cost effective treatment. It can be paid for privately with a private prescription that needs to be obtained from a neurologist. Pain is often described as a stabbing, burning, tingling or pins and needles feeling. It’s subjective and no two people will experience it in the same way. There are two main types of pain that can occur – neuropathic and musculoskeletal. If the cause of the pain is found to be neuropathic, medication may be prescribed. If it’s musculoskeletal you may be referred to a physiotherapist. Pain can be challenging to manage, but there are many medications, therapies and management strategies. ‘Mindfulness helps maintain equanimity in the face of fluctuating symptoms and the uncertainties of MS.’ The impairment of sensory perception includes the loss of feeling in limbs and other areas. The sensations can include tingling, a crawling feeling over the skin, numbness or tightness, and sometimes pain. The medical term for these uncomfortable abnormal sensations is dysesthesia or paresthesia. These feelings are classed as neuropathic pain symptoms. Another sensory symptom is the feeling of an ‘electrical rush’ radiating from the neck and down the spine, when the head is flexed towards the chest. This is known as Lhermitte’s Sign and was named after the French neurologist who first described it in 1924. Lhermitte’s Sign is thought to be a signal that the nerves are inflamed and flexing the head causes this transient feeling. Lhermitte’s Sign is associated with MS, sometimes even before diagnosis, but is not sufficient in itself to confirm a diagnosis of MS as it is associated with other conditions. It is important to talk to your GP if you are experiencing this sensory symptom to rule out any other causes, such as injury to the neck. Another sensory symptom associated with heat fatigue is Uhthoff’s Phenomenon or Uhthoff’s Sign. This is a temporary worsening of symptoms – often visual disturbances, but sometimes motor or sensory symptoms - caused by a rise in body temperature, for example while exercising or taking a hot bath. The visual symptoms may present as double vision, a blurring of vision, and loss of colour vision or a ‘greying-out’ of vision. The symptom takes its name from Wilhelm Uhthoff, a German ophthalmologist, who first described this symptom in 1890.  Uhthoff’s Sign can be worrying, but if it happens stop exercising or move away from the heat source, and cool the body down with a cold drink or fan. Once you are at normal body temperature, Uhthoff’s sign will slowly abate. Banding is a sensory symptom where it feels as if there is a tight elastic band around the ribs, or one side of the torso. Sometimes it is called the ‘MS hug’, although it can also affect feet and hands, as if you are wearing gloves or socks. If you experience tightness across the chest, contact your GP. Banding associated with MS can be treated with pain medication and, although uncomfortable, most people find it will pass without needing treatment. Some people find that wearing tight clothing, such as a sports vest or elasticated gloves or socks, actually helps alleviate the discomfort. Be careful to ensure you are not restricting your blood circulation. Speech and swallowing disorders can arise as a symptom of MS for some people. Speech disorders include dysarthria – slurring of speech due to weakness or lack of coordination in the muscles used in speech and dysphagia – swallowing difficulties. Difficulties with speech can develop at any stage. However, they are more common in the later stages of the condition. Studies have found that around a third of people with MS experience swallowing difficulties to some degree (8). This can be caused by damage affecting the coordination of the various muscles involved in swallowing. The result can be difficulty chewing or episodes of coughing or choking when eating and drinking. If swallowing problems are more advanced and eating is putting you at risk, nutrition can be provided through a procedure called percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG). A PEG is a feeding method whereby a small tube is inserted directly into the stomach through the abdominal wall. This helps to ensure sufficient nutritional intake and reduces the risk of aspiration, where food can get into the lungs, causing chest infections. If you are experiencing these symptoms, contact your MS nurse who can refer you to a speech and language therapist. Spasticity is a symptom where the signals from the brain are interrupted and the muscle remains in its shortened, contracted state. This causes the affected muscle to feel stiff or tight and to be resistant to movement. The degree of spasticity will vary from person to person and can greatly impact on many activities. Nevertheless, spasticity can be successfully managed. Sometimes spasticity is triggered by infections or bladder and bowel problems. Left untreated, spasticity can lead to complications such as frozen or immobilised joints and pressure sores. There are many ways in which spasticity can be alleviated (5). Drug treatment may be offered by your medical team. The most commonly prescribed are baclofen, dantrolene and tizanidine. They all help to relax the muscles. In some cases people may find the drugs are not effective, or cause unwanted side effects. The NICE Guidelines (5) suggest being referred to a specialist spasticity service for further treatment. This could include seeing a physiotherapist and/or occupational therapist for specific exercises and stretches which may help. In some cases where the drug treatments may not be effective, Botox may be considered. Botox is injected directly into the affected muscle to help reduce the tightness caused by spasticity. Sativex is a cannabis based spray that may help reduce spasticity. It is not generally available on the NHS. For more detailed information, see our Choices booklet, . Spasms are different to spasticity in that, although they involve similar muscle contractions they can come on very suddenly, and relax just as suddenly. Most spasms occur in the legs and arms, and less commonly the throat. Spasms can be painful and lead to interrupted sleep. The same drug treatments for spasticity are offered to help reduce spasm. An MS nurse with a holistic perspective has written about other suggested ways in which spasms can be managed. They are exercise, magnesium (either by tablet/spray/powder, or by rubbing directly into the skin), CBD oil and TENS machine (9). Many people with MS use other complementary therapies to help manage spasm too. A combination approach to treating spasms is often a more preferred option. ‘Do regular exercise (even when you don’t feel like it) it can be really helpful for many symptoms like stiffness and fatigue.’ Many people with MS may experience tremor in some way. There are different types of tremor; for some it may be very mild and only noticeable by the individual. For others it may be difficult to manage and incredibly disabling. Intention tremor is the most commonly experienced type. This is involuntary and a movement that is uncontrolled. Intention tremor in the upper limbs often worsens when reaching for an object. This can be exacerbated by stress and also fatigue. For mild tremor, adjustments in posture such as holding an arm closer to your body when moving a cup to your mouth, can help with the stability of the movement. Your MS nurse or GP can refer you to an occupational therapist who can offer practical advice in managing tremor – perhaps suggesting aids or appliances which can help, such as cups with easy-grip handles. A physiotherapist can also set up an exercise programme to increase strength in muscles which are weaker and may be contributing to the tremor’s severity. There are some drug therapies but these often only provide minor benefit. Sometimes the beta blocker, propranolol can have some effect, whilst in other cases, Botox has been shown to reduce head tremors. There are several problems that can affect the vision of people with MS. The most common symptom is optic neuritis – inflammation of the optic nerve, which is also one of the more common first symptoms that can lead to a diagnosis of MS. Optic neuritis is sometimes treated with steroids to help reduce the inflammation. Diplopia (double vision) – Often an early symptom of MS but can also occur as part of a relapse of MS where steroids may help Nystagmus – rhythmical oscillations of the eye ball which sometimes goes unnoticed by the person, but is obvious to others. A difficult symptom to treat but occasionally the drugs gabapentin and memantine may be offered Sometimes a temporary onset, or worsening of symptoms is actually a relapse. It can often be difficult to determine if you are having a relapse. It is important to let your GP and MS nurse know if you think you are experiencing a change in symptoms so they can determine if it is a clinical relapse and therefore if treatment is required. According to the NICE guidelines (5) a relapse can be diagnosed by a GP or neurologist if, ‘The person with MS has developed new symptoms or has a worsening of existing symptoms, and these symptoms have lasted for more than 24 hours in the absence of infection or any other cause after a stable period of a least one month.’ From multiple sclerosis symptoms, treatments and more to living life with MS, our Choices booklets cover a wide range of topics.

18bf563e-fb96-4dfa-821b-c7287d22742f,"— — Some people with multiple sclerosis (MS) feel their symptoms worsen when they become overheated. When elevated body temperature impairs vision, it’s called Uhthoff’s phenomenon. Uhthoff’s occurs because of damage to the optic nerve. It interferes with the transmission of signals between the eyes and the brain. Symptoms include blurry or reduced vision, and it’s often one of the first symptoms of MS. Uhthoff’s phenomenon is sometimes called “Uhthoff’s syndrome” or “Uhthoff’s sign.” The condition was named for William Uhthoff, a German professor of ophthalmology who lived from 1853 to 1927. MS is a chronic disease in which the immune system attacks myelin, the protective covering surrounding nerve cells in the central nervous system (CNS). Inflammation damages the nerve cells and causes lesions and scar tissue to form. This damage impairs the ability of the CNS to send signals to the rest of the body. Symptoms of MS vary depending on the location of the lesions. Some symptoms include: A 2011 reported that between 60 and 80 percent of people with MS experience heat sensitivity. Demyelinated fibers in the CNS are hypersensitive to a rise in body temperature. This makes it more difficult for the body to receive internal signals. This can result in a worsening of MS-related symptoms and cause blurred vision. The good news is that heat sensitivity and the related worsening of MS symptoms are only temporary. This is called pseudo-exacerbation. It doesn’t mean new lesions, lasting neurological damage, or a rapid progression of MS. Uhthoff’s is only temporary, so there’s no need to panic if you develop symptoms. But if your vision is seriously impaired, ask someone to assist you. MS-related heat sensitivity doesn’t cause new symptoms, but it can aggravate existing symptoms. Besides vision problems, these can include: Treatment involves cooling your body temperature. If you’re outdoors on a hot or humid day, find a shady area to rest. If you can, stay indoors and take advantage of air conditioning or a fan. You could also take a cool bath or shower. And drink a cool beverage or use ice cubes to cool your body. Once you’ve cooled down, symptoms generally improve quickly. Fever can also cause Uhthoff’s. When you have a fever, the remedy is to treat the underlying cause. Medical intervention isn’t necessary for symptoms of Uhthoff’s. If you’ve experienced it before, you’ll know what to expect. But it’s easy to confuse heat-related symptoms with other medical emergencies. you’ve never experienced heat-related symptoms of MS before you’re uncertain that your symptoms are Uhthoff’s or MS-related your symptoms don’t improve after you’ve cooled down To avoid Uhthoff’s phenomenon, the key is to avoid overheating in the first place. Try to stay indoors and use an air conditioner or fan during times of extreme heat and humidity. This is especially helpful when exercising. Also avoid hot showers, baths, and saunas. Outdoors, try to stay in the shade and avoid intense exercise. Use cooling products such as cooling vests, neck wraps, and portable fans. Enjoy icy beverages, and avoid hot tubs and swimming pools heated above 85°F (29°C). In some cases, MS and Uhthoff’s don’t go together. If you’re not sensitive to the heat, there’s no need to avoid activities you enjoy. While heat and humidity can trigger a wide range of MS-related symptoms, so can cold weather. High humidity or cold temperatures can trigger involuntary muscle spasms or stiffness, called spasticity. If you have heat- or cold-related symptoms of MS, it’s best to avoid exposure to any extreme temperature. If you’re thinking of relocating for health reasons, it’s a good idea to spend some time in a different climate first to see if it makes a difference. Uhthoff’s phenomenon is easy to treat and doesn’t mean your MS symptoms are worsening. But if you’ve never experienced symptoms of Uhthoff’s or of MS, see your doctor. — — Promising Treatments and Clinical Trials for Relapsing-Remitting MS Could an Undiagnosed Sleep Disorder be Causing Your MS Fatigue?

After childbirth there is a higher risk for relapse, and many women are advised to go back on their disease-modifying therapies as soon as possible. Since there is insufficient evidence to support the safety of breastfeeding while using any of these therapies, most babies born to moms with MS are bottle fed, despite known health benefits of breastfeeding for infants. Previous studies of postpartum relapse and breastfeeding have had mixed results, and more research is needed to help guide postpartum treatment decisions. Investigators recruited 201women with relapsing-remitting MS who had voluntarily enrolled in a German MS and pregnancy registry between January 2008 and June 2012. Women completed an interview and questionnaire in each remaining trimester of pregnancy, the first 6 weeks postpartum, and at 3, 6, and 12 months postpartum. Of these participants, 59.7% intended to breastfeed exclusively (without supplemental bottle feedings) for at least 2 months and 40.3% breastfed and included supplemental feeding or did not breastfeed. Within the first 6 months after delivery, significantly more women (38.3%) who did not breastfeed exclusively had a relapse compared with women (24.2%) who breastfed exclusively for at least 2 months. After 6 months postpartum, 22.5% of the women who breastfed exclusively for the first 2 months postpartum had their first postpartum relapse, compared with 8.6% of those who did not breastfeed exclusively. Taking the entire postpartum period into account, the overall risk of having at least one postpartum relapse was the same (about 47%) between the two groups, suggesting that any beneficial effect of exclusive breastfeeding lasts about 6 months after delivery.  The team (Kerstin Hellwig, University Bochum, Germany, and colleagues) has published results in JAMA Neurology (). Co-author Annette Langer-Gould, MD, PhD (Kaiser Permanente Southern California) is funded by the National MS Society to conduct additional research into this question This study contributes further evidence suggesting that exclusive breastfeeding may provide a modest protective treatment against postpartum relapses during the first six months in women with MS. It is unclear whether exclusive breastfeeding was somehow a protective factor that prevented relapses, or whether the women selected for the study shared another risk factor associated with fewer relapses. However, it indicates that exclusive breastfeeding does not increase the risk of postpartum relapse, an important consideration for women with MS of childbearing age.

The authors comment that it is likely that these genes combine with other genetic and environmental factors to explain what is often a worse clinical experience of MS in African Americans. The study was funded by the National MS Society and others. Genes are known to play a role in determining who is susceptible to developing MS, and may also influence the course of the disease. Focusing on ethnic groups with varying susceptibility to MS and searching for what is common and what is different in their genes may help pinpoint genes that contribute to MS risk and clues to the cause of this disease. MS can be especially active in African Americans. African Americans are more likely to experience more relapses, greater disability, and to require mobility assistance earlier in the disease course than Caucasians. The team used data from genome-wide studies completed by the International MS Genetics Consortium (IMSGC). They discovered the region of the genome containing the two variants in data from a landmark IMSGC study of African Americans with MS in 2005. Then, to characterize the variants, they focused on African Americans with MS in a 2007 study who showed strong signals in that area of the genome. Large numbers of participants are needed to accelerate this research. If you wish to participate, please contact the University of California at San Francisco MS Genetics Research Laboratory .

Multiple Sclerosis: Should I Start Taking Medicines for MS? You may want to have a say in this decision, or you may simply want to follow your doctor's recommendation. Either way, this information will help you understand what your choices are so that you can talk to your doctor about them. Multiple Sclerosis: Should I Start Taking Medicines for MS? Take medicines after your first attack of multiple sclerosis or as soon as you are diagnosed. Don't take medicines now. Wait to see how the disease progresses. Your doctor may suggest medicines after your first attack or when multiple sclerosis (MS) is first diagnosed. Lasting damage to the can occur in the early stages of MS. Early treatment may prevent or delay some of this damage. Some people wait to see if their symptoms get worse before they make a decision to start taking MS medicines. Instead of medicines, you can try physical therapy, occupational therapy, and shots to help you manage your symptoms. It's hard to know the course that your MS will take. Doctors can't know for sure if your MS will get worse. A small number of people with MS have only mild disease and do well without treatment. But many get worse over time. Medicines can reduce the severity of attacks of and how often you have them. They may also reduce or delay disability. But they don't work for everyone. And there is no way to predict if they will work for you. These medicines have side effects that can range from flu-like symptoms to headaches, chest pain, flushing, infections, and allergic reactions to the injection. Some of these medicines can damage your liver or heart. These medicines are costly. Your cost will depend on your health plan coverage. Multiple sclerosis is a disease that affects the central nervous system—the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerves. It is also called MS. It can cause problems with muscle control and strength, vision, balance, feeling, and thinking. Your nerve fibers have a protective covering called . Without myelin, the brain and spinal cord can't communicate with the nerves in the rest of the body. MS slowly destroys myelin and nerve cells in the central nervous system. This causes muscle weakness and other symptoms. Most of the time, MS is not diagnosed unless a doctor can be sure you have had at least two attacks affecting at least two different areas of your . Your doctor will examine you, ask you questions about your symptoms, and do some tests. An MRI scan is often used to confirm the diagnosis. That's because the patches of damage (lesions) caused by MS attacks can be seen with MRI. MS is different for each person. You may go through life with only minor problems. Or you may become seriously disabled. Most people are somewhere in between. In general, MS follows one of four courses: Clinically isolated syndrome. The symptoms last for 24 hours or longer and go away. Relapsing-remitting. This means symptoms fade and then return off and on for many years. Secondary progressive, which at first follows a relapsing-remitting course and then becomes progressively worse. ""Progressive"" means it gets worse over time. Primary progressive. This means the disease is progressive from the start. Disease-modifying therapy means treatment to delay, change, or interrupt the natural course of the disease. For MS, this means taking medicine over a long period of time to reduce not only the number of attacks but also how bad they are. To slow down the spread of MS, your doctor may suggest medicines after your first attack or when you are first diagnosed with MS. People treated soon after being diagnosed with MS may have better results than those who delay treatment. Lasting damage to the can occur in the early stages of MS. Early treatment may prevent or delay some of this damage. Medicines for MS can be costly. They don't work for everyone. And it's hard to know who will benefit. Making a decision about starting disease-modifying therapy can be hard, especially if your symptoms have been mild. Some people wait to see if their symptoms get worse before they make a decision to start therapy. A small number of people with MS may never have more than a few mild episodes and never have any disability. But there is no way to know who will fall into this group. Medicines can't cure MS. They don't stop disease activity or reverse nervous system damage that has already happened. But drugs may reduce relapses and delay disability in many people with relapsing forms of MS. If you decide not to try disease-modifying therapy at this time, work with your doctor to monitor your health through regular checkups and periodic MRI scans to evaluate whether the disease is progressing. If new lesions are developing or existing lesions are growing, you may want to reconsider your decision and begin treatment. If you decide not to take MS medicines, there are some other things you can do. Take other medicine, such as , to relieve symptoms during attacks or relapses. Try physical therapy, occupational therapy, and other treatment you can do at home to help you manage your symptoms and adjust to living and working with MS. Do what you can to stay well. Eat a healthy diet, get plenty of rest, and try to reduce stress. Some people try alternative therapy to reduce their symptoms. Before you try any type of alternative treatment for MS, talk with your doctor about your treatment options. You can also get advice from an MS treatment center or the National Multiple Sclerosis Society. What do numbers tell us about benefits and risks of MS medicines? This section focuses on glatiramer and interferon beta, the most commonly used MS medicines. Progression from early symptoms to diagnosis of MS *Based on the best available evidence (evidence quality: ) Flushing, chest tightness, sweating, heart palpitations, anxiety, and shortness of breath (glatiramer) *Based on the best available evidence (evidence quality: ) The evidence suggests a slight positive effect for people with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis. But the quality of the evidence isn't good. It is . If you have had some early symptoms of MS but don't have a clear diagnosis yet, medicine may reduce the chance that your symptoms will progress to full-blown MS. Take a group of 100 people who have had an MS-like episode but do not yet have an MS diagnosis: Without medicines, 45 to 58 out of 100 may progress to an MS diagnosis. This means that 42 to 55 may not. With MS medicines, 34 to 35 out of 100 may progress to an MS diagnosis. This means that 65 to 66 may not. Your risk of needing a hospital stay over the next 2 years may be lower if you take medicines than if you don't. : Without MS medicines, 20 people out of 100 may need to be hospitalized over the next 2 years, while 80 out of 100 may not. With MS medicines, 12 out of 100 may need to be hospitalized over the next 2 years, while 88 out of 100 may not. Many people who take MS medicines have uncomfortable side effects. : With interferon beta, 48 out of 100 may have flu-like symptoms. This means that 52 out of 100 may not. The quality of the evidence about this is . With glatiramer, 24 out of 100 may have symptoms such as flushing, chest tightness, sweating, heart palpitations, anxiety, and shortness of breath. This means that 76 out of 100 may not. The quality of the evidence about this is . Some evidence is better than other evidence. Evidence comes from studies that look at how well treatments and tests work and how safe they are. For many reasons, some studies are more reliable than others. The better the evidence is—the higher its quality—the more we can trust it. The information shown here is based on the best available evidence. The evidence is rated using four quality levels: . Another thing to understand is that the evidence can't predict what's going to happen in your case. When evidence tells us that 2 out of 100 people who have a certain test or treatment may have a certain result and that 98 out of 100 may not, there's no way to know if you will be one of the 2 or one of the 98. The National Multiple Sclerosis Society recommends that people with a definite diagnosis of MS and active, relapsing disease start treatment with medicine as soon as possible after receiving a diagnosis. Most neurologists support this recommendation and now agree that permanent damage to the nervous system may occur early on, even while symptoms are still quite mild. Early treatment may help prevent or delay some of this damage. In general, treatment is recommended until it no longer provides a clear benefit. The National MS Society also says that treatment with medicine may be considered after the first attack in some people who are at a high risk for MS (before MS is definitely diagnosed). Your doctor may suggest that you take MS medicines because: You have had symptoms that are most likely caused by multiple sclerosis, tests show you most likely have MS, and your doctor is confident that you have MS. You have just been diagnosed with multiple sclerosis, and early treatment may delay damage to your central nervous system. These medicines are the only ones proved to reduce the frequency and severity of relapses and delay disability. You take the type of medicine prescribed (pills, injections, or shots). You visit your doctor regularly for blood tests and to check your progress. These drugs can make relapses less severe and reduce how often they occur. Medicines can slow the spread of the disease by limiting new areas of damage in the brain. These drugs don't work for everyone. It is hard to predict who will benefit. The long-term risks of some of these drugs are not known. Side effects of these medicines can include flu-like symptoms, headaches, diarrhea, nausea, hair thinning, depression, chest pain, anxiety, flushing, and redness and swelling at the injection site (for shots or injections). You visit your doctor regularly to check your progress. You try physical therapy, occupational therapy, and other treatment at home to adjust to living with MS. You avoid the risks and cost of medicines that you might not need or that may not work for you. You avoid taking medicine for multiple sclerosis if you end up being diagnosed with a different condition. You may have a higher chance of becoming disabled. Long-term use of steroid medicine may lead to other problems such as stomach ulcers, problems sleeping, and high blood pressure. Personal stories about treatment for multiple sclerosis These stories are based on information gathered from health professionals and consumers. They may be helpful as you make important health decisions. The MS episodes I've had were fairly mild, but I'm worried that next time the symptoms will be more severe. I don't think I'm being pessimistic by deciding to take interferon. I think I'm giving myself the best chance to live a long and healthy life. I have never been much of a risk-taker, and my health is definitely not something I want to risk. My doctor recommends that I take the medicine. Even if it turns out that I might not have needed treatment for MS, I would rather err on the side of caution by starting therapy now. I know I would really regret not doing the treatment if I had a relapse a year from now or even a few years from now. I generally try to avoid medicine when I can. My doctor really thinks it would be a good idea for me to take the medicine, but I don't want to deal with the side effects, and I'm not sure I like the idea of giving myself shots on a regular basis. I don't want to take medicine ""just in case"" I have problems with MS later. Besides, I can always reconsider if and when I have another episode. Your personal feelings are just as important as the medical facts. Think about what matters most to you in this decision, and show how you feel about the following statements. I want to try the medicine now, even though it might not work. I don't want to take the medicine if it might not work. I worry that if I don't start treatment now, I may be sorry later. I'm willing to live with the side effects of medicine. I don't know if I can handle the side effects of medicine. I want to do whatever I can to make my attacks happen less often. I want to try to handle my attacks without medicine. Now that you've thought about the facts and your feelings, you may have a general idea of where you stand on this decision. Show which way you are leaning right now. Can medicines help prevent some nervous system damage from MS? If you decide not to start medicines now, are there other things you can try? Are you clear about which benefits and side effects matter most to you? Do you have enough support and advice from others to make a choice? How sure do you feel right now about your decision?

Here's a record of your answers. You can use it to talk with your doctor or loved ones about your decision. Take medicines after your first attack of multiple sclerosis or as soon as you are diagnosed. Don't take medicines now. Wait to see how the disease progresses. Your doctor may suggest medicines after your first attack or when multiple sclerosis (MS) is first diagnosed. Lasting damage to the can occur in the early stages of MS. Early treatment may prevent or delay some of this damage. Some people wait to see if their symptoms get worse before they make a decision to start taking MS medicines. Instead of medicines, you can try physical therapy, occupational therapy, and shots to help you manage your symptoms. It's hard to know the course that your MS will take. Doctors can't know for sure if your MS will get worse. A small number of people with MS have only mild disease and do well without treatment. But many get worse over time. Medicines can reduce the severity of attacks of and how often you have them. They may also reduce or delay disability. But they don't work for everyone. And there is no way to predict if they will work for you. These medicines have side effects that can range from flu-like symptoms to headaches, chest pain, flushing, infections, and allergic reactions to the injection. Some of these medicines can damage your liver or heart. These medicines are costly. Your cost will depend on your health plan coverage. Multiple sclerosis is a disease that affects the central nervous system—the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerves. It is also called MS. It can cause problems with muscle control and strength, vision, balance, feeling, and thinking. Your nerve fibers have a protective covering called . Without myelin, the brain and spinal cord can't communicate with the nerves in the rest of the body. MS slowly destroys myelin and nerve cells in the central nervous system. This causes muscle weakness and other symptoms. Most of the time, MS is not diagnosed unless a doctor can be sure you have had at least two attacks affecting at least two different areas of your . Your doctor will examine you, ask you questions about your symptoms, and do some tests. An MRI scan is often used to confirm the diagnosis. That's because the patches of damage (lesions) caused by MS attacks can be seen with MRI. MS is different for each person. You may go through life with only minor problems. Or you may become seriously disabled. Most people are somewhere in between. In general, MS follows one of four courses: Clinically isolated syndrome. The symptoms last for 24 hours or longer and go away. Relapsing-remitting. This means symptoms fade and then return off and on for many years. Secondary progressive, which at first follows a relapsing-remitting course and then becomes progressively worse. ""Progressive"" means it gets worse over time. Primary progressive. This means the disease is progressive from the start. Disease-modifying therapy means treatment to delay, change, or interrupt the natural course of the disease. For MS, this means taking medicine over a long period of time to reduce not only the number of attacks but also how bad they are. To slow down the spread of MS, your doctor may suggest medicines after your first attack or when you are first diagnosed with MS. People treated soon after being diagnosed with MS may have better results than those who delay treatment. Lasting damage to the can occur in the early stages of MS. Early treatment may prevent or delay some of this damage. Medicines for MS can be costly. They don't work for everyone. And it's hard to know who will benefit. Making a decision about starting disease-modifying therapy can be hard, especially if your symptoms have been mild. Some people wait to see if their symptoms get worse before they make a decision to start therapy. A small number of people with MS may never have more than a few mild episodes and never have any disability. But there is no way to know who will fall into this group. Medicines can't cure MS. They don't stop disease activity or reverse nervous system damage that has already happened. But drugs may reduce relapses and delay disability in many people with relapsing forms of MS. If you decide not to try disease-modifying therapy at this time, work with your doctor to monitor your health through regular checkups and periodic MRI scans to evaluate whether the disease is progressing. If new lesions are developing or existing lesions are growing, you may want to reconsider your decision and begin treatment. If you decide not to take MS medicines, there are some other things you can do. Take other medicine, such as , to relieve symptoms during attacks or relapses. Try physical therapy, occupational therapy, and other treatment you can do at home to help you manage your symptoms and adjust to living and working with MS. Do what you can to stay well. Eat a healthy diet, get plenty of rest, and try to reduce stress. Some people try alternative therapy to reduce their symptoms. Before you try any type of alternative treatment for MS, talk with your doctor about your treatment options. You can also get advice from an MS treatment center or the National Multiple Sclerosis Society. What do numbers tell us about benefits and risks of MS medicines? This section focuses on glatiramer and interferon beta, the most commonly used MS medicines. Progression from early symptoms to diagnosis of MS *Based on the best available evidence (evidence quality: ) Flushing, chest tightness, sweating, heart palpitations, anxiety, and shortness of breath (glatiramer) *Based on the best available evidence (evidence quality: ) The evidence suggests a slight positive effect for people with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis. But the quality of the evidence isn't good. It is .

ac30a341-1431-4928-8b7f-7fa63f896f86,"Shemar Moore of 'Criminal Minds' Opens Up About the Show and His Mother's MS — The daytime Emmy-winning actor turns the spotlight on multiple sclerosis and bikes 100 miles to help find a cure. Shemar Moore, who plays Derek Morgan on the hit CBS show , is a busy man. Healthline caught up with him between shooting an episode of the show and live-tweeting the Season 9 premiere Wednesday night. He spoke candidly about his mother, Marilyn, who was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis (MS) in 1998, and his upcoming Bike MS ride with the . Fiercely devoted to his mom, Moore describes her as, “strong-willed … courageous, and endearing, with a lot of ambition and a big heart.” Marilyn celebrated her 70th birthday earlier this year with a big family get together arranged by Moore, which included an impromptu visit from fellow cast member Joe Mantegna. When his mother was diagnosed with MS, it hit Moore hard. “At first her symptoms were so slight, I just thought she could take some aspirin or go get a shot or something and it would just go away,” Moore recalls. “I didn’t know what MS was. I thought maybe she was over-dramatizing it. It took awhile to come to grips with this … happening to her and affecting her life and her body.” Moore reflects on her struggles with fatigue, overheating, and numbness in her hands and feet. “She’s my Super Woman. It’s hard to see someone that you put on such a pedestal crack. She’ll never be broken, because she’s just way too strong-willed and hard-headed. But she’s human. She has her down days.” Multiple Sclerosis Patients Especially Sensitive to Heat Moore is a big part of the support team that allows her to live independently. “State of mind [is key] for people with MS,” says Moore. “I was blessed to buy her a condo in Redondo Beach [Calif.] about two years ago. She loves the ocean, and she gets to look at the dolphins and watch the whales come in.” “She gets to see the sweaty men playing volleyball and we joke about that,” he laughs. “But it lifts her spirits. She knows she’s loved by me. She knows that [we all] make it a point to lift her up and make sure she’s loved and thought about and fought for.” He attributes her positive frame of mind to the fact that Marilyn can still participate in the activities she loves, like going to the movies, watching Dodgers and Giants baseball games, and getting pampered at the salon. “She’s swimming, she’s doing yoga, and she can still get up and about,” Moore says. There are many retired people in her community, says Moore, “so she has a like-minded demographic of people to hang out with and it keeps her happy. The happier she is, the less she dwells on any pain or symptoms, unless they’re severe.” Moore is leveraging his fame to help not just Marilyn, but all those suffering from MS, by raising money for the National Multiple Sclerosis Society (NMSS). The weekend of October 12th and 13th will find Moore pedaling 100 miles in the event for the NMSS. In preparation, he’s been riding his bike to work and back every day, logging 32 miles round trip, with longer, more challenging weekend jaunts. Some friends will be joining him for the first time this year, Moore says. “They’re very athletic, but you can lift weights or play football or basketball and it’s not the same as riding a bike, the endurance you need.” In addition to building up his endurance, Moore’s, ahem, derriere has had to get used to spending many hours on a narrow bike seat. “There’s a muscle in your butt you have to break in because when you first get on the seat it’s quite an experience,” he says with a laugh. “Your little ‘man-situation’ gets dealt with and your butt bones start aching. It’s kind of funny to see grown men in tights sitting on these little seats, questioning their sexuality.” But it’s all to raise awareness and funding for a good cause. His clothing line is another way for Moore to raise money for MS research. His website sells clothing, posters, and photo books, all of which fans are eager to buy. “A large percentage of the profit goes to fight MS—none of it’s going into my pocket. It’s a fun way to give back, and I’m able to interact with my fans.” As for the new season of , Moore says there will be a new addition to the show to take the place of Erin Strauss, and one episode in which you’ll watch Hotch revisit his past, see his wife and child in flashback scenes, and attempt to find closure—or not. Morgan, Moore’s character, may have a love interest, and you’ll finally see glimpses of some of the characters’ lives outside their FBI personas. Referring to Morgan, Moore says, “You’ve never seen him with his hair down… in his off-the-clock life.” Asked if he had a message for those with MS, Moore says, “Know every day you get up is a blessing. Don’t apologize for anything. Spoil yourself… and know there are people out there—beyond myself—fighting on your behalf, trying to find a cure for this disease so you can live longer, happier, healthier lives. As long as you’re fighting, we’re going to fight along with you.” To learn how you can help the Bike MS team reach their fundraising goal, please . But You Look Great!

The team (J. William L. Brown, MRCP, University of Cambridge, and Tomas Kalincik, PhD, University of Melbourne, and colleagues) report their findings in (). Although this type of observational study cannot provide the same level of evidence as a well-designed, controlled clinical trial, Ari Green, MD (University of California, San Francisco) suggests in an that, based on this and other studies, “The signs are strongly pointing to the benefits of early and aggressive treatment to forestall damage.” He cautions that the study did not show that disease modifying therapies can stop MS completely since a significant number of people studied did develop secondary progressive MS.  UPDATE 2/22/19: A second study has reported that people with MS prescribed early, high efficacy therapies tended to have less progression of disability than those who started with traditional disease-modifying treatments. The team (Katharine Harding, PhD, Neil Robertson, MD, and colleagues at Cardiff University, Heath Park, Cardiff, UK) reported their results in (). DETAILS Many people who are diagnosed with eventually transition to a course in which there is a progressive worsening of neurologic function (accumulation of disability) over time. There has been some evidence that early and ongoing treatment with MS is the best way to reduce current and future disease activity, but specific information is needed about the timing and best types of therapies to achieve the optimal impacts against the disease.

Brown, MRCP, University of Cambridge, and Tomas Kalincik, PhD, University of Melbourne, and colleagues sought to determine the association between the use, the type of, and the timing of disease-modifying therapies with the risk of conversion to the secondary progressive phase of MS.   Investigators looked at records of 1,555 people with relapsing-remitting MS who began treatment with disease-modifying therapies from 1988-2012, or who remained untreated, and who had been followed for at least four years. Treated individuals were identified in MSBase, an international online registry that currently includes records of more than 60,000 people with MS from hundreds of clinics worldwide. Untreated individuals for the study were selected from the database of the University Hospital of Wales.   People who took fingolimod, alemtuzumab, and natalizumab (“higher-efficacy therapy” therapies with greater effectiveness but possibly more risk of side effects) were compared with those initially treated with glatiramer acetate or interferon beta (traditional, first generation disease-modifying therapies). Those initially treated with glatiramer acetate or interferon beta within five years of MS onset were compared with those initially treated after five years. Investigators also looked at whether treatment was escalated from traditional to higher-efficacy within five years or later.   The outcome being measured in all these comparisons was conversion to secondary progressive MS, which was defined as an increase of 1 point on the EDSS scale of disability progression (if the EDSS score was 5.5 or less) or .5 point (if the EDSS score was more than 5.5). This EDSS increase had to occur without a relapse and be confirmed after 3 months or more.   The investigators report that people who were treated with any type of disease-modifying therapy were significantly less likely to later develop secondary progressive MS than those who remained untreated. In addition, they reported that initial treatment with the higher-efficacy therapies was associated with a significantly decreased risk of conversion to secondary progressive MS compared with treatment with initial treatment with traditional therapies. They also found that the risk of developing secondary progressive MS was significantly lower when treatment was started within five years of MS onset compared to after five years, and when treatment was escalated from traditional therapy to a higher-efficacy therapy in the first five years compared to later.   The team (J. William L. Brown, MRCP, University of Cambridge, and Tomas Kalincik, PhD, University of Melbourne, and colleagues) report their findings in ().   Although this type of observational study cannot provide the same level of evidence as a well-designed, controlled clinical trial, Ari Green, MD (University of California, San Francisco) suggests in an that, based on this and other studies, “The signs are strongly pointing to the benefits of early and aggressive treatment to forestall damage.” He cautions that the study did not show that disease modifying therapies can stop MS completely since a significant number of people studied did develop secondary progressive MS.    Further studies are underway in this area. The is one of two studies funded by the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute that will help inform treatment decisions around whether, and which, people with MS would most benefit from early, possibly more risky aggressive therapy. The other study is Determining the Effectiveness of Early Intensive versus Escalation Approaches for the Treatment of Relapsing-Remitting Multiple Sclerosis (DELIVER-MS). UPDATE 2/22/19: Further Results on Early, Aggressive Treatment A second study has reported that, among 592 people with MS, 104 who were prescribed early high efficacy therapies had more favorable outcomes as measured by the EDSS, compared with 488 people who started with traditional disease-modifying treatments.

bec6711e-43e5-4ad8-a282-e55b0dc83a22,"Complementary & Alternative Medicines Find Programs & Services in Your Area COVID-19 Vaccine Guidance for People Living with MS     Multiple sclerosis is an unpredictable, often disabling disease of the central nervous system. Symptoms range from numbness and tingling to blindness and paralysis. The progress, severity, and specific symptoms of MS in any one person cannot yet be predicted, but advances in research and treatment are moving us closer to a world free of MS. Most people living with MS are diagnosed between the ages of 20 and 50, with more than twice as many women as men being diagnosed with the disease. There are an estimated 8-10,000 children under the age of 18 who also live with MS. Studies indicate that genetic factors could make certain individuals more susceptible to the disease, but there is no evidence that MS is directly inherited. It occurs more commonly among Caucasians, especially those of northern European ancestry, but people of African, Asian, and Hispanic backgrounds are not immune. More than 2.3 million people are affected by MS worldwide. Because the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) does not require U.S. physicians to report new cases, and because symptoms can be completely invisible, the prevalence of MS in the U.S. can only be estimated. The Society continues to advocate for the establishment of a national registry that will track the number of people living with MS and has made a commitment to re-evaluate the current prevalence estimate and investigate the process by which an updated estimate can be identified. The progress, severity, and specific symptoms of MS in any one person cannot yet be predicted. The disease varies greatly from person to person, and from time to time, in the same person. For instance, one person might experience abnormal fatigue, another might have severe vision problems, and another could develop attention and memory issues. Even severe symptoms could disappear completely and the person could regain lost functions. In the worst cases, however, people can have partial or complete paralysis. In MS, symptoms result when inflammation and breakdown occur in myelin, the protective insulation surrounding the nerve fibers of the central nervous system (brain and spinal cord). The nerve fibers themselves are also damaged. Myelin is destroyed and replaced by scars of hardened ""sclerotic"" patches of tissue. Such lesions are called ""plaques,"" and appear in ""multiple"" places within the central nervous system. This can be compared to a loss of insulating material around an electrical wire, which interferes with the transmission of signals. Life expectancy for people with MS has increased over time. We believe this is due to treatment breakthroughs, improved healthcare and life style changes. Recent research however, indicates that people with MS may live an average of about seven years less than the general population because of disease complications or other medical conditions. Many of these complications are preventable or manageable. Attention to overall health and wellness can help reduce the risk of other medical conditions, such as heart disease and stroke, that can contribute to a shortened life expectancy. In some rare instances, there are cases of MS that progress rapidly from disease onset and can be fatal. No. The majority of people living with MS do not become severely disabled. Two-thirds of people who have MS remain able to walk, though many will need an aid, such as a cane or crutches. No. MS is neither contagious nor directly inherited, although studies indicate that genetic factors might make certain individuals more susceptible to the disease. Not yet. However, advances in treating and understanding MS are being achieved daily and the progress in research to find a cure is very encouraging. In addition, many therapeutic and technological advances are helping people manage symptoms and lead more productive lives. Several FDA-approved medications are now available and have been shown to impact the underlying course of MS. What medications and treatments are available for MS?  The National Multiple Sclerosis Society recommends that people living with MS begin treatment with one of the disease modifying drugs, Avonex®, Betaseron®, Copaxone®, or Rebif® as soon as you are diagnosed with a relapsing form (the most common kind) of MS. Those drugs help to lessen the frequency and severity of MS attacks, reduce the accumulation of lesions in the brain, and slow progression of disability. Novantrone® (mitoxantrone) is approved for reducing disability and/or frequency of relapses in patients with worsening relapsing MS. This is the first therapy approved in the United States for individuals with secondary progressive MS or who are experiencing a rapid worsening of the disease. In addition, approved by the FDA for return to market, is Tysabri®, which is generally recommended for patients who have had inadequate response to, or are unable to tolerate, other approved disease-modifying MS therapies for relapsing forms of MS. Many therapies are available to treat symptoms such as spasticity, pain, bladder problems, fatigue, and weakness. People should consult with a knowledgeable physician to develop the most comprehensive approach to managing their MS. In early MS, elusive symptoms that come and go might indicate any number of possible disorders. Some people have symptoms that are very difficult for physicians to interpret, and these people must ""wait and see."" While no single laboratory test is yet available to prove or rule out MS, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a great help in reaching a definitive diagnosis. In an effort to develop a common language when discussing, evaluating, and treating MS, the Society conducted an international survey among scientists who specialize in MS research and patient care. Analysis of the responses resulted in the publication of four disease courses in 1996. In 2013, the International Advisory Committee on Clinical Trials of MS updated the based on advances in the understanding of the disease process in MS and in MRI technology: : a first episode of neurologic symptoms caused by inflammation and demyelination in the central nervous system that may or may not go on to become MS. a disease course characterized by clearly defined flare-ups (relapses) or episodes of acute worsening of neurologic function followed by remissions (with partial or complete recovery) during which no disease progression occurs. Frequency: Approximately 85% of people are diagnosed with RRMS. a disease course characterized by nearly continuous worsening from the onset of symptoms, with or without occasional relapses. The rate or progression varies over time, with occasional plateaus. Frequency: Approximately 15% of people are diagnosed with PPMS. a disease course that follows after an initial RRMS course. Following an initial period of time with RRMS, the disease becomes more steadily progressive, with or without occasional relapses.  Frequency: If left untreated, 50% of people with relapsing-remitting MS develop this form of the disease within about 10 years of initial diagnosis. © 2020 The National Multiple Sclerosis Society is a tax exempt 501(c)3 nonprofit organization.

Multiple sclerosis, often called MS, is a disease that attacks the central nervous system (CNS), which includes the optic nerves (the nerves that transmit visual information from the retina to the brain), brain and spinal cord. People with MS can experience a wide range of symptoms, including weakness, numbness, visual loss, double vision, imbalance and difficulties with memory and multitasking. Nerve fibers are normally surrounded by a protective covering called the myelin sheath. In people with MS, the immune system inappropriately attacks and injures the myelin sheath and the nerve fiber that it’s wrapped around. As a result, communications between the central nervous system and the rest of the body are interrupted, resulting in a variety of symptoms. In the most common form of MS, the immune system strikes the CNS episodically, causing areas or patches of damage, called “lesions,” in the optic nerves, brain and spinal cord. The symptoms a patient experiences during a given episode, or relapse, depend on the location of the lesion. For example, a lesion in the optic nerve causes visual loss, while a lesion in the middle of the spinal cord causes numbness and/or weakness below the waist. Over time, some people with MS develop gradually worsening weakness, imbalance, numbness or cognitive decline, called progressive MS. A subset of individuals experience progressive MS without relapses beforehand. MS is different for each person. Some people may go through life with only minor problems, while others may become disabled. There’s no cure for MS, but there are now drugs, called disease modifying therapies (DMT), that can decrease the risk of relapses and future nervous system damage. Our goal is to help patients reach a state of “no evidence of disease activity” (NEDA), meaning complete stability in neurological function and MRI scans, when possible. - A first episode of neurological symptoms and deficits caused by a typical MS lesion, that may evolve into definite MS in the future if additional inflammatory activity occurs. MRI scans and/or spinal fluid tests can indicate if someone with CIS has a high chance of developing definitive MS. CIS is most frequently caused by inflammation in the optic nerve (causing visual loss in one eye), spinal cord (causing numbness and/ or weakness in one or more limbs, often with bladder control difficulties), or brainstem (causing symptoms such as double vision, vertigo, and gait imbalance). In most cases, doctors will prescribe medicine for people who have CIS with risk factors for future relapses. These medicines, when taken early and even before the diagnosis of MS, may keep the disease from getting worse or extend one’s time without definitive MS. – MS characterized by recurrent, self-limited episodes of new neurological symptoms, or acute worsening of existing symptoms, followed by full or partial recovery. These episodes, which are often referred to as relapses, typically last weeks to months. By definition, they have to last one day or longer, and they’re caused by the formation of new MS lesions or the expansion of existing lesions within the CNS. Patients are generally stable during the periods between relapses, which are called remissions. However, some symptoms associated with MS, such as fatigue and muscle spasms, can persist during remissions, Most people who develop MS have a relapsing-remitting course initially. RRMS occurs 2 – 3 times more often in women than men, and usually is diagnosed in young adulthood (20s to 30s). – This is a phase of MS that follows the relapsing-remitting course in some individuals. It’s marked by steadily and gradually worsening neurological disability, usually in the form of weakness and/or numbness in one or more limbs, gait imbalance, and/or memory difficulties. The secondary progressive phase typically starts after 15 – 20 years of relapsing remitting disease. Not everyone with RRMS develops SPMS. Progressive MS is considered to be active when relapses, or new inflammatory lesions detected on MRI scans, are superimposed on the gradual neurological decline. Active disease is more likely to be responsive to disease-modifying therapy. – This is a form of MS characterized, from its inception, by steadily worsening neurologic disability, without prior clinical relapses and remissions. It resembles SPMS, except for the absence of a history of episodic neurological symptoms before the gradual decline becomes evident. PPMS is equally common in men and women, and it’s generally diagnosed in mid-life (40s to 50s). As in SPMS, some people with PPMS experience relapses and/or new inflammatory MRI lesions, superimposed on the progressive disease course. In those cases, the disease is considered to be active and is more likely to be slowed down by treatment with disease-modifying therapies. Sometimes, people without symptoms of an MS attack who undergo an MRI for other reasons, such as headache or head trauma, are incidentally found to have lesions that resemble the lesions seen in MS. These people should be examined by an MS specialist and may need additional tests. If they have never had symptoms suggestive of an MS attack and their exam is normal, they do not have and cannot be diagnosed with MS. A scenario such as this is called radiologic isolated syndrome (RIS). The diagnosis of RIS is made when MRI pictures look very similar to MS, but there haven’t ever been symptoms of an MS attack. People with RIS should be under the care of an MS specialist and generally are monitored with annual MRI scans to detect future areas of inflammation in the brain and spinal cord, which sometimes don’t cause symptoms. In a five-year period, 34% of individuals with RIS will be diagnosed with MS after they develop symptoms of an MS attack. Modify your home to keep it safe and easy to get around. For example, to help prevent falls, install grab bars in the bathroom and don’t use throw rugs. Try adjusting your daily schedule so that your routine is less stressful or tiring. Be physically active and try to exercise at least five days each week, either on your own or with the help of a physical therapist. Yoga and stretching improve the quality of life for many people with MS. Get help with urination problems. At some point, most people with MS have bladder problems. Your doctor may prescribe a medicine to help you. In some cases, you may be referred to a urologist, who specializes in conditions that affect the bladder. Avoid getting overheated. Increased body temperature can temporarily make your symptoms worse. Use an air conditioner, keep your home cool, and avoid heated swimming pools and hot tubs. During warm or hot weather, exercise in an air-conditioned area rather than outdoors, and wear a cooling vest or collar when you go outside. Eat plenty of fruits, vegetables, grains, cereals, legumes, poultry, fish, lean meats and low-fat dairy products. A balanced diet for a person who has MS is the same as that recommended for most healthy adults. For more advice about coping with MS at home, contact the National Multiple Sclerosis Society at .

In HSCT for MS, hematopoietic (blood cell-producing) stem cells, which are derived from a person’s own (scientifically referred to as “autologous”) bone marrow or blood, are collected and stored, prior to depleting much of the immune system using chemotherapy drugs. Then the stored hematopoietic stem cells are reintroduced to the body. The new stem cells migrate to the bone marrow and over time reconstitute the immune system.  Is HSCT an FDA-approved therapy option for people with MS? The medications and procedures used in HSCT are already approved by the FDA. Publication of the outcomes from well controlled clinical studies of HSCT therapy will encourage greater acceptance and use by the medical community. The goal of HSCT is to reset the immune system and stop the inflammation that contributes to active relapsing MS.  The National Medical Advisory Committee of the National MS Society has written an article reviewing evidence related to the optimal use of autologous HSCT for the treatment of specific types of relapsing multiple sclerosis. The committee’s findings are published in () . There is growing evidence that aHSCT is not for everyone with MS but may be highly effective for people with relapsing MS who meet very specific characteristics. While the general approach is the same, there are different treatment protocols that vary depending on the medical center and doctors performing the procedure. In general, these are some of the steps involved: A person undergoing autologous HSCT to treat MS is given some form of chemotherapy, usually by infusion in the vein, for 1-2 days, and also another type of treatment for up to 10 days to stimulate the production of bone marrow stem cells and promote their release into the blood. Then some blood is drawn from a vein and the stem cells in the blood are stored for later use. Then the individual is usually hospitalized, and given a powerful mix of chemotherapies for several days to kill or suppress immune cells throughout the body. The stored stem cells are then infused into the bloodstream through a vein. The individual is usually given medicines such as antibiotics to help combat possible infection. The person remains in the hospital for an additional period of time while the immune system begins to rebuild itself. Sometimes individuals are discharged from the hospital in two to four weeks, but this can be longer.  The immune system gradually rebuilds itself within 3 to 6 months.   Read more frequently asked questions about HSCT and MS National MS Society Releases Recommendations for aHSCT-Bone Marrow Transplant for MS November 11, 2020 Investigators Recruiting Nationwide for Study Comparing AHSCT to Other Therapies in Active Relapsing MS January 7, 2020 Results Published from Study of Bone Marrow Stem Cell Transplants (HSCT) in Relapsing-Remitting MS January 15, 2019 Results Published from Australian HSCT Bone Marrow Stem Cell Transplantation Trial in MS December 13, 2018 Paper Published on Recommendations for Speeding Research on Cell-Based Therapies for MS July 24, 2017 ""Combined Analysis of Previously Published HSCT/Bone Marrow Transplantation Studies"" May 4, 2017 ""Large Study Showed Long-Term Benefits of Bone Marrow-Derived Stem Cell Transplantation in Some People with MS"" February 21, 2017 ""Final 5-Year Results Published from Study of Bone Marrow Stem Cell Transplantation in Relapsing MS"" February 3, 2017 ""International Conference Held by National MS Society and ECTRIMS to Assess Progress and Define Research Directions for Cell-Based Therapies for MS""  December 9, 2015 “Positive Results from Study of Bone Marrow-Derived Stem Cells in People with Aggressive, Relapsing MS”  June 9, 2016 Additional research is focusing on figuring out who might benefit from this procedure and how to reduce its risks. HSCT is being investigated in Canada, the United States, Europe and elsewhere. For example:  • A multicenter phase 3 clinical trial of HSCT (“BEAT-MS”) began in 2020 in Cleveland, Seattle and up to 19 sites across the country. This study is now recruiting participants nationwide. The Society has been engaged with the team conducting the trial and is helping with recruitment.  • A clinical trial is getting underway at medical centers in Denmark, Netherlands, Norway and Sweden. The trial is testing treatment with HSCT compared with alemtuzumab in people with active relapsing-remitting MS.   • A phase 3 trial at Northwestern Medical in Chicago launched by Dr. Richard Burt to determine the optimal protocol for safety and benefit is ongoing and no longer recruiting participants. According to Northwestern, Dr. Burt will be going on a planned research sabbatical at the end of 2019. • In December 2020, a team from Lithuania published results of a study assessing cognitive dysfunction and physical disability after autologous HSCT. Thirteen people who did not respond to conventional therapies for highly active relapsing MS underwent autologous HSCT and completed 24 months of follow up. Disability progression was measured by the EDSS scale. Two people had one relapse during the first year and three people had one relapse during the second year. EDSS improved in 11 participants (84.6%). Information processing speed and verbal learning improved significantly at 12 months. No transplant-related deaths occurred. Fever was the most common side effect. • Researchers from Florence, Italy report on a small, open-label study involving 26 people with moderate to severe secondary progressive MS who underwent HSCT. Most showed signs of clinical or MRI inflammatory activity in the year prior to the procedure. Five years after the procedure, 42% of participants were stable with no further progression of disability that was reduced to 30% 10 years after transplant. No relapses or inflammatory activity occurred on MRI scans after treatment. These results suggest that HSCT might be appropriate in a subgroup of people with SPMS that have significant inflammatory activity as measured by MRI. Further study in larger numbers are needed to understand who among those with secondary progressive MS might benefit from HSCT. Read a  or an  in . • In January 2019, an international team of researchers led by Richard K. Burt, MD (MD (going on research sabbatical late 2019 from Northwestern University, Chicago, IL) published results of the first randomized, control trial of bone marrow stem cell transplant (HSCT) in people with aggressive relapsing-remitting MS. They enrolled 110 people whose MS was not controlled by available disease-modifying therapies. Half received immunosuppressant therapy followed by hematopoietic (blood cell-producing) stem transplant. The other half were switched to a different disease-modifying therapy. Significantly fewer people experienced MS progression in the group that underwent HSCT, compared with the group who were switched to a different MS disease-modifying therapy. There were no deaths or life-threatening adverse events in either group. The investigators consider this study to be preliminary and recommend that further research is needed to confirm these findings and to determine longer-term outcomes and safety. or in JAMA. • In December 2018, Drs. John Moore, David Ma (St. Vincent’s Hospital, Darlinghurst, NSW, Australia) and colleagues reported results of a small clinical trial of HSCT conducted at a single medical center in Australia. This trial enrolled 35 people with relapsing-remitting MS or secondary progressive MS whose disease had not responded well to disease-modifying medications. There was no control group or blinding; all participants underwent the HSCT procedure. The team reported on results after following participants from 12 to 66 months after transplantation. After 12 months, 82% remained free of relapses, MRI-detected new or enlarging lesions, and progression (called “Event-Free Survival” or EFS). At two years after transplant, 65% of the group had EFS, and at three years 60%. EFS was better in those who had relapsing MS. Of 8 who experienced MS progression after transplantation, 2 had relapsing-remitting MS and 6 had secondary progressive MS. Twelve of thirteen whose disability scores improved after transplantation had relapsing-remitting MS. At this center, which has a long experience with bone marrow transplants, there were no transplant-related deaths. Many experienced complications expected from the chemotherapy cocktail (called “BEAMS”) used to deplete their bone marrow cells in preparation for the transplant. or in the JNNP. • In April 2017, researchers in Italy combined and analyzed results from 15 previously published studies of HSCT (Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation) involving 764 people with various forms of MS. They found that overall, the procedure showed a significant benefit against disease activity and progression. Two years after transplantation, about 83% of all participants had not progressed; overall, studies involving more people with relapsing-remitting MS had lower progression rates. The pooled results showed an overall transplant-related mortality rate of 2.1%. There were fewer deaths in later studies as researchers gained more experience with the procedure. here or the ​• In February 2017, results of an international study were published. The study evaluated long-term outcomes from HSCT in 261 people with different forms of MS. The transplants took place between 1995 and 2006, with a follow-up period of up to 16 years. Several different transplant protocols were followed. After 5 years, 46% still had not experienced any progression or worsening of symptoms, including 73% of those with relapsing MS and 33% of those with secondary progressive MS. Eight deaths (2.8%) occurred within 100 days of the transplant. Most of these occurred during the early development of the procedure; improvements in patient selection and transplant techniques have significantly reduced the mortality. Those with the best outcomes tended to be younger, had relapsing MS, lower accumulation of disability and had used fewer MS therapies prior to the transplant procedure. Additional research is needed to better understand who might benefit from this procedure and how it compares to the benefits of powerful immune-modulating therapies now available.  or the • In February 2017, results were published from a multi-center, 5-year trial called the HALT MS Study. It tested HSCT in 24 people with MS and active relapsing-remitting disease that was not controlled by disease-modifying medications. Results suggest that after five years, 69.2% of participants experienced no new disease activity after the procedure and did not need disease-modifying therapies to control their disease. All participants experienced severe and/or life threatening adverse events. Most of these occurred within the first 30 days after transplant and were related to low white blood cell counts and infections. This trial, which was funded by the National Institutes of Health, is an important addition to research needed to determine whether this approach to stem cell transplantation is safe and effective in people with MS. A larger, phase 3 study is in the process of launching (see""Ongoing Research in HSCT"" above).   or the  • In June 2016 researchers in Canada published results of a long-term HSCT trial involving 24 people with aggressive relapsing-remitting MS whose disease was not controlled with available therapies. Three years after the procedure, 70% remained free of disease activity, with no relapses, no new MRI-detected inflammatory brain lesions, and no signs of progression. None of the surviving participants experienced clinical relapses or required MS disease-modifying therapies to control their disease, and 40% experienced reductions in disability. One participant died and another required intensive hospital care for liver complications. All participants developed fevers, which were frequently associated with infections, and other toxicities.    Read more about stem cell clinics and questions to ask Read about National MS Society Research in Stem Cells  from the International Society for Stem Cell Research Researchers from Italy Report Long-Term Outcomes from Bone Marrow Transplants (aHSCT) to Treat MS Study Shows that Stem Cells Derived from Skin Cells of People with MS Make Normal Nerve-Insulating Myelin National MS Society Releases Recommendations for aHSCT-Bone Marrow Transplant for MS HSCT Shows Benefits in Some People with Secondary Progressive MS in Small Study Myelin Repair, Clinical Trials, Gut Bacteria, and Exercise Headline at ECTRIMS2019, the World’s Largest MS Research Meeting © 2020 The National Multiple Sclerosis Society is a tax exempt 501(c)3 nonprofit organization.

The trial in primary progressive MS is the first large-scale clinical trial to show positive results in people with primary progressive MS. The studies were published in two papers in the December 21, 2016 issue of the New England Journal of Medicine: “Ocrelizumab versus Placebo in Primary Progressive Multiple Sclerosis” (Dr. Xavier Montalban and others); “Ocrelizumab versus Interferon Beta-1a in Relapsing Multiple Sclerosis” (Dr. Stephen Hauser and others).   Regulatory agencies are now evaluating these results. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration is expected to make an approval decision by March 28, 2017. DETAILS Results from three clinical trials of the experimental therapy ocrelizumab (proposed brand name, Ocrevus,™ Genentech, a member of the Roche Group) have been published, showing benefits in people with  and and providing additional details regarding effectiveness and safety, after preliminary findings were reported at medical conferences. The trial in primary progressive MS is the first large-scale clinical trial to show positive results.   “If the FDA approves this treatment, it will a breakthrough for people living with primary progressive MS, who have waited so long for an effective disease modifying therapy,” commented Dr. Bruce Bebo, Executive Vice President, Research at the National MS Society. “We hope that this success will encourage others to focus more resources into the research and development of treatments for progressive forms of MS.”   Dr. Bebo added, “The results from the trial of ocrelizumab in relapsing MS have revealed a new approach to suppressing disease activity. The possibility of another effective disease modifying treatment option for people living with relapsing MS is very encouraging.”   Ocrelizumab is a monoclonal antibody that binds to a molecule (CD20) on the surface of immune cells called B cells, and reduces the numbers of certain B cells that are circulating in the blood. B cells have several functions including making antibodies, and they are believed to play a role in immune-system-mediated damage to brain and spinal cord tissues in MS. Ocrelizumab is administered by intravenous infusion every 6 months.   The ORATORIO study compared ocrelizumab to inactive placebo in people with primary progressive MS for a minimum of 120 weeks. Of 732 participants, 488 were randomly assigned to receive ocrelizumab and 244 received inactive placebo. The trial was successful at meeting its primary endpoint, showing treatment with ocrelizumab significantly reduced the risk of progression of clinical disability by 24% compared with placebo. This reduced risk of progression means that people taking ocrelizumab in the trial were 24% less likely to demonstrate worsening of disability than those taking placebo. Other secondary benefits showed that compared to placebo, ocrelizumab reduced the time required to walk 25 feet, decreased the volume of brain lesions and reduced the rate of brain atrophy (shrinkage).   In the OPERA I and OPERA II studies involving people with relapsing MS, which compared ocrelizumab to interferon beta-1a (Rebif,® EMD Serono and Pfizer), ocrelizumab significantly reduced the annualized relapse rate by up to 47% compared with Rebif over two years in a total of 1,656 people with relapsing MS. Ocrelizumab also significantly delayed confirmed progression of disability, and reduced active inflammation and total damage on MRI scans compared with Rebif. The most common adverse events associated with ocrelizumab in all three trials were mild to moderate infusion-related reactions. Infusion reactions varied, the most frequent being itchy skin, rash, irritation in the throat, flushed face or fever, headache or other symptoms. These reactions decreased and tended to be less severe with subsequent doses. Serious infections occurred at similar rates in treatment and placebo groups. Other less severe infections included flu and oral herpes. A small percentage of participants who took ocrelizumab developed cancers during or after the trial more than those on placebo. This occurrence “warrants ongoing evaluation,” noted the authors of both papers. Extension studies now underway should help track safety and longer-term benefits.   There are extension studies involving participants of the clinical trials, plus additional clinical studies taking place which are currently recruiting individuals with MS who meet specific criteria. All participants receive the active therapy, and there is no placebo group.

This is the first therapy specifically approved to treat primary progressive MS. Potential safety issues identified by the FDA include infusion reactions and infections. There may be an increased risk of malignancy in people taking Ocrevus. More information about Ocrevus is available from Genentech:  1-844-OCREVUS (9am-8pm Eastern) Additional details and Frequently Asked Questions below DETAILS The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved Ocrevus™ (ocrelizumab - Genentech, a member of the Roche Group) for use in the treatment of and , making it the first therapy for the treatment of primary progressive multiple sclerosis. Ocrevus will be available as a first-line treatment, which means that there are no recommendations in the approved labeling for people to try other MS therapies before taking it. Ocrevus has not been tested in children.    “As the first therapy specifically approved to treat primary progressive MS, this represents a significant milestone,” said Kathy Costello, MS, ANP-BC, MSCN, Associate Vice President of Healthcare Access at the National MS Society.   “We are grateful that there is finally a disease-modifying treatment for people with primary progressive MS, and also an important new option for people with relapsing MS,” said Bruce Bebo, PhD, Executive Vice President, Research, at the National MS Society. “We hope this is just the first of many new treatments approved for people with progressive MS.”   Ocrevus is a monoclonal antibody that binds to a molecule (CD20) on the surface of immune cells called B cells, and reduces the numbers of certain B cells that are circulating in the blood. B cells have several functions including making antibodies, and they are believed to play a role in immune-system-mediated damage to brain and spinal cord tissues in MS. Ocrelizumab is administered by intravenous infusion every 6 months. The first dose is given in two infusions, two weeks apart. Subsequent doses are given as a single infusion.   The ORATORIO study involving people with primary progressive MS, which compared Ocrevus to inactive placebo, met its primary endpoint, showing treatment with Ocrevus significantly reduced the risk of progression of clinical disability by 24% compared with placebo in 732 people. Compared to placebo, Ocrevus also reduced the time required to walk 25 feet by 29%, and decreased the volume of brain lesions.   In the OPERA I and OPERA II studies involving people with relapsing MS, which compared ocrelizumab to interferon beta-1a (Rebif,® EMD Serono and Pfizer), Ocrevus significantly reduced the annualized relapse rate by up to 47% compared with Rebif over two years in a total of 1,656 people with relapsing MS. In addition, Ocrevus significantly delayed confirmed progression of disability on the EDSS scale by 40% compared with Rebif. Ocrevus also significantly reduced active inflammation observed on MRI scans by up to 95%, and total damage on MRI scans by up to 83% compared with Rebif.  (.pdf) for Ocrevus includes several warnings and precautions. Ocrevus can cause a wide variety of infusion-related reactions, the most frequent being itchy skin, rash, irritation in the throat, flushed face or fever, headache or other symptoms. In rare cases, these can be life-threatening. Infusion reactions occur most frequently with the first infusion, and they can occur up to 24 hours after the infusion. As a precaution, people are administered a steroid and antihistamine before their infusion and monitored at least one hour after infusion. Ocrevus increases the risk of infection, including respiratory tract infections and herpes infections. Ocrevus administration should be delayed in people with an active infection, and vaccination with live or live-attenuated vaccines is not recommended during treatment and not until B cells have been repopulated following treatment. There may be an increased risk of malignancy (cancers), including breast cancer, in people taking Ocrevus. Individuals using Ocrevus should follow standard breast cancer screening guidelines.The clinical trial results and ongoing monitoring of trial participants indicate an imbalance in the number of cancers that occurred in individuals treated with Ocrevus compared to those who were on interferon in the relapsing remitting trial and those on placebo in the primary progressive trial.The numbers are too small to know for sure if this is related directly to Ocrevus. This imbalance will require continued careful observation, evaluation, and data in larger numbers of individuals. PML: Although no cases of PML (progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy), a serious brain infection, occurred in clinical trials, PML has been observed in people taking related medications for other conditions. Typical symptoms are diverse, progress over days to weeks and include progressive weakness on one side of the body or clumsiness, vision disturbances, and changes in thinking, memory, orientation and personality. Hepatitis B Virus Reactivation: Although no cases of hepatitis B virus reactivation have been reported in people taking Ocrevus, they have occurred in people taking similar medications. Before initiating treatment with Ocrevus, individuals should have a blood test to detect hepatitis B virus.  For more information, people with MS can contact Genentech at: 1-844-OCREVUS (9am-8pm Eastern)   For people who qualify, Genentech plans to offer patient assistance programs through Genentech Access Solutions: (866) 4ACCESS/(866) 422-2377 or http://www.Genentech-Access.com.   The approval of Ocrevus is an exciting milestone for people with primary progressive MS and an encouraging new option for people with relapsing forms of the disease. The National MS Society applauds Genentech for their leadership in setting the wholesale acquisition cost (or list price) of Ocrevus at $65,000 per year -- nearly 20 percent below the current market average for an MS treatment. The continually escalating prices of MS disease-modifying therapies are creating barriers to people with MS getting these life-changing medications. Through its action on Ocrevus, Genentech is changing industry dynamics so that more people can access the life-changing treatments they need to live their best lives. We encourage other companies to follow suit, creating a drug pricing trend that keeps patients first.    - - -Read the FDA ""Snapshot"" describing the clinical trials of Ocrevus -Read details of the clinical trials of Ocrevus in two papers published in the December 21, 2016 issue of the New England Journal of Medicine: “Ocrelizumab versus Placebo in Primary Progressive Multiple Sclerosis” (Dr. Xavier Montalban and others) “Ocrelizumab versus Interferon Beta-1a in Relapsing Multiple Sclerosis” (Dr. Stephen Hauser and others)   Ocrevus is a trademark of Genentech, a member of the Roche Group. Rebif is a registered trademark of Merck KGaA and EMD Serono, Inc. FAQ About FDA Approval of Ocrelizumab – brand name Ocrevus™ – for Primary Progressive and Relapsing Forms of MS A. Ocrevus™ (ocrelizumab - Genentech, a member of the Roche Group) is a monoclonal antibody that binds to a molecule (CD20) on the surface of immune cells called B cells, and reduces the numbers of certain B cells that are circulating in the blood. B cells have several functions including making antibodies, and they are believed to play a role in immune-system-mediated damage to brain and spinal cord tissues in MS.   A. The FDA has approved ocrelizumab for the treatment of adults with  and with .   Q. Will everyone who has primary progressive MS benefit from Ocrevus? A. We don’t know, since like all clinical trials, the Ocrevus trial in primary progressive MS limited the characteristics of people who could participate. The trial only included people who were aged 18 to 55, who had an EDSS (Expanded Disability Status Scale – a scale to assess neurological functioning used in clinical trials) score of up to 6.5 (meaning they were able to walk with the help of a walker or bilateral crutches or other devices on both sides), and who had evidence of immune proteins in a test of their spinal fluid (“oligoclonal bands”). It is not possible to predict how a specific individual will respond to treatment. The use of Ocrevus in clinical practice will help determine who is likely to benefit.   Q. Will Ocrevus help people with secondary progressive MS who are no longer experiencing relapses? A. We don’t know. So far, the clinical trials of Ocrevus have involved people with relapsing forms of MS and primary progressive MS. Results were announced as positive for the trials in these populations. There is no data yet on whether Ocrevus may be effective in those people with secondary progressive MS who are no longer experiencing relapses.   A. Ocrevus is administered by intravenous (into a vein) infusion every 6 months. At the beginning of treatment there are two doses separated by 14 days. After that, there is a single infusion every 6 months.   Q. When will ocrelizumab be available by prescription? A. According to Genentech, people may talk to their MS doctors now about taking Ocrevus. The company expects supplies of the therapy to be available in about two weeks (around the week of April 4, 2017). Accessing the medication also depends on issues related to an individual’s health insurance.   Q. How effective is Ocrevus in primary progressive MS? A. The ORATORIO study involving people with primary progressive MS, which compared Ocrevus to inactive placebo, met its primary endpoint, showing treatment with Ocrevus significantly reduced the risk of progression of clinical disability by 24% compared with placebo in 732 people. Compared to placebo, Ocrevus also reduced the time required to walk 25 feet by 29%, and decreased the volume of brain lesions.   A. In the OPERA I and OPERA II studies involving people with relapsing MS, which compared ocrelizumab to interferon beta-1a (Rebif,® EMD Serono and Pfizer), Ocrevus significantly reduced the relapse rate by up to 47% compared with Rebif over two years in a total of 1,656 people with relapsing MS. In addition, Ocrevus significantly delayed confirmed progression of disability on the EDSS scale by 40% compared with Rebif. Ocrevus also significantly reduced active inflammation observed on MRI scans by up to 95%, and total damage on MRI scans by up to 83% compared with Rebif. Q. Should individuals who have relapsing MS switch from their current therapy to Ocrevus? A. The decision about whether to take Ocrevus should be made in collaboration with your MS doctor, taking into account a variety of factors including the effectiveness of any therapy you are currently using, the potential risks and benefits, as well as costs and lifestyle factors. Important questions to be considered and discussed with your doctor in terms of Ocrevus include: What is my tolerance for the risk of known side effects? What is my tolerance for the risk of adverse consequences that might emerge with longer-term use? How will my medication choice affect my ability or plans to become pregnant?  Q. If I have been taking another disease-modifying therapy for MS, how long will I have to wait before starting the Ocrevus? A.  There is no wash-out or waiting time currently established or recommended for switching from another therapy to Ocrevus. Therefore a decision to wait or proceed needs to be made in collaboration with your MS doctor.   Q. What are the potential side effects of Ocrevus? A.  (.pdf) for Ocrevus includes several warnings and precautions. Ocrevus can cause a wide variety of infusion-related reactions, the most frequent being itchy skin, rash, irritation in the throat, flushed face or fever, headache or other symptoms. In rare cases, these can be life-threatening. Infusion reactions occur most frequently with the first infusion, and they can occur up to 24 hours after the infusion. As a precaution, people are administered a steroid and antihistamine before their infusion and monitored at least one hour after infusion. Ocrevus increases the risk of infection, including respiratory tract infections and herpes infections. Ocrevus administration should be delayed in people with an active infection. Vaccinations need to be administered at least 6 week prior to starting Ocrevus and vaccination with live or live-attenuated vaccines is not recommended during treatment and not until B cells have been repopulated following treatment. PML: Although no cases of PML (progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy), a serious brain infection, occurred in clinical trials, PML has been observed in people taking related medications. Typical symptoms are diverse, progress over days to weeks and include progressive weakness on one side of the body or clumsiness, vision disturbances, and changes in thinking, memory, orientation and personality. Hepatitis B Virus Reactivation: Although no cases of hepatitis B virus reactivation have been reported in people taking Ocrevus, they have occurred in people taking similar medications. Before initiating treatment with Ocrevus, individuals should be given a blood test to detect hepatitis B virus.  Although there is long-term safety data available on other medications that work in a similar fashion (those medications that deplete B cells), the long-term safety of Ocrevus is unknown at this time.   A. There may be an increased risk of malignancy (cancers), including breast cancer, in people taking Ocrevus. Individuals using Ocrevus should follow standard breast cancer screening guidelines. The clinical trial results and ongoing monitoring of trial participants indicate an imbalance in the number of cancers that occurred in individuals treated with Ocrevus compared to those who were on interferon in the relapsing remitting trial and those on placebo in the primary progressive trial. The numbers are too small to know for sure if this is related directly to Ocrevus. This imbalance will require continued careful observation, evaluation, and data in larger numbers of individuals.   Q. Has Ocrevus been proven to be more effective than other disease-modifying therapies? A. Ocrevus has only been compared to Rebif® (interferon beta-1a, EMD Serono and Pfizer). In two phase III studies in a total of 1,656 people with relapsing MS (people with relapsing-remitting MS and those with secondary-progressive MS who were experiencing relapses), Ocrevus significantly reduced relapse rates after two years compared to Rebif. Ocrevus has not been compared in clinical trials to other disease-modifying therapies.   A. There is no specified time limit for taking Ocrevus. Like with other disease modifying medications, Ocrevus would likely be continued if the person’s MS is stable, and is experiencing no adverse events or new safety issues that could be ascribed to the medication.   Q. Will people taking Ocrevus have to get any special medical tests or monitoring? A. Your doctor will need to run a blood test prior to starting this medication to test for hepatitis B infection. For individuals with relapsing MS, some MS doctors might like to have a new “baseline” MRI prior to starting a new medication. This will be at the discretion of your doctor. Individuals using Ocrevus should follow standard breast cancer screening guidelines.   Q. Will Ocrevus help my mobility, prevent me from getting worse or reverse my progressive disability? A. Based on results from the clinical trials, Ocrevus is not likely to significantly reverse an individual’s disability, but may help stabilize it. In the ORATORIO trial for primary progressive MS, treatment with Ocrevus significantly reduced the risk of progression of clinical disability. This reduced risk of progression means that people taking Ocrevus in the trial were 24% less likely to demonstrate worsening of disability than people taking placebo. Ocrevus also reduced the time required to walk 25 feet, and decreased the volume of brain lesions. This means that as a group, people taking Ocrevus in the trial had a lower risk of progression, improved in their 25-ft walk speed and had reduced volume of brain lesions. However, it is not possible to predict how any one individual will respond to this or any other therapy.   Q. Will Ocrevus reduce disease activity in relapsing MS? A. As a group, people taking ocrelizumab in the trial had fewer relapses, fewer new or enlarging lesions on MRI and less risk of disability worsening than people who were taking Rebif (interferon beta-1a). However, it is not possible to predict how any one individual will respond to this or any other therapy.   Q. Can I continue to take supplements while on Ocrevus, such as Biotin, vitamin D, vitamin B12, etc.? A. Yes. However, it is essential that your MS doctor knows all of the prescription and over-the-counter medications, supplements and vitamins you are taking. Q. What about vaccinations and Ocrevus? Can I have a flu shot, the pneumonia shot, and the vaccine for shingles? A. Individuals should wait 6 weeks after being vaccinated before beginning therapy with Ocrevus. Any vaccination with live or live-attenuated viruses is not recommended during treatment with Ocrevus, and not until B cells have been repopulated following treatment. Individuals should speak to their doctors about whether the shot they are considering is available in an inactivated form.   Q. How often should I have an MRI while on Ocrevus? A. Your MS doctor will guide you on how often an MRI is needed. The 2015 Revised Recommendations of the Consortium of MS Centers’ Task Force for a Standardized MRI Protocol and Clinical Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Follow-Up of Multiple Sclerosis suggest a brain MRI approximately 6 months after switching to a new treatment and then routine brain MRI every 6 months to 2 years for all of those with relapsing MS. Currently there are no recommendations regarding the frequency of MRI in primary progressive MS.   Q. Will my immune system be suppressed or compromised if I take Ocrevus? Will I be more likely to “catch” ordinary infections if I take this medication? A. Ocrevus increases the risk of infection, including respiratory tract infections and herpes infections.   Q. Can I continue my other medications while I am on Ocrevus, such as Ampyra,® baclofen, and bladder medications? A. You can continue to take all of your MS symptom management medications. However, it is essential that your MS doctor knows all of the prescription and over-the-counter medications, supplements and vitamins you are taking.   Q. Will I need to have a spinal tap before starting Ocrevus? A. No.   Q. What if I no longer live in my own home. Can I still get Ocrevus if I live at an assisted living facility or a nursing home? A. Whether you live at home or in a facility should not affect your ability to be on Ocrevus. However, insurance coverage may impact access to the medication.   Q. What are the differences between relapsing-remitting MS, secondary progressive MS and primary progressive MS? A. Relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) is characterized by clearly defined attacks of new or increasing neurologic symptoms. These attacks – also called relapses or exacerbations – are followed by periods of partial or complete recovery (remissions). Secondary progressive MS (SPMS) follows an initial relapsing-remitting course. Many people who are diagnosed with RRMS will eventually transition to an SPMS course in which there is progressive worsening of neurologic function (accumulation of disability) over time. Primary progressive MS (PPMS) is characterized by worsening neurologic function (accumulation of disability) from the onset of symptoms, without early relapses or remissions. “Relapsing forms” of MS is a phrase that includes RRMS as well as progressive MS in those individuals who continue to experience relapses.   Q. Is Ocrevus more likely to help me if my disability from primary progressive MS is mild versus severe? A. It is not known who will benefit most from the use of Ocrevus. The study involving people with primary progressive MS only included individuals between the ages of 18 and 55, who had scores on the EDSS disability scale between 2.0 (minimal disability) to 6.5 (able to walk with the help of a walker or bilateral crutches or other devices on both sides). It is not possible to predict how a specific individual will respond to treatment.   Q. Is it better to take it earlier than later for treating progressive MS? A. In the ORATORIO trial for primary progressive MS, the average time from diagnosis in participants was 3.3 years. It is not known how the medication will work in people who have had primary progressive MS for longer periods of time.   Q. Is it better to take Ocrevus earlier than later for treating relapsing MS? A. In general, early and consistent treatment with a disease-modifying therapy is recommended. () However, it is not yet specifically known whether it is better to use Ocrevus earlier or later, and it is not known whether it is better to use Ocrevus before or after other disease-modifying therapies.   Q. Is there a point at which Ocrevus does not work? A. There is no known point in time when this or any MS therapy may stop working effectively. Each individual will respond differently to any given therapy, and response to treatment must be assessed regularly by your MS doctor.   A. The list price has been announced as $65,000 per year. However, the price of Ocrevus to an individual who has MS will depend on the provisions of his or her insurance coverage and the degree to which that individual will be eligible for programs designed to assist with out-of-pocket costs.   Q. What is the National MS Society’s response to the posted price of Ocrevus? A. The approval of Ocrevus is an exciting milestone for people with primary progressive MS and an encouraging new option for people with relapsing forms of the disease. The National MS Society applauds Genentech for their leadership in setting the wholesale acquisition cost (or list price) of Ocrevus at $65,000 per year — nearly 20 percent below the current market average for an MS treatment. The continually escalating prices of MS disease-modifying therapies are creating barriers to people with MS getting these life-changing medications. Through its action on Ocrevus, Genentech is changing industry dynamics so that more people can access the life-changing treatments they need to live their best lives. We encourage other companies to follow suit, creating a drug pricing trend that keeps patients first.    A. Coverage will depend on individual insurance plans. For people who qualify, Genentech plans to offer patient assistance programs through Genentech Access Solutions: (866) 4ACCESS/(866) 422-2377 or http://www.Genentech-Access.com.   Q. Where can I get information about the support that Genentech will provide to help people gain access to Ocrevus? A. Physicians and people with MS can contact Genentech for information about access at Genentech Access Solutions: (866) 4ACCESS/(866) 422-2377 or http://www.Genentech-Access.com.   Q. Is Ocrevus the same as rituximab, which is a therapy used to treat some cancers? A. No, and Ocrevus is not a derivative of rituximab. Both rituximab and Ocrevus work by depleting B cells. However, the two medications are not the same. Based on published reports, Ocrevus is manufactured differently than rituximab. Ocrevus is mostly human, and rituximab is equal parts mouse and human. These monoclonal antibodies bind to specific, but overlapping, areas of a molecule on immune B cells (called CD20 cells). There are also differences in the ways that rituximab and Ocrevus induce the death of CD20 B cells. Whether these differences are meaningful in terms of potential effectiveness in MS, or in terms of safety, is difficult to say at this time.    Q. Are there other therapies in development for progressive MS? A. Yes. The Society is closely watching clinical trials that could lead to treatments for people with progressive forms of MS. For example, positive results were recently announced from a trial of BAF-312 (Siponimod) in secondary progressive MS.  In addition, other studies include: The MS-SMART trial is testing three therapies that may have nerve-protecting properties in secondary progressive MS (with the MS Society of the U.K.). The SPRINT-MS trial of Ibudilast, an oral anti-inflammatory agent, is ongoing in people with secondary progressive and primary progressive MS thanks to a unique collaboration between NIH's NeuroNEXT Network, MediciNova, and the National MS Society. The MS-STAT2 study getting underway at University College London is a multicenter trial testing whether a repurposed cholesterol-lowering therapy can slow the course of secondary progressive MS; the Society is providing funding.The Society is also very interested in wellness research to identify exercise, dietary and other approaches that will help people who have MS live their best lives. The Society supports several clinical trials that are investigating dietary interventions for symptom management and for their potential to modify the disease process.  Q: Based on these trial results, is there still a need to invest in additional research on progressive MS? A:  Yes. We need to continue our investment in research to find solutions for progressive MS.  This trial is the first success after many disappointments. We welcome this development, but we must remain focused on finding more and better solutions for treating all forms of progressive MS. We will do this by our continued leadership in the International  and by funding research on progressive MS through our own research programs, and by encouraging other companies to commit to developing treatments for progressive forms of MS.   Multiple sclerosis is an unpredictable, often disabling . range from numbness and tingling to blindness and paralysis, and there is currently no cure for MS.

Optic neuritis (ON) is a common manifestation of multiple sclerosis (MS), and refers to inflammation of the optic nerve. It can be the initial demyelinating event in up to 20% of patients, and occurs in almost half of patients with MS.1 ON associated with demyelinating disease is generally characterized by acute to subacute, painful, and monocular vision loss. Vision typically worsens over hours to days (not months), and recovery is expected to begin within 1 month of symptom onset. The pain that occurs with optic neuritis is usually ocular, retroocular, periorbital, or a frontal headache. This pain is generally exacerbated with extraocular movements, and occurs in the vast majority of patients with typical ON.2 Patients with features atypical of ON, such as those that suggest other etiologies (i.e. abrupt onset of vision loss suggestive of a vascular etiology), warrant ophthalmology evaluation. The diagnosis of ON involves primarily clinical, electrophysiologic, and imaging evaluations. Clinically, patients typically describe central (less commonly arcuate, cecocentral, or hemianopic) vision loss that progresses over hours to days. Examination is commonly notable for impaired visual acuity, red desaturation, and an afferent pupillary defect. Funduscopic examination can appear normal acutely, but disc edema can be present in approximately one-third of patients (particularly those with anterior optic neuritis).1, 2 Optic disc pallor is generally seen weeks to months following onset of typical optic neuritis. The presence of hemorrhages or exudates on funduscopic examination is more suggestive of other, non-demyelinating etiologies of optic neuropathy and warrants ophthalmology evaluation. Imaging modalities used in the diagnosis of optic neuritis include orbital MRI and optical coherence tomography (OCT). These tools can be particularly helpful if the clinical history or physical examination findings are atypical for ON. Orbital MRI with and without contrast, performed with fat saturation sequences, generally reveals enlargement and enhancement of the affected optic nerve in the acute setting. The enhancement and edema seen on MRI generally improves over time with classic demyelinating ON. OCT evaluates the optic nerve axonal integrity by measurement of the retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL), and is generally used to evaluate for evidence of prior ON. The pattern of RNFL thinning most specific to MS is temporal.3 RNFL can appear normal in the acute setting but starts to decline within 4 weeks of ON. OCT at onset of ON is also potentially confounded by edema of the optic disc, which may lead to overestimates of baseline RNFL.4 Ganglion cell layer (GCL) thickness, another OCT measure, is not confounded by disc edema but declines in a similar time frame to RNFL and therefore may be more useful as a baseline measurement. The decrease in RNFL is thought to continue for 6 months following ON onset. Visual evoked potentials (VEPs) can also provide valuable information regarding optic nerve impairment in ON. VEPs evaluate optic nerve function by calculating P100 latency and amplitude, which are generally abnormal in the setting of acute and remote optic neuritis. Prolonged P100 latency is a characteristic of remote optic neuritis. In terms of other clinical testing, low contrast letter acuity has also emerged as a highly sensitive means by which to detect and quantify visual dysfunction following ON. Such modalities were not available for use in the ONTT, and therefore we are now able to evaluate visual impairment with greater sensitivity following ON. Once primarily ophthalmological causes of monocular vision loss (i.e. CRAO, CRVO, uveitis, glaucoma, retinal pathology, trauma, or corneal pathology) have been ruled out, the differential diagnosis of optic neuropathy, of which optic neuritis is a cause, can be broad. Vascular, inflammatory/autoimmune, infectious, neoplastic, and metabolic causes are considerations. A clinician should further narrow the diagnosis based on the timing of symptoms and associated features (Below). Anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (AION), arteritic or nonarteritic Older patients, sudden onset, lack of pain, severe vision loss with prolonged/limited recovery, hemorrhages present, altitudinal defect; see vasculitides below if arteritic Vasculitides (polyarteritis nodosa, granulomatosis with polyangiitis, temporal arteritis) Check ANCA, ESR, CRP; generally vascular presentation (acute onset) Temporal arteritis generally associated with Arteritic ION Systemic lupus erhythematosus, antiphospholipid syndrome Check ANA, cardiolipin antibodies, lupus anticoagulant, beta-2 glycoprotein antibodies Painful, acute to subacute vision loss associated with red desaturation Painful, acute to subacute vision loss associated with red desaturation Can be associated with other signs of intraocular/intraorbital inflammation (anterior uveitis, dry eye, other cranial neuropathies, glaucoma, optic nerve sheath enhancement) Painless vision loss, optic disc edema, Anti-CRMP5 (CV-2) antibodies CRION (chronic relapsing inflammatory optic neuropathy) Granulomatous inflammation, generally responsive to steroids, can be bilateral, painful Acute viral infections (EBV, HSV, VZV, West Nile Virus, CMV) Optic nerve sheath meningioma, but can have paraclinoid or sphenoid wing meningiomas causing compression Progressive vision loss over >10-14 days, young men Usually presents in childhood, bilateral and symmetric optic atrophy Associated nausea, abdominal pain, metabolic acidosis, usually bilateral Longstanding tobacco and alcohol dependence, generally bilateral, may be related to nutritional deficiencies Insidious, slowly progressive visual loss, with prolonged disc swelling Slowly progressive vision loss, 6-24 months after radiation therapy What is an appropriate diagnostic evaluation for secondary causes of unilateral optic neuritis? When a patient presents with unilateral acute optic neuritis, one should obtain a brain MRI with and without gadolinium contrast in order to evaluate for other signs of central nervous system demyelinating disease, specifically multiple sclerosis. Spinal cord MRI can also be considered to evaluate for subclinical spinal cord lesions, or to investigate further if a history suggestive of myelitis is reported. Laboratory evaluation could include testing for the previously mentioned differential diagnosis of ON: HIV, RPR, ACE, ESR, CRP, aquaporin-4 antibody, Bartonella testing, ANA, ENA, and Lyme testing.4 Testing should be expanded depending on relevant history and findings, as outlined in the table of differential diagnostic considerations above. In the appropriate clinical setting (i.e. when MS, NMOSD, neurosarcoidosis, or CNS infections are suspected), evaluation could include lumbar puncture for assessment of CNS oligoclonal bands, pleocytosis, elevated protein, and/or specific infectious studies. At the Mellen Center, we typically do not perform an extensive evaluation for typical demyelinating optic neuritis, unless a patient’s history or examination is suggestive of other potential etiologies. Atypical features, including lack of eye pain, systemic symptoms, atypical fundus findings, and bilateral disease, generally prompt a more extensive evaluation. How should this evaluation change if the optic neuritis is bilateral? More extensive evaluation is warranted if ON is bilateral, and this should include toxic/metabolic causes as outlined in the Table above. Bilateral optic neuritis can be a presenting symptom of neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders (NMOSD), anti-myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) syndrome, sarcoidosis, paraneoplastic optic neuropathy (CRMP-5), infections, and chronic relapsing inflammatory optic neuropathy (CRION). If a patient has bilateral optic neuritis and aquaporin-4 antibody testing is negative, anti-MOG antibody testing should be completed at the Mayo Clinic Laboratory. However, seronegative NMOSD is a possibility and should be considered in the appropriate clinical context, particularly in the setting of severe vision loss with poor recovery.10 If symptoms worsen following a steroid taper, sarcoidosis should be more strongly considered, and chest CT should be completed to evaluate for hilarlymphadenopathy. If paraneoplastic or metastatic disease is suspected, CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis should be completed, and a serum paraneoplastic antibody evaluation should be performed via the Mayo Clinic Laboratory to test for the presence of CRMP-5 antibodies. How should this evaluation change if the optic neuritis is recurrent? Optic neuritis can be recurrent, and potential causes include NMOSD, anti-MOG syndrome, CRION, and sarcoidosis. Therefore, the evaluation for recurrent ON is similar to that of bilateral ON. In any patient with unilateral ON, we generally test for aquaporin-4 antibodies. If this is negative and recurrent ON occurs, aquaporin-4 antibody testing can be repeated in 6 months, as this positive result would change management. Another consideration is anti-MOG syndrome, an increasingly recognized cause of optic neuritis. When a patient presents with acute inflammatory ON, treatment includes possible methylprednisolone, 1000mg IV daily for 3-5 days, followed by prednisone taper (60mg for 4 days, 40mg daily for 4 days, then 20mg daily for 4 days). However, a clinician may opt to defer steroids based upon the patient’s clinical characteristics. In the Optic Neuritis Treatment Trial (ONTT), visual recovery was faster in patients receiving IV methylprednisolone compared to those receiving placebo or oral prednisone. However, long-term visual outcomes were not significantly different between these groups. If a patient has visual acuity worse than 20/40, use of IV methylprednisolone followed by a prednisone taper is recommended. If visual acuity is better than 20/40, treatment with IV methylprednisolone should be considered if a patient has baseline visual impairment in the fellow eye, severe pain, scotoma, or an occupation that demands visual precision.13 If a patient’s brain MRI demonstrates gadolinium enhancing lesions, the impetus to treat with IV methylprednisolone is higher. What is the prognosis for recovery of vision after optic neuritis? Following an episode of typical ON, patients can be followed using several clinical and imaging modalities to monitor recovery. Visual acuity tends to recover over a period of weeks, and begins 2-4 weeks after onset.1 Monitoring of RNFL and GCL thinning following an episode of ON generally reveals RNFL thinning as early as 4 weeks, but up to 6 months after the clinical episode. The prognosis for subjective visual recovery after acute demyelinating optic neuritis due to MS is generally good, and recovery begins within 2 to 4 weeks. However, objective evidence including low contrast letter acuity and OCT measures demonstrate longstanding evidence of damage following each ON episode.6 Optic neuritis due to other etiologies (infectious and inflammatory (including NMOSD)) is variable. If a patient does not meet criteria for MS or NMOSD at the time of optic neuritis and no other causes are found, what is the appropriate monitoring and treatment strategy? Following an episode of typical optic neuritis, as reported in the ONTT, 35% of patients developed recurrent ON at ten-year follow-up. This recurrence was more common in patients with abnormal brain MRI. The risk of MS was higher for patients who had brain MRI lesions typical for MS at baseline, and generally lower for males, normal brain MRI at ON presentation, optic disc swelling, and atypical clinical features of ON. Given this risk of developing MS or other neuro-inflammatory disorders following ON, brain MRI should be repeated in 6 months, then after 1 year, to evaluate for the development of lesions that could indicate the development of MS via dissemination in time following a clinically isolated syndrome (CIS). Patients should be followed clinically for development of new neurological symptoms that could be consistent with a demyelinating event. If a patient is diagnosed with CIS at the time of optic neuritis typical for MS, with risk of MS development, a decision should be made whether initiation of disease modifying therapy is warranted. It is established that MS disease modifying therapies reduce the risk of MS development following a clinically isolated syndrome.17 Such a decision is based upon characteristics of an individual patient, including presence of brain MRI lesions. If a patient has recurrent optic neuritis not meeting MS or NMOSD criteria, what is the appropriate management strategy? If a patient has recurrent optic neuritis, an underlying cause cannot be identified, and steroid responsiveness is apparent, the diagnosis of CRION should be considered. CRION refers to a relapsing form of optic neuritis characterized by inflammation. Patients with CRION tend to have recurrent ON upon steroid withdrawal, so chronic immunosuppression is generally advised with medications including azathioprine, methotrexate, or IVIG. Another consideration in recurrent ON is anti-MOG syndrome, an increasingly recognized etiology of central nervous system demyelinating disease, including optic neuritis. Commercial testing for anti-MOG antibodies is available, and could be conducted if aquaporin-4 antibody testing is negative. The management of anti-MOG syndrome is thought to be similar to that of NMOSD. If a patient with known multiple sclerosis presents with monocular vision loss, what etiologies should be considered? Although optic neuritis is more common earlier in the course of MS, patients with MS can have optic neuritis at any point in their disease. The diagnosis of ON should therefore be considered in an MS patient who reports monocular vision loss, but other etiologies should be considered as well. Such diagnoses include temporal arteritis and ischemic optic neuropathy, which can be seen in older patients; these possible etiologies warrant emergent ophthalmological evaluation in a patient with sudden onset vision loss, scalp tenderness, jaw claudication, or new onset headaches. If the patient reports halos, ophthalmology evaluation is warranted to rule out uveitis, which can be associated with MS. Patients with MS who are on disease modifying therapies may also experience vision issues related to these medications. Specifically, patients on fingolimod are at risk for macular edema and can present with blurry or wavy central vision. Patients on natalizumab who are JC virus antibody-positive and therefore at risk for progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) can present with hemianopsia that they may perceive as monocular vision loss. Migraines are also common in patients with MS, and visual aura can often be misinterpreted as optic neuritis by patients. If a patient had previous optic neuritis and reports recurrence of symptoms that are not as severe as their initial episode, a pseudoexacerbation should be considered and the patient should be evaluated for infection. Additionally, patients with prior ON can experience Uhthoff’s phenomenon, with worsening of visual function associated with heat. Graves J and Balcer LJ.

This “BEAT-MS” study will be the first clinical trial in which the safety, efficacy, and cost-effectiveness of AHSCT will be directly compared to the best available treatments that have proven benefits for people with active relapsing MS.   “There is growing evidence that AHSCT can be a safe and effective treatment option for some people living with MS. The BEAT-MS study is designed to add to our knowledge about AHSCT by comparing the safety and effectiveness of this treatment directly with other powerful MS therapies in a well-designed and properly controlled study,” commented Bruce Bebo, PhD, Executive Vice President of Research for the National Multiple Sclerosis Society. “The results could change standards of care for people with some types of MS.”   DETAILS : The goal of (Autologous Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation) is to “reboot” the immune system, which is responsible for damaging the brain and spinal cord in MS. In AHSCT for MS, hematopoietic (blood cell-producing) stem cells, which are derived from a person’s own (scientifically referred to as “autologous”) bone marrow or blood, are collected and stored, prior to depleting much of the immune system using chemotherapy drugs. Then the stored hematopoietic stem cells are reintroduced to the body. The new stem cells migrate to the bone marrow and over time reconstitute the immune system. In many cases the ability of this new immune system to attack central nervous system myelin is greatly reduced or even eliminated along with MS relapses.   The BEAT-MS trial is being conducted by the Immune Tolerance Network and supported by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases . The purpose of this well-controlled trial is to gather evidence needed to confirm AHSCT as a standard part of the roster of disease-modifying therapies available for people with MS. Unlike medications, this actual procedure does not need FDA approval. The medications used in AHSCT are commonly used chemotherapy medications. If positive, publication of the outcomes from this trial of AHSCT will encourage greater acceptance and use by the medical community and help pinpoint who would most benefit from this approach, compared to available disease-modifying therapies.   : Participants should be ages 18 to 55, diagnosed with MS, and experiencing highly active, treatment-resistant relapsing MS, defined as two or more episodes of treatment failure in the prior 24 months while taking medication for MS. Further enrollment criteria are available from the contacts at each study site.   All people enrolled in the trial will receive some form of treatment. Participants will be randomly assigned to undergo either AHSCT or to “best available therapy” – including either Tysabri (natalizumab, Biogen), Lemtrada (alemtuzumab, Genzyme, a Sanofi Company), Ocrevus (ocrelizumab - Genentech, a member of the Roche Group), or Rituxan (rituximab - Genentech, a member of the Roche Group). The primary outcome being measured is the length of time without relapses for up to 6 years (“relapse-free survival”) -. Secondary outcomes include changes in relapse rate, disability progression, the rate of brain tissue volume loss, levels of a molecule (neurofilament light chain) that reflects damage to the nervous system, and safety/adverse events.   : To learn more about the enrollment criteria for this study, and to find out if you are eligible to participate, please contact the site nearest you, as listed on the study website, :   Sites are or will soon be recruiting in the following cities: Palo Alto, California Aurora, Colorado Worcester, Massachusetts Minneapolis, Minnesota Rochester, Minnesota Saint Louis, Missouri Buffalo, New York New York, New York Rochester, New York Durham, North Carolina Cincinnati, Ohio Cleveland, Ohio Portland, Oregon Philadelphia, Pennsylvania Dallas, Texas Houston, Texas Richmond, Virginia Seattle, Washington        Download a brochure that discusses issues to think about when considering enrolling in an MS clinical trial (PDF).   Without participants in research studies, MS research would come to a standstill. .     Tysabri is a registered trademark of Biogen Lemtrada is a registered trademark of Genzyme, a Sanofi Company Ocrevus is a registered trademark of Genentech, a member of the Roche Group Rituxan is a registered trademark of Genentech, a member of the Roche Group   Multiple sclerosis is an unpredictable, often disabling . range from numbness and tingling to blindness and paralysis, and there is currently no cure for MS.

Mittlerweile gilt es als unbestritten, dass sich die Trias „Fatigue, Depression/Angst und kognitive Störungen“ stark negativ auf die Lebensqualität betroffener Patienten und ihre Berufsfähigkeit auswirkt () . Verborgene Symptome der MS und ihr Einfluss auf Lebensqualität und Berufsfähigkeit Eine kürzlich erschienene Studie zum Einfluss der kognitiven Leistungsfähigkeit auf den Grad der Arbeitsfähigkeit konnte sehr deutlich zeigen, dass die Arbeitsfähigkeit eine direkte Funktion der kognitiven Leistung ist. Dieser Effekt blieb über verschiedene kognitive Domänen hinweg stabil, sodass dieser enge Zusammenhang als gesichert angesehen werden kann (). Ein weiteres starkes Argument dafür, die Kognition im Rahmen der MS als gewichtig anzusehen, lässt sich aus der jüngsten Publikation zur Schätzung der Kostenbelastung durch MS in Europa ableiten (). Hier zeigt sich sehr deutlich, dass Kognition neben Fatigue einen wesentlichen Beitrag zur Belastung leistet, da diese Symptome von Beginn an unabhängig vom Behinderungsgrad präsent sein können und die Produktivität der Patienten negativ beeinflussen. Die Folgekosten in Anbetracht der Betroffenheit oftmals noch sehr junger Patienten sind enorm und schließen vor allem häufige Arbeitsausfälle und Frühverrentung ein. Es sei daher bereits an dieser Stelle betont, dass eine Sensibilisierung seitens der behandelnden Ärzte (vor allem Neurologen und Hausärzte) für die unsichtbaren Symptome dringend angezeigt ist, um durch den Einsatz frühzeitiger Immun- und symptomatischer Therapie das kognitive Netzwerk so lange wie möglich funktionstüchtig zu halten. Die kognitiven Veränderungen bei Patienten mit MS fokussieren sich auf 3 wesentliche Bereiche: kognitive Verlangsamung (Einschränkung in der Informations­verarbeitungs­geschwindig­keit), Beeinträchtigungen der exekutiven Funktionen (z. B. eingeschränktes Multitasking, eingeschränkte mentale Flexibilität). Als hat sich die herausgestellt. Diese Verlangsamung lässt sich oftmals bereits zum Krankheitsbeginn mit sensitiven Testverfahren objektivieren und führt häufig dazu, dass auch andere kognitive Teilleistungen in Mitleidenschaft gezogen werden. Zudem ist eine gute kognitive Geschwindigkeit in unserer Hochleistungsgesellschaft von besonderer Bedeutung: Wer in kurzer Zeit viel leistet und dabei noch eine gute Qualität abliefert, hat beruflichen Mitstreitern etwas voraus. Wer aber für eine gute Qualität doppelt so viel Zeit benötigt, fällt rasch aus dem Rahmen. Letzteres ist genau das, was MS-Patienten nicht selten passiert. Gibt man im testpsychologischen Kontext genügend Zeit, sind die Patienten häufig in der Lage, 100 % Qualität zu erbringen. In zeitgebundenen Testverfahren sieht man häufig ein Scheitern, weil die Quantität einfach in der vorgegebenen Zeit nicht erreicht werden kann. Neben der Verlangsamung treten Probleme der auf, und zwar dahingehend, dass die Aufmerksamkeit nicht anhaltend auf dem gleichen Niveau gehalten werden kann, sondern . Das eingeschränkte Multitasking wirkt sich zudem negativ auf die Leistungsfähigkeit im Alltag aus, da nicht mehr parallel, sondernabgearbeitet werden können. Somit haben die kognitiven Domänen, die bei der MS im Speziellen beeinträchtigt sind, eine hohe Alltagsrelevanz und stellen zu jedem Zeitpunkt der Erkrankung eine beachtliche Belastung für die Betroffenen dar. Zur Evolution der kognitiven Veränderungen über die Zeit liegen nur wenige Daten aus longitudinalen und cross-sektionalen Studien vor. Diese aber sprechen kongruent für eine deutlichere Progression in den ersten 5 Jahren nach Krankheitsbeginn und eine Abschwächung im weiteren Verlauf (, ). In jedem Fall unterscheidet sich der Verlauf sehr deutlich von dem der klassischen neurodegenerativen Erkrankungen. Dies ist ein wesentlicher Punkt in der Kommunikation mit den Patienten, da oftmals die Angst im Vordergrund steht, dement zu werden. Letztere Sorge führt häufig zu einer generellen Ablehnung, den eigenen kognitiven Status erheben zu lassen. Daher ist eine frühzeitige Aufklärung der Patienten hinsichtlich der Entwicklung von kognitiven Teilleistungsstörungen sehr wichtig. Die Frage nach den konkreten Ursachen für das Auftreten kognitiver Störungen bei MS kann nicht mit Sicherheit beantwortet werden. Dennoch haben sich im Laufe der letzten 20 Jahre Hypothesen aus Studienergebnissen ableiten lassen: Zum einen zeigen bildgebende Daten, dass es nicht primär auf die Anzahl der Läsionen in der weißen und grauen Substanz ankommt, sondern vielmehr auf die Lokalisation (, ). Liegen auch nur wenige Läsionen in für die Kognition strategischen Hirnregionen, kann daraus ein kognitives Defizit resultieren. Neben der Lokalisation der Läsionen spielt die Hirnatrophie eine entscheidende Rolle. Es gilt als gesichert, dass das kortikale Gesamthirnvolumen bei kognitiv beeinträchtigten Patienten kleiner ist als bei Personen mit intakter Kognition (). Darüber hinaus gibt es Evidenz dafür, dass eine frühzeitig auftretende atrophische Veränderung in den ersten beiden Jahren nach Diagnosestellung als Prädiktor für einen ungünstigen kognitiven Verlauf in den Folgejahren zu werten ist (). Mit Korrelationskoeffizienten von 0,5 und größer stellt die zum kognitiven Status dar. In diesem Zusammenhang sei explizit auf den Thalamus verwiesen, da es Evidenz dafür gibt, dass MS-Patienten bereits in frühen Krankheitsstadien eine thalamische Atrophie entwickeln können () und dass sowohl Struktur als auch Funktion des Thalamus maßgeblich die kognitive Leistungsfähigkeit beeinflussen (). Aus den kernspintomografisch gefundenen Resultaten lässt sich gesamthaft ableiten, dass sich ein struktureller und funktioneller Schaden negativ auf die kognitive Leistungsfähigkeit auswirkt und therapeutische Ansätze möglichst frühzeitig zum Einsatz kommen sollten, solange das Netzwerk noch Ressourcen zur Kompensation besitzt. Aufgrund der Bedeutsamkeit der kognitiven Leistungsfähigkeit für das Berufs- und Sozialleben der Patienten ist eine regelmäßige angeraten. Diese Dokumentation dient dazu, dem Patienten zum einen zu signalisieren, dass er von seiner Therapie profitiert und auch hinsichtlich der Kognition stabil ist, zum anderen sollte ein sich deutlich verschlechternder kognitiver Status auch immer Anlass dazu geben, die gegenwärtige Therapie kritisch zu überdenken. Ein empfehlenswertes Instrument, um den kognitiven Status im Rahmen der klinischen Routine zu erfassen, ist die (). Sie besteht aus 3 Testverfahren: dem VLMT (verbaler Lern- und Merkfähigkeitstest) () und dem Die Durchführungszeit für die gesamte Screeningbatterie liegt bei circa 20 Minuten. Steht dafür nicht ausreichend Zeit zur Verfügung, empfiehlt es sich, zumindest den SDMT regelmäßig einmal pro Jahr durchzuführen. Die Durchführung nimmt nur 90 Sekunden in Anspruch, und die Aussagekraft des Tests ist dabei äußerst gut. Vor allem das Defizit in der kognitiven Prozessierungsgeschwindigkeit und im Arbeitsgedächtnis kann mit diesem Verfahren sehr zuverlässig erfasst werden. Selbstverständlich ersetzen Screeninginstrumente keine elaborierte neuropsychologische Untersuchung. Sie sollen eher dazu dienen, eine Sensibilisierung für die Kognition zu entwickeln, und können bei deutlich abfallender Leistung im Vergleich zum individuellen Vortest frühzeitig eine kognitive Verschlechterung aufzeigen. Die Behandlung der kognitiven Störungen bei MS ist eine , da es keine wirksame, evidenzbasierte symptomatische Therapie gibt, die jedem betroffenen Patienten empfohlen werden könnte. Zu den verlaufsmodifizierenden Immuntherapien liegen nur wenige Daten zur Kognition vor. Für die Interferone und Glatiramerazetat konnte gezeigt werden, dass sie sich nicht nachteilig auf die kognitive Leistungsfähigkeit auswirken, sondern Patienten unter der Therapie deutlich besser abschneiden als solche unter Placebo (–). Zu Natalizumab liegen Ergebnisse aus 2 Studien vor, die eine signifikante Verbesserung der kognitiven Leistungsfähigkeit in entscheidenden Domänen dokumentieren (, ). Fingolimod und Dimetylfumarat () wirken sich ebenfalls stabilisierend auf die Kognition aus, konnten aber in bisherigen Studien keine klinisch relevante Verbesserung zeigen. Eine solche Verbesserung konnte jüngst eindrücklich für Daclizumab vorgestellt werden. Im direkten Vergleich zum Interferon beta-1a i.m. schnitten die Patienten über einen Zeitraum von 144 Wochen deutlich besser ab. Hinzu kam, dass die Leistung im SDMT nach dem genannten Beobachtungszeitraum als klinisch relevante Verbesserung im Vergleich zur Baseline-Untersuchung zu werten ist (). Zur symptomatischen Behandlung der kognitiven Teilleistungsstörungen muss leider konstatiert werden, dass es keine hinreichende Evidenz für die Wirksamkeit der untersuchten Medikamente gibt, zu denen Modafinil, 4-Aminopyridin, Amantadin, L-Amphetamin, Methylphenidat, aber auch Antidementiva wie Donepezil, Rivastigmin und Memantin zählen (, ). Zu den ist zu sagen, dass sich moderates Ausdauertraining positiv auf die kognitive Leistungsfähigkeit auswirkt und eine Studie zur Frage der Intensität gezeigt hat, dass intensives, moderates und leichtes Training sich gleichsam positiv auswirken. Dies bedeutet, dass Patienten sich durchaus auch körperlich fordern können, sie aber die Trainingsintensität ihrer jeweiligen Verfassung anpassen sollten. Wichtig ist, dass überhaupt körperliche Aktivität durchgeführt wird (, ). Neben sportlicher Aktivität ist auch Hirnleistungstraining eine Maßnahme, von der viele Patienten profitieren (, ). Das Training sollte allerdings spezifisch auf die jeweiligen im Vordergrund stehenden Defizite zugeschnitten sein und nicht einen Rundumschlag darstellen im Sinne von „viel hilft auch viel“. Kognitive Defizite sind ernst zu nehmende Symptome der MS mit hoher Relevanz für den Alltag und die Berufsfähigkeit der Betroffenen. Das Erheben des kognitiven Status sollte bereits im Rahmen der Diagnosestellung erfolgen, um einen Verlauf über die Zeit und einen Vergleich zu einem Ausgangswert bei deutlicher Verschlechterung dokumentieren zu können. Es gibt Evidenz dafür, dass eine frühzeitige Immuntherapie auch als Benefit im Hinblick auf die kognitive Leistungsfähigkeit über die Zeit zu werten ist. Eine deutliche kognitive Verschlechterung kann Anzeichen eines Schubes sein (kognitive Schübe sind keine Chimäre!). Eine deutliche kognitive Verschlechterung (z. B. > 4 Punkte im SDMT) sollte in der Gesamtschau mit anderen Befunden (vor allem MRT) Anlass dazu geben, die bestehende Therapie kritisch zu überdenken. Prof. Dr. phil. Dipl.-Psych.

Doctors at are experts at identifying the different types of multiple sclerosis, or MS, in children. This chronic disorder of the central nervous system leads to damage in the brain and spinal cord. It is considered to be an autoimmune disorder, meaning the body’s immune system mistakenly attacks healthy tissue. In MS, the immune system attacks the protective coating of nerves, called the myelin sheath, throughout the central nervous system. Scar tissue called sclerosis—or lesions—forms at the sites of the damaged myelin. This disrupts nerve impulses traveling to and from the brain and spinal cord. The resulting neurological symptoms vary from person to person, depending on the amount of damage to the myelin and the part of the central nervous system that is affected. Although MS most commonly occurs , it can also affect children and teens. Approximately 2 to 5 percent of people with MS begin to experience symptoms before age 18. Symptoms and Causes of Multiple Sclerosis in Children No one knows what causes MS, though experts believe that genetics and environmental factors play a role in its development. Whereas the genetic factors related to MS are very complex, the risk of a child being diagnosed with MS is somewhat increased if the child has several family members who have the disease. No two people with MS experience exactly the same symptoms. In addition, symptoms can change or fluctuate over time. Some people may have tremors, fatigue, and muscle tightness, also called spasticity. Others may have sudden vision loss or paralysis, which may be temporary or permanent. MS can also cause forgetfulness or difficulty concentrating, as well as problems with bladder and bowel function. The symptoms of MS in children are similar to those in adults, but younger children are more likely than adults to have difficulty with balance and coordination of movements. Some develop numbness, and others have itching or irregular sensations, such as a “pins and needles” feeling or burning pains in the arms and legs. Most of these symptoms are the direct result of damage to the myelin in the central nervous system, which is why doctors consider them to be the main symptoms of MS. Secondary symptoms can arise from neurological changes. Bladder dysfunction, for example, may cause an increase in urinary frequency. This can lead to a child needing frequent bathroom breaks. Another frequent symptom is fatigue, which can interfere with daily activities. The times when a child experiences new, abrupt MS symptoms are referred to as relapses, or flare-ups. These can be followed by a period when the child does not have symptoms, which is called remission. By tracking the course of the condition over time, doctors can determine which type of MS is affecting your child. The first time a child experiences neurological symptoms that last at least 24 hours and are determined to be caused by inflammation and damage to the myelin sheath, this episode, or “attack,” is known as a clinically isolated syndrome. These attacks are the same as those that occur with MS, but a diagnosis of MS is not made until there are at least two attacks. Some children may experience only one attack and not go on to develop MS. Depending on the results of testing, such as an MRI scan, our doctors can determine if your child is in the early stages of MS and likely to experience another attack. If symptoms recur, the condition is then referred to as relapsing-remitting MS. Children with relapsing–remitting MS have attacks that alternate with periods of remission. When symptoms appear, it’s described as a relapse. The child is considered to be in remission when symptoms subside, with or without treatment. Most children are diagnosed as having relapsing-remitting MS. Typically, symptoms develop over the course of days and then spontaneously improve over weeks or months. Relapses can occur at any time, even after years of remission. Children often experience more frequent relapses than adults who have early MS, but they usually enter remission more quickly. Heat, fever, infection, fatigue, and stress can increase the severity of symptoms. The severity of a child’s symptoms may change from day to day, and even from hour to hour. Each of these variations in symptom severity is not considered to be a relapse. A symptom must last for more than 24 hours to be considered a relapse. As they age into adulthood, children with relapsing-remitting MS may transition into secondary-progressive MS. This is when the disease begins to progress more steadily, without alternating periods of relapse and remission. Adults usually transition to secondary-progressive MS about 7 to 10 years after diagnosis. However, children with MS transition more slowly, entering this stage about 20 years after diagnosis. With the availability of MS therapies, this transition may be even further forestalled. Primary-progressive MS is when the condition’s neurological dysfunctions occur without relapses or remissions. Children are almost never diagnosed with this form of MS. If a child experiences the onset of progressive neurologic dysfunction without relapse, it might not be MS but another disorder.

3a7554cd-8346-49e5-aa25-cac19720d76d,"Research Highlights from the AAN and CMSC 2018 Annual Meetings Research Highlights from the AAN and CMSC 2018 Annual Meetings Disease-Modifying Therapies in the Research Pipeline Various Strategies for Wellness and Symptom Management, Physical Activity and Exercise, Vitamin D, and Reproductive-Health Topics Hot Topics in MS: Stem Cells, Lipoic Acid, Diet and MS, Obesity and MS, Gut Microbiome, and Medical Marijuana The cascade of research driving advances in multiple sclerosis (MS) continued at the same heightened pace in the first half of 2018. The results of numerous significant studies were reported at the Annual Meeting of the American Academy of Neurology (AAN), held in Los Angeles in April, and the Annual Meeting of the Consortium of Multiple Sclerosis Centers (CMSC), which took place in Nashville in May. We have summarized some of the most interesting findings from those conferences in this update. Disease-Modifying Therapies in the Research Pipeline The treatment options for people with MS are likely to continue to expand in the years just ahead, as several disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) are in late stages of clinical development and/or are under review by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Five noteworthy studies of such “pipeline” medications are summarized here. Cladribine and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) outcomes Cladribine is an oral medication taken for up to 20 days over a period of two years. It selectively targets the immune system’s B cells and T cells, leading to depletion of those cells followed by a distinct pattern of “reconstitution” as new B cells and T cells are produced. It is approved for use in relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) in several countries, but is not yet approved for use in the United States. In the Phase III CLARITY study, cladribine showed efficacy when compared to placebo over the course of two years of use by people with RRMS. A post-hoc analysis of that study’s data examined the impact of cladribine on a subset of individuals who had high disease activity as measured by relapses, MRI findings, and other characteristics. The analysis found that the effectiveness of cladribine versus placebo in this subpopulation was comparable to that seen in the overall CLARITY population in terms of reducing MRI markers of disease activity. This includes reducing such MRI markers as cumulative new T1 gadolinium-enhancing lesions and cumulative combined unique active lesions. This post-hoc analysis did not focus on safety. However, in the CLARITY study from which this analysis’ MRI data were derived, certain adverse events occurred more frequently in the cladribine groups than in participants receiving placebo. These adverse events included lymphocytopenia (21.6 percent in the 3.5-mg cladribine group and 31.5 percent in the 5.25-mg group, versus 1.8 percent in the placebo group), and herpes zoster (eight patients and 12 patients, respectively, versus no patients). As clinicians experience continued progress in treating MS overall, an increasing focus is placed on improving outcomes in people with high disease activity. Studies of this type help provide informed treatment strategies for these individuals. Opicinumab is a monoclonal antibody that targets LINGO-1, a protein in the central nervous system whose role is to halt myelination (repair of the protective covering of the nerves) and prevent the survival of neurons (nerve cells). The SYNERGY trial assessed various doses of opicinumab, given by intravenous infusion, in combination with interferon beta-1a, over the course of 72 weeks in people with relapsing forms of MS (RMS). The results showed a sort of “inverted U” effect with more favorable outcomes in the 10 mg/kg and 30 mg/kg dose groups, indicating that other factors may have been involved in how the participants responded. That finding prompted investigators to explore those factors associated with a better response to opicinumab. Their post-hoc analysis identified three factors associated with better response to the medication: shorter disease duration (less than 20 years); lower baseline magnetization transfer ratio values in T2 lesions, which may signify lower myelin content in those lesions; and lower baseline diffusion tensor imaging-radial diffusivity values in T2 lesions, a characteristic that may be consistent with greater structural integrity. Practicing “precision medicine” involves identifying those factors that enable clinicians to give the right medication to the right patient at the right time. As this study shows, that effort may entail drawing on highly technical, and possibly even less understood, biomedical characteristics and concepts in the service of individualizing care. Ublituximab and central nervous system lesions in relapsing MS Ublituximab is a monoclonal antibody given by infusion. Like Ocrevus, ublituximab targets the CD20 molecule. Researchers evaluated 24-week data from a Phase II trial of the medication in people with relapsing forms of MS. Among 31 individuals who had a total of 73 T1 gadolinium-enhancing (Gd+) lesions on MRI at baseline, no T1 Gd+ lesions were found at Week 24. Additionally, T2-lesion volume decreased by 8.1 percent from baseline to Week 24, prompting the authors to conclude that ublituximab has “robust efficacy” on MRI endpoints. Ozanimod is an oral, once-daily medication being evaluated for use in RRMS. It is a selective modulator of two types of S1P receptors: S1P1 and S1P5. Data from two Phase III studies, SUNBEAM and RADIANCE Part B, show that ozanimod, given at 1 mg/daily and 0.5 mg/daily, had favorable outcomes relative to Avonex (interferon beta-1a) – both in terms of annualized relapse rate (ARR) and MRI findings. Annualized relapse rate, or ARR, refers to how many relapses a person in a particular study group is likely to have, on average, over a one-year period. For example, if the placebo group in a clinical study had an ARR of “1,” the average person in that group could expect to have one relapse per year. Ozanimod, given at doses of either 1.0 mg or 0.5 mg, reduced the ARR by 48 percent and 31 percent respectively, compared to interferon beta-1a in the SUNBEAM trial. In these same doses, it also reduced the ARR by 38 percent and 21 percent respectively, compared to interferon beta-1a in the RADIANCE trial. Meanwhile, the adjusted mean number of new or enlarging T2 lesions was reduced by 25 percent to 48 percent in people taking ozanimod versus those receiving interferon beta-1a. Additionally, the individuals taking ozanimod had fewer adverse events overall and fewer adverse events leading to study discontinuation. Siponimod, relapses, and disability progression in secondary-progressive MS Siponimod is an oral medication being studied for use in secondary-progressive MS (SPMS). Its mechanism of action is similar to that of Gilenya (fingolimod), in that it works at the S1P receptor family to block the movement of lymph cells from lymph nodes; however, siponimod appears to interact with fewer of the receptors than Gilenya does – with its primary actions at the S1P1 and the S1P5 receptors, the same receptors that ozanimod targets. The Phase III EXPAND study showed that siponimod reduced confirmed disability progression (CDP). Investigators analyzed the results of that trial to understand to what extent, if any, this effect was related to a reduction in relapses. This information is important to uncover, because it could have implications for the effectiveness of the medication in people who do not experience relapses or who have very infrequent relapses. Using sophisticated statistical analyses, the researchers concluded that, “Siponimod treatment reduces the risk for CDP in both relapsing and non-relapsing SPMS patients. Our analyses suggest that siponimod’s effect on disability is largely independent from the effect on relapses.” Research into the safety and effectiveness of a DMT does not stop when that medication wins approval from the FDA. Several recently reported studies provide ongoing information on approved DMTs or findings from focused analyses of data from those medications’ major Phase III clinical trials. Highlights from several such studies are reported below. Ocrevus (ocrelimzumab) was approved by the FDA in 2017 for RMS and PPMS. The medication is administered by IV infusion, with 600 mg given every six months. The safety and efficacy of Ocrevus were assessed in two large clinical trials, OPERA I and OPERA II, in which individuals with relapsing MS received either Ocrevus or Rebif (interferon beta-1a). At the end of those trials, study participants were allowed to continue on Ocrevus or switch from Rebif to Ocrevus during a so-called “open-label extension” (OLE) period. A recent analysis found that switching from Rebif to Ocrevus at the start of the OLE period was associated with rapid and significant reductions in disease activity as identified on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Patients who changed therapies in the OLE went from having an adjusted number of 0.48 T1 gadolinium-enhancing lesions per scan prior to switching, to an average 0.00 such lesions per scan after one year and two years on Ocrevus. Tysabri (natalizumab) is a monoclonal antibody that is administered by IV infusion of a 300-mg dose every four weeks. The medication was approved for use in adults with relapsing MS in 2004. However, Tysabri was voluntarily withdrawn from the market the next year after three cases of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), a rare but potentially fatal brain infection caused by the JC virus, were identified in individuals taking the medication. Tysabri became available again in 2006, following implementation of a comprehensive risk-management program, which includes testing potential Tysabri users to see if they have anti-JC virus antibodies. Now, a team of New Zealand researchers have reported favorable results with administering Tysabri every six weeks rather than every four weeks, noting that they pursued extended-interval dosing with a view toward reducing the risk of PML. Those investigators report that after administering Tysabri at six-week intervals to 27 patients for an average of two years, none of the participants had lesions on MRI, and only one reported relapse. No participants were diagnosed with PML. This treatment strategy reflects ongoing efforts across the MS treatment spectrum to balance efficacy and safety to the patient’s maximal advantage. Aubagio (teriflunomide) was approved in 2012 for use in relapsing MS. It is an oral medication administered as 7-mg or 14-mg once daily. An analysis of long-term data on patients with relapsing MS who participated in two Phase III trials of the medication and the extensions of those trials found that 74 percent taking the 14-mg dose had stable or improved Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) scores over five years. Mean EDSS scores at five years were higher (indicating disease progression) in those who experienced a relapse, compared with those who did not – at 2.70 and 2.43 respectively. A separate study examined 169 pregnancies in women who took Aubagio during pregnancy. Based on findings of teratogenicity – an elevated incidence of birth defects – in animal studies, use of the medication is contraindicated in pregnant women and females of reproductive potential not using effective contraception. Nonetheless, some women have taken the medication shortly before conceiving or while pregnant. In this study, the final dose of Aubagio was administered pre-conception or in the first trimester in all but four cases. Outcomes were known for 67 of the 169 pregnancies. Two structural abnormalities were reported: one case of congenital hydrocephalus in a full-term pregnancy and one cystic hygroma (a fluid-filled sac resulting from a blockage in the lymphatic system) detected on ultrasound during pregnancy (with the outcome of that pregnancy unknown). Researchers concluded that the current data from pregnancies exposed to teriflunomide show no warning signs of a treatment-related increased risk for birth defects. Lemtrada (alemtuzumab) is a monoclonal antibody approved for use in RMS in 2014. It is administered by intravenous infusion over four hours for two multi-day treatment courses 12 months apart. Researchers recently analyzed data on 393 individuals who had participated in clinical trials of Lemtrada and then remained on the medication during a longer-term extension study. The researchers found that after using Lemtrada for six years, 77 percent of the more than 300 patients studied showed stable or improved Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) scores compared to their baseline scores. Additionally, 43 percent achieved a six-month confirmed disability improvement (CDI), further underscoring the long-term benefits of treatment. Another analysis examined outcomes in extension-study patients who received re-treatment with Lemtrada due to disease activity after the initial two courses of therapy. Among 178 participants who received at least one re-treatment, the annualized relapse rate (ARR) fell from 0.85 (12 months before receiving a third course of Lemtrada) to 0.20 (12 months after the third course). The percentage of individuals with a CDI increased from 4 percent to 14 percent over those two time periods. Researchers concluded, “Patients who were re-treated due to relapse and/or MRI activity after the initial two courses demonstrate continued alemtuzumab [Lemtrada] efficacy after [Course 3] with reduced relapses and stable or improved disability.” Glatiramer acetate is an injectable DMT approved for use in relapsing forms of MS. It is available both as a branded medication (Copaxone) and in generic form from two other companies. In a one-year, placebo-controlled study, administering the medication in a dose of 40 mg/mL three-times weekly reduced the annualized relapse rate (ARR) by 34 percent and MRI disease activity by 34.7 percent relative to placebo. A new analysis shows that those benefits were sustained for up to five years in people participating in the open-label phase of the study, which was supported by Teva. The overall ARR during the entire long-term follow-up period was 0.26 for individuals who started on glatiramer acetate in the placebo-controlled phase of the study, and was 0.32 for those who switched from placebo to glatiramer acetate in the open-label phase. Researchers added that the most common adverse events seen over the long term were generally mild and consistent with the medication’s established safety profile. Interferon beta-1b was the first DMT approved for use in MS, and today is available in branded form as Betaseron and Extavia. A 23-year observational follow-up study was conducted with 87 patients treated at the Henry Ford Health System in Detroit. The study found that 29 percent of individuals used the medication for less than one year, while 18 percent remained on therapy for more than 15 years. Of the individuals who stopped treatment, side effects were the reason cited most often in those who discontinued therapy before five years of use, while lack of efficacy was given as the reason for stopping in those who used the medication for longer periods. A stable disease course on a DMT does not predict continued stability after discontinuing that therapy, regardless of a person’s age. Noting that clinicians sometimes recommend stopping DMT therapy as individuals with MS get older, researchers assessed the advisability of this strategy by examining data from the New York State MS Consortium (NYSMSC) database. Of 135 patients who were considered stable on DMT therapy as determined by minimal change in EDSS score, 35.6 percent saw their EDSS score worsen after stopping their DMT. Age did not affect post-discontinuation course, with 34.1 percent of people age 54 years and younger and 37.7 percent of people age 55 years and older recording unfavorable changes in their EDSS scores after going off a DMT. People with MS and their healthcare providers today face a “welcome dilemma” unimaginable even 20 years ago. With more than a dozen disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) now approved by the FDA for use in adults, patients and clinicians have an opportunity (and challenge) to select the medication likely to best address the each individual’s specific health status and needs. That can be a daunting prospect, particularly because few clinical trials have directly compared one agent with another. Given the scarcity of such studies, investigators often rely on sophisticated analytical methods – such as propensity scoring and other techniques – to assess the merits of one agent relative to others. Those methods, while useful, typically are considered by physicians to be less authoritative than a head-to-head trial of two agents. This section highlights five recently presented studies that compared agents within the same trial or via analysis of data drawn from different trials or large patient databases. In considering various treatments, however, it is critical to not only look at clinical trial data and other analyses, but also for individuals to talk with their clinician about their specific history and circumstances – in order to individualize their care and achieve an optimal effect. DMT impact on cognition in patients at increased risk of progressive disease The OPERA 1 and OPERA 2 trials were identical Phase III studies that compared the effectiveness and safety of Ocrevus (ocrelizumab) to Rebif (interferon beta-1a) in people with relapsing MS. Study participants received either 600 mg of Ocrevus every 24 weeks or 44 ug of Rebif three times a week for 96 weeks. The studies included 186 individuals receiving Ocrevus and 180 receiving Rebif who were considered to be at increased risk of progressive disease based on their Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) and pyramidal Kurtzke Functional Systems scores. Participants completed the Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT) at baseline and during the course of 96 weeks to assess their cognitive function. Over the study period, individuals receiving Ocrevus who were at increased risk for disease progression had a greater mean improvement in SDMT scores than did increased-risk individuals receiving Rebif (6.2 for Ocrevus versus 2.6 for Rebif). Assessing DMTs in terms of annualized relapse rates Annualized relapse rate (ARR) is a measure of a DMT’s impact on disease course in MS. Researchers drew on data from two studies of Plegridy (peginterferon beta-1a) and two studies of Aubagio (teriflunomide) to assess the ARR in newly diagnosed individuals starting one or the other of those medications. The participants had been diagnosed with relapsing MS within one year of study enrollment and had not taken other DMTs. The investigators used individual patient data from the studies to match analyzed subjects by key baseline characteristics. Their analysis showed that at 108 weeks after treatment initiation, the ARR was numerically lower in newly diagnosed individuals receiving Plegridy than in newly diagnosed Aubagio patients. However, this difference was not statistically significant. In a separate study, a German network of more than 130 neurologists drew on its database of roughly 25,000 individuals with relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) to assess various DMTs in terms of ARR. The analysis found that Tecfidera (dimethyl fumarate) had a statistically significant reduction in ARR versus interferon medications. Tecfidera also performed better than the other agents in terms of time to first relapse. A third study assessed the ARR in people with highly active RRMS who switched to either Tysabri (natalizumab) or Gilenya (fingolimod) after inadequate response to DMTs that are considered first-line therapies in Europe. Such medications include interferon medications, glatiramer acetate, Aubagio, and Tecfidera. Researchers analyzed data for 897 “patient triplets” or matched sets of individuals who either switched from one first-line therapy to another or from a first-line therapy to Tysabri or Gilenya. The study drew from the MSBase Registry, an international online registry for neurologists studying multiple sclerosis and other neuro-immunological diseases. The analysis found that after switching, individuals moving from a first-line therapy to Tysabri had an ARR of 0.21; those moving to Gilenya had an ARR of 0.30; and those switching from one first-line therapy to another had an ARR of 0.33. The ARR was statistically significantly reduced for Tysabri, with no evidence of difference for Gilenya. Earlier this year, Gilenya (fingolimod) became the first DMT approved to treat relapsing MS in adolescents and children aged 10 years and older. This medication was approved for use in adults with RMS in 2010. The Phase III PARADIGMS study compared use of Gilenya to interferon beta-1a for up to two years in 214 individuals aged 10 to 17 years with pediatric-onset MS. At the end of the study, Gilenya reduced the annualized rate of new or newly enlarging T2 lesions by 52.6 percent and the number of gadolinium-enhancing T1 lesions per scan by 66.0 percent compared with interferon beta-1a. The early recognition of MS and the evidence-based assessment of likely disease course are critical to patients’ and physicians’ ability to engage in shared decision-making on treatment choices and overall wellness strategies. A significant amount of research is being conducted to map the connections between imaging findings or biomarker levels and establishing the diagnosis and predicting the course of MS. Other studies are focused on what measures of physical function may reveal about current and future health status. Several recent studies exploring these issues are highlighted below. 2017 McDonald Criteria apply well to children at MS onset MRI findings play a key role in the diagnosis of MS, but most research on the significance of imaging results has been focused on adults. Now, a study by investigators from The Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia and other institutions, has found that the 2017 McDonald Criteria are largely applicable to children, as well as adults, when assessing patients at clinical disease onset. The researchers assessed more than 2,800 MRI scans from 331 pediatric patients with MS, acquired demyelinating syndrome, and related conditions, and followed those patients’ course over a median of six years. They found that the presence of ≥one T1-hypointense lesions or ≥one periventricular lesions were the MRI features most predictive of MS outcome. The 2010 McDonald criteria and 2017 version of those criteria had comparable utility in predicting a pediatric patient’s disease course, but the investigators said the 2017 criteria were easier to apply. “Both ‘black holes’ and periventricular lesions at baseline are strong predictors of MS” in children, as they are in adults, the researchers concluded, adding that evidence of new disease activity is required to confirm MS in children who present with acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM). Location of brain lesions predictive of walking speed The presence of MRI-detected lesions in the infratentorial/cerebellar region of the brain is associated with slower walking speed in people with MS, according to a retrospective chart review of 82 individuals. A team of Connecticut-based researchers reviewed magnetic resonance images and medical records to determine whether the location of lesions in four areas of the central nervous system – the spinal cord, and the infratentorial/cerebellar, juxtacortical, and periventricular regions of the brain – was associated with mobility and disability in people with MS. No significant relationship was found between number of CNS regions with lesions and Extended Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score or time in performing the Timed 25-Foot Walk test. Similarly, no significant relationship was seen between the presence of lesions in any one region of the CNS and EDSS score. Higher number of oligoclonal bands correlates with relapses and disease progression People with relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) who had 10 or more oligoclonal bands (OCBs) in their cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples were far more likely to have relapses and disease progression over the ensuing two years than individuals with RRMS who had <10 OCBs in their CSF samples. That was the finding from a retrospective study of 128 people with RRMS on DMT therapy. Researchers from the University of Pennsylvania also found that in addition to having more relapses and more new lesions on MRI, people with ≥10 OCBs were more likely to begin using an assistive device relative to their counterparts with fewer OCBs. “As OCBs may have greater diagnostic weight going forward, the quantity may be important in guiding selection of DMTs,” the study’s authors noted. Tapping into a new means of assessing MS subtype and mobility The number of times a person with MS can tap his or her foot in 10 seconds correlates with MS subtype and with results of mobility measures such as the 25-Foot Walk Test (25FWT). This finding was discovered by researchers from the University of Massachusetts Amherst and related institutions. In a study of 30 people with non-progressive MS, 30 with progressive MS, and 17 age- and sex-matched healthy controls, 10-second tap counts distinguished people with MS from healthy controls, and those with progressive MS from their peers with non-progressive MS. Further, slower foot tapping correlated with slower performance on the 25FWT and Timed Up and Go test (TUG). “The associations between foot tap speed and mobility measures, such as the TUG test and 25FWT, suggest that rapid foot-tapping may be a useful marker for tracking or predicting progression of mobility dysfunction in people with MS, regardless of their ability to ambulate,” the researchers noted. Various Strategies for Wellness and Symptom Management, Physical Activity and Exercise, Vitamin D, and Reproductive-Health Topics People with MS often must contend with a wide range of issues affecting their quality of life, overall health status, and general well-being. As the nature and impact of those issues have become better understood in recent years, an array of healthcare professionals – from psychologists and physical therapists to health educators and epidemiologists – are analyzing databases and devising innovative programs to further define and more effectively address challenges involving everything from insomnia to infertility. To follow are highlights of research in these areas. These were reported earlier this year at the Annual Meetings of the American Academy of Neurology (AAN) and the Consortium of Multiple Sclerosis Centers (CMSC). Well, maybe not the absolute best medicine, but apparently good medicine when it comes to addressing depression in people with MS and other neurologic conditions. Researchers at Evergreen Health in Kirkland, Washington, conducted a prospective, open trial of laughter therapy (LT) for 31 participants: 17 with MS, eight with Parkinson’s disease, two with spinal cord injury, and the remainder with other disorders of the central nervous system. After participating in eight, 60-minute laughter therapy classes taught by a certified LT instructor (yes, there is such a thing), participants who completed the course saw an improvement from baseline in their scores on a measure of depression. Scores on a separate measure of anxiety essentially were unchanged from baseline. “Our findings show that LT may reduce depression and be administered across a variety of neurological deficits, including for people with limited exercise options due to severe disability,” the researchers noted. However, they added that the approximate 50 percent attrition rate – with 14 participants not completing the program – may indicate a potential shortcoming for when the intervention is employed in people with neurological conditions. Comparing strategies for stress reduction in people with MS Both mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) and group education on stress reduction can provide short-and long-term benefits to people with MS, according to a randomized study involving 62 adults with MS and Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) scores of ≤8.0. Compared to their status at the start of the study, people in both groups experienced significant reductions in stress both eight weeks and 12 months after participating in an MBRS program or group education. Both groups also saw improvement on a measure of emotional well-being at eight weeks, but that improvement was no longer statistically significant at 12 months. No significant differences were found between the two groups in terms of degree of stress reduction achieved or improvement in emotional well-being, suggesting that both approaches are viable options for addressing the stress and other emotional issues that can be part of living with MS. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) may improve insomnia symptoms, sleep quality, and fatigue in the roughly 40 percent of people with MS who experience chronic insomnia, according to an ongoing study. Seven people have completed the randomized controlled trial thus far, with five participating in a six-week program of CBT for insomnia and two serving as controls. The CBT group showed a 78 percent improvement from baseline on a measure of insomnia symptoms, compared to a 38 percent improvement in the control group. Similarly, sleep quality improved by 63 percent for people in the CBT group and 32 percent in the control group. Additionally, two measures of fatigue showed improvements of 70 percent and 50 percent, respectively, for people receiving CBT, versus a 37 percent improvement and 20 percent worsening, respectively, for control group members. Can shared medical appointments enhance wellness in MS? So much needs to happen in an MS patient’s regular visit with his or her clinician. As a result, education on wellness, managing co-morbidities, and other important topics can get lost in the time crunch. Two researchers from Cleveland explored whether shared medical appointments, or SMAs, may be a solution to that problem. In the typical SMA model, individual appointments for patients are scheduled around a time set aside for group instruction and discussion. In this case, the Cleveland researchers offered a monthly SMA, with group sessions covering topics such as nutrition, therapeutic yoga, and guided imagery. Thirty-three patients attended at least one SMA, with 45 percent of those participants returning for at least one more SMA, and 36 percent attending three or more sessions. Patient-satisfaction assessments found 75 percent of participants had a favorable view of the value of the information presented and regarding attending future SMAs. Female patients attended preferentially relative to men, noted the researchers, adding that “encouraging wellness interventions at an earlier age and to wider demographics and disability level” may encourage more people with MS to adopt healthy lifestyle practices. Becoming physically active is a challenge for people with MS – and for all people, for that matter. Staying active after completing a formal physical therapy or exercise program can be even more of a challenge. However, two New York City physical therapists have reported success in encouraging ongoing physical activity among seven of eight participants in a six-week wellness exercise class (WEC) they conducted. All eight of the program’s participants recently had been discharged from outpatient physical therapy. The weekly exercise class that they then entered consisted of 60 minutes of progressive aerobic and resistance training, as well as stretching. Upon completing the six-week class, participants showed improvement from baseline on several measures of the physical and psychological impact of MS. And, in keeping with the adage that success begets success, at a follow-up four weeks after completing the class, seven of the eight class members reported being active in an independent gym program. The researchers concluded, “Providers should work with physical therapists to assure that, after rehabilitation, affordable opportunities such as group WEC exist to help those with MS have the opportunity to independently engage in an exercise program. This bridge between therapy and discharge could safely enhance adherence to exercise post rehabilitation, and potentially decrease the need for a future prolonged course of PT.” Research supports maximal strength training for people with MS Properly supervised maximal strength training (MST) is safe for people with MS and can help improve their strength, balance, and walking speed, according to a team of researchers from Hunter College in New York City. Those researchers conducted a pilot study in which nine people with MS (six women and three men) participated in an eight-week program. The twice-weekly sessions involved leg press, knee flexion, and ankle plantarflexion, with weights increased based on participant capability and preference. At the end of the exercise program, the participants showed significant improvement from baseline in the Six Minute Walk Test and Mini-BESTest. Meanwhile, measures of fatigue and spasticity did not change significantly from the study’s start until its end, suggesting that the strength training did not increase fatigue or spasticity. The researchers noted that while the study is ongoing, the results to date suggest that “MST is a safe and effective intervention, and that [people with multiple sclerosis] can benefit from a higher intensity of intervention than might have previously been thought.” Time spent in physical activity correlates with higher Vitamin D concentrations in people with MS, according to a study of 23 women and 15 men with multiple sclerosis and an Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score of ≤4.0. Researchers used an activity-monitoring device, patient diaries, and measurement of Vitamin D blood levels to follow patients over a one-month period. The participants did not take Vitamin D supplements before or during the study. The fact that study participants who were more physically active had higher levels of Vitamin D than those who were not as active – despite the fact that they were not taking the Vitamin D supplements, is intriguing. This is because many MS patients have lower-than-normal Vitamin D levels, and because physical activity has been shown to improve outcomes in MS. The study’s authors noted that alternative pathways leading to the connection between disease progression and Vitamin D levels need to be considered. Long-term reduction in spasticity seen with intrathecal baclofen therapy Five years after implantation of a pump to deliver intrathecal baclofen therapy, both ambulatory and non-ambulatory people with MS had significant reductions in spasticity, according to researchers from the Cleveland Clinic Mellen Center and related institutions. Those researchers examined the records of 77 individuals (40 ambulatory and 37 non-ambulatory) who had a pump implanted between 2001 and 2014, and for whom at least three years of follow-up data were available. The patient’s mean age at surgery to implant the pump was 47.1 years; 62 percent of the patients were women. For ambulatory patients, spasticity as measured by the Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS) improved from 14.5 (range 10.8-20.25) at baseline to 2 (range 0-8) after five years on IBT. For non-ambulatory patients, MAS score improved from 24 (range 16.5-26) to 2 (range 0-5) after five years of IBT. Pain scores also improved significantly in both groups. Physical therapy (PT) has been shown to improve gait speed in people with MS. The medication dalfampridine extended-release (DER) also can increase gait speed in those with MS, but only about 38 percent of individuals experience this benefit. Now, the results of a small study support combining the interventions in people with MS who do not see a 20 percent or greater improvement in their Timed 25 Foot Walk test (T25W) after three weeks on the medication. The study involved eight adults with MS. Four of those people had been taking DER for three weeks and did not have a ≥20 percent improvement in T25W at the end of that period. They continued on DER for another six weeks, but also engaged in twice-weekly physical therapy during that period. The other four participants did not receive DER but also engaged in six weeks of twice-weekly PT. Among the DER + PT patients, T25FW results improved by 20.7 percent from Week 3 to Week 9, while the PT-only group had a 6.8 percent improvement in T25W during that period. Infertility and MS – findings from a large database analysis Women with MS are more likely to have a diagnosis of infertility, less likely to use infertility medications, and less likely to have a live birth than their age-matched peers without MS. Those are the main findings from an analysis of United States’ commercial insurance claims for 117,041 women with MS and more than 1.4 million women without MS. The analysis, which spanned the period from 2006 through 2015, found that 8.52 percent of women with MS and 8.02 percent of those without MS had a diagnosis of infertility. While that percentage difference is small, the researchers noted that it is statistically significant. Similarly, a significantly lower proportion of women with MS used any fertility treatment relative to women without MS (1.01 percent versus 1.19 percent). Finally, the rate of live births in women on any infertility treatment was 5.00 percent among women with MS, compared with 6.98 percent among those who did not have MS. Data from the New York State Multiple Sclerosis Consortium (NYSMSC) provide reassuring news regarding both the incidence of relapses during pregnancy and the near-term effect on infants of maternal use of DMTs in pregnancy. Among 109 women who reported a pregnancy after being diagnosed with MS, 48.6 percent had a relapse in the two years before becoming pregnant, but just 11.9 percent reported a relapse during pregnancy. Those relapses were more common in the first and second trimesters than in the third trimester. Meanwhile, 45.8 percent of the women reported a relapse in the first two years after birth, with most of the relapses occurring in the first year after delivery. Women who had experienced a relapse in the 24 months before pregnancy were more likely than others to have a relapse in the 24 months after birth, while relapse during pregnancy was not associated with postpartum relapse. Eleven of the women in the analysis were on disease-modifying therapy (DMT) for at least part of their pregnancy, with six continuing to use their DMT through their entire pregnancy. None of those women reported birth problems, and none of their children had been referred for special medical services at age 1 or 2 years. Hot Topics in MS: Stem Cells, Lipoic Acid, Diet and MS, Obesity and MS, Gut Microbiome, and Medical Marijuana Research into interventions for MS extends far beyond the important efforts to develop new pharmacologic treatments and to better understand the efficacy and safety profile of currently approved medications. Increasingly, investigators are assessing the impact of diet, the gut microbiome – a key component of the immune system – and various substances as they look for ways to manage symptoms and improve outcomes. Studies also are exploring the role of two very different types of interventions long used to treat other conditions — medical marijuana and stem-cell transplantation – in MS. This section reviews pertinent findings in these and other areas reported at the 2018 Annual Meetings of the American Academy of Neurology (AAN) and the Consortium of Multiple Sclerosis Centers (CMSC). When relapses continue while taking a DMT – a role for stem-cell therapy? An international team of researchers is assessing the role of stem-cell transplantation for individuals with highly active RRMS who continue to have relapses despite taking a DMT. At the AAN’s annual meeting, those scientists reported interim results from their Multiple Sclerosis International Stem cell Transplant (MIST) trial. The study involves 110 individuals with RRMS on a DMT who have had two or more relapses in the past 12 months. Fifty-five patients were randomly assigned to receive stem-cell transplantation, while the other 55 continue to receive the DMT that their treating neurologist deemed best for them. Importantly, the study is employing “non-myeloablative” stem-cell transplantation, meaning that patients can go through a less-demanding pre-treatment regimen than what was first used in stem-cell transplantation and still often used in treating certain types of cancer. The study’s main endpoint is treatment failure, defined as a 1.0 increase in EDSS sustained for six months or more. After a mean follow-up of three years, 60 percent of patients in the DMT arm had experienced a treatment failure, compared to just 6 percent of those in the stem-cell transplant group. During the first year after transplant, those receiving stem cells saw their EDDS score improve from 3.5 to 2.4, while it worsened in the DMT group from 3.3 to 3.9. Both of those findings were statistically significant. No deaths occurred in the stem-cell transplant group. These results led the researchers to conclude that in people with RRMS who have more than two relapses in a year while on a DMT, stem-cell transplantation is superior to continued use of a disease-modifying therapy. Meanwhile, a separate, smaller study from a single center suggests that stem-cell transplantation may be a first-line option for the minority of MS patients who have rapidly evolving severe multiple sclerosis (RESMS), also known as highly active relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS). British investigators performed stem-cell transplantation on five men and two women who had not received a disease-modifying therapy (DMT), and who had experienced two or more severe relapses in the 12 months before the procedure. These individuals all had clinical or imaging findings that suggested that their MS would continue to worsen, and all had at least one gadolinium-enhancing lesion seen on MRI associated with their relapses. They ranged in age from 27 to 52 years old, and their median time between symptom onset and treatment was nine months. The investigators used each patient’s own stem cells for the procedure. After a median follow-up period of 18 months, none of the participants had experienced a relapse following the transplantation, although one had a single new gadolinium-enhancing lesion six months after treatment. The median Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score for these individuals improved from a median 5.5 before treatment to 3 at the last follow-up. No serious adverse effects were observed. The investigators concluded that autologous (using the patient’s own cells) hematopoietic (blood-cell producing) stem-cell transplantation is safe and effective for previously untreated patients with rapidly evolving, severe MS. Lipoic acid is a naturally occurring compound that exhibits antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. Its potential role as a dietary supplement for people with MS has been the focus of recent research, including a study by investigators from the Oregon Health & Science University and VA Portland Health Care System. Those researchers administered 1,200 mg of oral lipoic acid to people with relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS), secondary-progressive MS (SPMS), and healthy controls. They then drew blood samples to measure the amount of lipoic acid found in the plasma of all three groups, as well as levels of substances involved in immune system responses. In particular, the investigators wanted to see if taking lipoic acid would stimulate the body’s production of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), which plays a role in modulating the immune system. They found that two hours and four hours after ingesting lipoic acid, the health controls and people with SPMS had increased cAMP levels relative to baseline, while those with RRMS had decreases in cAMP. Also, women with RRMS had lower plasma concentrations of prostaglandin E2, which stimulates cAMP, compared to women with SPMS and women without MS four hours after taking lipoic acid. These findings prompted the investigators to conclude that the differences in the way people with RRMS responded to lipoic acid relative to those without MS or with SPMS may have implications for the efficacy of immunomodulatory agents in RRMS. Following a paleolithic diet can help decrease fatigue in MS through changes in people’s lipid profiles, according to a study reported at the AAN annual meeting. The paleolithic – or so-called “caveman” diet – focuses on eating meat, fish, nuts, and vegetables available before the advent of processed food. A one-year study of 18 people with progressive MS found that a comprehensive intervention that included following a paleolithic diet, neuromuscular stimulation, and stress reduction reduced participants’ mean Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS) score from 5.51 at baseline to 3.03 at 12 months. During that time, participants saw their HDL-C (“good cholesterol”) levels increase, their total cholesterol levels decrease, and their body mass index (BMI) fall (BMI is a measure of healthy or unhealthy weight). The researchers concluded, “Lipid profile variables are associated with the improvements in fatigue in progressive MS patients on a modified Paleolithic diet-based multimodal intervention.” Meanwhile, researchers from Johns Hopkins reported on people with MS who follow a Mediterranean-style diet high in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, seafood and polyunsaturated fats while eating little red meat and drinking in moderation. The researchers found that these individuals appear to have less severe depressive and cognitive symptoms than people with MS who follow a more-traditional American diet. The researchers had 34 people with MS complete dietary recall surveys and then assessed those people for depression, cognitive impairment, and other known symptoms of MS. The investigators noted that the results of this cross-sectional survey need to be validated by interventional studies that could better examine the nature of the relationship seen between diet and the MS symptoms studied. Other research being conducted at Johns Hopkins is examining how caloric restriction affects the metabolite profiles of people with MS. In a six-month study, 19 people with MS who were receiving monthly injections of Tysabri and who had a higher body mass index (BMI) of ≥25 kg/m (indicating that they are overweight) chose from one of two calorie-restriction strategies. The first strategy, chosen by 11 individuals, involved continuous calorie restriction (CCR), with participants consuming 78.6 percent of their daily caloric needs each day. The other approach, chosen by eight participants, entailed intermittent calorie restriction (ICR), with people consuming only 25 percent of their daily caloric needs two days per week, and consuming their full caloric needs on the other days of the week. Nine of the 11 people in the CCR group and six of the eight in the ICR group completed the study. Researchers are assessing blood samples collected at baseline, three months, and six months to see how the two calorie-restriction approaches influenced the production of metabolites. They note that the results of their analysis may provide new information on how dietary changes affect clinical outcomes in MS. People who are obese at the onset of MS are likely to experience greater functional impairment and higher risk of relapses in the first two years after onset than people with a healthy weight, according to a study of more than 1,500 people with MS. Drawing on data for 1,524 participants in the Accelerated Cure Project’s study, researchers found that obesity was associated with a 15-percent increase in the number of impaired functional domains and a 30-percent increase in early relapse activity. People who were obese also were on average 8-percent older than non-obese patients at the onset of MS. The investigators explain, “These results warrant further investigation into the impact of this proinflammatory phenotype [obesity] in MS.” Gut reaction? Exploring potential ties between MS and the digestive tract’s microbiome The mix of bacteria found in the digestive tracts of people with MS or clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) differ from the bacterial milieu found in the gastrointestinal systems of people who don’t have those conditions, two recent studies found. Those studies reflect a growing research focus on potential links between MS and the “gut microbiome,” the digestive tract’s bacterial environment, which is known to play a major role in immune-system function. In the first study, American researchers used sophisticated genetic testing to analyze 42 stool samples from individuals with relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) or secondary-progressive MS (SPMS), as well as stool samples from 28 healthy donors. Compared to the samples from healthy volunteers, stool samples from people with RRMS had a statistically significant greater abundance of several types of bacteria, including Ruminococcus torques, Ruminococcus obeum, and Lactospiraces. Escherichia coli and Oscillibacter also were found more often in people with RRMS than in healthy controls. Conversely, people who did not have MS had a higher concentration of other bacteria – including bacteroides fragilis and Roseburia – than did study participants with MS. The researchers noted that further, larger studies are needed to determine whether these findings can help pave the way for markers of disease activity or even therapies that target the composition of the gut microbiome. Meanwhile, Italian investigators found differences in both the stool and blood samples of individuals with clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) – referring to individuals experiencing a symptom of MS, but who have not yet been diagnosed – relative to healthy volunteers. They found that butyrate-producing bacteria were more abundant in the healthy volunteers compared to those with CIS. Additionally, the blood of people with CIS had an increased level of a type of white blood cell involved in immune function – T helper (Th) 17 – and fewer T regulatory (Treg) cells producing Interleukin 10, compared to healthy volunteers. The researchers said that both findings indicate that gut microbiome dysfunction or imbalance exists at the earliest stages of MS. Most people with MS who use medical marijuana (MM), find that the medication helps manage their pain, spasticity, and other symptoms. This is according to two recent small-scale studies. In the first study, 14 individuals at the University of Rochester MS Center (13 with MS and one with transverse myelitis) enrolled in the New York State Medical Marijuana Program and completed a survey on their experience with MM. Ninety-three percent of these individuals who were certified by the state program to use medical marijuana actually had tried the medication at least once, with 77 percent reporting ongoing use, and 62 percent saying they used MM at least daily. Seventy-seven percent of participants said MM was helpful in managing their symptoms, 70 percent said that their quality of life improved with marijuana use, and most respondents reported no side effects. Most subjects estimated that they spent between $100 and $300 per month on MM, and cost was cited as a factor in stopping use of MM or using the agent less frequently.   The second study is being conducted in Colorado, where cannabis use – for any purpose, not just medical reasons – is legal. The experience and beliefs of 25 patients from the Rocky Mountain Multiple Sclerosis Center at the University of Colorado were reported in preliminary findings from the research. Fifty-six percent of those participants believe cannabis has a beneficial effect on MS symptoms, while 8 percent think marijuana could entail harm in terms of MS symptoms. Seventy-six percent said they would consider cannabis use to ease their symptoms. Pain was the reason most frequently cited for using cannabis (by 57 percent of respondents), followed by spasticity/muscle tightness (29 percent), and muscle spasms (14 percent). Slowed thinking was the most commonly reported side effect, cited by 29 percent of participants. Forty-eight percent of survey respondents said that they were not currently using cannabis, with half of those people saying their non-usage was because they did not know enough about the medication. The authors of the second study noted, “As cannabis becomes more available under the laws of individual states, the results of this ongoing study may have important implications in the future landscape of MS symptom treatment and research exploring the efficacy of cannabis for MS symptom management.” For general information or to speak with a trained Client Services Specialist, please call MSAA’s Helpline at .

HSCT is a procedure that attempts to “reboot” the immune system, which is believed to launch attacks on the brain and spinal cord in people with MS. The trial is being performed at Northwestern University, Rush University Medical Center, University of Sao Paulo, Uppsala University and Sheffield Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust. This trial enrolled 110 people with active MS whose disease has not responded to disease-modifying medications. Half of the participants stayed on their medication and half underwent HSCT. So far, the team reports that one year after enrollment, no severe toxicities or deaths have occurred in those who received the transplants. One MS relapse occurred in the transplant group versus 39 relapses in those continuing their medication. The team also reported improvement in MS disability in those who had received the transplants. The trial is ongoing but no longer recruiting new participants. Further details will be available when the study is completed and results are published. Additional controlled trials, now in planning stages, will help determine who may respond best and which approach to HSCT is optimal for treating MS. Research to date suggests that those most likely to benefit are 50 years or younger, have had MS for 5 or fewer years, have active relapsing-remitting MS but are still walking, and whose disease is not adequately treated by available disease-modifying therapies. “These preliminary results from one of the first well-controlled clinical trials of HSCT for MS are exciting,” said Bruce Bebo, PhD, Executive Vice President of Research at the National MS Society. “This trial adds to a growing body of knowledge that is helping to define the precise risks and benefits of HSCT and who is more likely to benefit.”   Multiple sclerosis is an unpredictable, often disabling . range from numbness and tingling to blindness and paralysis, and there is currently no cure for MS. The progress, severity and specific symptoms of MS in any one person cannot yet be predicted, but advances in and are leading to better understanding and moving us closer to .

aa6439fb-43d6-41b3-89dd-3e37342b2613,"Published: April 03, 2010. Updated: April 03, 2010 Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a demyelinating disease, a non-contagious chronic autoimmune disorder of the central nervous system which can present with a variety of neurological symptoms occurring in attacks or slowly progressing over time. The prevalence of multiple sclerosis (MS) is approximately 350,000 cases in the United States and more than 2.5 million worldwide. There are at least 10,000 newly diagnosed cases of MS annually. In northern Europe, continental North America, and Australasia, about one of every 1000 citizens suffers from multiple sclerosis, whereas in the Arabian peninsula, Asia, and continental South America, the frequency is much lower. In Sub-Saharan Africa, MS is extremely rare. With important exceptions, there is a North-South gradient in the Northern hemisphere and a South-North gradient in the Southern hemisphere, with very low frequencies near the equator (between latitudes 40 degrees North and 40 degrees South. Climate, diet, geomagnetism, toxins, sunlight, genetic factors, and infectious diseases have been discussed as possible reasons for these regional differences. It has been postulated that an environmental factor during childhood might play an important role for the development of MS later in life. This was based on several studies in migrants demonstrating that if migration occurs before the age of 15, the migrant acquires his new region’s susceptibility to MS. If migration takes place after 15, the migrant keeps the susceptibility of his home country. MS occurs mainly in the Caucasian race. It is 20-fold lower in the Inuits of Canada than in other Canadians living in the same region. It is also rare in the Native American tribes of North America, the Australian Aborigine and the Maoris of New Zealand. These few examples point out that the genetic background plays an important role in the development of MS (see below). As observed in many autoimmune disorders, MS is more common in females than males; the mean sex ratio is about two females for every male. In children, who rarely develop MS, the sex ratio may reach three females for each male, whereas MS occurring in the fifth decade more commonly affects males. Onset of symptoms usually occurs between 20 to 40 years of age, rarely below 15 or above 60, although both is possible. MS is not strictly a hereditary disease. However, MS is a disease influenced by a variety of factors, one of which is the genetic background of an individual. There is no single gene known to be responsible for MS, though a few genes have been demonstrated to increase the risk of development. Although these genes are of scientific interest and continue to play a part in research, they are not enough to diagnose an individual with MS. Overall, an average one of every 25 siblings of an individual with MS will also be afflicted. Up to every second identical twin of a MS-affected person will develop MS, but only one of 20 fraternal twins. If one parent is affected by MS, only about 1 of 40 of his children will develop MS later in life. There also seems to be an association with specific HLA antigens (HLA-DR2). The ultimate cause of MS is unknown. It is hypothesised that a viral infection or other environmental factor in childhood might prime the immune system for an abnormal reaction later in life. On a molecular level, there might be a structural similarity between an unidentified infectious agent and components of the central nervous system, causing confusion in the immune system later in life (a process called “molecular mimicry”). However, so far there is no known “MS virus”. Certainly MS is not an infectious disease and not contagious. The importance of genetic factors has been discussed above. It is widely accepted that a special subset of white blood cells, called T cells, play a key role in the development of MS. Under normal circumstances, these lymphocytes can distinguish between self and non-self. In a person with MS, however, these cells recognize healthy parts of the central nervous system as foreign, and attack them as they would a virus. In MS, the part of the nervous system primarily attacked is myelin. Myelin is a fatty substance that covers the axons of nerve cells, and which is important for proper nerve conduction. Normally, there is a tight barrier between blood and brain, called the blood-brain barrier (BBB), built up of endothelial cells lining the blood vessel walls. Lymphocytes (blue) surrounding blood vessel (center) within MS lesionIn MS, the BBB breaks down; autoreactive T cells cross the BBB and trigger an inflammatory process, also mediated by other immune cells, such as cytokines and antibodies. Due to this abnormal behavior of the immune system, MS is considered to be an autoimmune disorder. The inflammatory process finally leads to a destruction of myelin called demyelination. Repair processes, called remyelination, also play an important role. This is one of the reasons why, especially in early phases of the disease, symptoms tend to decrease or disappear temporarily after days to months. Nevertheless, axonal damage and irreversible loss of neurons occur early during the course of the disease. However, due to its plasticity the brain can often compensate for some portion of the damage. MS symptoms develop as a result of multiple lesions in the brain and spinal cord, and can vary greatly between different individuals, depending on where the lesions occur. In general, relapses tend to occur more frequently during spring and summer than during autumn and winter. Infections like the common cold, influenza or unspecific diarrhea increase the risk for a relapse. In contrast, influenza vaccination is safe and does not trigger relapses as demonstrated in several recent studies. It can therefore be recommended for MS patients, especially for those at risk for influenza (e.g. healthcare workers). Tetanus vaccination is considered to be safe as well, although so far it has not been studied in that respect. In general, vaccinations with living, attenuated viruses increase the risk of relapses. Pregnancy can directly effect the susceptibility for relapse. The last three months of pregnancy offers a natural protection against relapses, whereas during the first few months after pregnancy, especially during the first six weeks, the risk for a relapse is increased 20-40%. According to current knowledge, pregnancy doesn’t seem to influence long term disability. MS does not increase the risk of bearing a handicapped child. Statistically, there is no good evidence for triggering of relapses through trauma or operations. In principle, surgical procedures require no special precautions if not dictated by existing disability. Participation in sports is possible, although extremes, such as marathon running, should probably be avoided. Emotional stress may cause a relapse, although study data has been inconsistent. Heat can transiently increase symptoms, in something known as Uhthoff’s phenomenon. This is why some patients avoid saunas or even hot showers. However, heat is not an established trigger of relapses. Extensive exposure to the sun should be avoided, since ultraviolet radiation is a strong stimulus for the immune system. Currently there are no clinically established laboratory investigations available to predict prognosis or therapeutic response, although promising approaches have been undertaken that need further confirmation, such as treatments based on the two antibodies anti-MOG and anti-MBP, and TRAIL, a TNF-Related Apoptosis Inducing Ligand. In most cases MS starts with an acute flare-up of symptoms within hours to days, called a relapse, exacerbation, bout, episode, or attack. Inflammation of an optic nerve (optic neuritis), causing painfulness of eye movement and visual deterioration frequently is the first symptom. However, not all patients with optic neuritis develop MS. Sensory disturbances such as numbness or tingling sensations are other frequent initial symptoms. In principle, MS can start with any of the symptoms mentioned in the section above. Especially in early phases of the disease, symptoms frequently decrease or resolve spontaneously within days to months. Therefore, this disease course is called relapsing remitting. New relapses can occur within weeks to many years and can include formerly experienced and/or new symptoms. However, MRI studies have shown that nerve damage can continue in relapsing remitting patients even if symptoms subside. It has long been known that “MS never sleeps”. This highlights the importance of preventive treatment if and when it is available. In many cases, the disease course changes after several years and symptoms start to deteriorate slowly with or without superimposed relapses. This course is called secondary chronic-progressive, or just secondary progressive. However, some patients stay in a relapsing remitting course for the rest of their lives. About 10% of all MS-affected individuals experience chronic progression without relapses from onset of symptoms. This course is called primary progressive and frequently comes along with weakness of the legs, gait and bladder disturbances. Degenerative processes and not inflammation are thought to play the most important role in this clinical disease course. Chronic progression from onset of symptoms with superimposed relapses is referred to as relapsing progressive. MS is suspected in a female, between 15 and 60 years old and usually of Northern European, Northern US or Canadian descent. Affected individuals may experience a wide variety of symptoms, such as vision loss, double vision, nystagmus, difficulty with speech, various kinds of tremor, clumsiness of the hands, unsteady gait, weakness, spasticity, numbness, and bladder (urgency, hesitancy), bowel, as well as sexual dysfunction. Various cognitive impairments are also common, such as difficulty performing multiple tasks at once, difficulty following detailed instructions, loss of short term memory, depression, and fatigue. Symptoms and signs may partially disappear after a few days or weeks. MS plaques appear hyperintense on T2 weighted studies. They usually are oval in shape, and appear in the periventricular region or corpus callosum. Detection of gadolinium enhancement can help differentiate active from chronic lesions and could help in establishing the temporal dissemination of the disease on follow up. A lumbar puncture, which is a procedure done to collect a sample of cerebrospinal fluid, is useful for providing evidence of chronic inflammation of the central nervous system, often indicated by oligoclonal banding. Nerve conduction studies of optic, sensory and motor nerves can provide further evidence for MS, as the process of demyelination results in reduced nerve conduction velocities. The diagnostic process is completed by several laboratory tests to exclude other diseases that can mimic MS, such as Sarcoidosis, Vasculitis, and Lyme disease). A definite diagnosis of MS requires evidence for dissemination of lesions within the central nervous system both in space and in time. This means that not only must there exist evidence of at least two distinct lesions, verifiable by clinical symptoms or by Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), there must also be evidence of an occurrence of new symptoms or lesions within a time interval of at least 30 days. Diagnosis of multiple sclerosis is made using the 2005 revised McDonald diagnostic criteria [1]: Generally speaking, three parameters are used to assess the diagnosis. An attack refers to an episode of neurological disturbance that has lasted for at least 24 hours. This is usually a subjective report by the patient and should be backed by objective findings. A clinical lesion refers to a neurological lesion detected by history and physical examination. A paraclinical lesion refers to a lesion that is detected by MRI, evoked response testing or urodynamic studies. In addition to the assessment of the three parameters discussed above, the criteria require that evidence for dissemination of lesions in both space (spatial dissemination) and time (temporal dissemination). 2005 revised McDonald Diagnostic Criteria for Multiple Sclerosis Two attacks (temporal dissemination) + two clinical lesions (spatial dissemination) Two attacks (temporal dissemination) + one clinical lesion + one paraclinical lesion (spatial dissemination). One attack + one clinical lesion + evidence of spatial dissemination by MRI, CSF + evidence of temporal dissemination by MRI or evidence of second clinical attack. One year of disease progression + two of the following There is no known definitive cure for multiple sclerosis. However, several drugs have proven to be effective in its treatment. Intensive research is underway to study a variety of promising new drugs. Treatment is aimed at maintaining a maximum quality of life. Physiotherapy plays an important role. There are three primary forms of medication used to treat the symptoms: During an exacerbation, corticosteroids (such as prednisone or methylprednisolone) used at high dosages (500 mg - 2 g per day intravenously for a course of 3 to 5 days) can accelerate regression of symptoms. Subsequent tapering with pills may be reasonable in certain cases. There is clear evidence that sole treatment with oral steroids at dosages of 100 mg per day or less and subsequent tapering is inferior to intravenous high dose treatment. In principle, steroid treatment during pregnancy is possible. There is no good evidence that corticosteroids influence longterm outcome. Long-term treatment can influence the course of the disease: Interferon-beta1a or beta1b (Avonex; Betaseron [in Europe Betaferon]; Rebif) has been shown to reduce the relapse rate by about 30%, decrease the number of new MRI lesions and slow progression of disability. Interferon-beta is a cytokine that under natural conditions is produced by the body during viral infections; as a drug it is extracted either from special mammalian cells or special bacteria. All preparations must be injected into either muscle or skin every second day to once per week, depending on the preparation. Attempts to develop pills containing Interferon-beta have not been successful so far. Some of the interferons have been proven to be effective not only in relapsing remitting MS, but also in secondary progressive MS, as long as superimposed relapses occur. Main side effects include flu-like symptoms which tend to decrease during ongoing therapy and which can be alleviated, for example, by paracetamol or ibuprofen. Another frequent side effect is inflammatory skin reactions at the injection site if Intereferon-beta is injected into the skin. Regular blood monitoring is required. Glatiramer acetate (Copaxone) has also been shown to reduce the relapse rate by about 30%, decrease the number of new MRI lesions and slow progression of disability. Concerning its therapeutic effect it is approximately comparable to Interferon-beta. Glatiramer acetate consists of synthetic peptides made of four different amino acids, which are basic modules of all proteins in the human body. Once per day must be injected into the skin. Attempts to develop pills containing glatiramer acetate have also been unsuccessful. Copaxone is effective in the treatment of relapsing remitting MS. So far, beneficial effects in secondary progressive MS have not been convincingly demonstrated. Main side effects include inflammatory skin reactions at the injection site, and a rare but transient and perturbing “post-injection” reaction manifested by flushing, chest tightness, heart palpitations, breathlessness, and anxiety. A post-injection reaction does not require discontinuation of therapy. In general, Copaxone is considered to cause fewer side effects than Interferon-beta. However, most MS patients injecting Interferon-beta also tolerate their therapy well. Regular blood monitoring is required. Azathioprine is an agent available as a pill approved for the treatment of relapsing remitting MS in some countries. However, its effectiveness has not been proven as stringently as for the interferons and glatiramer acetate, and an effect in secondary progressive MS has not been demonstrated. In general, it is well tolerated. After longtime therapy the risk of cancer increases slightly (after 10 years of therapy about fourfold). Regular blood monitoring is required. There is some evidence that immunoglobulins (antibodies) are effective in the treatment of relapsing remitting MS, a large clinical trial (PRIVIG) is presently continuing. Immunoglobulins have not been proven to be effective in secondary progressive MS. The currently most effective drug in the preventive treatment of MS is Mitoxantrone. It has been proven to be effective in relapsing remitting and in secondary progressive MS. In most cases it is administered every three months intravenously. Therapy with Mitoxantrone is generally well tolerated, however, since with ongoing therapy the risk for damage of the heart muscle increases, at an average Mitoxantrone can only be administered for 3 to 4 years. This is why Mitoxantrone is only used in cases of rapid disease progression. Mitoxantrone treatment requires monitoring of the heart function during therapy. Regular blood monitoring is required. With these precautions Mitoxantrone treatment is safe. A family of cholesterol-lowering drugs, the statins, have shown anti-inflammatory effects in animal models of MS. However, so far there has not been provided sufficient evidence that statins are beneficial in the treatment of human MS patients with normal cholesterol levels. Recently, scientists found women who took vitamin D supplements were 40% less likely to develop multiple sclerosis than women who did not take supplements. However, this study does not allow to conclude that vitamin D has a beneficial influence on ongoing MS. Furthermore it could not distinguish between a beneficial effect of vitamin D and multivitamin drugs including vitamin E and various B vitamins which may also exert a protective effect. Primary progressive MS is very difficult to treat. High dose corticosteroids every three months can show some effect. In principle, there is no efficient preventive treatment for primary progressive MS available. Symptomatic therapy as described in the next paragraph and physiotherapy play an important role. A variety of medications are used to treat symptoms without influencing the inflammatory nature of the disease (symptomatic treatment): Baclofen and tizanidine can be useful against spasticity. There is no convincing evidence that cannabinoids (marijuana) can improve spasticity. The anticonvulsant drugs Gabapentin and Carbamazepine and the antidepressant amitriptyline can improve pain and tingling sensations in certain cases. SSRIs be used for depression, as well as for fatigue. Fatigue can also be influenced by amantadine and modafinil. There is also treatment for bladder disturbances available which is effective in many cases. Examples are oxybutynin and trospium chloride. Treatment with sildenafil (Viagra) or similar substances can improve male erectile dysfunction in many cases. Additional treatment options include plasmapheresis (“washing the blood”, showing similarities to dialysis) for severe, non-steroidresponsive relapses. Because of improved treatment for complications such as lung and bladder infections, the life expectancy of those diagnosed with MS is only slightly reduced. The earlier in life disease onset occurs, the slower disability progresses. This is due to more frequent chronic progressive courses with faster accumulation of disability when onset occurs at a higher age. Disability after 5 years correlates well with disability after 15 years: 2/3 of MS patients with low disability after 5 years will not markedly deteriorate during the next ten years. Further MS cases in the family do not influence disease progression. 1 of 3 patients will still be able to work after 15-20 years. Visual loss as the initial symptom is a marker for a rather good prognosis; gait disturbance, weakness or numbness for a rather poor prognosis. Rapid regression of initial symptoms, age at onset below 35, only a single symptom at onset, rapid development of initial symptoms and short duration of the last relapse indicate a good prognosis. When the initial disease course is relapsing remitting, the statistical duration until a wheelchair is needed, is 20 years. This means that many MS patients will never need a wheelchair. If the disease course is primary progressive then a wheelchair at an average will be needed after 6 to 7 years. It has to be noted that most of this longterm data was acquired before the advent of modern immunomodulatory drugs about 10 years ago, which have been shown to delay disease progression over a period of several years.

UPDATE: Pr Ocrelizumab Granted “Breakthrough Therapy Designation” for Primary-Progressive MS by FDA. UPDATE: Priority Review Granted by Dec. 28, 2016 UPDATE: FDA has granted Priority Review Designation, with a decision target of December 28, 2016.  Originally released February 17, 2016 Genentech, a member of the Roche Group, has announced that the experimental therapy ocrelizumab has been granted “Breakthrough Therapy designation” by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of people with primary-progressive MS. This designation means that once Genentech files for approval of ocrelizumab to treat primary-progressive MS, the review process can be expedited. According to a February 16 press release, Genentech plans to pursue marketing approval for both primary-progressive MS and relapsing multiple sclerosis.   “We are encouraged by this news and look forward to following the FDA’s actions regarding ocrelizumab,” says Timothy Coetzee, PhD, Chief Advocacy, Services and Research Officer at the National MS Society. “People with progressive MS need solutions and we are hopeful that this is the first of many treatments that will be developed for this form of MS.”   Breakthrough Therapy designation can expedite the development and review of therapies intended to treat a serious condition when clinical evidence indicates that the treatment may demonstrate substantial improvement over available therapy. The designation was granted to ocrelizumab based on phase III trial results presented at the European Committee for Treatment and Research in MS in 2015. Compared to placebo, ocrelizumab significantly reduced the risk of progression of clinical disability by 24% in 732 people with primary-progressive MS. about these results.   Ocrelizumab is a monoclonal antibody that binds to a molecule (CD20) on the surface of immune cells called B cells, and depletes them from circulation. B cells have several functions including making antibodies, and they may play a role in immune-system mediated damage to brain and spinal cord tissues in MS. Ocrelizumab is administered by intravenous infusion every 6 months. There currently are no FDA-approved disease-modifying therapies to treat , which is characterized by steady worsening of neurologic functioning, without any distinct relapses or attacks, or periods of remission.   Frequently Asked Questions Related to “Breakthrough Therapy” Designation of Ocrelizumab to Treat Primary-Progressive MS   The Food and Drug Administration has developed four approaches to making treatments available as rapidly as possible when treatments are the first available treatment or if the therapy has advantages over existing treatments. about these on the FDA website. designation can expedite the development and review of therapies intended to treat a serious condition when clinical evidence indicates that the treatment may demonstrate substantial improvement over available therapy. This designation makes the treatment eligible for all designations, intensive guidance on an efficient drug development program, and organizational commitment involving senior managers. It does make the treatment automatically eligible for priority review, which means FDA’s goal is to take action on an application within 6 months (compared to 10 months under standard review).   Q: Does this mean that ocrelizumab is approved to treat primary-progressive MS? No, this means that once Genentech files with the FDA for approval of ocrelizumab to treat primary-progressive MS, the review process can be expedited. According to a February 16 press release, Genentech plans to pursue marketing approval for both primary-progressive MS and relapsing multiple sclerosis, and will submit data from three phase III studies to the FDA in the first half of 2016.   Q: Will ocrelizumab be approved to treat secondary-progressive MS? At this point, Genentech plans to pursue marketing approval for both primary-progressive MS and relapsing multiple sclerosis. Relapsing MS includes people with secondary-progressive MS who are experiencing relapses. Ocrelizumab reduced relapse rates by 46% to 47% after two years compared to the established MS treatment, Rebif (interferon beta-1a, EMD Serono) in two phase III studies in people with relapsing MS. about these results. Ocrelizumab has not been studied so far in people with secondary-progressive MS who are not experiencing relapses. Breakthrough designation only applies to primary-progressive MS.   It is not possible to say if or when ocrelizumab may become available.  The company has stated plans for applying for regulatory approval of ocrelizumab in the first half of 2016.  Even with an expedited review, the timeline for successful marketing approval depends on many variables, such as whether the application is accepted by the FDA or whether the agency requests additional information before the application is deemed complete.  Then the FDA needs time to evaluate the results and make a decision about whether the therapy can be marketed.   Q: What role, if any, did the National MS Society play in the development of ocrelizumab? The Society did not play a specific role in the development of ocrelizumab. However, the Society has funded early studies that increased understanding of the role of B cells in the immune attack of MS, as well as an early clinical trial of rituximab, a therapy similar to ocrelizumab. The Society continues to fund researchers exploring the importance of B cells, in relapsing and progressive MS. The Society also provides leadership to the International Progressive MS Alliance, which is testing rituximab in progressive MS.   FAQs about ocrelizumab    Rebif is a trademark of EMD Serono.

It is important to have a positive outlook on living a healthy life in order to make the most of physical, emotional, social and spiritual aspects of health. Although there is no cure for MS at present, there is hope that people can find their own way to live with the disease and to try to live in a healthy way. Deciding to adhere to a healthy lifestyle or to maintain healthy habits is a choice for each person. This concept of choice is especially relevant for people with MS who often feel they have little control over the disease. Diet, exercise, stress management, travel, leisure activities and health-promotion activities are all aspects of living well that are, to a certain extent, under the control of the individual. Although there are no particular diets that have been shown to affect the disease process in MS, food fuels the body and provides energy. A well-balanced diet, low in fat and high in fibre, can help stabilise weight and improve bowel health. Dietary supplements such as multi-vitamins with minerals, calcium, and vitamin D should not replace proper food intake, but can be useful. People with MS should be encouraged to check with their doctor or nurse before taking vitamins, minerals or herbal supplements to ensure safety and compatibility with the traditional medications already prescribed. Regular exercise for people with MS is important for several reasons. It improves cardiovascular health, helps improve strength and endurance, and is a factor in stabilising mood. Exercise can help relieve MS-related fatigue and manage spasticity. Aquatics therapy (also known as hydrotherapy) can be very helpful in MS because it provides an aerobic workout while keeping the body temperature down. Other helpful exercise regimens include stretching, and low impact aerobic workouts, combined with strength training using light weights. People with MS should discuss exercising with their doctor or nurse, and may need a consultation with a physiotherapist before starting an exercise programme. Coping with stress can be difficult. Stress makes most people feel bad, but those with MS may experience stress in ways that make their symptoms feel worse. Stress may raise body temperature. People with MS tend to feel more fatigued, or have temporary worsening of other symptoms, when their body temperature is elevated. Relieving stress can be as easy as taking a few deep breaths, visualising a pleasant memory, undertaking relaxation techniques or enjoying a favourite pastime or hobby. Some people with MS take very good care of their MS, but forget about the other aspects of their health that need attention. Regular examinations by a primary care doctor may include a cardiogram, and monitoring of blood glucose, triglycerides, and cholesterol levels. Women should have regular cervical smear tests, breast examinations and bone density studies. Download the Healthy living issue of (you will need to view these): 10/2011, Reykjavik, Iceland.

841b64ed-1e89-4db0-a811-6b055672dce5,"MS, the coronavirus and vaccines – updated global advice MS, the coronavirus and vaccines – updated global advice There is no cure for MS, but people can find their own way to live with the disease and to try to live in a healthy way MS is a life-long neurological illness that can be variable and create uncertainty in the day-to-day lives of those who have the disease. It is important to have a positive outlook on living a healthy life in order to make the most of physical, emotional, social and spiritual aspects of health. Although there is no cure for MS at present, there is hope that people can find their own way to live with the disease and to try to live in a healthy way. Deciding to adhere to a healthy lifestyle or to maintain healthy habits is a choice for each person. This concept of choice is especially relevant for people with MS who often feel they have little control over the disease. Diet, exercise, stress management, travel, leisure activities and health-promotion activities are all aspects of living well that are, to a certain extent, under the control of the individual. Although there are no particular diets that have been shown to affect the disease process in MS, food fuels the body and provides energy. A well-balanced diet, low in fat and high in fibre, can help stabilise weight and improve bowel health. Dietary supplements such as multi-vitamins with minerals, calcium, and vitamin D should not replace proper food intake, but can be useful. People with MS should be encouraged to check with their doctor or nurse before taking vitamins, minerals or herbal supplements to ensure safety and compatibility with the traditional medications already prescribed. Regular exercise for people with MS is important for several reasons. It improves cardiovascular health, helps improve strength and endurance, and is a factor in stabilising mood. Exercise can help relieve MS-related fatigue and manage spasticity. Aquatics therapy (also known as hydrotherapy) can be very helpful in MS because it provides an aerobic workout while keeping the body temperature down. Other helpful exercise regimens include stretching, and low impact aerobic workouts, combined with strength training using light weights. People with MS should discuss exercising with their doctor or nurse, and may need a consultation with a physiotherapist before starting an exercise programme. Coping with stress can be difficult. Stress makes most people feel bad, but those with MS may experience stress in ways that make their symptoms feel worse. Stress may raise body temperature. People with MS tend to feel more fatigued, or have temporary worsening of other symptoms, when their body temperature is elevated. Relieving stress can be as easy as taking a few deep breaths, visualising a pleasant memory, undertaking relaxation techniques or enjoying a favourite pastime or hobby. Some people with MS take very good care of their MS, but forget about the other aspects of their health that need attention. Regular examinations by a primary care doctor may include a cardiogram, and monitoring of blood glucose, triglycerides, and cholesterol levels. Women should have regular cervical smear tests, breast examinations and bone density studies. Download the Healthy living issue of (you will need to view these): 10/2011, Reykjavik, Iceland. Lonni Björg Sigurbjörnsdóttir could be the poster girl for the unpredictable nature of MS. She was diagnosed in 2000, at the age of 19. A severe relapse in 2001 put her in a wheelchair for two years. Eventually, she opted for an extreme form of medication that involved bi-weekly hospitalisation for a period of one year. Lonni stopped all therapies in 2004, and has had no subsequent attacks.

d26ad477-34af-4f0f-9eb7-ae8438347521,"MS, the coronavirus and vaccines – updated global advice MS, the coronavirus and vaccines – updated global advice Which of these MS research areas would you like to hear more about? Three young researchers supported by MSIF are available to answer your questions. You can read a summary of their areas of expertise below, and vote for the area that interests you the most, using the poll on the right side of this page. Each of the three researchers was awarded one of MSIF’s McDonald Fellowships in 2014 or 2015. This award enables talented young MS researchers from emerging countries to work with leading researchers in MS. Arman Eshaghi “Grouping patients into different MS subtypes (e.g. relapsing-remitting or progressive) is important when selecting appropriate treatments. Currently the decision is based on clinical evaluation, which is subjective and unreliable. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), on the other hand, provides an objective assessment of brain, but it is not clear whether we can use MRI to predict progression or group patients into subtypes. My research, which is a collaboration between the Institute of Neurology and UCL Department of Computer Science, aims to study MRI in detail to describe MS progression. I will specifically look at brain tissue changes over time to develop an objective way to describe the stage of a person’s MS (known as staging system). I will combine advanced image analysis and statistical models to explore brain tissue loss in each region to predict people who are at higher risk of disability later in their disease course. It will provide a unique way to look into each MS subtype based on a set of characteristics shown on MRI. By combining information from imaging, other biomarkers (such as spinal fluids) and clinical information we could identify people who are at risk of higher disability earlier and assign the correct treatment. I’m from Iran, currently based in UCL Institute of Neurology in London and working under the supervision of Prof Olga Ciccarelli, Prof Alan Thompson, and Prof Daniel Alexander.” Measuring cortex thickness changes in people with clinically isolated syndrome Rumaiza Hussein Alyafeai “For a long time, it was believed that the brain cortex (the outer layer of nerve tissue) is not affected in MS. However, recent research suggests that this is not the case. People with MS often report symptoms such as cognitive issues, which are related to damage to the cortex. As a result, we decided to study the cortex of people with MS by measuring changes in its thickness. We are focusing on people in the very early stages of MS – those with CIS (clinically isolated syndrome), where only a single attack has occurred. We are investigating whether people are affected from the beginning of their disease by looking for any thinning of their brain cortex. We will also look at these changes in different brain regions, to see if this is a period of disease which is free of any changes. We also aim to find a link between thinning of the brain cortex and symptoms that people with MS report. This research is important to people with MS as well as to MS physicians, as it could provide a new way to understand early changes in the brain. Maybe in the future it could be used to predict if early intervention could prevent, stop or even cure the disease process. I’m from Yemen, currently based at the Centre d’Esclerosi Mútiple de Catalunya (Cemcat) in Barcelona and working under the supervision of Prof Xavier Montalban.” Cristina Marcoci “Neuroprotection (preventing damage to nerve cells) is an urgent need in MS, to stop inflammatory lesions from causing deterioration and loss of function of nerve cells (degeneration). The lesions found in optic neuritis (an inflammation of the optic nerve causing blurred vision and pain that is sometimes associated with attacks in MS) are similar or identical to MS lesions, but are directly visible through the pupil. This offers an opportunity to study what might be happening in the brain through a more accessible system. We plan to study two models of experimental optic neuritis (as substitutes of the MS lesion) to test therapies that aim to deal with the newly-discovered phenomenon of oxygen shortage in lesions that causes an energy deficit and degeneration. Our study will examine whether preventing oxygen loss reduces degeneration. We will use a range of methods to examine energy production, oxygen levels, visual function and protection of the retina. If successful, this could result in a therapy that protects the brain from damage which is very important for people with MS. I’m from Moldova, preparing to start working at the UCL Institute of Neurology in London, under the supervision of Prof Kenneth Smith.” Which of these MS research areas would you like to hear more about?

The study, published in the , focused on two large groups of women involved in the Nurses’ Health Study, involving hundreds of thousands of female nurses followed over time. The nurses were asked to report on general stress at home and at work, as well as recall physical and sexual abuse in childhood and as teenagers. The investigators, led by Trond Riise, PhD (University of Bergen, Norway), concluded that their results do not support a major role of stress in the development of MS, but that more research is needed to definitely exclude stress as a potential risk factor for developing MS. Some studies have suggested that stress may be linked to MS exacerbations, or attacks, but there is still no conclusive evidence that links the two . There have been a few previous studies linking stressful events with the onset of MS, but there has not been definite evidence that stress could cause MS. This is the question posed in this study. With funding from the National Institutes of Health, Dr. Riise and collaborators focused on two Nurses’ Health Study groups, involving female nurses in the U.S. followed over time: the NHS1 included 121,700 nurses between the ages of 30-55 who have been followed from 1976. NHS2 included 116,671 nurses between the ages of 25-42 who have been followed from 1989. The participants had responded to past questionnaires about their history of stressful events. Later, a small proportion of the nurses developed MS, and the investigators were able to compare the answers about stressors between those who developed MS and those who did not. The investigators found that those who later developed MS did not respond significantly different than those who did not develop MS in terms of their histories of general levels of stress or physical or sexual abuse. They accounted for other variables, such as smoking, that have been linked to increasing the risk of developing MS. The authors conclude that this study does not support a major role for stress in the development of MS, but suggest that further research is needed to definitely exclude stress as a risk factor for MS.

11eaa6e8-2207-4fd8-9841-0ef78c4930c8,"Cover Story: Promoting Mental and Emotional Wellness During Difficult Times Cover Story: Promoting Mental and Emotional Wellness During Difficult Times Who could imagine that the lives of so many in our nation could be uprooted so dramatically and for so long, from a pandemic we had never even heard of less than a year ago. And as discussed in our “Up Front” column, we are also facing some significant and heartbreaking challenges, including racial injustice, acts of violence, severe weather, and raging wildfires. “Feeling anxious? You are not alone. This is a common reaction to an uncommonly stressful time.” This is according to Adam Kaplin, MD, PhD, chief psychiatric consultant to the Johns Hopkins Multiple Sclerosis and Transverse Myelitis Centers, and clinician-researcher in the departments of psychiatry and neurology at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore, Maryland. The Effects of the Pandemic on Individuals with MS Dr. Adam Kaplin’s ABC’s for Good Mental and Emotional Health (from Winter/Spring 2020 issue) Dr. Kaplin continues, “Compared to the same time last year, we are seeing a 400-percent increase in depression and anxiety among Americans. We are also seeing significant increases in trauma and stressor-related disorder, self-medicating through the use of alcohol or drugs, plus suicidal ideation and attempts.” Readers should note that depression and anxiety are not limited to just those with multiple sclerosis or other chronic illnesses; this increase in depression, anxiety, and other emotional issues applies to virtually all populations living in our country, and similar mental health problems are being observed around the world. In this article, we will examine the symptoms of depression and anxiety, as well as other effects of the pandemic, more closely. We will explain which populations are at the greatest risk and how these types of symptoms can affect not only overall health, but notably, the immune system. We will also provide strategies and resources aimed at improving overall mood and wellbeing, and through studies on something called “Purpose in Life,” explain how the mind-body connection can dramatically affect one’s emotional, mental, and physical health. Dr. Kaplin has a great interest in “Purpose in Life,” or “PIL,” and has published research findings that support its effectiveness for individuals with chronic illness, including MS and Alzheimer’s disease. In addition to the positive effects on one’s mental and emotional health, PIL has also been shown to significantly support the central nervous system, cardiovascular health, and even the immune system – reducing inflammation and calming overactive immune-system activity. More information is provided on this exciting research appearing later in this cover story. MSAA’s featured the cover story, “Coping with the Emotional, Physical, and Mental Effects of a Pandemic.” However, due to the start of the pandemic, this particular issue of our magazine was not printed. It was only available on our website in digital formats. “Coping with the Emotional, Physical, and Mental Effects of a Pandemic” gave important details on COVID-19 and pandemics, how to limit exposure, common reactions to (and strategies to cope with) disease outbreaks and social isolation, additional wellness information, children’s responses to the pandemic, plus a collection of helpful resources and articles. If you have not seen this issue and would like to read the entire cover story or any of the other sections, please visit . Additionally, MSAA provides a wealth of information on symptoms and symptom management on our website at . Much of the information on depression and anxiety from our website has been summarized for this article. This information was originally written by Miriam Franco, PsyD MSCS, who has been an esteemed member of MSAA’s for many years. Dr. Franco is a psychotherapist and psychoanalyst who specializes in helping individuals cope with chronic illness and has a private practice in the Philadelphia area. Dr. Franco’s observations on the pandemic and its effects on the MS community are provided in a sidebar on page 19. Our hope is to accomplish three objectives with this article. Our first objective is to explain the different types and symptoms of both depression and anxiety, so individuals may recognize if they or a loved one may be suffering from a form of one or both disorders. Our second objective is to provide emergency contacts, resources, and strategies for mental and emotional wellness. And finally, we hope that by raising awareness, those experiencing such symptoms will consult with their family doctor, neurologist, or mental-health professional for both a diagnosis and a treatment plan – one which may involve talk therapy, medication, and/or changes in lifestyle. See Also: The Effects of the Pandemic on Individuals with MS Researchers believe that the high rate of major depressive disorder, dysthymia (a chronic type of depression), and bipolar disorder with MS, is a result of the disease process or the etiology of the disease itself. In other words, the damage to the nerves within certain areas of the brain is believed to increase the chance of greater depressive reactions. Depressive reactions are not to be confused with sadness or fatigue. Sadness is a feeling in response to disappointments and losses; it is experienced directly in relation to one of these triggers. Experiencing sadness helps us to mourn and move through an experience of pain or loss. It typically does not last long, and once expressed, is relieved. Fatigue, the most common symptom of MS, occurs in response to having the disease and is greater at certain times of the day. It may not be eliminated, but can be reduced by periods of rest and appropriate planning and pacing of your activities. A depressive mood typically lasts longer and is not associated with one trigger alone. Moods, by definition, have strong intensity and long duration. Shifting or distracting yourself from your mood is difficult. With this most-common type of depression, you can have one major episode or experience recurring episodes over time. To be considered to have major depressive disorder, you typically experience a depressed mood most of the day, nearly every day, and you would also have some or all of the following symptoms: have a loss of pleasure in most if not all activities that usually give you pleasure experience a significant change in weight (loss or gain) either have difficulty falling asleep or sleeping too much likely have feelings of worthlessness, low self-esteem, or major guilt have recurrent thoughts of harming yourself, possibly have thoughts of suicide have aches and pains that physicians can’t explain have mood lability, which means you can cry or become angry easily over things that typically would not draw that kind of reaction from you This type of depression is very similar to major depression, except that the symptoms may not be as severe and you may not experience as many of them. The key feature to dysthymia is that it is felt to be a chronic mood, something you have had for at least two years. This form of depression is not episodic; it’s not characterized by a sudden episode or outburst. Rather, it is more like a slow malaise that starts to be associated with your normal mood. Dysthymia is typically experienced with long-standing insomnia, poor appetite or overeating, poor concentration, and poor self-esteem. This type of disorder is highly genetic in that it often runs in families and is sometimes referred to as manic depressive disorder. You can have a mild or more severe form. If you have a sibling, parent, or close relative who has been diagnosed with this disorder, and you are experiencing any signs of depression, it is a good idea to have this checked by a mental-health professional. With this disorder, episodes of low mood and depression are interspersed with periods of euphoria or heightened activity and agitation. You must have at least a single episode of mania or heightened activity, agitation, and euphoria, to warrant this diagnosis. In all types of depression, activities of daily living can feel overwhelming and there is a tendency to believe you will never change. Several symptoms of depression are common ones of MS, such as fatigue, trouble sleeping, cognitive difficulties – especially being unable to focus and concentrate – and feeling slowed down. These similarities can, however, be distinguished by a mental-health specialist who has experience with MS, such as a social worker, psychologist, or psychiatrist, who is specialized or certified in this area. Women are not only more likely to have MS, but they are also more likely to experience depression. It is not known if this is attributable to hormonal factors and fluctuations caused by pregnancy, menopause, and/or menstrual changes. Additionally, women tend to have multiple care-related responsibilities, are under major stress, and are constantly multi-tasking. While women may be more inclined to seek help, men are more likely to self-medicate with drugs and alcohol, as well as take prescribed antidepressants. Often, depression may present itself first with some men as increased irritability. And those who have been vulnerable to depression prior to having MS will likely have a higher risk for depression during the course of MS. Other risk factors include a lack of or low social support and isolation, substance dependency and abuse, or presence of another medical condition. Specific Effects of Depression on Quality of Life (QOL) In one study of people with MS who experienced thoughts of suicide, one-third had not received any psychological help, and two-thirds had not received any anti-depressant medication. This may be largely due to the fact that such problems are not always communicated to the doctor. Given the wide range of physical symptoms experienced by individuals with MS, physicians tend to spend most of the limited appointment time on the physical course of the disease. Often the patient with MS is the one to bring up the issue of emotional disturbances or mood in order to have them addressed. People with MS, their care partners, and their physicians, all need to be aware of these symptoms that can arise with MS, and be sure to inquire about any emotional issues that could be present. Untreated high rates of depression and anxiety increase suicide risk in MS. Also, severe depression, abuse of alcohol, and social isolation (living alone) can increase the risk of suicide as well. Anyone experiencing these types of thoughts, or care partners who might suspect this of their loved one with MS, should immediately contact their physician, therapist, or the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline. Trained counselors are available 24 hours per day, seven days per week, at . For family members, understanding the physical symptoms of MS is often easier than understanding the emotional ones. When depressed, becoming passive, exhibiting a negative mood, and experiencing low motivation are common; some may even withdraw from others. This may irritate family members, causing them to be critical or expecting you to do one thing that will snap you out of your mood. They may feel at a loss encountering your helpless mood. If you become withdrawn, family members may withdraw too, as they may not fully understand what is needed. A loss of sexual interest or libido is also common and this too can have a negative impact on couples. Depression is not overcome by the power of positive thinking. Family members should avoid giving advice. Instead, a referral to a skilled mental-health professional can be of great benefit, ideally someone who specializes in MS, can work with both the individual and/or family, and can prescribe a specific antidepressant medication if needed. Depression is treatable and needs the time and attention it deserves, like any other condition. Expecting someone to “just get over it” or “just put up with it” won’t help. Many become depressed following the diagnosis of MS because time is needed to adjust to what the diagnosis means, as well as any potential losses in one’s quality of life that may be anticipated. Individuals who do not cope well, whose coping skills are highly emotionally centered and involve reacting by escape or avoidance, may experience a worsening of their depression. It is natural to be upset and struggle with the uncertainty and loss that surrounds the course of living with MS, yet constructive problem-solving and psychological counseling can be extremely beneficial. Getting help with focusing on what you can control, and learning to respond – not just react – to your experience, will help over time. Participating in psychological therapy and taking a medication for depression appear to be the most effective means of treating depression. Treating depression with a medication or a drug alone does not address the underlying causes. This is because communicating and sharing your experiences with others and with a mental-health professional has been shown to improve one’s ability to cope and to continue to find meaning in one’s life. Consistent exercise has also been shown to improve depression. Many types of psychotherapies may be effective in treating depressive disorders. These include cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), psychotherapy, problem-focused supportive-group therapy, and telephone-administered CBT for individuals with MS who experience significant levels of depression. For treatment with medications, consulting a psychiatrist, if possible, may be of greater benefit. Many managed-care and insurance plans have psychiatrists available for medication management. Your therapist can also aid you in this referral process. Consulting a psychiatrist is important because general practitioners (GPs) or family physicians may not be as familiar with the range of antidepressant medications available, versus someone who specializes in this field. Steroid use is known to induce depressive reactions or exacerbate bipolar reactions in individuals. Additional medications, such as those used to treat urinary incontinence or spasticity, can also affect mood. If you are taking one or more of these medications, check with your physician to see if they in any way could be lowering your mood. Anxiety in MS: Frequently Overlooked and Undetected Anxiety is perhaps the most taxing and under-treated psychological effect of living with MS. It does not appear to result from the physical disease process of MS, but rather stems from the realities of living with MS. Individuals living with MS know that it’s the unpredictability, and therefore the difficulty, in planning and preparing for the effects of MS on your life, that drives one’s anxiety. Anxiety disorders are estimated to affect 43 percent of those with MS, and are also more common among women. The scientific literature suggests that anxiety levels are higher at the onset of the disease and when it co-exists with moderate to severe depression. Tragically, the combination of untreated, sustained depression along with anxiety can produce higher rates of suicide among people with MS. Limited social support and higher rates of alcohol consumption also elevate anxiety disorders in MS. Anxiety disorders are frequently overlooked and often undetected. As a result, they can worsen one’s quality of life and greatly reduce treatment adherence. Research suggests that approximately half of those with MS who have a diagnosable anxiety disorder are not receiving an anti-anxiety medication and/or psychotherapy. This is important to consider, because if an anxiety disorder co-exists with a depressive disorder, adequate treatment may require higher doses of an antidepressant medication for a longer period of time. This is something that many healthcare professionals may not be implementing if they are not well-versed in this area of treatment. The spectrum of anxiety disorders includes panic attacks, phobias, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). GAD is more prevalent in MS, followed by panic disorder and OCD. Those at higher risk are women, particularly those with a prior history of depression, excess drinking, and the presence of high social stressors. To be considered to have an anxiety disorder, a patient would present physiological and/or psychological symptoms. Feelings of inadequacy, feeling criticized, or easily embarrassed Rigidity, which is to be inflexible and less willing to make changes Repeating certain behaviors or ruminative thoughts (pondering something repeatedly) Lowering anxiety requires many steps that include learning stress-reduction techniques. These techniques include: Interrupting and changing both “all or nothing” types of thinking, as well as catastrophic thinking, where an individual dwells on the worst possible outcomes Breaking down fearful concerns into manageable, “present-oriented” solutions, aimed at resolving the issues at hand Allowing and normalizing feelings of loss of control, while allowing the effect of any losses to be grieved and expressed Learning to control your reactions and quiet yourself can allow you to feel anxiety when needed to problem-solve, but not to become so overwhelmed by it. Increasing the areas of where you can have control and prioritizing activities can also help. Developing a more spiritual, entrusting attitude has also been found to be helpful to many. Psychotherapy, either psychodynamic or cognitive/behavioral, includes stress-reduction techniques such as guided imagery, biofeedback (a technique that teaches individuals how to control their body’s responses), and meditation. These can be very helpful to reduce anxiety. Medication management is also available. Dr. Kaplin notes, “Surprisingly, during this pandemic, people under 25 are at the greatest risk for worsening anxiety. Many are stuck living with older family members versus being out on their own, possibly attending college or starting their careers, and enjoying their independence. “Another high-risk group are the healthcare professionals who work at the hospitals. They care for patients with COVID-19 every day – some of whom never recover – and often don’t seek help for themselves if and when they need it.” Dr. Kaplin adds that mindfulness can be helpful to reduce symptoms of depression and anxiety. He explains, “Mindfulness gives people the opportunity to take a break, to ‘check out’ from the stressors, and then ‘check in’ with themselves. It’s particularly useful when life is too busy.” For more information on mindfulness, please see MSAA’s archived webinar, “Keeping it Simple: Everyday Mindfulness for People Living with MS.” See Also: Dr. Adam Kaplin’s ABC’s for Good Mental and Emotional Health Purpose in Life and its Impact on Mental and Physical Health “New Movement in Neuroscience: A Purpose-Driven Life,” published in the May-June 2015 issue of , is an informative and thought-provoking article co-authored by Adam Kaplin, MD, PhD and Laura Anzaldi. In this writing, the concept of “Purpose in Life” is explored and study data are provided to support its many proposed health benefits. The Editor’s Note from this article explains, “Purpose in Life (PIL) is a research area that focuses on the interactions between mind and body and the powerful ways in which emotional, mental, social, and spiritual factors can directly affect health. It links the belief that your life has meaning and purpose to a robust and persistently improved physiological health outcome.” PIL was first introduced to psychiatry in the 1940s by the Jewish physician, Viktor Frankl, who was trained in both psychiatry and neurology. He was practicing in Austria during World War II, and survived three years in different concentration camps, including Auschwitz. According to Frankl, “Man’s main concern is not to gain pleasure or to avoid pain but rather to see a meaning in his life. That is why man is even ready to suffer, on the condition, to be sure, that his suffering has meaning.” In 1964, researchers James Crumbaugh and Leonard Maholick created a twenty-question scale to measure PIL. This was in response to those who challenged the ability to assess PIL and the validity of those studies. According to Kaplin and Anzaldi’s article, “Other researchers have sought to characterize the nuances of PIL. The general consensus is that PIL includes dimensions such as (1) believing that life has meaning or purpose, (2) upholding a personal value system, and (3) having the motivation and ability to achieve future goals and overcome future challenges.” What are the Potential Health Benefits Related to Purpose in Life? In terms of cognitive decline and dementia – which encompasses difficulties with memory, cognition, and communication – Purpose in Life (PIL) appears to have significant effects in delaying and possibly preventing these types of disorders. According to work done by Patricia Boyle and colleagues at the Rush Alzheimer’s Disease Center, PIL may be neuroprotective, helping to protect the nerves of the brain. Looking at more than 900 seniors who were at risk for dementia and following them for seven years, the investigators found that those with high PIL were 50% less likely to develop Alzheimer’s disease and 30% less likely to experience mild cognitive impairment. Even those without Alzheimer’s disease showed a slowing of age-related cognitive decline. In terms of cardiovascular benefits, higher levels of PIL have been shown to reduce the risk of stroke and heart attacks. In a study that followed a group of men for 13 years, investigators found a 72% lower rate of death from stroke, a 44% lower rate of death from cardiovascular disease, and a 48% lower rate of death from any cause, among those with a strong sense of purpose. With regard to inflammation, Kaplin and Anzaldi explain how inflammation is a factor in the development and worsening of central nervous system (CNS) disorders, which include MS, as well as neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases. Inflammation in certain areas of the brain can also cause cognitive impairment and depression. While the body’s immune system produces inflammation to fight infection and heal injuries, when it becomes overly active, it can damage tissues and cause disease. Psychosocial stress can also contribute to inappropriate immune system activity. PIL may have a calming effect on immune system activity. For example, blood tests show lower levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-6 (IL-6) for individuals with higher PIL scores. Interestingly, researchers have found that those who sought to experience happiness for immediate gratification – without a long-term purpose – actually had higher amounts of pro-inflammatory genes compared with those who were striving for a purpose. Given these findings, the authors conclude, “This correlation implies that seeking purpose helps avoid a pro-inflammatory state, a positive step in fighting neurological diseases.” In Crumbaugh and Maholick’s original paper, they noted that the patients they studied who were significantly depressed exhibited a “clearly observable loss of life purpose and meaning,” than those who were not depressed. However, they also commented, “It may be difficult to untangle whether depression decreases PIL or low PIL leads to depression.” Additionally, Kaplin and Anzaldi “drew some parallels between meaningfulness and peaceful feelings that religion can bring.” They stated, “Many people experiencing a tragedy or crisis turn to faith to find comfort, support, and answers. It is possible to endure almost anything as long as we can identify a greater purpose, and for some, religious doctrines and beliefs provide reasons and reassurances for suffering.” However, they also note that “how clearly and confidently an individual holds to their self-concepts of the world and their place in it” determines the degree of PIL, indicating to the authors that while having some similarities, “PIL and religion are separate and independent phenomena.” In summary, Kaplin and Anzaldi state, “Identifying a purpose to life can have profound implications in overall life satisfaction and health, as it motivates and drives us even in the face of difficulties and hardships. PIL appears to be biologically wired into our thinking and necessary for optimal health.” English: Español: TTY: Dial then Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) Disaster Distress Helpline: This helpline provides free and immediate counseling to anyone in need of help coping mentally or emotionally with the pandemic or any current crisis or disaster.

f1117967-a30f-4c45-9b4c-c2fa17efbae8,"Medically reviewed by — Managing multiple sclerosis often involves medications, therapies, and other treatments. Different treatments can be covered under different parts of Medicare. Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic neurological condition that affects nearly adults in the United States. If you or a loved one has MS and are eligible for Medicare, many of your costs will be covered. Medicare provides coverage for medications, physical and occupational therapy, hospital stays, doctors’ visits, surgeries you might need, and medical equipment. Your costs and coverage will depend on the type of Medicare plan you’re enrolled in and what services are medically necessary for your situation. As you may know, Medicare has multiple parts (A, B, C, and D) that provide different aspects of medical coverage. But it can be confusing to try and figure out what each part covers — especially if you’re treating a chronic condition like MS. Knowing what each part will cover for your MS treatment can help you know what to expect as you manage your health. is hospital insurance. It covers inpatient stays in hospitals and . It also provides limited and short stays at . Part A covers any treatments you receive while admitted to a facility, including therapies and medications. is medical insurance. Together with Part A, it makes up what is known as . Part B covers a wide range of services you might need while managing MS, including: is also known as Medicare Advantage. When you have Part C, you buy a plan from a private insurance company that contracts with Medicare. Your Medicare Advantage plan takes the place of original Medicare (parts A and B) and is required to cover all the same services as original Medicare. Some plans cover additional services as well. For example, your Part C plan might also cover prescription drugs. Most plans work with a network of providers. To receive full coverage, you’ll need to use pharmacies, doctors, and other providers within the plan’s network. provides coverage for prescription drugs, including medications you might take to manage your MS. Original Medicare doesn’t cover medications, unless you receive them in a facility or at a doctor’s office. So, you can purchase a Part D plan to supplement your original Medicare coverage. Part D plans have what is known as a formulary. This is a list of medications the plan covers. If there are two medications that can treat the same conditions, a formulary might cover only one of them. The cost of drugs on the formulary often depends on which pricing tier they fall under. are designed to cover some of the out-of-pocket costs you pay with Medicare. These plans can save you some up-front costs, like: What specific medications, services, and treatments for MS are covered? Managing MS often requires a with several parts. Medicare will help cover the cost of many of these treatments, as long as they’re considered medically necessary in your situation. The FDA has approved multiple medications for MS. Depending on your symptoms and the progression of your MS, you might be prescribed medications with one of three aims: These medications are used to slow down the progression of MS. You might take these medications as a pill, injection, or infusion. Common medications in this group include interferon beta-1a (Avonex, Rebif, Plegridy), interferon beta-1b (Betaseron, Extavia), glatiramer acetate (Copaxone), fingolimod (Gilenya), and ocrelizumab (Ocrevus). Many MS relapses resolve on their own. During a severe relapse, your doctor might prescribe high-dose medications such as methylprednisolone (Solu-Medrol), prednisone (Deltasone), or ACTH (H.P. Acthar Gel) to help you manage it. Not everyone with MS has the same symptoms, so the medications you need will depend on your specific experience. Medications can help manage symptoms like loss of bladder control, bladder infections, loss of bowel control, depression, pain, fatigue, sexual problems, dizziness, and tremors. Medicare coverage for any of these medications will depend on where you receive them. For example, if you receive prednisone in the hospital during a relapse, it will be covered under Part A. If you’re taking daily medications at home to manage your symptoms or slow the progression of your MS, you’ll need a Part D or Part C plan for coverage. Much like the medications you might take for symptoms, the services you need will depend on the progression, severity, and specific symptoms of your MS. Depending on your needs, your doctor might recommend: Medicare will cover any medically necessary physical therapy. This means that the therapy must be used to treat your symptoms. It could include therapy to reduce pain, improve balance, or build strength. Medicare will also cover any medically necessary occupational therapy. Occupational therapy can help you learn or relearn how to do everyday tasks, such as showering or eating, as your disease progresses. You can get coverage for speech therapy for any symptoms that might be making it difficult for you to communicate, eat, or swallow. Depression and other mental health concerns are among people with MS. Medicare will cover visits with mental health professionals as part of your treatment plan. Generally, Medicare will cover these services under Part B, unless you receive them while in inpatient care. For example, if you receive physical therapy for your MS while staying in a skilled nursing facility, Part A would cover the cost. Because Medicare Advantage plans cover at least as much as original Medicare, these services are also covered by all Part C plans. Part B will cover you use in your home. This DME must be deemed medically necessary and includes a range of things you might need to manage your MS, including: pressure-reducing support surfaces, such as cushions or mattresses The following table summarizes how each of the treatments we’ve discussed are covered by Medicare: Part A applies only if given as an inpatient; Part B applies only if given in a doctor’s office Part A applies only if given as an inpatient; Part B applies only if given in a doctor’s office Part A applies only if needed while you’re an inpatient Medicare won’t cover everything you might need to treat your MS. Since the course of MS varies from person to person, you might run into some things that aren’t covered. Common examples include: Medicare won’t cover any treatments that haven’t been approved by the FDA for treating MS. For example, is being studied as a treatment for MS, but it hasn’t been approved by the FDA. Since it’s not approved, Medicare won’t cover it. Medicare doesn’t cover long-term care in nursing homes or other facilities. Part A covers short-term stays of up to 60 days, as long as they’re medically necessary. Medicare won’t pay for you to permanently stay in a nursing facility or have long-term help at home. You’ll need a Part D or Medicare Advantage plan to cover any at-home MS medications. Original Medicare doesn’t cover medications unless you receive them at a hospital, doctor’s office, or other healthcare facility. Your costs for MS treatment will depend on the parts of Medicare you use and the therapies you receive. Most people receive Part A without a monthly premium. But you’ll need to pay a deductible before Part A coverage kicks in. In 2020, the Part A deductible is . Once you’ve paid the deductible, Medicare Part A will cover 100 percent of your costs during the first 60 days of inpatient treatment. On days 61 through 90, you’ll pay in coinsurance per day. After day 90, you’ll pay per day in coinsurance until you’ve used up your 60 . The deductible and coinsurance costs apply for each . A benefit period begins the day you’re admitted as an inpatient and ends when you haven’t received care for 60 days. You can have multiple benefit periods in a single year. You’ll pay a monthly premium for Part B. In 2020, the Part B premium is . You’ll also need to pay the Part B deductible of before your coverage begins. After you meet your deductible, you’ll be responsible for coinsurance, which is of the Medicare-approved amount for most covered services. Your Part C costs will depend on the plan you choose. Not all plans are available in all states. You can shop for a plan in your area on the . The plan you choose will determine your deductibles, copays, coinsurance, and premiums. Check the plans in your area for specific prices and services covered. Just like with Part C, your costs will depend on the plan you choose. The national base beneficiary premium for Part D is in 2020. You might also have a deductible or copayments. You can look for plans in your area using on the . Check each plan’s formulary to make sure any medications you need are covered. To lower your costs, you can ask your doctor if it’s possible to switch to the generic version of any expensive brand-name medications. You’ll have to pay a premium for Medigap plans. These premiums tend to be more expensive than those for Medicare Advantage or Part D. But Medigap plans can help lower your out-of-pocket costs significantly. Depending on the plan you choose, Medigap can cover your coinsurance amounts, Part A premium, and more. So, if you’re going to be using a lot of Medicare services when managing a condition like MS, a Medigap plan might save you money in the long run.

Medicare can help you pay for some of those costs. Different parts of Medicare will cover different treatment options. For example, your Part A coverage will cover hospital stays, while your Part B coverage will cover doctors’ visits and medical equipment. Your Part D coverage will cover necessary medications to take at home. If you have a Medicare Advantage plan, you’ll receive coverage that’s equal to coverage under parts A, B, and D combined.

75bac191-6cdc-4892-b865-c4b00147daed,"MS, the coronavirus and vaccines – updated global advice MS, the coronavirus and vaccines – updated global advice International study looks at long-term progression in people with MS following stem cell therapy Autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) has sparked global interest in recent months. In MS, HSCT works by “resetting” the diseased immune system and replacing it with a healthy one. A number of studies have shown that the treatment has the potential to stop the progression of MS in its tracks, prevent the requirement of disease modifying therapies (DMTs), and in some cases improve function. However, only limited information has been available about how people do in the longer term following a transplant. Researchers around the world are continuing to study HSCT as a potential treatment for MS, and a new study looks further into these trials and what they can tell us about the long term benefits and risks of HSCT. The study looked at a group of people living with MS who received HSCT between 1996 and 2006. Researchers analysed data from 281 participants from 25 centres across 13 countries that underwent the treatment. They examined demographic and clinical data (EDSS score, type of MS, treatment history, as well as the type of chemotherapy regimen that was administered- high, intermediate, or low intensity). The researchers looked at the proportion of people who had progression-free survival, meaning their disability level stayed the same before and after the treatment. They based this assessment on the observed changes in Expanded Disability Status Score (EDSS). MS progression was halted in 46% of all individuals at 5 years post-HSCT. The study also determined that the progression of MS after the HSCT is more likely to occur in (1) older versus younger people with MS (2) those with progressive MS versus relapsing-remitting MS and (3) individuals that previously were on more than two DMTs. For example, 73% of people with relapsing-remitting MS compared with 33% of people with secondary progressive MS experienced an absence of disease progression at the 5 year post-treatment assessment. In a subgroup of 111 people that were further analysed, those individuals with relapsing-remitting MS showed an improvement in disability following HSCT (EDSS change of -0.76), and for people with progressive MS improvement was also observed but to a lesser degree (EDSS change of -0.14). There were 8 deaths reported within the first 100 days after transplant, which were related to the treatment. The findings from this study provide insight into the long-term impact of HSCT in people living with all forms of MS, and serves as a driving force for larger, well-designed trials that could compare HSCT with other available DMTs or against a placebo treatment. It provides information that will help guide decisions of people with MS and health care professionals who are considering HSCT, and paves the way for ongoing research in the application of stem cells for MS.

f296acac-e9a7-4236-a705-7e84b6495c89,"MS, the coronavirus and vaccines – updated global advice MS, the coronavirus and vaccines – updated global advice MS, the coronavirus and vaccines – updated global advice MS, the coronavirus and vaccines – updated global advice New advice for people with MS - updated on 13 January 2021 COVID-19 is a new illness that can affect your lungs, airways and other organs. It is caused by a novel coronavirus (called SARS-CoV-2) that has spread around the world. The advice below was developed by MS clinicians and research experts. It is based on the emerging evidence of how COVID-19 affects people with multiple sclerosis (MS) and expert opinion. This advice will be reviewed and updated as further evidence about COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 becomes available. For information about COVID-19 mRNA (Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna) vaccines and MS, please scroll down. to download the full statement as a PDF, including the list of consulted individuals and organisations. Current evidence shows that simply having MS does not make you more likely to develop COVID-19 or to become severely ill or die from the infection than the general population. However, the following groups of people with MS are more susceptible to having a severe case of COVID-19: Black people with MS and possibly South Asian people with MS People with higher levels of disability (for example, of 6 or above, which relates to needing to use a walking stick) People with MS and obesity, diabetes or diseases of the heart or lungs People taking certain disease modifying therapies for their MS (see below) All people with MS are advised to follow guidelines for reducing the risk of infection with COVID-19.  People in the higher risk groups should pay particular attention to these measures. We recommend to: Practise social distancing by keeping 1.5 metres*** distance between yourself and others, to reduce your risk of infection when they cough, sneeze or speak. This is particularly important when indoors but applies to being outdoors as well. Make wearing a mask a normal part of being around other people and ensure that you are using it correctly by following Avoid going to crowded places, especially indoors. Where this is not possible, ensure to wear a mask and practise social distancing. Wash your hands frequently with soap and water or an alcohol-based hand rub (70% alcohol content is considered most effective). Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth unless your hands are clean. When coughing and sneezing, cover your mouth and nose with a flexed elbow or tissue. Clean and disinfect surfaces frequently especially those which are regularly touched. Talk to your healthcare provider about optimal care plans, through video consultations or in-person visits where needed. Visits to health clinics/centres and hospitals should not be avoided if they are recommended based on your current health needs. Stay active and try to take part in activities that will enhance your mental health and well-being. Physical exercise and social activities that can take place outside and with social distancing are encouraged. Get the seasonal flu vaccination where it is available and encourage your family to do the same. Caregivers and family members who live with, or regularly visit, a person with MS in one of the higher risk groups should also follow these recommendations to reduce the chance of bringing COVID-19 infection into the home. *** National and international guidelines on physical distancing vary between at least 1 metre and 2 metres. People should consider their national guidance and be aware that these are minimum distances, longer being better. Advice regarding disease modifying therapies for MS Many disease modifying therapies (DMTs) for MS work by suppressing or modifying the immune system. Some MS medications might increase the likelihood of developing complications from COVID-19 but this risk needs to be balanced with the risks of stopping or delaying treatment. We recommend that people with MS currently taking DMTs continue with their treatment, unless advised to stop by their treating clinician. People who develop symptoms of COVID-19 or test positive for the infection should discuss their MS therapies with their MS care provider or another healthcare professional who is familiar with their care. Before starting on any new DMT or changing an existing DMT, people with MS should discuss with their healthcare professional which therapy is the best choice for their individual circumstances. This decision should consider the following information: The risks and benefits normally associated with different treatment options Additional risks related to COVID-19, such as: The presence of other factors for a more severe case of COVID-19, such as older age, obesity, pre-existing lung or cardiovascular disease, progressive MS, higher risk race/ethnicity etc, as listed above The current and anticipated future COVID-19 risk in the local area Risk of exposure to COVID-19 due to lifestyle, for example whether they are able to self-isolate or are working in a high-risk environment Emerging evidence on the potential interaction between some treatments and COVID-19 severity Evidence on the impact of DMTs on COVID-19 severity Interferons and glatiramer acetate are unlikely to impact negatively on COVID-19 severity. There is some preliminary evidence that interferons may reduce the need for hospitalisation due to COVID-19. The evidence available suggests that people with MS taking dimethyl fumarate, teriflunomide, fingolimod, siponimod and natalizumab do not have an increased risk of more severe COVID-19 symptoms. It is unlikely that people with MS taking ozanimod will have an increased risk either, as it is assumed to be similar to siponimod and fingolimod. There is some evidence that therapies that target CD20 – ocrelizumab and rituximab – may be linked to an increased chance of having a more severe form of COVID-19. However, these therapies should still be considered as an option for treating MS during the pandemic. People with MS who are taking them (or ofatumumab and ublituximab that work in the same way) should be particularly vigilant regarding the advice above to reduce their risk of infection. More data on the use of alemtuzumab and cladribine during the COVID-19 pandemic are required to make any assessment of their safety. People with MS who are currently taking these therapies and are living in a community with a COVID-19 outbreak should discuss their current lymphocyte counts with their healthcare professional. (Lymphocytes are a type of white blood cell that helps protect the body from infection). If their counts are considered to be low they should isolate as much as possible to reduce their risk. Recommendations on delaying second or further doses of alemtuzumab, cladribine, ocrelizumab and rituximab due to the COVID-19 outbreak differ between countries. People who take these medications and are due for the next dose should consult their healthcare professional about the risks and benefits of postponing treatment. People are strongly encouraged to stop treatment without the advice of their clinician. Autologous Haematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (aHSCT) includes intensive chemotherapy treatment. This severely weakens the immune system for a period of time. People who have recently undergone aHSCT should consider extending the period they remain in isolation during the COVID-19 outbreak to at least six months. People who are due to undergo treatment should consider postponing the procedure in consultation with their healthcare professional. If aHSCT is given, chemotherapy should be administered in rooms isolated from other hospital patients. Seeking medical advice for relapses and other health concerns People with MS should still seek medical advice if they experience changes in their health that may suggest a relapse or another underlying issue such as an infection. This can be done using alternatives to in-person clinic visits (such as telephone or video consultations) if the option is available. In many cases, it is possible to manage relapses at home. The use of steroids for treating relapses should be carefully considered and only used for relapses that need intervention. There is some evidence that receiving high-dose steroids in the month prior to contracting COVID-19 increases the risk of a more severe infection requiring a visit to hospital. Where possible, the decision should be made with a neurologist experienced in the treatment of MS. People who receive steroid treatment for a relapse should be extra vigilant and may want to consider self-isolation for at least a month to reduce their risk from COVID-19. Note that once someone has been infected with COVID-19, steroids may be used to treat COVID-19, to dampen the excessive immune response often referred to as a ‘cytokine storm’. People with MS should continue to participate in rehabilitation activities and stay active as much as possible during the pandemic. This can be done through remote sessions where available or in clinics/centres as long as people with MS attending the clinics/centres follow safety precautions to protect themselves and limit the spread of COVID-19. People with concerns about their mental health should seek advice from their healthcare professional. The flu vaccine is safe and recommended for people with MS. For countries entering flu season, we recommend people with MS receive the seasonal flu vaccine where it is available. At this time there is no specific advice for women with MS who are pregnant. There is general information on COVID-19 and pregnancy from the . There is no specific advice for children with MS; they should follow the advice above for people with MS. COVID-19 mRNA vaccines (Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna) and MS Our guidance currently relates to the mRNA vaccines (Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna) only, as these have been through an assessment by our clinical and scientific experts. We know that other COVID-19 vaccines are in use in different countries, and our aim is to update our advice to cover these vaccines as soon as possible. The mRNA vaccines work by using part of the coronavirus’ genetic code to prompt a response from the human immune system, which in turn will generate a human response to produce antibodies and T-cells cells (a special population of white blood cells) to fight the virus. All data regarding these mRNA COVID-19 vaccines come from clinical trials, which were carefully and thoroughly reviewed and then approved by regulatory authorities. We do not know how many people in the mRNA vaccine clinical trials had MS, so data on the safety and effectiveness of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines specifically for people with MS are not yet available. Our guidance is therefore based on data from the general population in the vaccine clinical trials, and guided by prior experience regarding vaccination of people with MS.  We will update our guidance as more data emerges. The science has shown us that the COVID-19 mRNA vaccines (Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna) are safe and effective. Like other medical decisions, the decision to get a vaccine is best made in partnership with your healthcare professional. You should get the mRNA vaccine (Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna) if and as soon as it becomes available to you. The risks of COVID-19 disease outweigh any potential risks from the vaccine. In addition, members of the same household and close contacts should also get an mRNA vaccine (Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna) when available to decrease the impact of the virus. The Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines require two doses. You need to get both doses for it to be fully effective. You should follow local, regional and national guidelines on the timing of the second dose. If you have had COVID-19 and recovered, you should also get the vaccine since it does not appear that prior infection protects from future COVID-19 infection indefinitely. Note that following full vaccination (both doses), it may take up to three weeks to reach maximal immunity. We do not know how long a vaccinated person is protected from COVID-19, although clinical trial data indicates that protection is very high (ie; vaccinated persons have a very low, less than 5% risk, of having COVID-19 symptoms if exposed to the virus) for at least multiple months. Repeated doses of the COVID-19 vaccines may be required in future years. People with progressive MS, those who are older, those who have a higher level of physical disability (e.g. limited walking distance), those with certain medical conditions (e.g. diabetes, high blood pressure, obesity, heart and lung disease), and Black people with MS and possibly South Asian people with MS, are among groups with the highest risk of hospitalisation due to COVID-19. The mRNA vaccines (Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna) are safe for people with MS The mRNA vaccines (Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna) do not contain live virus and will not cause COVID-19 disease. The mRNA vaccines (Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna) are not likely to trigger an MS relapse or to worsen your chronic MS symptoms. The risk of getting COVID-19 far outweighs any risk of having an MS relapse from the vaccine. The mRNA vaccines (Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna) can cause side effects, including a fever or fatigue. A fever can make your MS symptoms worse temporarily, but they should return to previous levels after the fever is gone. Even if you have side effects from the first dose, it is important to get the second dose of the vaccine for it to be fully effective. The COVID-19 mRNA vaccines (Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna) are safe to use with MS medications Continue your disease modifying therapy (DMT) unless you are advised by your MS healthcare professional to stop or delay it. Stopping some DMTs abruptly can cause severe worsening of the disease. Based on data from previous studies of other vaccines and DMTs, getting the mRNA vaccines (Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna) while on any DMT is safe. Some DMTs may make the vaccine less effective but it will still provide some protection. For those taking ofatumumab, alemtuzumab, cladribine, ocrelizumab, or rituximab – you may need to coordinate the timing of your vaccine with the timing of your DMT dose. Work with your MS healthcare professional to determine the best schedule for you. All of us have a personal responsibility to slow the spread of the pandemic and eliminate the virus as quickly as possible The authorisations of safe and effective vaccines for COVID-19 bring us one step closer to eliminating this pandemic. In areas where there is ongoing local transmission of COVID-19, in addition to getting vaccinated, you should refer to your local guidelines about transmission mitigation strategies, which are likely to include wearing a face mask, social distancing and washing your hands.

The Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines require two doses. You need to get both doses for it to be fully effective. You should follow local, regional and national guidelines on the timing of the second dose. If you have had COVID-19 and recovered, you should also get the vaccine since it does not appear that prior infection protects from future COVID-19 infection indefinitely. Note that following full vaccination (both doses), it may take up to three weeks to reach maximal immunity. We do not know how long a vaccinated person is protected from COVID-19, although clinical trial data indicates that protection is very high (ie; vaccinated persons have a very low, less than 5% risk, of having COVID-19 symptoms if exposed to the virus) for at least multiple months. Repeated doses of the COVID-19 vaccines may be required in future years. People with progressive MS, those who are older, those who have a higher level of physical disability (e.g. limited walking distance), those with certain medical conditions (e.g. diabetes, high blood pressure, obesity, heart and lung disease), and Black people with MS and possibly South Asian people with MS, are among groups with the highest risk of hospitalisation due to COVID-19. The mRNA vaccines (Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna) are safe for people with MS The mRNA vaccines (Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna) do not contain live virus and will not cause COVID-19 disease. The mRNA vaccines (Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna) are not likely to trigger an MS relapse or to worsen your chronic MS symptoms. The risk of getting COVID-19 far outweighs any risk of having an MS relapse from the vaccine. The mRNA vaccines (Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna) can cause side effects, including a fever or fatigue. A fever can make your MS symptoms worse temporarily, but they should return to previous levels after the fever is gone. Even if you have side effects from the first dose, it is important to get the second dose of the vaccine for it to be fully effective. The COVID-19 mRNA vaccines (Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna) are safe to use with MS medications Continue your disease modifying therapy (DMT) unless you are advised by your MS healthcare professional to stop or delay it. Stopping some DMTs abruptly can cause severe worsening of the disease. Based on data from previous studies of other vaccines and DMTs, getting the mRNA vaccines (Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna) while on any DMT is safe. Some DMTs may make the vaccine less effective but it will still provide some protection. For those taking ofatumumab, alemtuzumab, cladribine, ocrelizumab, or rituximab – you may need to coordinate the timing of your vaccine with the timing of your DMT dose. Work with your MS healthcare professional to determine the best schedule for you. All of us have a personal responsibility to slow the spread of the pandemic and eliminate the virus as quickly as possible The authorisations of safe and effective vaccines for COVID-19 bring us one step closer to eliminating this pandemic. In areas where there is ongoing local transmission of COVID-19, in addition to getting vaccinated, you should refer to your local guidelines about transmission mitigation strategies, which are likely to include wearing a face mask, social distancing and washing your hands.

9eef63d2-627f-4ad5-b798-64e6ea0bb406,"MS, the coronavirus and vaccines – updated global advice MS, the coronavirus and vaccines – updated global advice The updated Atlas of MS covers three key themes: the epidemiology of MS, the resources available to diagnose and treat the disease, and the support available to people with MS in 124 countries around the world. stimulate additional systematic data gathering, particularly data on the epidemiology of MS encourage the development of much-needed policy, services and training. The estimated number of people with MS in the world has increased to 2.3 million (up 9.5% from the 2008 survey). Women are twice as likely to have MS as men, although in some countries women are three times as likely to have MS. Up to 5% of people with MS develop it before the age of 18, and the new Atlas of MS provides data on the prevalence of . The number of neurologists worldwide has increased by 30% and the provision of MRI machines, which are key to early diagnosis and treatment of MS, has doubled in the past 5 years in emerging countries. Disease-modifying therapies for MS are partly or fully funded by governments in 96% of high income countries, but funding drops to zero in low income countries. Data sources for the 2013 survey are more robust than in 2008. Ninety two countries (accounting for 79% of the world population) provided prevalence data in 2013. Forty seven of these countries (51%) provided a reference to at least one published peer-reviewed paper reporting the results of a local or national epidemiological study, while another 18 (20%) referred to a register (local or national) or study that was not published in a peer-reviewed journal. Where possible the statistics submitted were checked against published data and, where there were discrepancies, we contacted the individual who submitted the data in order to reconcile the different figures. The estimates for the epidemiology of MS that were provided by the countries participating in the Atlas survey were conservative, and are likely to have been substantially lower than the real figures in many countries with less developed healthcare systems, due to under-diagnosis and under-reporting. Although multiple sclerosis has been described and named as a neurological disease in adults for well over 100 years, it is only in the past few decades that it has been recognized that MS can occur in too. More and more physicians consider this as a possible diagnosis when presented with symptoms consistent with central nervous system demyelination. Knowledge about the incidence, diagnosis and clinical management of has expanded significantly in the past 10-15 years as research and dissemination of data has increased among the medical community. In 2007, an was founded with the support of several MS societies. The group has published consensus statements about the diagnosis and clinical care of children with MS and the most promising avenues of future research. Research into possible genetic and environmental factors that may cause MS is an area of special interest in this field as it could yield valuable information about the development of MS in adults. What’s the difference between relapsing and progressive MS? Most people with MS (85%) are initially diagnosed with relapsing remitting MS (RRMS), where symptoms appear (relapse) over a short period of time, lasting between a few days and a few months. The symptoms then resolve (remission), sometimes for a long time. In progressive MS, there is a gradual accumulation of disability, with or without superimposed relapses. Up to 80% of people with RRMS will eventually develop (secondary progressive MS). A small percentage will develop progressive MS from the outset (primary progressive MS). What is the connection between eye disease and MS? Optic neuritis is a medical term that describes inflammation of the optic nerve. It may cause a complete or partial loss of vision. The cause is unknown, and believed to be multi-factorial. In some cases, optic neuritis is one of the first symptoms of MS, but not all people who have optic neuritis go on to develop MS. Optic neuritis is also a characteristic feature of Neuromyelitis optica (NMO), also known as Devic’s disease, which is an autoimmune condition that shares many of the clinical features of MS. There is limited data on NMO, but it is more common in some regions. For that reason, the MS International Federation has been working with people with affected by MS and NMO in China to build a sustainable support structure in that country. The Atlas says that, in some countries, three times as many women as men get MS and that Iran is one of these countries. Does having to cover and therefore have less contact with the sun and absorption of Vitamin D explain this statistic? There is no simple answer. The reasons for the higher ratio of MS among women relative to men in certain parts of the world are most likely to be related to the complex interplay between genetics and the environment. While reduced sun exposure and consequent decreases in vitamin D levels might be a factor in some countries, substantial increases in the female to male ratio of MS have also been observed over the past few decades in countries where there is no tradition of women covering up. What improvements for people with MS did the 2008 Atlas bring about? The 2008 Atlas found that Ireland had the lowest number of neurologists per head in the European Union. MS Ireland used this to persuade the Irish government to increase this and, by 2013, the number of neurologists in Ireland had increased from 14 to 34. We have also seen an increase in the number of countries in the Eastern Mediterranean with MS support groups, and in the availability of information for people with MS. What is the MS International Federation going to do with the findings of this report? We are encouraging all our members to use the report, and the more detailed data on this website, to call for improved diagnosis and treatment of MS and improved information and resources for people living with MS.

A: Neuromyelitis Optica Spectrum Disorder (NMOSD) is an inflammatory, demyelinating, antibody-mediated disease of the central nervous system (CNS) that predominantly targets the optic nerves, brainstem and spinal cord. The term neuromyelitis optica was first described by Devic and Gault in 1894 (1). The disease was, therefore, previously referred to as Devic’s disease. It was considered for years as a variant of multiple sclerosis but, more recently, demonstrated to represent a distinct clinical and pathophysiologic entity. Moreover, the identification of a serum autoantibodies specific for the aquaporin-4 (AQP4) (2), a water channel present on astrocytic foot processes heavily expressed in the optic nerves, brainstem, and spinal cord, unified a spectrum of NMO-related disorders and distinguished them from multiple sclerosis (MS). NMOSD encompasses patients who fulfill the diagnostic criteria below and are either AQP4 seropositive or AQP4/myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) seronegative (testing discussed below). A: The reported incidence and prevalence of NMOSD are dependent on geographical location and ethnicity. The prevalence in the United States and Europe range between 3.9-4.1/100,000 but higher in African and Asian populations. Females are more affected than males (3:1–9:1) (3). The median age at presentation is 39 years, but 18% of cases occur in children or the elderly (4). It is generally regarded as a non-familial disease. A: NMOSD has three cardinal manifestations: optic neuritis, transverse myelitis, and area postrema syndrome. Optic neuritis is often associated with severe bilateral vision involvement, and incomplete recovery. Transverse myelitis in NMOSD is typically complete with profound bilateral motor weakness, prominent dysesthesias, a sensory level, and sphincter dysfunction (5). Other useful clinical clues include pain, pruritis, and tonic spasms (brief recurrent, usually painful episodes of increased muscle tone with abnormal posturing of the affecting limb). NMOSD transverse myelitis is often disabling and associated with poor recovery despite treatment. The third common presentation is area postrema syndrome, which is characterized by nausea, vomiting with or without hiccup, and patients are often evaluated first by gastroenterologists. It may occur in isolation, have other accompanying brainstem features, or evolve into a myelitis episode. Other less common presentations include symptomatic diencephalic syndrome (narcolepsy, autonomic dysfunction, anorexia and syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion), symptomatic cerebral syndrome with presentation similar to posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) or acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM), myalgia and hyperCKemia. A: NMOSD is commonly associated with organ specific autoimmune disease myasthenia gravis (pernicious anemia, autoimmune thyroiditis, ulcerative colitis and type 1 diabetes) and non-organ specific autoimmune disease or their autoantibody biomarkers such as systemic lupus erythematosus, Sjogren syndrome, and antiphospholipid antibody syndrome (6). The presence of any core manifestations of NMOSD in any patient with these diseases is likely due to NMOSD rather than neurological manifestations of connective tissue disease and should promote testing for AQP4-IgG. NMOSD can rarely be a paraneoplastic presentation. A: Although NMOSD has distinct immunopathogenesis and treatment options, both NMOSD and MS may have similar clinical presentations and imaging features. It is essential to differentiate NMOSD and MS, especially in patients with both optic nerve and spinal cord involvement, as some MS therapies (e.g. interferon beta, natalizumab, fingolimod) can exacerbate NMOSD. Optic neuritis is generally more severe, and recovery poorer in NMOSD than in MS, with complete remission in only 32%. Transverse myelitis in NMOSD is usually extensive, with complete clinical remission in only 17% of attacks (7). Unlike MS, the disability in NMOSD is mostly driven by relapses rather than disease progression. MRI of the brain is usually normal or shows changes that differ from MS (See below). The longitudinally extensive cord lesions (typically 3 vertebral segments long) characteristic of NMO are rarely seen in MS (MS lesions are usually one vertebral segment long).  CSF may show a striking lymphocytic pleocytosis or a neutrophilic predominance, whereas a CSF pleocytosis >50 cells/mm3 is rare in multiple sclerosis. Oligoclonal bands are found in only 15-30% with NMO versus 90% with MS (8). A: Brain MRI is abnormal in 55-80% of patients with NMOSD, but only 10% to 20% will satisfy Barkhof MS criteria (9). Typical brain involvement in NMOSD occurs at regions of high AQP4 expression (periaqueductal, hypothalamic, and periventricular regions) but can also involve the deep and subcortical white matter. Different patterns of white matter involvement have been reported in NMOSD, such as marbled appearance of the acute callosal lesion, involvement of the entire thickness of the corpus callosum (arch bridge appearance), tumefactive lesion and spindle-like appearance following white matter tracts. On occasion, lesions ascending from the spinal cord into the brainstem can occur. In addition, different patterns of enhancement have been reported to be typical for NMO, such as pencil-thin linear ependymal enhancement (thin ependymal enhancement of lateral ventricular surfaces), leptomeningeal enhancement, and cloud-like poorly marginated enhancement. Cases of PRESS have also been reported in association with NMOSD. MRI findings of NMOSD optic neuritis include extensive T2 hyperintense lesions, commonly bilateral, extending over the posterior part of the optic nerve or involving the optic chiasm, with enhancement usually extending more than half the length of the nerve (11). Imaging of the acute myelitis of NMOSD typically reveals a longitudinally extensive T2-hyperintense lesion spanning three or more contiguous vertebral segments. However, lesions are short in 14% of first myelitis episodes (92% long at relapse) (10). Extensive cord edema, central cord involvement with necrosis and cavitation, and a long segment cord atrophy are other common features with NMOSD. A: Patients suspected of having NMOSD should be tested for AQP4-IgG antibodies. AQP4-IgG binds to AQP4, which is located on the end-feet of astrocytes, initiating a cascade of immune-mediated inflammation resulting in secondary demyelination. Blood testing is recommended for AQP4-IgG and should be performed during the attack, before immunotherapy. Of available AQP4-Ab assays, the live cell-based assay has the highest sensitivity (76.7%) and specificity (99.8%) (12). The older-generation enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay technique is less sensitive and more prone to yield false-positive results. With the most sensitive assays, testing is negative in 10-25% of clinically diagnosed NMO. Up to 25% of patients with seronegative NMOSD will have antibodies to myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG-IgG). Please refer to the Mellen Center Approach (MCA) on Myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein antibody disorders for more information on that topic. CSF findings in NMOSD typically include a mixed pleocytosis (lymphocytes, neutrophils, and monocytes) with a median cell count of 19 cells/μl (range: 6-380) and elevated protein, especially in the setting of relapse. Positive oligoclonal bands are found in less than 30 % of patients with AQP4-IgG. Testing for AQP4-IgG in the CSF is less useful and is not the preferred method. A: We test any patient with any of these clinical presentations: longitudinally extensive or severe transverse myelitis, severe unilateral, recurrent, or bilateral optic neuritis. We also test AQP4-IgG in patients with intractable vomiting, hiccup, vertigo, unusual brain or brainstem lesions or undiagnosed inflammatory CNS disorder. Q: What are the criteria for the diagnosis of NMOSD? A: Revised consensus criteria published in 2015 base the diagnosis of NMOSD on the presence of core clinical characteristics, AQP4 antibody status, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) neuroimaging features (13). Positive test for AQP4-IgG using best available detection method (cell-based assay strongly recommended) Diagnostic criteria for NMOSD without AQP4-IgG or NMOSD with unknown AQP4-IgG status 1. At least two core clinical characteristics occurring as a result of one or more clinical attacks and meeting all of the following requirements: a. At least one core clinical characteristic must be optic neuritis, acute myelitis with longitudinally extensive transverse myelitis (LETM), or area postrema syndrome b. Dissemination in space (two or more different core clinical characteristics) c. Fulfillment of additional MRI requirements, as applicable 2. Negative tests for AQP4-IgG using best available detection method, or testing unavailable Area postrema syndrome: Episode of otherwise unexplained hiccups or nausea and vomiting Symptomatic narcolepsy or acute diencephalic clinical syndrome with NMOSD-typical diencephalic MRI lesions Symptomatic cerebral syndrome with NMOSD-typical brain lesions Additional MRI requirements for NMOSD without AQP4-IgG and NMOSD with unknown AQP4-IgG status 1. Acute optic neuritis: Requires brain MRI showing (a) normal findings or only nonspecific white matter lesions,  (b) optic nerve MRI with T2-hyperintense lesion or T1-weighted gadolinium enhancing lesion extending over more than one-half the optic nerve length or involving optic chiasm 2. Acute myelitis: Requires associated intramedullary MRI lesion extending over ≥3 contiguous segments (LETM)  ≥3 contiguous segments of focal spinal cord atrophy in patients with history compatible with acute myelitis 3. Area postrema syndrome: Requires associated dorsal medulla/area postrema lesions 4. Acute brainstem syndrome: Requires associated periependymal brainstem lesion Q: What is the expected course and prognosis of NMOSD? A: Approximately 90% of NMOSD patients have a relapsing course, with around 50% have their first relapse within 1 year and 90% within 5 years (14). Predictors of relapsing course include older age of onset, longer interval between first and second clinical attack, female gender, and less severe motor disability with the index event (15). If untreated, 50% of patients with relapsing NMOSD become blind in one or both eyes and require ambulatory help within 5 years of disease onset. Q: What are the differences between pediatric and adult onset NMOSD? A: Approximately 4% of NMOSD cases are reported to be pediatric onset. The age of onset is typically around 10–12 years, with the youngest reported patient with NMOSD was 16 months old. The marked female predominance seen in adult-onset disease is less evident (∼3:1 female: male ratio compared with up to 9:1 for adults). As in adults, AQP4 IgG seropositivity is usually associated with a severe, relapsing course, but is sometimes monophasic. In pediatric cases, the brain tends to be more involved, and brain lesions are commonly symptomatic, most common are encephalopathy, intractable nausea, hiccups, diplopia, and vertigo. With regard to spine MRI, both long and short segment myelitis were reported. However, LETM is less specific for NMOSD in children as 15% of pediatric MS patients have LETM. Other clinical, neuroimaging, and laboratory characteristics of pediatric NMOSD are similar to those of adult-onset disease. The International Panel for NMO Diagnosis (IPND) suggested that adult criteria are utilizable in pediatric with a caveat that LETM is probably less specific and can be observed in children with MS or ADEM. Current therapeutic options are similar to those of NMOSD for adults (see below). However, there is no FDA approved drug for pediatric patients with NMOSD. Q: What is the general approach to an NMO relapse? Is it different from an MS relapse? A: At the Mellen Center we treat NMO relapses urgently because of the rapidity, severity, as well as potential irreversibility of relapses in this disorder. Brainstem and cervical cord involvement may lead to fulminant neurogenic respiratory failure. We also make sure the patient is started on long term disease therapy as well (See below). Intravenous corticosteroids are our initial treatment for an acute attack. The typical Mellen Center regimen is methylprednisolone 1000mg IV as a single daily dose on 3-5 consecutive days followed by an oral prednisone taper of one to 6 months depending on the severity of the attack and the maintenance immunotherapy plan. Patients with severe myelitis or brainstem symptoms should be given steroids in an inpatient setting.  We consider plasmapheresis as an early second line treatment with a low threshold in those with no or minimal response to corticosteroids or if the attack is severe. Q: Other than medication, what types of support are needed in an NMO relapse? A: Other considerations during an NMO relapse with spinal cord involvement include attention to skin hygiene, DVT prophylaxis, symptomatic treatment for painful spasms, and early physical therapy.  Patients with cervical cord and/or brainstem involvement may require close monitoring of pulmonary mechanics and cardiac telemetry. Tonic spasms following transverse myelitis can often effectively be treated with a low dose of carbamazepine. Central neuropathic pain is also more frequent in NMOSD and early involvement of a local pain team is helpful if typical neuropathic agents are not effective. A: Given the natural history of NMOSD, long-term immunotherapy is indicated as soon as the diagnosis is made to prevent recurrent relapses and disability accrual. Unlike MS where the risk of relapses diminishes with age, patients with NMOSD require long term immunotherapy-for decades and any decision to stop chronic immunotherapy must be taken with caution. Until recently, there was no approved medication for NMOSD, and all of the medications were used off label. In June 2019, the FDA approved eculizumab (Soliris) for treatment of adult patients with NMOSD who are seropositive for AQP4 IgG antibodies (16). Rituximab has been widely used off label as first-line treatment to prevent relapses in NMOSD, driven by robust effects in several retrospective studies and a recent small randomized control trial  (17). Azathioprine and mycophenolate mofetil have been used for years but prospective data in support of their efficacy are lacking. Other therapies, such as methotrexate, mitoxantrone, cyclo- phosphamide, and cyclosporine have less supporting data for use in NMOSD. Inebilizumab and Satralizumab showed positive outcomes in phase III with reduction in relapse rates between 70–90% but are not yet licensed or available outside of clinical trials at the time of this review. At the Mellen Center, we treat all patients with AQP4-Abs at their first attack with long-term immunosuppression. We also recommend initiating therapy with Eculizumab or Rituximab as a first line therapy for AQP4-IgG-seropositive NMOSD. Rituximab has the potential benefits of infrequent administration, cost effectiveness and long-term efficacy and tolerability. Table 2 summarizes current treatment options.

These groups included MS researchers, neurologists who specialize in MS, and people who are affected by MS. Through an iterative process, research priority areas were identified and the outcomes from the January 2016 meeting provided the starting point for the development of a set of draft research priorities. A Task Force of both scientific experts and people affected by MS was recruited to refine these research priorities to achieve the greatest impact for people living with MS. The Task Force revised and enhanced the Research Priorities, and codified the Society’s Research Funding Principles. Draft statements were shared with local Society chapter boards and Society volunteer scientific peer reviewers for additional input. The Task Force and Research Programs Advisory Committee endorsed final versions of the principles and priorities in 2017.   - The Funding Principles statement outlines the Society's general research philosophy. - The Research Priorities statement describes five topic areas of critical importance to finding solutions and a cure for MS. The Society uses these priorities to determine the relevance of research proposals we receive and to identify gaps and opportunities for targeted funding.  The complexity of MS requires a comprehensive research strategy that fuels knowledge and speeds better treatments, health care policies, and new disease and symptom management therapies so that there are treatments for everyone and so that people with MS can live their very best lives. The Society provides grant funding, research training, and shared resources, to support the brightest scientists exploring questions underlying MS. We manage a diverse portfolio of academic and commercial research projects, provide training fellowships, foster global collaboration, and convene experts to identify strategic research priorities. Our objectives are achieved by ensuring funding of the best science regardless of geography. Consistent application of the following principles will help accelerate progress toward a world free of MS. We prioritize research that advances the Society’s strategic plan, with a focus on stopping the disease in its tracks, restoring what has been lost, and ending MS forever through a cure for all forms of MS. We maintain a diverse research portfolio that includes short- and long-term investments, balances risks and rewards, and funds research globally. We balance investments in research initiated by individual investigators with investments in Society-directed research, all focused on bridging knowledge gaps, seizing opportunities and addressing research priorities. We promote synergies between researchers in diverse disciplines, and develop strategic partnerships to accelerate progress. We invest in all types of research including: laboratory models, human studies, population-based approaches, and data-intensive investigations that leverage both researcher and patient reported outcomes. We support the full spectrum of basic, translational, and clinical research. We also strive to break down barriers to commercial development to ensure that new treatments and wellness approaches are available as quickly as possible. We use independent experts to ensure that each research proposal receives a fair, competent and objective assessment of its scientific merit, relevance to MS and alignment with the Society’s research priorities. We attract and support new investigators to foster a robust future workforce focused on finding solutions for MS. We expect Society-funded researchers to adhere to rigorous experimental methods and reporting practices. We believe that sharing data and resources enhances research and speeds scientific discovery. Data and resources developed through Society-sponsored research will be made available to other researchers after publication in an expeditious manner. The National MS Society invests in promising research to drive breakthroughs that will stop MS, restore function and end MS forever. To do this, we support collaborations and innovation, convene thought leaders, leverage new technologies and data, invest in training to ensure a robust future workforce, and learn from other diseases, funders and people living with MS. The following focus areas are critical to advancing breakthroughs that will identify solutions for people living with MS today and ultimately lead to prevention and a cure.   Define the contribution of genetics, risk factors and their modifiers to the risk for developing MS and disease course, and develop strategies to prevent, treat and cure all forms of MS -   Although tremendous progress has been made in identifying key biological pathways that contribute to MS risk, the cause is still unknown. Preventing MS for future generations requires a deep understanding of what triggers MS, how triggers lead to the development of the disease, and how to protect against it. High impact research areas include:   Studying how pathogens, lifestyle factors and behaviors like diet and exercise, and environmental exposures impact the risk of developing MS and influence the disease course. Elucidating the role of the microbiome in MS risk and disease course Identifying additional risk variants and their epigenetic modifiers, and determining the genetic influence on clinical/imaging phenotype   Understand MS pathology and pathophysiology -   Much has been learned about immune system activity in the relapsing-remitting phase of MS and this knowledge has led to the development of effective disease-modifying therapies. Less understood is the relationship between initial immune activity and progressive neurodegeneration and how innate immunity participates in the progressive phase of MS. Identifying the causes of MS, and the underlying mechanisms and biological pathways involved in MS injury to the brain and spinal cord, will expose new targets for the development of treatments to stop the damage that causes disability. High impact research areas include:   Clarifying the destructive and protective roles of the adaptive and innate immune system, including both infiltrating and compartmentalized cells Determining the causes of tissue injury at different stages of disease, and whether neurodegeneration and demyelination can be independent events in MS Determining how evolving MRI sequences relate to pathological changes in the central nervous system Leveraging big data and transformative technologies to identify and interrogate relevant biological pathways and clinical/demographic features that influence disability progression Ensuring access to human central nervous system tissues/cells from MS patients and healthy controls for the purpose of gaining a thorough understanding of the neuropathology of MS   Understand and treat MS progression -   MS progression often occurs early in the disease, even while the brain compensates for injury and even in people successfully treated for relapses. Progression is not easily measured and usually happens over long periods of time, making it hard to quickly detect whether a therapy is impacting the course of disease. This has made the development of therapies for progressive stages of MS a challenge. Diagnosing progressive disease based on biomarkers, in addition to clinical presentation would enable the testing of therapies earlier, promising better ways of protecting the nervous system from MS injury. High impact research areas include:   Determining the specific pathologic underpinnings of MS progression Identifying objective indicators of disease activity that mark the transition to progression, measure treatment impact, and predict an individual’s course and response to therapy Determining mechanisms underlying the causes of progression in the absence of acute inflammation or relapses, the transition from relapsing to secondary progressive MS, and whether primary progressive and secondary progressive MS have similar biological underpinnings Developing better animal models that recapitulate human pathology to inform the study of the mechanisms underlying MS and progression Developing tools that allow better treatment decision making and personalized medicine, including therapy risks/benefits Testing approaches for the prevention and treatment of MS progression including repurposed/repositioned FDA-approved therapies, impact of early aggressive treatment vs. step therapy, and cell-based therapy   Identify strategies for neuroprotection and nervous system repair -   The hopes of people living with MS today rest on finding a way to stop disease worsening by preventing neurodegeneration and reversing the damage to restore lost function. The brain can repair myelin and also rewire itself around damaged areas, but in order to significantly impact disease, this natural ability needs to be enhanced. In addition to developing treatment strategies, there is a crucial need for non-invasive ways to determine quickly whether neuroprotective and repair strategies are working. High impact research areas include:   Exploring remyelination and neuroprotective therapies (including stimulation of endogenous repair and cell-based approaches) and testing whether they have synergistic benefit with immune modulatory therapies Developing imaging biomarkers that detect demyelination/remyelination of white and gray matter and better outcome measures to track neuroprotection and repair Determining the extent that individuals’ behaviors (e.g. rehabilitation and exercise) can promote repair and plasticity   Elucidate the cause of MS symptoms, the impact of comorbidities, and identify rehabilitation, wellness behaviors and lifestyle approaches that impact disease course, symptoms and overall health - “How do we reverse symptoms and promote wellness?”   Emerging evidence suggests that wellness behaviors and lifestyle factors can influence the risk for developing MS, disease course, severity of symptoms and quality of life. Finding ways to understand and address the variable and unpredictable symptoms caused by MS will have a profound impact on people’s quality of life. In addition, people with MS often live with other chronic medical conditions. Understanding how these other health conditions affect MS disease course and symptoms represents an important research opportunity. Focusing on opportunities to improve the design and conduct of clinical trials and providing strategies people can incorporate to enhance their wellbeing should be emphasized. High impact research areas include:   Studying the impact of dietary interventions, supplements, and complementary approaches on the course of disease and quality of life Determining the optimal study designs, regimen, and safety of exercise/physical activity and rehabilitation approaches Determining the effectiveness of behavioral interventions such as mindfulness, resilience, positive psychology, problem solving, yoga, stress reduction and other strategies on disease activity and emotional health  Understanding the cause and exploring potential treatment approaches to address symptoms including pain, spasticity, incontinence, sexual dysfunction, fatigue, cognitive impairment, and symptoms caused by lack of mobility Revealing the potential of adaptive technologies and advanced rehabilitation strategies Identifying causes of depression, anxiety and other emotional health issues in MS, and the best approaches to treatment and suicide prevention Assessing the effects of co-morbidities, aging and symptoms on disease course and related economic/life impacts Testing strategies to enhance health care access and quality to improve the lives of people living with MS Here are a few related topics that may interest you Understanding and ending MS can’t come fast enough – it will take all of us working together.

Medical Editor: When to Seek Medical Care, Questions to Ask the Doctor, and Diagnosis More Headache Types and Associated Diseases and Conditions Migraine Headache in Children and Self-Care at Home Migraine Headache in Children More Medical Treatment Migraine Headache in Children Follow-up and Prognosis Doctor's Notes on Migraine Headache in Children Symptoms Migraine triggers in children can include cheese, nuts, and sugar. are the most common acute and recurrent pattern experienced by children. These often incapacitating experiences are noteworthy for their sudden onset and accompanying symptoms of , , , and relief by . Doctors focus on ruling out other serious diseases or conditions when they first examine migraineurs (people who have migraines). Treatment consists of finding and avoiding trigger factors in the environment, giving immediate pain relief, and taking preventive drugs. Migraineurs may present with an array of various signs and symptoms. During a episode, patients often endure the sudden onset of a severe located around the eyes, in the forehead region, or in the temples. Some children experience vision changes or other sensory changes (""auras"") during or proceeding a . A sick feeling in the stomach or vomiting is common. Many children avoid bright lights, loud noises, or strong odors since these may amplify the pain of their headache. While various medications may be employed to treat a , the severe head pain is often completely relieved by deep . An inherited tendency is believed to make some people more likely to have a after some minor trigger, although no single theory explains how the produces all the symptoms of a typical migraine headache. Emotional or physical , the onset of an illness, and/or certain foods or liquids may trigger a migraine headache. One rare migraine presentation (familial hemiplegic migraine) has been shown to have specific gene mutations that predispose to the patient's symptoms. Although migraine have long been considered a (relatively harmless) condition, their symptoms may wreak havoc on a person's quality of life and ability to take part in normal life activities. Migraine pain is so intense that migraineurs often cannot think or function very well during or immediately following episodes. The symptoms of migraines interrupt normal activities in a majority of children who suffer from them. In one study of 970,000 self-reported migraineurs aged 6 to 18 years, 329,000 school days were lost per month. The sense of vulnerability of the sudden and unanticipated onset of migraine symptoms may cause emotional changes such as or sadness. Appropriate diagnosis and treatment of migraines can greatly improve quality of life for a person who suffers from migraine . Studies suggest that migraine headaches occur in 5% to 10% of school-aged children in the United States This frequency gradually increases through adolescence and peaks at about 44 years of age. Many people experience spontaneous remission, meaning that the headaches go away on their own for no clear reason. The age of onset of migraine headaches is earlier in boys than in girls. From infancy to 7 years of age, boys are affected equally or slightly more than girls. The prevalence of migraines increases during the adolescent and young adult years. After menarche (the time when the first occurs), a female predominance occurs. This continues to increase until middle age. The frequency of migraines declines in both sexes by 50 years of age. Most migraineurs begin to experience attacks before 20 years of age. Approximately 20% have their first attack before their fifth birthday. Preschool children experiencing a migraine attack usually look ill and have , vomiting, and a strong need to sleep. They may show pain by irritability, crying, rocking, or seeking a dark room in which to sleep. They usually fall asleep within an hour of the time the attack begins. The most common accompanying signs and symptoms include: Older children tend to present with headache on one side of their skull. The headache location and intensity often change during or between attacks. Research has shown that many ""sinus headaches"" are really of migrainous origin. As children grow older, headache intensity and duration increases, and migraines begin to happen at more regular intervals. Older children also describe a pulsating or throbbing characteristic to their headaches. Headaches often shift to the one-sided temple location that most adult migraineurs report. Childhood migraines often stop for a few years after . A headache may be a symptom of a benign (relatively harmless) condition, or it may be a life-threatening symptom. The patient's medical history and physical examination results are often enough to identify or rule out serious underlying problems or conditions. Testing (laboratory or imaging) is employed to support a suspected diagnosis. No specific laboratory or radiological test establishes the diagnosis of migraine headache. Doctors make the diagnosis through medical history, physical examination with emphasis on the neurological components, and clinical judgment. When considering a diagnosis of migraine headache, the doctor will ask about a child's medical history, previous tests, , and current and previous medications. Children will be asked to describe how the headache feels (for example, throbbing, pounding, squeezing, pressing, pulsating, aching, burning, stabbing, dull). They will also be asked about the headache's location, timing, severity, causal events (for example, , falling down), duration, and whether any relatives have migraine headaches. Other common historical evidence to support the diagnosis of migraine headache includes sensitivity to light and sound, tenderness in the (usually where the pain is most severe) and a strong desire to lie down and sleep. Conditions that cause severe headaches in children include both primary and secondary disorders. 16 Surprising Headache Triggers and Tips for Pain Relief The exact cause(s) of migraine headaches is unknown. Some migraines are thought to be due a temporary deficiency of the brain chemical . Many of the drugs effective in treating migraines target this chemical. Some migraineurs know that their headaches are triggered by something they eat, drink, or a particular activity. Chinese food (commonly containing MSG -- sodium glutamate), Migraines most likely have several trigger factors and multiple internal causes. Although many migraine disorders do not develop until middle age, early recognition of migraine risk factors may help a child adopt a healthy lifestyle. Primary headaches are conditions in which the headache is the medical condition and no underlying internal cause is present. Treatment is aimed at the specific headache disorder. Primary types include: The doctor must find out which type of headache a child has, because the best treatments are different for each category. Headaches that come back again and again are usually the result of primary disorders. Secondary headaches are a result of some underlying condition. When that condition is treated, the associated headache usually gets better or goes away. Secondary headaches can be caused by many conditions, from harmless to life-threatening. The following are examples of such conditions: (inflammation of the membranes of the brain or ) (inflammation of the mucous membrane of any sinus) Subarachnoid ( in the brain membranes) A physician evaluating a patient with headache must consider that a patient with a primary headache disorder may also have a secondary headache disorder. Both migraine headaches with aura (see below) and migraines without aura have a premonitory phase (a phase that precedes and forewarns), which may start up to 24 hours before the headache phase. During this prodrome phase many symptoms may develop. These include: food craving or (lack of appetite, distaste for food), These prodrome symptoms are often more evident in migraine without aura than in migraine with aura. Children with frequent migraine headaches or migraine variants often have a vague feeling that something is different in their world. They often learn to recognize these early signs but have trouble explaining or describing them to parents or health care practitioners. An aura is a focused symptom that happens right before a migraine headache or when one begins. An aura may occur without headache, or it may be more severe than the following migraine headache. Some children with migraine headaches experience auras; however, under- reporting may exist due to the inability of young patients to verbally explain their sensations. The aura usually occurs less than 30 minutes before the migraine headache and lasts for 5 to 20 minutes. Motor auras (those affecting a person's coordination) tend to last longer than other forms. Visual disturbances are the most common form of aura. Numbness and tingling of one side of the face and tingling of fingers on the same side are the second most common type of aura. Disorder of speech is a rare aura presentation. Complete recovery of aura symptoms should be expected. Children are often unable to recognize or describe their auras. Picture cards that show typical visual auras may help the doctor get an accurate history. Visual auras are often reported as moving or changing shapes and are the most common form in children. Micropsia (perception of objects as smaller than they are) Macropsia (perception of objects as larger than they are) Alice in Wonderland syndrome [the illusion of dreams, feelings of levitation (floating or rising), and altered sense of the passage of time] Aphasia (impaired or absent understanding or production of or communication by speech, writing, or signs) Ataxia (an inability to coordinate muscle activity during voluntary movement) (a sensation of spinning or twirling, implying a definite feeling of rotation) Paresthesia (an abnormal feeling of burning, pricking, tickling, tingling, etc) Hemiparesis (weakness affecting one side of the body) Aura symptoms can vary widely within and between attacks for the same individual. The actual headache phase of a migraine attack is usually shorter in children than in adults. Children's headaches can last 30 minutes to 48 hours but usually last less than 4 hours. Some children report short headaches lasting 10 to 20 minutes. The headache phase is often associated with the following: After the headache phase, the migraineur (person who has migraines) may feel elated and energized or, more typically, exhausted and lethargic (weary, tired) in the stage known as the postdrome. This stage of migraine may last from hours to days. This type of migraine, also known as , is characterized by a visual or other type of aura followed by a unilateral (one-sided), throbbing headache, which may later spread to both sides. It lasts from half an hour to 48 hours. Migraine with aura occurs in 15% to 40% of children who experience migraine headaches. The typical aura is manifested by various abnormalities of the visual, auditory, and/or sensory systems. These symptoms are progressive in intensity, usually last for about 1 hour, and resolve completely. Common migraines lack an aura. Migraine without aura in children is traditionally described as a recurring (happening over and over), bilateral (two-sided) headache disorder with a throbbing and/or pulsating pain quality, moderate-to-severe intensity, and severe stomach symptoms. Common accompanying symptoms in children are irritability and paleness with dark circles under the eyes. In younger children, the pain is more often on both sides and around the eyes and temples. Migraine without aura occurs in a majority of migrainous children. Persons with chronic migraine have headache attacks at least 15 days of every month for at least 2 months. Chronic migraine may affect up to 4% of teenage girls and 2% of teenage boys. This is a severe form of migraine headache in which the attack is continuous over 72 hours. People who have such an attack usually have a history of migraine. In those who vomit, rehydration (restoring adequate fluid levels) is often the necessary first step in treatment. These are classified as migraines because they often have the same triggers. They are brief, recurrent, episodic disorders that are made worse by physical activity and relieved by deep sleep or typical anti-migraine medications. Complicated and variant migraines cause some of the same symptoms as typical migraines, including pain, stomach problems, autonomic symptoms (for example, abnormal sweating, changes in pupil size), neurologic symptoms (for example, tingling, numbness, weakness), and changes in mood or emotion. These benign (relatively harmless) disorders are frightening because they often seem to be life-threatening emergency situations. Migraine equivalents are under-recognized and under-reported expressions of childhood migraine. They are often forerunners of the typical migraine, and complicated and variant migraines occasionally alternate with typical migraines. Listed below are examples of some of these variant migraine patterns. FHM is an uncommon form of migraine with aura. Persons with FHM have long-lasting hemiplegia (paralysis of one side of the body) along with numbness, aphasia, and confusion. The hemiplegia may come before (as part of the aura), accompany, or follow the headache, and symptoms may last for hours or as long as a week. FHM is very rare and may run in families (usually another first- or second-degree relative is affected in these cases). The headache is usually opposite from the paralyzed side. Some cases of FHM are associated with cerebellar ataxia [a loss of muscle coordination caused by disorders of the cerebellum (a part of the brain)]. People with other types of severe FHM may experience , fever, and meningismus [pain caused by irritation of the membrane layers (meninges) surrounding the brain and spinal cord]. Another type of FHM involves progressive ataxia, nystagmus (uncontrollable, rapid horizontal or vertical movement of the eyeballs), , and dysarthria (a speech disturbance due to emotional , to , or to paralysis, incoordination, or spasticity of the muscles used for speaking). A chromosomal marker has been demonstrated to be shared with patients who experience FHM. The significance of this observation is not fully understood. Basilar migraine (basilar artery migraine or Bickerstaff syndrome): Basilar migraine is a subtype of migraine with aura that is mostly observed in adolescent and young adult females. The headache pain is located in the back of the head. The headache must have at least two of the aural symptoms and signs listed below: Bilateral paresthesias (abnormal feeling of burning, pricking, tickling, tingling, etc., on both sides of the body) [noises (ringing, whistling, hissing, roaring, etc.) in the ear] Unilateral (one-sided) or bilateral (two-sided) vision loss A history of typical migraine exists in a majority of families studied. Many people experience basilar migraine attacks intermingled with typical migraine attacks. Some children with migraine will suffer from basilar migraine. The most common age of onset is 7 years of age. This form of migraine is associated with paralysis of the extraocular muscles (muscles which control eyeball movement) and is rare. People with this type of migraine experience severe one-sided headaches. Ophthalmoplegia (paralysis of one or more of the eye muscles) may precede, accompany, or follow the headache. This is an extremely rare migraine type during which there is a unilateral (one-sided) sudden loss of vision preceded by a sensation of bright lights. A migraine headache generally follows within 1 hour of the visual impairment and is commonly on the same side as the affected eye. Full vision recovery is expected, and it is rare to have any permanent loss or impairment of vision. This condition is probably not a true migrainous disorder. It is the most frequent cause of vertigo in childhood and is characterized by brief episodes of vertigo, disequilibrium (poor balance), and nausea. Episodes tend to be brief, have a sudden onset, and may occur in clusters for several hours and then spontaneously stop. Children with this problem are usually aged 2 to 6 years. Nystagmus may occur during but not between attacks. loss, , or loss of consciousness does not occur. Symptoms usually last only a few minutes. Parents observe that an attack is characterized by a sudden onset of fear, refusal to walk, or need to hold onto supporting structures for stability. They may have a sudden loss of alertness (""space out""). No headache occurs in benign paroxysmal vertigo. Children with benign paroxysmal vertigo often develop a more common form of true migraine as they mature. This type of migraine is characterized by short-lived episodes of amnesia (memory loss), confusion, agitation, lethargy, and dysphasia (speech difficulties) brought about by minor head . The child may have aphasia, and the confusional state may either precede or follow the headache. Some children also experience recurrent episodes of temporary amnesia and confusion. Recovery almost always occurs within 6 hours. One report points out that brain CT studies of those whose migraine is associated with head trauma are normal. The child may not have a history of headache but usually develops typical migraine attacks at some point in the future. Migraine-associated cyclic vomiting syndrome (periodic syndrome): This syndrome is characterized by recurrent periods of intense vomiting separated by symptom-free intervals. Many people with cyclic vomiting have regular or cyclic patterns of illness. Symptoms usually come on quickly at night or in the early morning and last 6 to 48 hours. Associated symptoms include abdominal pain, nausea, retching, anorexia, paleness, lethargy, photophobia, phonophobia, and headache. Headache often does not appear until the child is older. Migraine-associated cyclic vomiting syndrome usually begins when the person is a toddler and disappears in adolescence or early adulthood. (It rarely begins in adulthood.) This syndrome affects more females than males. Infections, psychological or physical stress, and dietary triggers are often clearly associated. Examples of triggers include cheese, chocolate, monosodium glutamate (MSG), emotional stress, excitement, or infections. Usually, a family history of migraines in the parents or siblings is present. Children with this condition often need intravenous fluids. The child may have recurrent bouts of generalized with nausea and vomiting. No headache is present. After several hours, the child can sleep and later awakens feeling better. Abdominal migraine may alternate with typical migraine and usually leads to typical migraine as the child matures. Probably not a true migrainous condition, paroxysmal torticollis is manifested as a sustained contraction or shortening of the neck muscles. This rare disorder is characterized by repeated episodes of head tilting and is associated with nausea, vomiting, and headache. Attacks usually occur in infants and may last from hours to days. A migraine is a result of neurological (nerve) dysfunction. More Headache Types and Associated Diseases and Conditions Acephalic migraine of childhood (migraine sine hemicrania): This condition is characterized by a (usually visual) without headache. Females are more likely than males to have this type of migraine. The syndrome is characterized by headache that is preceded by visual hallucinations or delusions, distortions of body image and abnormalities in the experience of time. Such experiences may wax and wane over several days to months, and children generally recover without residual problems. It is most commonly seen in the young school-aged child. Menstrual migraine occurs in close approximation to the onset of and will commonly last for 2 to 3 days. The cause of such migraine headaches has been postulated to be associated with the reduction of estrogen and levels that are associated with menses. No aura is appreciated with menstrual migraines. Women who suffer from menstrual migraines may also experience more traditional migraines (either with or without aura) at other times of their . Psychiatric diseases Many migraineurs report anxiety (excessive worrying) or sadness. Whether the headache or the mood or anxiety symptoms appear first is unclear. and migraine headaches often occur in the same person and may be related. About 70% of individuals with partial complex have migraines, but most people with migraines do not have . Migraineurs are more prone to than people without migraine. Intermittent vertigo is found in many of people with classic migraine and in some of those with common migraine. A higher degree of cardiovascular reactivity to postural changes (blood circulation responses to standing or sitting) has been shown in those with cyclic vomiting and migraine. Diarrhea is common in migraineurs and is sometimes severe enough to cause excessive fluid loss and . Migraines are associated with sleep disturbances, and (somnambulism) is found in some of migraineurs. An aversion (dislike) of striped patterns is found in many tested migraineurs. One study found that eating ice cream caused headache in 93% of migraineurs and was typically located at the usual site of migraine pain. When to Seek Medical Care, Questions to Ask the Doctor, and Diagnosis Parents should take children with severe headaches to see a doctor. The doctor will ensure that no life-threatening underlying condition is responsible. He or she will also provide a diagnosis, reassurance that no serious underlying illness is present, and a plan for effective pain treatment. Writing down specific questions before a medical appointment is a good idea. Parents should feel free to take notes and/or make an audio recording of the visit. The purpose of the first appointment is to find out what kind of headache the child has. If a diagnosis of migraine headache is confirmed, the doctor should spend time explaining exactly what that means for the child and for the parents or caregivers. Education is often the most important part of the visit. A review of potential trigger factors, how to treat the headache pain at the time of the attacks, and whether a preventive drug is needed are important issues that should be addressed. Doctors evaluate children who have headaches by performing a thorough general physical examination and a detailed neurologic examination (an examination of the brain and nerve functioning). All findings should be distinctly normal. Doctors perform or order appropriate additional evaluations and tests if the child has abnormal vital signs, nuchal rigidity (stiff neck), cranial nerve (nerves in the head) abnormalities, macrocephaly (an abnormally large head), bruits (abnormal body sounds), papilledema (swelling of the structures and tissues of the ), cutaneous lesions (skin changes), cognitive (thinking) changes, or asymmetric signs (for example, weakness on one side of the body). The doctor will order laboratory studies (lab tests) to rule out other causes for those people with headache that might have a non-migrainous reason for their headaches. Typically, imaging studies are unnecessary in children with a long-term (more than 6 months) history of headaches, normal neurologic examination results, and no seizures. An abnormal imaging result is very rare in a person meeting these criteria. The doctor will consider imaging studies in everyone with a history of seizures, recent , significant change in the character of the headache, focused brain/spinal cord/nerve deficits, or papilledema (swelling of the structures and tissues of the retina). A () will probably be performed if the doctor suspects (inflammation of the membranes of the brain and/or spinal cord), encephalitis (inflammation of the brain), subarachnoid hemorrhage (bleeding in the brain membranes), or certain other conditions. Migraine Headache in Children and Self-Care at Home There are a variety of treatments for migraine headaches in children including self-care measures and medications. Sleep is the best treatment for a migraine. Sleep restores normal brain function, relieves pain, and resolves many associated migraine symptoms. Doctor-prescribed or recommended pain-relieving drugs should be given to the child migraineur. Medical treatment of migraine headaches in children is based on the following: (1) education of children and parents or caregivers about , (2) creation of a plan of immediate treatment for the attacks, and (3) consideration of preventive medicines or measures for children with frequent migraines. The doctor should explain the disease to the child and the parents or caregivers. The treatment of children with mild, infrequent migraine attacks consists mainly of rest, trigger avoidance, and stress reduction. The doctor should also assure parents that the headache is not caused by a or other life-threatening condition. A regular bedtime, strict meal schedules, and not overloading the child with too many activities are important. Helping the child recognize migraine triggers is helpful but often difficult. Ridding migraine triggers reduces the frequency of headaches in some children but does not completely stop occurrences. A headache diary can be used to record triggers and features of attacks. Triggering factors that occur up to 12 hours prior to an attack should be noted. Other important factors to include are as follows: Bedtime, wake time, and quality of sleep prior to the attack Unfortunately, even the most diligent person cannot always identify specific migraine triggers. At the time of attack, parents or caregivers should have the child lie down in a cool, dark, quiet room to help him or her fall asleep. In spite of the development of many effective anti-migraine medications, sleep is the most powerful and best treatment. During a migrainous attack, a child can often be found resting in the fetal position with the affected side of the head down. Some children find that ice or pressure on the affected artery can reduce pain for a short time. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are effective if taken at a high but appropriate dose during the aura or early headache phase. Common over-the-counter (OTC) NSAIDs include (, Children's Advil/, etc.) and (, , , Naprelan). ( and others) may also be used for pain control. should not be used in children or adolescents. Digestion temporarily slows or stops during migraine attacks, delaying absorption of oral medications. Occasionally, carbonated may improve absorption. Other treatment methods, such as self-relaxation, biofeedback, and self-hypnosis, may be reasonable alternatives to drug therapies in childhood migraine, particularly in adolescents. Response rates in children tend to be higher than in adults and show continued effectiveness over time. The primary goals of preventive therapy are to prevent migraine attacks and to reduce the frequency and severity of attacks. Most preventive migraine medications have potential side effects, so only children with at least one to two attacks per week should take them. Parents and caregivers should have realistic expectations. While medications lessen the impact of migraines, they do not resolve the underlying causes and they will not completely eliminate all migraines. Half of all patients experience a 50% reduction in migraines (at most). Migraine Headache in Children More Medical Treatment An estimated 20% to 50% of migraineurs (people who have migraines) are sensitive to foods. These dietary triggers are thought to cause a change that provokes a migraine attack. Helping children learn to recognize and avoid these triggers is helpful but often difficult. The following are some common dietary triggers: Individuals with low levels of a substance called phenol sulfotransferase P are believed to be sensitive to dietary monoamines (a type of molecule) such as tyramine and phenylethylamine. Cultured dairy products (for example, aged cheese, sour cream, buttermilk), chocolate, and citrus fruits are believed to cause vasodilation (widening of the blood vessels) in certain people. Some migraines may be triggered by artificial sweeteners. Alcoholic beverages (especially red wine) and excess of or withdrawal from caffeinated such as coffee, tea, cocoa, or colas may trigger a migraine headache. Migraineurs should limit caffeinated sources to no more than two cups per day to prevent -withdrawal headaches. Caffeine can be found in chocolate-containing foods and candies; therefore, children with migraines should avoid them. These vasodilating agents are found in preserved meats. Examples of foods containing these chemicals include lunch meats, processed meats, smoked fish, sausage, pork and beans with bacon, sausage, salami, pastrami, liverwurst, hotdogs, ham, corned beef, corn , beef jerky, bratwurst, and bacon. MSG is a flavor enhancer and vasodilator found in many processed foods. Food labels should be checked carefully. MSG sources include Accent seasoning, bacon bits, baking mixtures, basted turkey, bouillon cubes, chips (potato, corn), croutons, dry-roasted peanuts, breaded foods, frozen dinners, gelatins, certain Asian foods and soy sauce, pot pies, relishes, salad dressing, soups, and yeast extract. Citrus fruits, avocados, bananas, raisins, and plums: These foods may be triggers. Although few individuals are sensitive to fruit, children with migraines should still eat a well-rounded, natural that includes fruits and vegetables and avoid processed foods. A headache diary may be helpful (a pattern often emerges after 6 to 8 weeks). Care must be taken to avoid creating an unnaturally limited diet that harms a child's growth and development. Both OTC and can trigger or worsen migraine headaches. (), estrogen (), histamine, (), (), (), (), and reserpine (Serpasil) are examples of medications that can increase migraine frequency. Excessive use of OTC and analgesics can cause occasional migraine attacks to convert to analgesic-abuse headaches or drug-induced headaches that do not respond to treatment. Children with migraines should avoid frequent or long-term use of NSAIDs, acetaminophen, triptans, or ergotamines. Migraineurs who have been treated for a long time with amphetamines (Biphetamine), phenothiazine (a type of antihistamine), or () should avoid sudden withdrawal from these medications because migraine headaches may result. In children who have an inborn tendency for migraine headaches, attacks can occur as a result of psychological (emotional), physiological (internal body processes), or environmental triggers. Physical exertion and travel or motion can be triggers. These include stress, anxiety, worry, , and sadness. Migraine headaches are not an imagined or psychological illness. Stress makes an underlying tendency for migraine more difficult to manage. The frequency of migraines can be reduced but not eliminated by maintaining a healthy lifestyle. These include fever or illness and not getting adequate food, rest, or sleep. Children with migraines should stick to a routine with regular meal times and adequate sleep. These include fluorescent light, bright light, flickering light, , barometric pressure changes, high altitude, strong odors, computer screens, or rapid temperature changes. Some migraineurs report that complex visual patterns like stripes, checks, or zigzag lines trigger their migraines. Activity can trigger childhood migraine. Some migraineurs report that they are more likely to get a headache after participating in sports or being extremely active. Minor head trauma (for example, being hit in the head with a ball, falling on one's head) may also result in a migraine attack. This may cause migraine, particularly in young children. If headaches cannot be reasonably controlled within 6 months, the child should see a pediatric neurologist (a physician specializing in the treatment of brain/nerve disorders). Children who suddenly develop new neurologic problems such as weakness, thinking difficulties, or seizures, should also see a pediatric neurologist. The drug treatments of migraine headache and associated symptoms can be divided into Analgesic and abortive therapies are for the treatment of occasional severe headache attacks and related symptoms. Analgesic and abortive medications should not be used frequently (that is, more than two times per week) because they may cause rebound headaches when children stop taking them. In general, the earlier in an attack the pain is treated, the less severe the pain becomes. The longer the wait before starting therapy, the more difficult the pain is to control. Established migraines are notoriously difficult to treat successfully. Digestion temporarily slows or stops during migraine attacks, delaying absorption of oral medications. In addition to drug therapy approaches, other approaches to reducing the severity of many childhood migraines include avoiding sensory stimulation (for example, bright lights, intense odors), applying ice packs, and resting in a quiet, dark room. Preventive medications are taken on a daily basis over a long period of time to reduce the frequency or severity of headaches and associated symptoms. None of the preventive medications are 100% effective in preventing all attacks. A good response to preventive medications is a 50% reduction in the frequency or severity of attacks. Children should not be given these drugs unless they have frequent (more than two per week), prolonged, and disabling migraine attacks that do not respond to other treatments. Often, several weeks are necessary before improvement is observed. Some child migraineurs must be kept on long-term preventive therapy, while others tolerate drug ""holidays,"" particularly during summer, when migraines are less frequent for many children. Occasionally, these drugs lose their effectiveness after initially helping the child. Using the same drug later is often not very effective. Different drugs work better for different people; therefore, several may have to be tried before finding the best drug for a particular child. Preventive drugs should be withdrawn slowly to avoid relapse and withdrawal symptoms. The following drugs are used to treat quickly stop migraine headaches in mid attack. They have little preventive value. The first group is the ""triptans,"" which specifically target serotonin. They are all chemically very similar, and their action is similar. The following drugs are also specific and affect serotonin levels, but they affect other brain chemicals as well. Occasionally, one of these drugs works when a triptan does not. ( Injection, Nasal Spray) acetaminophen-isometheptene-dichloralphenazone (Midrin) The following daily drugs have preventive value and are helpful to those who have more than two migraine headaches per week: Medications used to treat : Beta-blockers [propranolol (Inderal), calcium channel blockers [ (Covera)] : (Elavil), () Antiseizure medications: (), (), () Children with status migrainosus (a severe form of migraine headache in which the attack is continuous over 72 hours) can be treated in an emergency department or a doctor's office with intravenous or intramuscular medications. Migraine Headache in Children Follow-up and Prognosis Doctors sometimes cannot be absolutely certain that a child has migraines, or they may suspect that he or she has a headache condition caused by an underlying neurologic disease. Such children should have appropriate follow-up care, so that they can be observed over time. In children with an inborn tendency for migraine, minor head trauma may worsen the headaches, typically for a period of days to months. If this occurs, parents should make a follow-up appointment. A follow-up appointment is also needed if the headaches worsen, if they do not respond to medications, or if drug side effects are intolerable. Several medication trials are often necessary before adequate headache control is achieved. In one of the few long-term studies of migraine patients, a Scandinavian researcher named Bille observed 73 Swedish children with migraine. He followed these children for 40 years. On average, they started to have migraines at age 6 years. During puberty or young adulthood, 62% of the children were migraine-free for at least 2 years. About 33% started to have regular attacks again after an average of 6 migraine-free years, and a surprising 60% of the original 73 children still had migraines after 30 years. In 30 years, 22% of the children never had a migraine-free year.

Happy thanksgiving to those of you celebrating today!This is your chance to ask questions about progressive MS directly to international experts. We received a lot of questions in advance – thank you! Peer Baneke, our Chief Executive has just arrived back from Russia and has popped in to say hello. Thank you very much. Thank you all for the many suggestions you sent us for questions to answer. We’ve had questions about diet, about alternative medicine, about myelin repair and myelin protection, exercise and rehabilitation, about stem cells of course, and also about the search for a cure. Now, these are too many questions to tackle in one hour, in one webinar, so we’ll start off with progressive MS because that was the issue where most of you asked questions about. Thank you Peer. Now, over to your host for the webinar, Dr Dhia Chandraratna. Thank you Ceri. Hi, I’m Dr Dhia Chandraratna, Head of Research at the MS International Federation and I will be your host today. We are delighted to have with us two world renowned experts in MS, Professor Alan Thompson and Professor Olga Ciccarelli.Prof. Alan Thompson is the Chair of the International Medical and Scientific Board of MSIF and the Dean of the Faculty of Brain Sciences at University College London. Prof. Olga Ciccarelli is a Professor of Neurology at University College London and also one of our first ever Du Pre Grant recipients.Today they will be answering your questions on progressive MS. So let’s get started! Alan, as an introduction to the topic, can you tell us what is progressive MS?   Let me begin my saying a few words about multiple sclerosis itself and then moving along to the progressive form.  As many of you will know, MS is a condition which affects the brain, causes inflammation, damage to the myelin sheath, and damage to the nerve fibres themselves. It often affects young adults and it usually causes attacks or relapses that come and go over time. But then you also have the progressive form of MS and that basically is describing a gradual change over time, a gradual worsening of disability over time.There are two forms of progressive MS – primary progressive that occurs from the onset, right from the beginning people notice that they have some deterioration, usually in their walking which gets gradually and sometimes quite subtlety worse over time, and then there’s secondary progressive MS which occurs maybe five, ten or fifteen years after relapsing-remitting MS and again you notice this very gradual progression over time.Primary and secondary progressive MS probably constitute together up to 50-60 % of the MS population worldwide. Thank you Alan for a very clear introduction. We have some questions coming in now – from Karen in Canada and Joanne in the United States. The first is a question to Olga. They want to know why there are no treatments for progressive MS. What are the challenges in finding treatments for progressive MS? That’s correct. We don’t have available treatments to slow down progression in progressive MS and this is due to the fact that we don’t fully understand the mechanisms of progression. So there’s been a lot of research and there has been progress on understanding these mechanisms but until we understand fully why there is a neurodegeneration causing progression it is difficult to treat it.Also there is the challenge in identifying outcome measures to use in trials to measure the efficacy of treatment in performing large clinical trials with suitable medications. There are a lot of challenges but this has been tackled in recent years and hopefully we will have some good news soon.  Thank you Olga. The next question is from Jan Zantingh in Lebanon and Linda Doubleday in New Zealand. They would like to know – this is a question to Alan – why isn’t more research being done on progressive MS?  I begin by saying I agree completely with Olga that this is a more complicated form of multiple sclerosis and one which we don’t understand as well as the relapsing-remitting form. But actually there is quite a lot of research going on in the world. I think the last estimate, when we looked worldwide at all the research that is being supported, was up to $90 million spent on research into progressive MS.But there are a couple of points to make about this. I think it’s not very joined up so there’s research going on in different parts of the world independently and of course the key thing is that none of this research has got over the bar and resulted in a treatment. Until we have a treatment people feel there’s not a lot going on.  There is a lot going on but there is a real potential to bring all this research together, to focus it more and to be more strategic in how we approach it. And that’s really why the Progressive MS Alliance was established. Thank you. And just following on from that we have a question from Kevin Kelly in Ireland and Kate Cherry from Australia. They would like to know what is the Progressive MS Alliance and what are they trying to achieve. I have given an introduction to this already. The whole idea of the Progressive MS Alliance is to bring all of the research across the world together to try to tackle this very difficult issue. When you’ve got something that’s very challenging you need collaboration to try to understand it and then to treat it. The Alliance is about bringing together as many people as possible with expertise in the area to tackle the problems or the issues that are blocking or slowing treatments for progressive MS. Olga mentioned some of those and they are around having good models of the disease, understanding what is happening inside the tissue of people with progressive MS, identifying targets for treatment, having trials both early and then larger more definitive trials, having outcome measures that we could use in those trials and then the hugely important area of symptomatic treatment and rehabilitation. So the Alliance is trying to drive this area forward. It is an alliance of MS societies around the world brought together by the MS International Federation and its focus is upon treatment for progressive MS. Thank you. And just following on from that a question for Olga from Non Smit in South Africa and Sue Morris from the UK. Alan just talked about some of the areas that the Alliance is trying to focus on. Can you tell us what are the most promising areas of research in progressive MS? The most promising is trying to define a treatment that slows down progression in MS and I think this can be done by researching the mechanisms of the disease. This is achievable by studying people with MS with a clinical assessment or an imaging assessment and trying to understand what is contributing to clinical progression. Then an important area of research is evaluating outcomes which we can use in clinical trials to identify whether people are having a good response to the treatment to understand whether the treatment is effective for MS or not. And then there is important research trying to identify and measure for prognosis, so we want to know and be able to tell a person with MS whether it is likely to progress faster in a shorter period of time or perhaps slower is a long period of time. We want to give answers to individuals about their future, about what’s going to happen in the following years – something that makes a difference for individuals. And then obviously there is the area of treatment trials, trying to bring together difference centres, different expertise worldwide, to perform these very challenging clinical trials to test the efficacy of the medication. We know there has also been a lot of interest in other research areas and if we can raise the funds we would love to put on other webinars in the future. So, if you can make a gift, please use the simple form at the bottom of the page. Let’s go back to our questions. The next question is to Alan from Dan Favotto from Australia and Karim Daya from Canada, and they would like to know, what are the best available treatments currently for progressive MS? well, I make two points to begin with. The first is that we don’t have a specific treatment for progressive MS as Olga has mentioned earlier. But the second is that all forms of MS need a very active management plan. That is the same for relapsing remitting as it is for progressive MS. So health is really important, keeping yourself well is very important. Looking after yourself, a good diet, exercise, also very important. In progressive MS, you get a number of symptoms; difficulty with mobility, with bladder, with tremor, and all of these need to be treated symptomatically, and that’s crucially important. Of course rehabilitation is also key. It brings together all the symptomatic management, but also improves quality of life for people with progressive MS. So having progressive MS isn’t about not having active management. That is absolutely critical. In fact arguably, it is more important to be actively managing your condition when you have progressive MS, than with relapsing remitting MS. Thank you. The next question is to Olga and it’s from Bergthora Bergsdottir from Iceland and Gillian Hirsch from Israel, and their question is: ‘are there new treatments on the horizon for progressive MS?’ Yes, definitely there are new treatments undergoing clinical trials, so they are already being tested in phase II or phase III clinical trials. Others are more experimental, so perhaps further away from clinical trials. These are treatments that are trying to target neuroprotection, so trying to protect the tissue from further damage, and then you must have heard of treatments that are trying to repair what has been damaged. I think these are the two main streams, either protect the central nervous system, the cells from further neurodegeneration or trying to improve the conduction along the nerves, trying to restore some of the function, so repair what has been lost. There are medications, completely new medications being discovered, but also some older medications that are now going to be tested in progressive MS to see whether they can have an effect. So I think as Alan said there is a lot going on, and we expect, we hope, to have something available in the near future. Great! The next question is on stem cells for Alan and it is from Vladislava Vassitskina from Estonia and Christian Oleson from Denmark and Teresa de Marcos from Spain. And they would all like to know: is there hope for stem cells as a treatment for progressive MS? So again, I will begin by saying that stem cells are a topic that has been discussed now over a number of years, and it’s one that there’s always been great hope for, but it’s taking quite a long time to realise that hope. So where are we at the moment? I think we’ve had a number of small studies looking at different forms of stem cells. There are many different kinds, and insofar as those small studies can be evaluated, they do show some encouraging evidence, but none of them are absolutely clear in their outcome. And what we need with stem cells is larger trials, or bringing together the small trials to get a definitive answer. So this perhaps is rather a long winded way of saying that yes there is potential and there is hope. Stem cells suppress inflammation, but they also encourage repair or remyelination. So you’ve got two actions that could be very useful in multiple sclerosis.  So there is hope, it is a difficult area to do definitive studies, but they are ongoing at the moment and they are developing very well. So I think it’s a question of watching this space. But we need proper trials and we need to make sure that if people want to get involved with stem cells they do so through proper trials and not in any other way. The next question is to Olga and it’s from Jeyachitra Alagar from India and Rebecca Anderson from the USA and Judy Slater from the UK. The question is: what is the role of rehabilitation and exercise in managing progressive MS? As Alan mentioned before, rehabilitation is essential in the management of progressive MS and has to focus on the person with progressive MS. So it is not something that can be advised to [EDIT: a wide audience], it has to be for a very specific case. It is important to improve mobility of the person, to improve exercise tolerance, help to maintain cognitive function, help to keep people in employment or help people to come back to employment if they want to. It is important to manage the person with MS in general to improve the quality of life, to reduce impact of symptoms, so we include obviously symptomatic treatments. But exercise – everyone should do it, I know I should, Alan probably and everyone here should do exercise! So I always say this is not something exclusively for progressive MS, it is good to have it as part of a daily routine for everyone, but in particular for people with progressive MS it is essential to keep mobility, to keep a general wellbeing to improve quality of life. Thank you Olga. We have a question now from Drew Heap and Debra Tiegren in the USA, Brian Lee from Australia and also Monica Silva from Canada. And their question to Alan is: ‘is there any research on myelin repair and neuroprotection? What are the advances in that area? Well the straightforward answer to that question is yes. There is a lot of research in myelin repair and in neuroprotection. When you’re dealing with progression, which of course is about loss of axons, loss of tissue, then protecting the brain or repairing the brain are two really critical areas to try and develop. But they are complex and challenging. We talked a bit about stem cells earlier, which of course is one of the approaches to myelin repair and there has been some progress in that area. And Olga mentioned neuroprotection which is not something we want to do just for progressive MS but for a whole range of neurological conditions, there’s also been quite a lot of activity. There is a lot going on here in the UK, some going on in the States and in other countries globally. There are studies now in progress which are looking at a number of drugs which we are using for other conditions but which actually have a neuroprotective component to them, and they are happening now; the MS SMART trial in the UK, SPRINT MS in the States. We are focusing on this area and as I say, it is challenging. But through the Progressive MS Alliance we would be hoping to have far more studies in this area, and in a finite period of time, to have treatments. Great. We have a question now from John Davis sent to us by email, and the question is how do we know if drugs are having an effect on progressive MS, we don’t know how our progression would have progressed without the drug, so how do you measure efficacy? Who’s going to take that? This is a very good question. We always get this question. So how do I know whether a drug is effective for me or not, since I don’t have myself without the medication? But if a medication is licensed and is available for prescription, it’s a medication that has been tested in clinical trials against a placebo, which is a tablet without a chemical effect. So we assume that it is an effective medication. Whether it is helping that specific person then is really down to discussion with the individual whether he or she has noticed any change over time. Has she noticed that the course of the disease? Whether progression has stabilised or maybe has improved with the medication? So it’s really coming from discussion and communication with their own doctor. I will just add to that, that it is very difficult as an individual to know whether a medication is having an effect so that is why clinical trials are so critical. You can’t tell from an individual experience. In clinical trials we’re not just looking at what’s happening to the person with MS, we’re also looking at things like their MRI scans and there we can see the rate of tissue loss and if that is actually being slowed. I think that with a person with MS you can get a sense over a period of time, perhaps 6 or 12 months or even longer, whether that gradual change has now plateaued or maybe even improved. I think it is difficult but not impossible to detect that kind of change. Thank you, we have a question coming in now from Twitter from David Seffer, who asks, “Interferons have completely stopped my relapses. Should I continue to take them when I have evolved progressive MS?” It’s a good question and one which comes up in clinic a lot. We know that the main effect of interferons is to reduce relapses and if it’s working well then you’re not having relapses. There’s a difficult question as to whether you’re no longer having relapses but you think you may be getting very subtly and very gradually worse; and is that progressive MS? And should you stop your medication? And if you do stop your medication are you likely to have attacks? It’s not a very straightforward question. MS Is a very individual condition and I think it’s very important that every patient discusses their condition with their own neurologist to decide what is best for them. Sometimes it can be quite difficult. We sometimes have this tendency to stop taking medication when it’s being effective, so that’s something we should avoid doing. The next question is also coming from Twitter, “Does MS progress faster in men than in women?” That’s a good question. There is some evidence that men with secondary progressive MS progress faster than women with secondary progressive MS. There is also possibly more cognitive impairment than women. In primary progressive MS the difference between the two genders is less clear. I think that in general the differences are more at the individual level than an effect of gender but it is definitely worth discussing. This next question has been asked by many people on email and twitter, asking how they can get on clinical trials? There are a number of different ways. Firstly, they will be attending their own hospital and their own neurologist and I anticipate the MS team there will know about what trials are going on. They can discuss them with the person with MS and discuss what the inclusion criteria are. Of course you can go on the web and you can look at websites. MS International Federation has a very good website. There are also the MS societies and many will flag up the trials that are going on. Some trials have their own websites so you can see what’s happening directly. It can be a little confusing and I think that the first step should always be your local MS team. The next question from Twitter is from David Seffer, “Is there a way to definitely tell when one has passed from relapsing remitting MS to progressive MS?” There is no way to tell you now definitely have progressive MS, it is something which happens more retrospectively. During clinical assessment we tend to discuss how MS is evolving. When a person reports progression of symptoms in the absence of clear episodes of relapses, so there is evidence that neurological evidence is accumulating despite the fact there are no acute episodes, then this may have become progressive MS. But what happens is that after a certain period of time you come back and you say, ‘well this has been now two years or three years that I’ve been progressing without acute relapses’. There is the difficulty that it cannot be [assessed] over one day or one month, it is something which is identified over a longer period of time. It comes out through discussion with your doctor because we do not have a single test which says, ‘you now have progressive MS’. The next email has come in from Loretta, who talks about the similarities between Alzheimer’s and multiple sclerosis. She wonders whether it is worth studying the similarities between the two conditions? This is a very important question because we often look at these conditions in isolation and there is a lot to be learnt by looking across neurological disorders. I think particularly for progressive MS where we know there is tissue damage, tissue loss and neurodegeneration that makes it more similar to certain other conditions like Alzheimer’s or motor neurone disease. It’s looking at the basic mechanisms which underpin or underlie that neurodegeneration that is important. So that is why it is important to look across these different conditions and the literature, because these conditions are very challenging. Nobody understands all aspects of any neurodegenerative condition. If we can get some clues from one which we can then apply to another then that is very useful. So a very good question, particularly for progressive MS. This one has just come in by email and it asks, is the Progressive MS Alliance focusing on the immune and autoimmune factors? The Alliance is focusing on all mechanisms that could result in progression so the immune system plays a big part. Both parts of the immune system. The innate immune system is perhaps less studied so is becoming more of a focus for research. The immune system is being studied and particularly the relationship of the immune system to demyelination and neurodegeneration and how all of these things link up. If you impact on one what effect will that have on the others? So those relationships are key and the immune system is absolutely central to that. A very good question. Another question has come in via email, from Anne. She would like to know more about nutritional approaches and any particular diets and if there is any benefit on progressive MS? We do not have any evidence that a specific diet helps to slow down or stop progression in progressive MS. I get this question all the time in clinic, ‘should I go on this diet or that diet…’. My personal advice is that people are free to try whatever diet they like as long as people don’t expect to see huge improvements from that specific diet. I know that online you can see reports from people who have shown incredible improvements from diets. I think that some of the diets are also quite challenging. If it is a very strict diet it’s difficult to follow; it is also sometimes quite difficult for the whole family because you have four or five different meals with different preparation, then it becomes an obsession, then you feel guilty when you don’t follow the diet. So in general it’s a bit like exercise, everyone should follow a healthy lifestyle doing exercise and eating a healthy diet. But we cannot recommend any specific diet because we do not have the evidence to do so. We have a question from Kholoud in Saudi Arabia, asking if there is a role for Alemtuzumab in treating progressive MS? The main evidence at the moment is that Alemtuzumab has a very strong effect on relapses and often results in no attacks. Patients often find that they are improving both in terms of not having attacks but in terms of their mobility so they see changes. A specific effect on progressive MS has not been demonstrated and that’s much more difficult. Whether or not – and this is another quite challenging question – whether or not suppressing relapses and inflammation in the earlier part of MS has an impact on the progression that might follow is a very difficult question which has not yet been answered. The relationship, if you like, between that early inflammatory phase and the progressive phase. When we look at scans of people with MS and we look right from the beginning, what we see is that although they have a lot of lesions on their scans when they have relapses they also have a gradual loss of tissue right from the very beginning of their MS. So there is a very subtle neurodegenerative part right from the beginning. It may well be that that continues and may not necessarily be affected by suppressing the inflammation. It’s difficult to say and again it’s back to this relationship between inflammation and neurodegeneration. Does one cause the other, or is one a reaction to the other? That is still a very fundamental question which we are yet to get a very clear answer on. There’s another question actually, related to that, coming from twitter and this is about brain atrophy and it’s about MS and the relationship with brain atrophy in the longer term and they’ve also asked if you can explain brain atrophy for a lay audience. Ok so it’s a good question. Brain atrophy you can see over time as reduced volume of the brain. So everyone, over time, develops some volume loss everyone sitting here, we’re all losing some neurons. But it has been recognised that the people with MS have a faster loss of brain volume over time. But as you know as part of aging there is also some development of brain atrophy. The surviving tissue adapts to the loss of volume and it creates connections to continue functioning in a sufficiently acceptable way. So although there is brain atrophy there is also some plasticity of the brain for which  neurological  functions are maintained, cognitive functions are maintained. What happens in progressive MS is that the development of brain atrophy becomes more significant. This is why it is used as an outcome measure in clinical trials. What we want to see is a treatment that slows down or has an effect on reducing the development of volume loss. So it’s actual loss of tissue over time and it’s more loss of tissue than you would see with normal aging which is what we’re all doing! We’ve got another question coming from twitter from Nick who wants to know: How critical is basic physiological research to finding a cure and how does this translate to the  clinic? I think that basic physiological research is really important because we do know that in MS normal physiological processes are affected. There is involvement of what we call the autonomic nervous system which has an effect on these physiological mechanisms. We also know – and this is back to the exercise literature – that over time people tend to do less and as a result they do even less so you become deconditioned. So actually physiological wellbeing, particularly around cardiovascular respiratory, is really important. Whether that tells us more about the underlying mechanisms about MS I’m not so sure. I think it’s very important for the person with MS and very important to manage and understand but perhaps not fundamental to the actual finding of a treatment for progressive MS. We’ve got another question from Sally Beck via twitter. There’s sort of two questions but she’s linked them. What are your thoughts on CCSVI and any recent trials using statins? They both increase the blood flow. I think it’s fair to say that we have no evidence of any effect by CCSVI on the brain or on progression in MS. I’m aware of people who have had CCSVI either as part of clinical trials – especially in the States – or as private treatment and I come from a country where CCSVI has been used a lot and still currently used but it is not something we can recommend because there is no evidence that it is effective. Well I think in relation to CCSVI I think that when the initial positive reports came out in the literature there was a lot of excitement about it. There was a huge response from people with MS to look at this exciting area and as a result the MS societies funded a lot of research to look at the underlying mechanism of CCSVI, which is really about dilating veins. [There were] also much more detailed studies of the effect on people with MS and that was a useful exercise because we now have  a very large database. [This] research base really shows  little or no effect on underlying mechanisms  and little or no treatment effect but it is based on really sound evidence. That’s all we have to approach any of these potential new treatments because you can never be sure until you have done that really hard research approach. I wanted to add that I know people who had CCSVI treatment and they felt better and I always get this question in clinic. ‘Well you say the clinical trials show no evidence of this treatment but in fact I had it and I feel better and I had it and I feel the same or I had it and I feel worse.’ You come back to the question we had earlier on, how do I know that the treatment is effective for myself?  We are talking about treatments being tested in large clinical trials. Very sound research but then obviously an individual person may feel that it has an effect but on a chemical level and on a clinical trials level that effect hasn’t been observed. If that makes clear? So can I now go on and talk about the statins? I think statins are really very interesting. I mean they are obviously an incredibly useful group of drugs which help many people with a whole range of different conditions. They have been looked at in relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis and there have been several trials and they’ve been mainly negative but there has been recently a trial in progressive MS which was published in The Lancet which demonstrated an effect both on the measure of brain atrophy but also on the patient’s own level of mobility or disability. That’s the statin trial which looked at 80 milligrams of simvastatin, [which] has been positive. It was a relatively small phase  2 trial so we now really need to go on to do a major phase 3 trial. So that’s an ideal study to be done internationally involving many of the MS societies and also perhaps the Progressive MS Alliance. I think statins are very interesting and it’s interesting that they seem to work in progressive MS but not in relapsing remitting MS which gives you some indication of what the mechanism might be. There’s a question from Dorothy in California. In order to cure MS do you have to destroy and rebuild the immune system? Quite challenging. I don’t think so. I don’t think you have to destroy and rebuild the immune system, no. The approach so far has been to try to modulate it. Try to improve the response in a way that is the correct immune response but destroying and rebuilding may be a bit extreme. I don’t think that’s the approach we are doing so far, no. We can remember that in MS we have an altered immune system, most of it functions very well, in fact some of it might over function, so actually it’s much more as Olga said, we use the word ‘modulate’ to try and influence the immune system so that it functions more normally. That’s not about rebuilding. Thank you.  Alessandro in Italy wants to know more about any functional MRI studies in relation to progressive MS and also in particular in relation to spinal cord studies. Alessandro, it’s a very good question. As you know, scanning the spinal cord with MRI is very challenging, for several reasons. It’s a very small structure so it’s very difficult to image. But definitely there’s been study with functional MRI and there will be more studies in the future. The question is to try to overcome the challenges and design a study which can give some important understanding of the mechanism of the disease. But definitely there are functional MRI studies of the spinal cord in MS and more I think are due to come. I think it’s  probably also important to make the  point that when we say ‘functional MRI’ what we’re talking  about is using imaging to actually,  as it says, see how the brain functions when it is doing tasks so you have an idea of the working brain. It’s not just taking static pictures of the brain.  You’re looking at what the brain is actually doing as we are doing things or thinking or acting so it gives you a real insight into how the brain is changing over time and therefore how the effect multiple sclerosis can have on the brain itself. It’s also very useful in looking at things like rehabilitation to see how you might be able to address some of the problems with brain function and improve it so it’s a very powerful tool. It’s quite a complex tool but one with lots of potential for the future. Thank you. We’ve just received a question form Paul via twitter.  He says ‘After sexual intercourse I find my symptoms clear for a short while, is there a medical reason why?’ I can’t think of any medical reason why this is happening and no, I don’t think we have an answer for this. OK. Rachel, via email, just wants to know a little more about the clinical trials process. For example what does phase 1, phase 2, phase 3 mean? So that’s a really very good question and I think it prompts us to just to talk a little bit about how you get from identifying a potential treatment to  licensing a drug and this is a long journey if it’s a new drug which can take anything up to ten or twelve years. If you think that you’ve found something in the laboratory which might actually have an effect in the central nervous system, which will in turn have a useful effect in MS, the first thing you have to do is to do some further studies involving animals to actually see if there is any danger to this agent. The next is then doing small safety study in small groups of people that don’t have any condition, that don’t have MS and then you move on to studies that will involve people with MS. Again small studies which will be looking at side effects and at safety. And that would be first-in-man trials or phase 1 studies. You then go on to do phase 2 study which is larger and is actually looking at efficacy. Is this drug useful? But it may not be looking at a clinical measure, it may be using imaging or some protein in the blood or in the spinal  fluid to see if there’s a really clear beneficial effect from this agent. If that’s true you’ll then move on to what we call a phase 3  trial which is the large, definitive, clinical study which will be the kind of study to move on to the drug being licenced and used as a treatment in the population. Quite a lengthy process. Now, if you have drugs ‘off the shelf’ that are already being used for another conditions, and this has certainly been the case for some of the drugs we have been looking at in progressive MS, then of course you can move quite quickly to a phase 2 or phase 3 trial without any of the earlier work and that’s why repurposing of these agents is a very, a short cut to potential and new treatments for multiple sclerosis. Are there any promising agents around that have been looked at in repurposing trials. Well there are. The statins which we talked about earlier are a really good example of a repurposing agent. So we know they lower cholesterol, we know they reduce risk factors and now we have a sense, an indication that they may be useful in progressive MS but now we need a phase three trial. I think when we go back to neuroprotection a number of the drugs which we know to be neuroprotective are drugs which are used in epilepsy. There are many I could mention and these are the drugs we are now looking at in MS. Phenytoin is an agent which has been around for many years in epilepsy. We are looking at this in optic neuritis to get a sense of whether or not it could have a neuroprotective effect. Lamotrigine is another and there’s a whole range of existing agents so repurposing is very important. Thank you, we have a question from Cindy in London by email and she wants to know if there is any effectiveness of oxygen treatments in progressive MS? Yes, oxygen therapy has been studied and some people are using it. Some people report improvements in their energy level. I don’t think that the evidence of the effect in the mechanisms of progression is there already so this is not something that is recommended as a first line treatment for MS. I think I probably emphasise the fact that there is not a sound evidence base to support what we call hyperbaric treatment in MS. It came about as a treatment when I was starting in MS nearly 30 years ago and there is not a sound evidence base so I would not be enthusiastic about exploring it. We have a question from Martin via Twitter. He asks “Is Fingolimod as dangerous as the sources I have read on the internet claim?” Fingolimod, as with any other treatment we use – not just in neurology, in any medical speciality – has a list of side effects. So this is why every time it is prescribed for a person with MS we have to balance the benefits with the side effects. The person has to be informed about the possible risks but also see what it is useful to try this medication to improve for example the relapse rate. It is true it is associated with side effects but I think that any medication has side effects. Even aspirin! I always say to my patients, if you ever read the list of aspirin you wouldn’t take that. Everything comes with benefits and side effects. And I think that is an important point. All the time you are looking at the benefit and the risk. There is a risk benefit analysis. It tends to be the case that as the treatments become more effective they are stronger and they often have stronger side effects. Of course that is why we wouldn’t use very strong drugs with very strong side effects in somebody with very mild MS. You would certainly think about using it with someone who has very active MS, and this is the balance of the discussion you would have with someone all the time with the person with MS and make a decision with them. And in case of aggressive treatment or treatment with the worst safety profile then you keep engaged with the medical team, the MS specialist and come back for regular follow up and blood test. There is follow up, you don’t only give them medication and then not see the person anymore. You continue to monitor the effect and possible side effects of the drug. We’ve got through a lot of questions and thank you for answering so many of them. But unfortunately we’re running out of time so I’m just going to ask one final question to Alan: If I was recently told I had progressive MS, what would the future look like for me? I think if you were told you had progressive MS the first point is that you would look after yourself well. It doesn’t change anything. You look after yourself, you have to actively manage your condition as you would any other form of MS. I think you would keep really abreast of research activity as that whole area has exploded and it’s incredibly exciting. I think particularly to link in with the activities of the Progressive MS Alliance. You may even consider becoming involved in a clinical trial, which would be an excellent thing to do. And you would anticipate a treatment for progressive MS in a finite period of time. I think it is positive, very positive. And much more positive now than even five years ago. Now I’d like to pass over to Olga who will talk about how MS International Federation has supported her in her career. Yes so I’m very grateful to the MSIF because when I finished my training in neurology I was awarded a Du Pre grant from the MSIF, this was in 2000, not sure I had to disclose the year! So this allowed me to come to the UK to work with Alan and Professor Miller and learn more about MS. At that time we did not have [many] treatments available for MS so a lot has changed really in 14 years. This is an excellent organisation that has provided funding for young researchers to move abroad and have experience of how things work in other countries, in this case UK. To develop a passion for MS, improve their research skills and clinical skills. So yes, a big thank you to the MSIF. I think if you enjoy this webinar what we want to ask you is to make a donation to the MSIF, in order for this kind of activity to be repeated in the future. Also send your feedback if you want to make changes for the future, this has to be interactive process. But we also need donation to give grants that allow young researchers to come to UK [and] but also other locations to improve understanding and discovering treatments for MS. So I got the figure of about $40,000 dollars, that’s about €50,000 to support five young researchers to get out of their own countries, come to the UK [and other countries], learn more about MS, learn about symptomatic treatment, learn more about the challenging medications. Then go back to their own countries to share this knowledge with their teams. So this is why we need your help. , whatever you like. Even $1 or €1 will be helpful to help the MSIF to help them fund more research into MS and with the purpose of today, into progressive MS. Thank you. It just remains for me to thank our wonderful world renowned experts, Professor Thompson and Professor Ciccarelli and our wonderful host Dhia for answering so many of your questions. Thank you for spending some time with us and sending in your questions. Good bye and see you next time.

2098dd21-a88a-4c70-a492-b8d41dc0ac32,"What’s New in MS Research: Highlights from the 2018 ECTRIMS Annual Meeting What’s New in MS Research: Highlights from the 2018 ECTRIMS Annual Meeting For more than three decades, multiple sclerosis (MS) experts from around the world have gathered in a European city each fall to share the results of their research at the annual meeting of the European Committee for Treatment and Research in Multiple Sclerosis (ECTRIMS). This year’s gathering was held in Berlin, Germany, October 10-12, where the findings were presented from hundreds of studies on topics ranging from the safety and effectiveness of investigational medications to the role of diet in controlling symptoms of MS. Along with the annual meetings of organizations such as the American Academy of Neurology (AAN), the Americas Committee for Treatment and Research in Multiple Sclerosis (ACTRIMS), and the Consortium of Multiple Sclerosis Centers (CMSC), the ECTRIMS meeting is an important forum for researchers and clinicians to compare notes, generate hypotheses, make plans for future research, and discuss how best to translate study findings into improved patient care. This ECTRIMS 2018 research update article highlights more than 30 studies with important implications for people with MS. While these studies represent only a small sampling of the research presented at ECTRIMS, they were selected for their relevance to the current and potential near-term management of MS, and with a view toward addressing a variety of topics. Accordingly, the study findings reported below are organized into eight categories: We hope this information will be of interest and value. For additional information about MS, symptoms, and symptom management, as well as MSAA’s programs and services, please visit or call . Questions for MSAA’s Client Services department may be emailed to . And as always, please note that your healthcare provider remains your best source of information on the medical and overall management of your MS, and should be consulted with any questions you may have or before making any changes to a treatment regimen or other aspects of your approach to living with MS. For readers who are not familiar with study protocol, to follow is a helpful listing that provides a brief explanation of the different clinical trial phases. Phase I studies are primarily concerned with assessing the drug’s safety. This initial phase of testing in humans is done in a small number of healthy volunteers, and is designed to determine what happens to the drug in the human body – how it is absorbed, metabolized, and excreted. Once a drug has been shown to be safe, it must be tested for efficacy. This second phase of testing may last from several months to two years, and involve up to several hundred patients. Phase II studies are often “double-blinded,” meaning that the participants, medical staff, and investigators are not told who is receiving the drug and who is receiving the placebo. In a Phase III study, a drug is usually tested in several hundred to several thousand patients, usually in multiple medical facilities around the world. Phase III studies typically last two or more years. Only after a Phase III study is successfully completed can a pharmaceutical company request FDA approval for marketing the drug. Phase IV clinical trials are conducted after a drug has been approved. Participants are enrolled to further monitor safety and side effects, while evaluating long-term efficacy. Ongoing decline in relapse rate seen in long-term study of Gilenya People with relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) who took Gilenya (fingolimod) for five years or more had low rates of disease activity during that period, with gradually decreasing relapse rates, researchers reported. The investigators drew on data from LONGTERMS, an open-label, single-arm, extension study assessing the ongoing safety, tolerability, and efficacy of 0.5 mg of Gilenya in RRMS patients who had participated in earlier clinical trials of the disease-modifying therapy (DMT). The LONGTERMS study evaluated 754 patients. Sixty-seven percent of study subjects were women, and the mean time since MS diagnosis was 4.8 years. The annualized relapse rate in the population declined from 0.26 at one year to 0.16 at five years and to 0.14 for those patients for whom data were available at the 10-year mark. Of the 697 patients for whom five-year data was available, 78 percent were free from confirmed disability progression in the six months prior to assessment. The most common adverse events reported were viral upper respiratory tract infections, headache, and hypertension. The most common serious adverse events were MS relapse, basal cell carcinoma, and pneumonia.  Charting rise in treatment-satisfaction scores with switch to Aubagio Patients switching to Aubagio (teriflunomide) from other disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) showed improvements in treatment satisfaction up to 96 weeks after switching, researchers reported. Investigators drew on data from the Phase III TENERE study extension and the non-interventional TAURUS-MS I study. Both studies employed the Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire for Medication (TSQM), which was administered at baseline and every 24 weeks thereafter in the TENERE extension study, and at baseline and at weeks 12, 24, 48, 72, and 96 in TAURUS-MS I. More than 650 patients from the two studies switched to 14 mg/day of Aubagio after having been on other DMTs. From baseline (initiation of Aubagio) to week 96, Global Satisfaction scores increased for patients from both studies. The average change from baseline was 9.1 in TENERE and 15.3 in TAURUS-MS I, with both changes being statistically significant. Tecfidera altered composition of gut microbiome in 12-week study  Tecfidera (delayed-release dimethyl fumarate) altered the gut microbiome in relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) patients who took the oral disease-modifying therapy (DMT) over 12 weeks. The gut microbiome – the milieu of bacteria and other microbes found in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract – is a major component of the body’s immune system. Recent research suggests that the composition of the microbiome, as defined by the presence and number of various microbes, may affect the course of MS. In a study involving 36 patients with RRMS, 17 types of microbes were significantly altered in MS patients compared with 165 healthy controls. In particular, people with MS had lower levels of compared to the healthy controls. Twenty-seven of the study participants received Tecfidera, while nine received an injectable DMT. At two weeks, subjects receiving Tecfidera reported a worsening of GI symptoms compared to baseline, but this impact on symptoms was not seen at 12 weeks. Meanwhile, at 12 weeks, the Tecfidera patients had an increased abundance of . Similar alterations were not seen in the participants receiving an injectable DMT. Researchers continue to investigate not only the role of the gut microbiome in MS, but also the impact that individual microbes may have on disease course. As those investigations continue, this study adds to the understanding of the interplay between MS medications and the composition of the microbiome. As the investigators note, “It could therefore be speculated that direct effects on the gut microbiome are part of the therapeutic actions” of Tecfidera. Exploring treatment outcomes in African Americans relative to Caucasian Americans Do treatment outcomes on disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) differ between African Americans (AA) and Caucasian Americans (CA)? A team of researchers posed that question in the context of the widely held view that African Americans often have a more aggressive form of MS than Caucasian Americans, and therefore may require more efficacious therapies.   To find answers, those investigators conducted a retrospective analysis of the CombiRx study, a randomized controlled trial that evaluated combined use of interferon beta-1a and glatiramer acetate in relapsing-remitting MS. The CombiRx study followed patients for three years. Eighty-eight percent of the study’s 1,008 patients identified as Caucasian Americans, and 7 percent identified as African Americans. At the start of the study, the AA participants had worse disability and a higher total burden of brain/spine lesions than CA participants. Once on treatment, however, there was no difference in outcomes between the two groups. While that finding is welcome news, the researchers noted that there is a need to study larger numbers of African-American patients to further explore the relative efficacy of DMTs in the AA and CA populations. They added that research into the causes of disparity in disease burden prior to treatment also is warranted. Support for early initiation of Betaseron in clinically isolated syndrome Starting Betaseron (interferon beta-1b) sooner rather than later in clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) yields benefits up to 15 years after initiation of the disease-modifying therapy (DMT), researchers report. Investigators in the BENEFIT 15 study monitored long-term outcomes in people who had CIS and at least two lesions on MRI that were suggestive of MS. In an earlier, related study, those individuals were randomly assigned to receive Betaseron (early-treatment group) or placebo. After either two years or conversion to clinically definite MS (CDMS), patients in the placebo group were offered Betaseron (delayed-treatment group). Of the 468 participants who had been randomized in the initial study, 261 enrolled in a follow-up study 15 years later. One hundred and sixty one were in the early-treatment group and 100 were in the delayed-treatment group. In the delayed-treatment group, Betaseron had been initiated an average 1.5 years after randomization. The annualized relapse rate in the full analysis set was 0.18 over 15 years. Notably, however, the risk of relapse in the early-treatment group was 19-percent lower than in the delayed-treatment group, and the risk for conversion to clinically definite MS by Year 15 was 31-percent lower. The researchers concluded that their results “support a sustained benefit of early intervention in reducing the risk of relapse and conversion to CDMS.” Tracking the efficacy of interferon beta-1a for up to 10 years With many people with MS now on disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) for several years, there is an increasing focus on the long-term safety and effectiveness of those medications. Researchers recently evaluated the ongoing efficacy of one of the first DMTs, subcutaneous interferon beta-1a, in 1,240 individuals receiving care at four MS centers throughout Italy. (In the United States, subcutaneous interferon beta-1a is available as Rebif.) The primary endpoint of their study was the proportion of patients with no evidence of disease activity (NEDA-3) as measured by clinical relapse, confirmed disability progression, and MRI for brain/spine lesions. Seventy-one percent of the study participants were women, and the participants’ mean age at the start of treatment was 34.6 years. The patients were followed for an average of approximately 7.5 years. Seventy-four percent of patients remained on treatment at two-year follow-up, just under half were still on therapy at the 5-year mark, and 28 percent were on the medication after 10 years of follow-up. At two years, 44 percent of patients did not have evidence of disease activity, while 25 percent were free of disease activity at five years and 19 percent were at 10 years. The researchers concluded that those percentages constitute “further evidence of sustained interferon beta-1a efficacy in modifying the natural course of MS.” Plegridy use in real-world setting consistent with clinical trial findings A post-approval, real-world analysis of Plegridy (peginterferon beta-1a) in 963 patients with relapsing-remitting MS yielded safety and efficacy findings consistent with those from the pre-approval clinical trials of the DMT. The interim analysis from the Plegridy Observational Program included data on 242 newly diagnosed individuals and 721 people who had been diagnosed one year or longer before study entry. The newly diagnosed (ND) patients generally were younger than their non-newly diagnosed (NND) counterparts (mean age 37.7 years versus 46.0 years) and had less disability, but had experienced more relapses in the prior year. Treatment discontinuation rates were similar for the two groups (31 percent for ND patients versus 32 percent for NND patients). The most commonly cited reasons for treatment discontinuation in both groups were adverse effects and lack of efficacy. The most frequently reported adverse effects were redness at the injection site and influenza-like illness. Eighty-two percent of newly diagnosed individuals and 85 percent of those who were non-newly diagnosed were relapse-free up to two years after starting Plegridy.   Glatiramer acetate slows disability progression for up to 10 years Glatiramer acetate, which is marketed as Copaxone and in generic formulations, including Glatopa, showed enduring benefit over the course of 10 years of therapy, making it a cost-effective option for long-term treatment of relapsing-remitting MS, according to British investigators. The researchers drew on clinical data and cost-effectiveness models to assess the impact of glatiramer acetate (GA) on patient health and health-system economics. The analysis included 752 people treated with GA and another 898 people with MS who were not treated. The investigators found that, relative to no treatment, GA use led to a 17-percent reduction in disability progression as measured by the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS). Further, among people treated with GA, there was only a 1.2-percent difference in Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) scores in six-year and 10-year data. The study’s authors concluded that the 10-year analysis “continues to support the long-term efficacy of GA in terms of disability, based on EDSS, and utility with no apparent evidence of a waning in treatment effect” making it highly cost-effective based on prevailing prices in the United Kingdom.   Reductions in relapse rate, MRI disease activity after three-to-five years of Ocrevus Two studies of people with relapsing-remitting MS show that use of the disease modifying therapy (DMT) Ocrevus (ocrelizumab) for three-to-five years is associated with reductions in annualized relapse rate (ARR) and several MRI measures of disease activity, according to researchers. The studies followed patients who had participated in the Phase III OPERA I and OPERA II trials that led to FDA approval of Ocrevus. In those 96-week studies, patients were randomized to receive either Ocrevus or interferon beta-1a. Upon completion of the Phase III trials, patients were able to enter an open-label extension study in which they would either continue on Ocrevus, if they had been assigned to receive that medication initially, or switch from interferon beta-1a to Ocrevus if they had been in the comparator group. Among those who received Ocrevus during the initial two-year trial and for three years afterwards in the open-label extension, the annualized relapse rate (ARR) declined from 0.13 in the year before the open-label extension to 0.07 at Year 3 of the extension (or five years, in total, from starting Ocrevus). For individuals who switched from interferon beta-1a to Ocrevus, the ARR decreased from 0.20 in the year before switching to 0.07 at three years post-switch. At five-year follow-up, the proportion of people with clinically defined disability progression was lower in those who had been on Ocrevus for five years than for those who had taken the medication for three years. Meanwhile, in people who switched from interferon beta-1a to Ocrevus, the adjusted number of T1 gadolinium-enhancing lesions on MRI was 0.48 lesions/scan prior to switching medications, and decreased to rates of 0.007, 0.004, and 0.004 after one, two, and three years, respectively, on Ocrevus. Individuals on Ocrevus for the full five-year period maintained low numbers of lesions on MRI. Compared to patients who started Ocrevus after two years on interferon beta-1a, those treated with Ocrevus from the outset had less brain atrophy as measured by whole brain volume, grey matter volume, and white matter volume on MRI. No MRI disease activity in most study subjects after six years on Lemtrada Most people with relapsing-remitting MS who began therapy with Lemtrada (alemtuzumab) after having received subcutaneous interferon beta-1a in a clinical trial were free of MRI indications of disease activity six years after switching medications, researchers reported. The TOPAZ trial followed 143 patients who initially had received subcutaneous interferon beta-1a in the Phase III CARE-MS study. These individuals entered an initial extension study in which they switched to Lemtrada, which was given in doses of 12 mg/day for five days at baseline, and then 12 mg/day for three days 12 months or more later. The participants were then eligible to enter TOPAZ, an additional five-year extension study. In TOPAZ, investigators had the option of giving these patients additional courses of alemtuzumab or another disease-modifying therapy as they thought necessary. Eighty-two percent of the participating patients completed Year 2 of TOPAZ (Year 6 after starting Lemtrada). Fifty-seven percent did not receive an additional dose of Lemtrada or another DMT during those six years. The annualized relapse rate at Year 6 after Lemtrada initiation was 0.19 percent. Further, 69 percent of patients were free of MRI disease activity, and 89 percent did not have new gadolinium-enhancing lesions. Meanwhile, safety results were consistent with those seen in Lemtrada-treated patients in the initial CARE-2 study and its two-year extension. Overall, researchers noted, Lemtrada improved clinical and imaging outcomes in patients who switched to the medication after receiving subcutaneous interferon beta-1a, and those improvements were sustained over six years in the absence of further treatment. Assessing the long-term safety and effectiveness of Tysabri An analysis of more than 6,100 people with relapsing-remitting MS who have taken Tysabri (natalizumab) for several years shows the long-term effectiveness of the medication and indicates that its safety profile remains consistent with ongoing use, researchers reported. Investigators drew on data from the Tysabri Observational Program (TOP) to characterize the Tysabri patient population and assess the medication’s impact on relapses and other measures of MS activity. At the time of the analysis, the program included 6,149 participants. Their median exposure to Tysabri was 38 doses, and median follow-up time was slightly over five years. Fifty-two percent of patients had discontinued the medication. The patients’ annualized relapse rate declined by 89 percent while on Tysabri, from 1.99 prior to starting the medication to 0.21. The greatest reduction was seen in the approximately 10 percent of patients who had not taken another disease-modifying therapy (DMT), but those who had taken one or two prior DMTs saw ARR reductions of 93 percent and 87 percent, respectively. Fourteen percent of these individuals experienced at least one serious adverse effect, with infections/infestations being the most commonly reported issues.   Evobrutinib shows favorable impact on lesion count, relapse rates Evobrutinib, or M2951, is an orally administered compound being investigated as a potential treatment for immune-mediated diseases including MS, rheumatoid arthritis, and systemic lupus erythematosus. Evobrutinib is an inhibitor of Bruton’s Tyrosine Kinase (BTK), an enzyme that plays an important role in the development and function of immune cells, including B lymphocytes and macrophages. At the ECTRIMS 2018 meeting, researchers announced 24-week results of a double-blind, randomized, 48-week, Phase II study of evobrutinib in patients aged 18 to 65 years with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) or secondary-progressive MS (SPMS) with relapses. In the study, 267 participants were randomized to receive evobrutinib 25 mg daily, 75 mg daily, 75 mg twice daily, placebo, or open-label Tecfidera (dimethyl fumarate 240 mg twice-daily. (The Tecfidera group served as a reference arm in the study, and no formal comparisons were made between people in that group and those receiving evobrutinib or placebo.) The study’s primary endpoint was the sum of T1 gadolinium-enhancing lesions at weeks 12, 16, 20, and 24. The annualized relapse rate (ARR) at 24 weeks was a key secondary endpoint, as were safety assessments. The primary analysis comparing the evobrutinib groups to the placebo group was planned to occur when all randomized patients either reached 24 weeks of treatment or had discontinued the study before that point. Ninety-one percent of patients completed 24 weeks of therapy. The study met its primary endpoint, with patients in the evobrutinib 75-mg once-daily and 75-mg twice-daily groups having significantly fewer gadolinium-enhancing T1 lesions than placebo patients at each time point studied. For weeks 12-24, the mean total of such lesions was 3.85 in the placebo group, 4.06 in the evobrutinib 25 mg once-daily group, 1.69 in the evobrutinib 75 mg once-daily group, and 1.15 in the evobrutinib 75 mg twice-daily group. The evobrutinib 75 mg once-daily and 75 mg twice-daily groups also had greater reductions in the ARR than placebo. No treatment-associated infections or significant reductions in lymphocyte counts were observed in those receiving evobrutinib. The most common treatment-emergent adverse events, occurring in more than 5 percent of patients, included increased liver-enzyme levels in patients receiving 75 mg of evobrutinib twice daily, but these changes were reversible and did not cause symptoms. French study details impact of biotin on disability measure, walking speed   Biotin is a vitamin involved in energy metabolism and fatty acid synthesis, including the activation of an enzyme in myelin synthesis. In the MS-SPI study, a high-dose, pharmaceutical-grade biotin known as MD1003 reversed MS-related disease disability in 13 percent of patients with progressive multiple sclerosis (PMS). To assess the efficacy and safety of MD1003 in a real-world setting, as opposed to in a clinical trial such as MS-SPI, researchers monitored outcomes in primary-progressive MS (PPMS) and secondary-progressive MS (SPMS) patients at a clinic in France. From January 2016 through May 2018, 220 individuals with progressive MS who were receiving care at the clinic in Toulouse, France, received 300 mg/day of the oral medication. At the ECTRIMS 2018 meeting, researchers presented data on the first 91 patients to complete one year of follow-up. Those patients’ mean age at baseline was 59.5 years. Sixty-two percent were females, and 70 percent had SPMS. The mean Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score at baseline was 5.9, and their mean timed 25-foot walk time was 50.7 seconds. At the end of one year of treatment with MD1003, 23 percent of the participants had an improvement in their EDSS score and 23 percent had a 20 percent or greater improvement in the time it took them to walk 25 feet. During the one-year period, 11 percent of patients had active disease, such as a clinically defined relapse, a gadolinium-enhancing T1 lesion on MRI, or both. Researchers said, “This real-world study supports the growing body of evidence that MD1003 is an effective and safe treatment for PMS.”  Gauging the impact of ozanimod on early and advanced relapsing-remitting MS Ozanimod is a once-daily, oral immunomodulator that targets two cell-surface receptors, sphingosine 1-phosphate receptors 1 and 5, suspected of playing a role in multiple sclerosis. The agent was evaluated in two Phase III studies, SUNBEAM and RADIANCE. In SUNBEAM, individuals with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) received ozanimod on a daily basis (either ozanimod HCl 1 mg or 0.5 mg) or a weekly injection of interferon beta-1a for 12 months or longer. In RADIANCE, the participants were randomized to the same treatments, but for 24 months. More than 2,600 people participated in the trials. A post hoc analysis presented at the 2018 ECTRIMS meeting examined how outcomes in SUNBEAM and RADIANCE differed between patients with early RRMS and advanced RRMS. The designation of early MS was based on a composite baseline profile that included three years or less from diagnosis, an Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score ≤3.5, and use of one or no disease-modifying therapies (DMTs). The early MS group consisted of 1,392 patients, while there were 1,267 people in the advanced MS group. Thirteen hundred and ninety-two patients were included in the early MS group. Key differences between the two groups at baseline included median years since diagnosis (0.5 years for the early group and 5.7 for the advanced group), median EDSS (2.0 versus 3.5), mean relapses within the last year (1.4 versus 1.2), and mean count of gadolinium-enhancing lesions (1.77 versus 1.67). In both the early and advanced RRMS groups, the annualized relapse rate (ARR) was lower in those who received ozanimod than in patients who received interferon. In the early group, the ARR was 0.149 for those on 1 mg of ozanimod HCI, 0.200 for the ozanimod HCI 0.5 mg patients, and 0.285 for the interferon group. The annualized relapse rates in the advanced RRMS group were 0.217 for ozanimod HCI 1 mg, 0.277 for ozanimod HCI 0.5 mg, and 0.363 for interferon. MRI measures of disease activity also favored ozanimod over interferon. In both the early and advanced RRMS groups, individuals receiving either dose of ozanimod had lower mean numbers of gadolinium-enhancing lesions and new/enlarging T2 lesions at 12 months than patients receiving interferon. Surveying real-world experience with treating MS with rituximab Rituximab is a monoclonal antibody approved by the FDA to treat rheumatoid arthritis and several forms of cancer. Because it depletes B cells, which are key components of the immune system, some neurologists prescribe rituximab to treat MS, although it currently does not have FDA approval specifically for use in MS. Investigators at the University of Colorado’s Rocky Mountain MS Center examined the safety and effectiveness of rituximab in 125 people with MS. The participants had an average age of 44 years and had an MS disease duration of slightly more than 10 years. Seventy-two percent were female; 62 percent had relapsing-remitting MS. With an average follow-up of 40.6 months, most individuals had six or seven rituximab infusions. While on rituximab, 16 percent of participants had infections requiring an emergency department visit, and 11 percent had infections necessitating hospitalization. Thirty-seven percent of patients had an infusion reaction on their first infusion that required interrupting the infusion, but that percentage fell to 14 percent on the second infusion. None experienced an infusion reaction that required hospitalization. Two individuals (1.6 percent of the total) were diagnosed with cancer after starting rituximab. While on rituximab treatment, 5 percent of patients had a clinical relapse, 2 percent had an enhancing lesion on MRI, and – based on detailed analysis – 8 percent of those with available MRI data had a new lesion on T2 imaging. Those findings prompted the researcher to conclude that rituximab appears to be a safe and effective option for long-term MS treatment. Two trials to examine the monoclonal antibody ofatumumab in relapsing-remitting MS Two Phase III trials will assess the safety and efficacy of the human monoclonal antibody ofatumumab relative to Aubagio (teriflunamide) in people with relapsing-remitting MS. Like Ocrevus (ocrelizumab), ofatumumab targets the CD20 marker on the surface of B cells. The identically designed ASCLEPIOS I and ASCLEPIOS II trials have enrolled a combined total of 1,884 patients in 37 countries. Study participants will be randomized to receive either 20 mg subcutaneous injections of ofatumumab every four weeks (following an initial regimen of three 20-mg subcutaneous doses per week in the first 14 days) or 14 mg of Aubagio taken orally once daily. Annualized rate of confirmed relapses is the primary endpoint for both trials. Secondary outcomes include confirmed disability worsening and MRI-related measures. Enrollment for both studies has been completed. Both employ an adaptive design in which study duration is not fixed over a specified period of time but rather is dependent on reaching a pre-specified number of events. Phase II study to explore impact of opicinumab in targeted population Early-phase research into investigational agents often identifies patient groups that have a better response to treatment than other patient types. That was the case in the Phase II SYNERGY study of opicinumab. Opicinumab is a human monoclonal antibody active against LINGO-1, a protein that exercises an effect on the differentiation and regeneration of central nervous system cells. SYNERGY investigated the infused medication’s safety and efficacy as an add-on therapy to disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) in MS. The study found that a patient subpopulation (defined by disease duration and baseline MRI findings) was associated with an enhanced response to treatment. The Phase II AFFINITY trial is following up on those findings by taking a closer look at the impact of opicinumab in that patient population. At the ECTRIMS 2018 meeting, researchers provided an overview of the AFFINITY study’s design and demographics. AFFINITY is a randomized, placebo-controlled trial that will evaluate the efficacy and safety of 750 mg of opicinumab administered intravenously every four weeks compared to placebo as an add-on to DMTs. The trial will last for 72 weeks. The population being studied encompasses people aged 18-58 years with relapsing-remitting or secondary-progressive MS who have had MS for 20 years or less and who have Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) scores between 2.0 and 6.0. Further, the study’s inclusion criteria specify a clinical relapse in the last four to 24 months or brain MRI evidence of disease activity in the past two years. Because opicinumab is being studied as an add-on therapy, patients must be stable on interferon beta, dimethyl fumarate, or natalizumab for at least six months. Further, the patients must have brain imaging findings indicative of lower myelin content and more preserved tissue integrity in brain T2 lesions. The study’s main endpoint is Overall Response Score, an integrated assessment of disability improvement and worsening based on the EDSS and other measures. The study began in September 2017, and remains open to enrollment. Study investigators noted that AFFINITY is expected to enroll approximately 240 participants at roughly 150 sites in about 25 countries. Cladribine is an oral medication approved for use in several countries for the treatment of relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS). It is not approved for that use in the United States. The medication has an unusual dosing pattern in that it is taken for up to 20 days over the course of two years. It also has an unusual mechanism of action: it targets the immune system’s B cells and T cells, leading to a reduction in the total count of those cells followed by a distinct pattern of “reconstitution” as new B cells and T cells are produced. At the ECTRIMS 2018 meeting, researchers presented an update on the safety profile of Cladribine Tablets in people with RRMS who took the medication as a monotherapy (without use of other MS agents at the same time). The study assessed data from three clinical trials and a patient registry, and reported information collected through May 2017. The analysis included data on 923 patients who received cladribine at a dose of 3.5 mg/kg and 641 patients who received placebo. It focused on the incidence of adverse events per 100 patient-years. The cladribine group had an average age of 36.5 years at study enrollment; two-thirds of the cladribine patients were women. The rate of serious treatment-emergent adverse events per 100 patient years through May 2017 was 3.88 for the cladribine group and 2.24 for the placebo group. Adverse events occurring at a higher rate in the cladribine group than in the placebo group included abnormally low levels of lymphocytes (a white blood cell) and serious infections, including serious herpes zoster. Study authors concluded that the updated safety profile “was generally consistent with that from two years prior,” adding, “No new major safety findings were identified in the updated dataset, where patients were followed for up to 10 years.”  Elezanumab: Phase I trial supports the need for larger studies A small, early-stage study of a monoclonal antibody directed at a new target in MS showed the medication to be well-tolerated, but did not demonstrate a clear-cut impact on symptoms, highlighting the need for further testing in a larger population, the study’s authors said. Elezanumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody directed against repulsive guidance molecule A (RGMa), which has been shown to inhibit key processes in neurologic regeneration and functional recovery following inflammation or trauma. A Phase I placebo-controlled, 29-week study randomized 20 people with MS to one of three treatment groups or to a placebo group. Elezanumab was administered intravenously every four weeks for a total of four doses. Patients in the three active treatment groups received an initial “loading” dose followed by maintenance doses of either 150 mg, 600 mg, or 1800 mg of elezanumab. Twenty-five percent of all participants reported headaches. Most individuals receiving elazanumab did not report a clinically significant improvement in, or worsening of, MS symptoms. However, testing showed that as levels of elezanumab in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) increased, levels of free soluble RGMA decreased, while total RGMA (both free and antibody-bound) increased in step with CSF elezanumab exposure. Investigators concluded that, “Additional long-term studies are required to elucidate elezanumab efficacy in a more robust patient population.” Survey results reveal people with multiple sclerosis want more information on preventing brain atrophy Cognitive changes are a common symptom of multiple sclerosis, affecting more than half of those living with the condition. A new survey examines the topic of brain volume loss, known as brain atrophy, in people with multiple sclerosis. The survey, conducted by the Multiple Sclerosis Association of America (MSAA) and sponsored by Celgene, included more than 1,300 people with multiple sclerosis or someone responding on their behalf. Based on the survey findings that were presented at ECTRIMS 2018, maintaining cognitive function is the second most common concern for respondents. Only the prevention of physical disability progression was reported more often (45 percent). The survey findings also suggest that there is a high level of interest in better understanding how brain atrophy may impact disease progression. Sixty-three percent of respondents reported that they have not talked to any member of their medical team about brain atrophy, and only 20 percent reported being moderately or very satisfied with the amount of information available on potential ways to prevent brain atrophy. These study results indicate that additional education on the topic of brain atrophy is an area of interest to the MS community. Global initiative seeks to improve shared decision-making and communication between healthcare professionals, patients, and care partners Navigating Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a global initiative that aims to improve outcomes for people with MS through the global adoption of strategies that optimize therapeutic decision-making. This initiative also aims to improve the way that healthcare professionals, patients, and care partners communicate around benefit and risk in the management and treatment of their disease. In order to better understand the potential barriers to effective communications and shared-decision making, the Navigating MS Steering Committee developed and distributed a survey to MS healthcare professionals and people with MS to identify potential and perceived barriers to successful shared-decision making in MS practice. A total of 73 neurologists, 104 nurses, and 1,184 individuals with MS have responded to the survey. Differences in the perception of neurologists, nurses, and people with MS regarding the adequacy of resources required for successful shared-decision making was demonstrated in the data received. Four main areas of contention were identified: lack of education, resources, time, and variable involvement of the interdisciplinary (healthcare) team. Nurse respondents indicated a perceived proficiency with shared-decision making and adequacy of education and training to fulfil this role. However, 73 percent of people with MS who responded indicated a strong preference for engagement with the neurologist in discussing the benefits and risks of treatment options. There was no clear consensus regarding the degree to which decision-making is accurately a collaborative process within the interdisciplinary team. Half of the nurses stated that the decisions were shared, although people with MS reported a lot of ambiguity and variation in how actively involved they were in the decision-making process. Despite neurologists stating the main barrier to shared-decision making was lack of time, 49 percent of people with MS strongly disagreed that time was a barrier to shared-decision making, with 60 percent of nurses reporting clinic timeframes as adequate. The disagreement in perceptions among clinicians and people with MS demonstrates an ongoing need to educate both healthcare professionals and patients on best practices in adopting a shared-decision making approach to discussions around treatment decisions. The Navigation MS initiative has received funding from Biogen, Celgene, EMD Serono, Genentech, Novartis, and Sanofi Genzyme.  It might seem paradoxical that people who experience fatigue should exert themselves in order to have more energy, but that is exactly what researchers found when conducting a study of 60 individuals with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis and fatigue. The 47 females and 13 males participating in the study had an average age of 30 years and a baseline mean Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS) score of 56.7. They were divided into two groups, balanced by age, gender and FSS score. People in the first group walked on a treadmill three times a week for six weeks, with the pace increasing from easy to brisk during each session and the duration of exercise increasing from 10-15 minutes initially to 25-32 minutes by the end of the study. People in the second group did not exercise but instead received amantadine, a medication used to treat movement disorders. While the people who did not exercise had no meaningful change in their FSS scores over the 12-week course of the study, those assigned to the exercise group saw their mean FSS score improve to 35.67 (versus 56.7 for all at the start of the study) at six weeks and to further improve to 29.11 at 12 weeks. The researchers concluded, “A specially designed walking exercise program with gradual increments in time and speed for 12 weeks can improve fatigue in RRMS patients. A long-term follow-up is recommended to verify the maintained effect on such improvement.”  Securing the long-term benefits of activity in MS: “Keep going!” Is the improvement in quality of life typically seen in exercise and activity programs for people with MS sustained after those programs end? That is the question a team of investigators posed in a study of 56 women with MS. Their answer: Yes, over the short term; and no, over the long term. The women, who had an average age of 34.5 years, were divided into groups, with some assigned to exercise and others to engaging in leisure-time activities such as making crafts. The women completed surveys to measure their sleep quality, fatigue, and depression, if any, at the start of the study and at several points afterward. Women in both groups showed improvement in sleep, fatigue, and depression at the end of the study and four weeks after its conclusion. By the 20-week mark after the study, however, MS symptoms had begun to increase, leading the researchers to comment that “continuous exercising appears to be of utmost importance for keeping symptoms of depression, fatigue, and sleep disturbances stably low.” There is growing evidence that diet plays a role in the MS disease course, but researchers continue to debate how best to study the issue in a scientifically rigorous manner. One practical concern is whether sufficient numbers of people with MS will be able to adhere to restrictive diets long enough for studies to yield valid results. A six-month pilot study involving 36 women with MS provides encouraging news in this regard. The study assigned 18 of the women to the intervention group – and to following a restrictive, modified Mediterranean diet for six months. The women in this group participated in training sessions with a nutritionist and attended monthly meetings to assess and encourage their adherence to the diet. The other 18 participants acted as a control group; they participated in educational seminars. All 18 women in the intervention group completed the study, with a 90.3-percent mean self-reported rate of adhering to the study diet. At the time of the ECTRIMS meeting in early October, 14 of the 18 women in the control group had completed the six-month study, three more were on track to finish in the weeks just ahead, and there was only one anticipated drop out. Sixteen of the 18 women in the intervention group reported that their overall health had benefited from following the study diet, with 14 women reporting benefit in terms of specific MS symptoms. The intervention group subjects also showed greater improvement than the women in the control group on measures of fatigue and MS impact. The researchers concluded, “It is feasible to enroll MS patients into a rigorous dietary intervention study requiring significant commitment and randomization and reasonable to expect high adherence to this type of dietary program utilizing educational methods to promote adherence.” They added, “Larger-scale clinical trials to assess the role of diet for symptom management and even as a disease modifier in MS are feasible and warranted.” Exploring the impact of a high-fat, low-carbohydrate diet on MS The benefits of a ketogenic diet – a high-fat, low-carbohydrate eating plan – have long been promoted by some people with MS and their physicians, while others have said that there has not been adequate research to support the approach. A recent pilot study sought to add to the knowledge base on the subject by assessing how following a ketogenic diet for six months affected 20 people with relapsing-remitting MS. Researchers reported that no subjects experienced worsening diseases – as assessed by clinical symptoms and brain MRI – while on the diet. Further, fatigue and depression scores improved from baseline, and body-mass index and insulin levels declined. While additional data is being collected, those findings prompted the investigators to conclude that ketogenic diets appear to be “safe, feasible, and well-tolerated” in people with relapsing-remitting MS. Despite the old saying, misery doesn’t actually appear to love company  The more social support a person with MS enjoys, the less pain is likely to interfere with his or her life – even as the intensity of pain increases. That is the bottom-line finding of a study involving 196 people with MS who reported experiencing pain. Study participants had an average age of almost 54 years; 82 percent were women and 18 percent were men. Researchers assessed the participants’ degree of social support, pain intensity, and pain interference at the start of the study and again after an average of roughly 3.5 years. As would be expected, as the intensity of pain changed, so did the extent to which pain caused interference in a person’s life. However, the study also found that “higher levels of perceived social support [are] associated with subsequent improvements over time in pain interference in individuals with MS and pain, even when controlling for changes in pain intensity.” In simpler language, the more friends, family members, and other meaningful relationships a person has in his or her life, the less he or she will experience interference from pain, even when the pain is intensified. Conversely, the investigators found that “lower levels of social support prospectively predict increases in pain interference.” Commenting that their findings “are consistent with other research indicating multiple health benefits from the presence of social support,” the study’s authors noted the importance of investigating means to enhance such support for people with MS who are experiencing pain. Pain and sleep issues are top reasons for cannabis-based product use in people with MS Roughly one in five people with MS surveyed by researchers at a Canadian hospital reported using cannabis-based products (CBP) on a regular basis, with pain and sleep problems as the most commonly cited reasons for use. Investigators at the University of British Columbia MS clinic distributed surveys on CBP use to 600 patients attending the clinic from January to March 2018. Two hundred and fifty-nine participants completed and returned the survey. Seventy-five percent of the respondents were female, and the most common age range of respondents was 45 to 55 years. Sixty-one percent of respondents reported never using CBP, and another 16 percent said they rarely did so. Of the remainder, 15 percent reported daily use, 4 percent said they used CBP weekly, and 3 percent said they used CBP on a monthly basis. Researchers noted that responder bias might cause overestimation of CBP use. Seventy-one percent of regular CBP users said they sought relief from pain with a cannabis-based product. Help with sleep also was cited by 71 percent of respondents. Other reported reasons for use included mood (44 percent), spasticity (40 percent), tremor (11 percent), and bladder dysfunction (9 percent). Ninety-five percent of regular users said they had obtained relief of symptoms from CBP. More than half (52 percent) had discussed their CBP use with a neurologist; 35 percent had not tried other symptomatic medications. With the increasing liberalization of state laws regarding use of cannabis-based products for both medical and recreational purposes, CBP is likely to be an increasingly accessible option for more and more people with MS. Reassurance on use of DMTs in women pursuing pregnancy “How will this medication affect my ability to conceive, and to deliver a healthy baby?” It’s a question MS clinicians hear frequently when talking with women of child-bearing age about starting a disease-modifying therapy (DMT). A recent retrospective analysis by Israeli researchers provides reassuring news with regard to this important concern. The investigators examined data on 125 women with relapsing-remitting MS who had a total of 219 live births between 2002 and 2017. They divided the women into three groups: those who were not treated with a DMT in the three months prior to becoming pregnant; those who were treated in the three months prior to pregnancy; and those who were treated during pregnancy. After adjusting for factors including age, disease severity, and known fertility problems, the researchers found that use of DMTs shortly before and during pregnancy did not affect fertility or pregnancy outcomes. They found no significant differences between women in the three groups in terms of the need for fertility treatment and time to pregnancy, pregnancy outcomes, complications during pregnancy, or incidence of relapses during pregnancy or in the first year following delivery. The investigators concluded, “The decision regarding DMTs treatment in RRMS patients during child-bearing years should not be influenced by the question of pregnancy in the near future.” However, treatment discussions along with pregnancy planning should always be discussed with one’s healthcare team in advance. Additionally, none of the DMTs have been approved by the FDA for use during pregnancy and certain DMTs may present more of a risk than others. Sexual dysfunction common in women with clinically isolated syndrome   More than one-half of women with clinically isolated syndrome (CIS), a common precursor to MS, experience sexual dysfunction. That is the main finding of a small study in which Egyptian researchers gathered data from August 2011 to June 2017. Noting that sexual dysfunction has been reported in between 40 percent and 80 percent of women with multiple sclerosis, the investigators sought to determine the frequency of the condition in CIS. They had 43 women with CIS complete the Multiple Sclerosis Intimacy and Sexuality Questionnaire (MSIQ-19), as well as instruments assessing fatigue, cognitive function, anxiety, and depression. Fifty-six percent of the women reported at least one manifestation of sexual dysfunction. Eight cited a lack of sexual interest or desire, five reported less intense orgasms, and four said they experienced inadequate vaginal lubrication. Beyond those primary aspects of sexual dysfunction, women also reported that symptoms of CIS – such as urinary and bowel problems and difficulty with concentration – interfered with their sexual function. Lack of confidence about sexuality and fear of rejection also was reported to contribute to sexual difficulties. Fatigue and depression were significant predictors of sexual dysfunction. Further, women who reported sexual dysfunction were older than those who did not report such difficulties (27.5 years versus 23.1 years), but the two groups did not differ in terms of occupation, educational level, or location of brain/spine lesions on MRI. The investigators noted that four patients reported experiencing sexual dysfunction before the emergence of neurological symptoms of MS. As researchers continue to “fill in the gaps” on the many facets of CIS, this study points to the importance of patients talking frankly with clinicians about the full range of issues they may be experiencing. Is menopause a turning point for MS disease course? Relapse rates declined but disability increased in the years following menopause among 148 women with relapsing forms of MS, suggesting that “natural menopause could be a turning point to a less inflammatory, progressive phase of disease,” according to researchers. Those findings and conclusions are from an observational study conducted at 16 MS centers across Italy. Women were followed for a period of roughly 3.5 years before and after natural menopause, meaning menopause not brought about by surgical removal of the ovaries. Ninety-three percent of the women received disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) during that period. The annualized relapse rate (ARR) for the women declined from 0.22 before menopause to 0.13 following menopause. However, their scores on the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) increased from a median of 2.0 at menopause to 2.27 two years later and to 2.46 four years after menopause. On the EDSS, an increasing score reflects increased disability. The investigators noted that the findings are in keeping with the results of earlier research they have conducted with a smaller group of women. The impact of endocrine (or hormonal) factors on MS is a focus of considerable research, and studies such as this one suggest avenues for further investigation, while also helping clinicians and patients better anticipate changes that may await across one’s lifespan.  Promising results for stem cell therapy in “aggressive MS”  Clinicians long have faced a challenge in treating “aggressive MS” – a term used when one’s MS is marked by frequent relapses and rapid progression of disability. An international study presented at the ECTRIMS 2018 meeting offers hope that removing, treating, and re-infusing a patient’s own hematopoietic (blood-tissue forming) stem cells may be a safe and effective first-line therapy for this uncommon but extremely debilitating type of MS. The study involved 20 patients treated in the United Kingdom, Sweden, Canada, Italy, and the United States. None had received more than three months of standard DMT treatment before undergoing autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, or AHSCT (with autologous signifying that the cells came from the patient, rather than from a donor). The patients, who ranged in age from 19 to 52 years, had a median EDSS score of 6.5 prior to treatment. They were followed for a median time of 30 months after transplantation. The median improvement in their EDSS score from pre-treatment to last follow-up was 2.5, which was a statistically significant difference. None had a clinical relapse following transplant. Three patients had new lesions on MRI at their first follow-up visit, but no other new or gadolinium-enhancing lesions were seen on later scans. The investigators reported that, “There were routine toxicities, but no treatment-related mortality.” The researchers added that the study results demonstrate the potential role of AHSCT as a first-line treatment for aggressive MS. Additional studies will continue to provide answers on the potential benefits and risks of this intriguing experimental treatment. Low immunization rates against respiratory disease in people with MS Pneumonia and influenza pose serious threats in the setting of MS, but more than 70 percent of people with MS in an Argentine study had not been vaccinated against either illness, researchers reported. The investigators noted that age, smoking, severe disability, and use of immunosuppressive medications all increase the risk of respiratory infections, adding that people with MS have a risk three-times higher than that of the general population for contracting community-acquired pneumonia. Against that backdrop, the researchers conducted an online survey of 220 people with MS and 62 healthy controls. The proportion of people not receiving either the pneumococcal pneumonia or influenza vaccine was high in both groups – 71.4 percent of people with MS and 79 percent of the healthy controls. Among the unvaccinated patients with MS, 80 percent were on a DMT medication, 31 percent smoked or had only recently stopped smoking, 22 percent were aged 50 years or older, and 11 percent had severe disability. The investigators concluded that the low vaccination rates combined with the high prevalence of risk factors among MS patients underscores the need to develop consensus policies on immunization in people who have MS. Impact of magnetic stimulation on balance in people with MS Using a coil held over a person’s head to direct magnetic stimulation to the brain improved balance and walking ability in people with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) and a related movement disorder, according to a group of Egyptian researchers. The investigators studied 43 people with RRMS and truncal ataxia, a condition that can diminish balance and the ability to walk. In the first phase of their study, half of the participants received actual magnetic stimulation while the other half received a sham treatment. In the study’s second phase, all subjects received 12 sessions of magnetic stimulation over four weeks every third month, for a total of 48 sessions. Each session lasted several minutes. The Berg Balance Scale (BBS) and 10-Minute Walk Test (10MWT) were used to measure the impact of treatment, with patients assessed before, during, and at the completion of treatment. The researchers reported that from the pre-treatment baseline to the last session, participants saw a 36-percent improvement in the 10MWT and a 46-percent improvement in BBS score. These individuals also saw improvement on an imaging assessment of white matter in the brain. The investigators said that the adverse effects of treatment were mild and transitory, with two people reporting nausea, two experiencing dizziness, and three having headaches. Based on these findings, the researchers said that non-invasive, high-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation has a long-term beneficial effect on improving balance in people with MS and ataxia.

d83a4c59-d1b4-4ac2-889a-d04120b716f4,"Complementary & Alternative Medicines Find Programs & Services in Your Area COVID-19 Vaccine Guidance for People Living with MS     New Study Links Obesity to Faster Nerve Loss in People with MS New Study Links Obesity to Faster Nerve Loss in People with MS Johns Hopkins University researchers funded in part by the National MS Society report that people with MS who were obese experienced accelerated loss of optic nerve tissue compared to people of normal weight. The study followed 513 people with MS  for about four years. The authors suggest that, if confirmed, the findings show a link between a wellness factor – body weight -- and MS progression, and support studies that would track whether reducing weight can improve outcomes in MS. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) has been increasingly used as a research tool to detect and track damage that occurs to the nerves in the back of the eye. OCT scanning is done with a small machine that can fit into an examining room, is relatively inexpensive, painless and well tolerated. This team has that the rate of tissue thinning seen on OCT in people with MS over time reliably mirrors overall brain health and nerve loss, suggesting that OCT can show underlying disease progression. In this study, loss of tissue in a specific nerve layer in the back of the eye, called the ganglion cell and inner plexiform layer, was accelerated in people who were obese at the start of the study (defined as having a body mass index of 30 or higher). This study adds important evidence to previous findings that obesity worsens outcomes for people with MS.

a5e5fd0b-fb57-49a0-b8e2-bdee5d29d141,"MS, the coronavirus and vaccines – updated global advice MS, the coronavirus and vaccines – updated global advice Researchers and health professionals gather for the latest updates and research findings on treatment, care and management of MS Post written by Arman Eshaghi, winner of the ECTRIMS MS researchers from around the globe gathered in London, UK, last week for the annual congress of the European Committee for Treatment and Research in Multiple Sclerosis (). ECTRIMS is the largest global MS conference, bringing together over 9,000 researchers and health professionals for the latest updates and research findings on treatment, care and management of MS. During ECTRIMS, we saw significant progress in the field of MS and new studies on progressive MS. Below are some of the highlights. Positive results for a fingolimod-like drug for people with secondary progressive MS Siponimod is a similar drug to fingolimod, but it has a more targeted effect on white blood cells and therefore may have fewer side effects compared to fingolimod while maintaining similar beneficial effects. In a phase III trial called EXPAND (the biggest clinical trial on people with secondary progressive MS with 1,651 people from 31 countries) (), participants received either a daily placebo or siponimod tablet. Further results from the trial were presented at ECTRIMS showing that, after 3 and 6 months, people with MS who received siponimod had slower progression as assessed by Expanded-Disability Status Scale (EDSS). Novartis, the producer of siponimod, will apply for the regulatory approval to formally include this drug as a treatment for secondary progressive MS. The results of this study have been submitted for publication. We will report the details as soon as they are published. You can read more about this trial on the . Negative results for fluoxetine in progressive multiple sclerosis Fluox-PMS is a multi-centre study performed in Belgium and Netherlands (). Fluoxetine is mainly used for the treatment of depression, but may be useful to protect brain cells from dying (degeneration). In this study investigators asked whether fluoxetine could slow the progression of MS. This drug trial included both people with primary progressive MS and secondary progressive MS. Participants were divided in two groups of placebo (68 participants) and fluoxetine (69 participants). After 108 weeks, there was no significant difference between the two groups of participants in terms of the rate of progression. Therefore, this study failed to show significant improvement in people with progressive MS who took fluoxetine. Although the trial showed a trend towards a reduction in disability progression, a larger and longer trial would be needed to show if this trend was statistically significant. Three research abstracts were presented, which reported the recruitment phase for a promising drug trial for people with secondary progressive MS, called MS-SMART (). MS-SMART stands for ultiple clerosis – econdary progressive ultiple rm andomisation rial. This trial for secondary progressive MS is testing 3 drugs at once: riluzole – licensed to treat motor neurone disease (MND) This is an ongoing study in 13 different sites across the UK. A total of 440 participants with worsening secondary progressive MS have been recruited in 4 groups: (1) placebo, (2) riluzole, (3) fluoxetine, and (4) amiloride. Investigators plan to follow participants for 96 weeks and assess the effects of each drug on clinical, disability and MRI outcomes. We look forward to seeing the results over the coming years. Lipoic acid: is it useful for people with secondary progressive MS? Lipoic acid is a tablet with antioxidant effects. In a study from Portland, Oregon, USA, investigators ran a clinical trial on 54 participants with secondary progressive MS (). Participants were divided into two groups who either received placebo or lipoid acid. The results of this trial after 96 weeks of follow up showed that the group who received the lipoic acid treatment had lower rate of brain shrinkage. However, there was no significant effect of the treatment on disability and clinical measures in people who received the treatment. Authors stressed the need for trials with more participants in order to prove the effectiveness of lipoic acid. ORATORIO trial: New promising information on Ocrelizumab, a treatment for people with primary progressive MS Last year, Ocrelizumab showed positive results for people with primary progressive MS (ORATORIO trial). The ORATORIO trial is a multi-center and multi-national drug trial. This year several groups presented new data on the trial from around the world (, , , ). Ocrelizumab treatment showed consistent positive effects on walking and slowing the disability progression. The most common adverse event was the reaction at the site of infusions. In a proportion of people with MS, the disease starts without fulfilling all the criteria for MS (clinically isolated syndrome). People with clinically isolated syndrome may (or may not) develop MS over time. The factors that can affect conversion from clinically isolated syndrome to MS are of high interest if they can be modified and reduce the conversion rate to MS. Investigators from the MS centre of Barcelona (CEMCAT) reported their findings on the relationship between vitamin D and smoking at the time of the diagnosis of clinically isolated syndrome on the risk of developing MS and disability progression in participant, followed for many years (). Investigators looked the vitamin D levels in 503 people with clinically isolated syndrome. They also looked at a blood marker of smoking (cotinine) in 464 people with clinically isolated syndrome. This study started in 1995 and followed participants for an average of 8 years (up to 15 years). Investigators did not find any significant increase for the conversion to MS in people with low vitamin D or those who were smokers. However, low levels of vitamin D, and cigarette smoking were both significantly associated with development of higher disability in the study participants. Therefore, both these risk factors, if modified, can slow the progression of disability in people with clinically isolated syndrome. People with relapsing remitting MS are often treated by injectable interferons. A study from the Danish MS centre (Petersen et al, Righospitalet, University of Copenhagen, Denmark, abstract 178) on 1,145 people with relapsing remitting MS showed that smoking has significant effects on the response to treatment with interferon. Investigators observed that people with MS who smoked more, were less likely to respond to interferon treatment. In another study from University of California in Berkeley and San Francisco (), Lisa Barcellos and colleagues asked whether body mass index (an index to define normal weights) has any effect on the risk of developing MS. Investigators looked at a huge population of people with MS and healthy volunteers from USA and Sweden (close to 20,000). They found a causal association between abnormal increase in weight (overweight or obese people) and the risk of MS. Authors suggested that this observation might be due to the effect of obesity on the immune system. There was great interest in a presentation by Dr Tomas Kalincik and his colleagues who had conducted a major analysis comparing the clinical data of people receiving alemtuzumab, natalizumab or fingolimod, using the extensive international data gathered in the MSBase database. The results suggest that natalizumab and alemtuzumab are better able to suppress relapses in comparison with fingolimod. Alemtuzumab and natalizumab appear to be similar in suppressing relapses and disability progression, with natalizumab more often showing an early improvement in disability levels. Of course, these effects represent the overall effects across a large population and may vary considerably for each individual. Treatment decisions also need to be based on other factors including general health, family planning, and other work and life related factors for each individual.

Multiple Sclerosis is a condition that affects the central nervous system. It involves an abnormal response of the body’s own immune system. MS gradually destroys the myelin, which is the protective covering of the nerve fibers. Progressive nerve damage can then lead to permanent damage. The course of MS and the symptoms vary from person to person. MS is one of the most common neurological disorders. There are approximately 2.3 million people with MS worldwide. The cause of MS is unknown and there is no cure. [1] National Multiple Sclerosis Society, https://www.nationalmssociety.org/What-is-MS/Definition-of-MS [2] Noseworthy JH, Lucchinetti C, Rodriguez M, Weinshenker BG. Multiple sclerosis. N. Engl. J. Med. 2000;343:938–952 [3] National Multiple Sclerosis Society,https://www.nationalmssociety.org/What-is-MS/MS-FAQ-s Clinically Isolated Syndrome (CIS) is the first episode of neurological symptoms experienced by a person, lasting at least 24 hours. The person may experience a single sign or symptom, or more than one at the same time. Not everyone who experiences CIS goes on to develop MS, but CIS can be an indicator for it. Relapsing-Remitting MS (RRMS) is the most common form of MS, with 85% of people with MS being initially diagnosed with RRMS. People experience attacks or exacerbations of symptoms (‘relapses’), which then fade or disappear (‘remission’). Relapses can last for varying periods – from a few days up to months – and then the disease may then be inactive for months or years. Secondary-Progressive MS (SPMS) is a secondary phase of RRMS that may develop years or even decades but most people who have RRMS will transition to SPMS. In SPMS there is progressive worsening of symptoms over time with no definite periods of remission. SPMS can also be categorized by whether it is active or not active (someone who has active MS experiences relapses and/or evidence of new MRI activity). Primary-Progressive MS (PPMS) is not very common and is characterized by steadily worsening symptoms and disability from the start, rather than sudden attacks or relapses followed by recovery.

7c2fce34-30ff-4b27-94e7-47cd30a37ef2,"Autologous haematopoietic stem cell transplant (AHSCT) Autologous haematopoietic stem cell transplant (AHSCT) Ageusia is the loss of taste functions on the tongue, which means you lose the ability to distinguish what is sweet, sour, bitter, or salty. Allodynia is a high sensitivity to touch, resulting in intense pain even with minimal contact, and refers specifically to a painful response to a normally innocuous stimulus. Allodymia is a specific type of dysesthesia, which is the abnormal sense of touch. Any substance that triggers the immune system to produce an antibody; generally refers to infectious or toxic substances, e.g. viruses or bacteria, or the small molecules that form part of these microorganisms. Anxiety is the most common mental health disorder. It is characterised by constantly feeling or showing worry, nervousness, or unease about something. It can also cause fatigue, restlessness and hypervigilance resulting from excessive worry and/or fear, which in turn can affect the ability to concentrate, sleep and carry out ordinary tasks. Astrocytes are star-shaped cells found in the brain and spinal cord. They perform many functions, including biochemical support of cells that form the blood–brain barrier, provision of nutrients to the nervous tissue, and play a role in the repair and scarring process of the brain and spinal cord following traumatic injuries. The incoordination and unsteadiness that result from the brain’s failure to regulate the body’s posture and the strength and direction of limb movements. Ataxia is most often caused by disease activity in the cerebellum (the part of the brain at the back of the skull). A wasting away or decrease in size of a cell, tissue, or organ of the body because of disease or lack of use. An antibody produced by the body’s immune system which target the body’s own cells, which it mistakenly recognizes as a threat. Autoimmune processes or autoimmunity is when the immune system mistakenly attacks healthy cells and tissues. Autologous Haematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant (AHSCT) Autologous Haematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant refers to a treatment scheme where a patient’s haematopoietic (or blood) stem cells are isolated from their bone marrow, before their immune system is removed either by chemotherapy or whole body irradiation. The patient’s own haematopoietic stem cells are then reintroduced back into their body to rebuild the immune system. A nerve fibre that carries information from the nerve cell body to another nerve cell or muscle fibre. B cells also known as B lymphocytes, are a type of white blood cell in the immune system. B cells are important for ‘policing’ the human body for foreign substances. In particular, B cells are responsible for the production of antibodies and cytokines (chemical signals that circulate around the body), they are also important for presenting foreign substances (antigen presenting) to the rest of the immune system. The Babinski Reflex is often used to test MS, normally when stimulated with a blunt instrument the toes natural respond by pointing downwards, in newborns and some people with nerve damage the big toe points up and the toes splay outwards, this latter reaction is known as the Babinski reflex and may indicate an issue in the brain or the CNS. The word biomarker is short for biological markers. Biomarkers are measurable indicators of a biological process. Biomarkers can usually be measured through external testing such as tests of blood, urine or other body fluids such as cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) or can be measured by scans or other physical tests. Often the term biomarker is used to describe indicators which are observable during disease, or a factor which may predict disease onset. Biomarkers may also been used during clinical trials to determine whether treatment being tested is working. MS attacks the central nervous system, which controls the normal functions of the body, including controlling the bladder. Bladder dysfunction is a breakdown in the communication between nerves and the bladder. The blood-brain barrier is a selective barrier that separates the circulating blood from the fluid that surrounds the tissue of the brain and spinal cord. A common symptom of MS is brain fog, or brain haze. It is a term used to describe the forgetfulness, trouble concentrating, and confusion. Brain tissue refers to any cells or connective tissue that make up the brain. Brain tissue is further subdivided into two categories, grey matter or white matter. The grey matter is the part that contains the main body of the nerve cells, and the white matter is mainly made up of axons or the projections that nerves cells use to connect and communicate with other nerve cells. The central nervous system refers to the brain, spinal cord and optic nerves. It is named the central nervous system because it integrates information it receives from all of our senses, and coordinates and influences the activity of all the parts of the body. Clinically Isolated Syndrome is diagnosed when a person has only experienced a single episode of neurologic symptoms (such as visual blurriness, numbness, tingling and weakness of the limbs).  It is caused by inflammation and/or loss of the myelin sheath that covers the nerve fibres. It can be associated with future development of MS, but is not always associated with the development of MS. A diagnosis of MS can only be made if a person has experienced two or more attacks occur separated by time (for example 2 months) and affecting different parts of the central nervous system. The central nervous system (CNS) refers to the brain, spinal cord and optic nerves. It is named the central nervous system because it integrates information it receives from all of our senses, and coordinates and influences the activity of all the parts of the body. Cognitive Impairment is the noticeable decline in memory, learning, language, thinking or judgment, and memory. AKA as brain fog. A permanent shortening of the muscles and tendons adjacent to a joint, which can result from severe, untreated spasticity and interferes with movement around the joint. An experiment or clinical trial in which two groups are used for comparison purposes. This includes drug trials where one groups of participants are given a substance or treatment whereas the other group (the control group) are not, or are given a mock treatment. Messenger chemicals produced by immune cells, to influence the activity of other cells. The process where the protective myelin sheath which surrounds nerve fibres is attacked and destroyed during an active phase of MS. A mental health condition characterised by a persistently depressed mood or loss of interest in activities, causing significant impairment in daily life. Disease Modifying Drugs (DMD) or Disease Modifying Therapies (DMT) are treatments which slow down or reduce the damage caused by MS, as opposed to symptom modifying treatments which work to control the symptoms. Short for deoxyribonucleic acid, DNA constitutes the chemical basis for genes, the basic units of heredity. A study in which none of the participants nor examining doctors, know who is taking the test drug and who is taking control agent (also known as a simulated medication or placebo). The purpose of this research design is to avoid inadvertent bias of the test results. This is considered the gold standard for clinical trial design. The double-blind refers to neither the patient nor the treating doctor knowing whether a patient is receiving active treatment or not until the completion of the trial Dysathria is a reduced control of the speech muscles resulting in slurred speech. It is often associated with damage to the nervous system. Dysesthesia is an unpleasant abnormal sense of touch. It can present as pain – Allodymia, but it may also present as abnormal response to touch such as burning, wetness, itching, electric shock, pins and needles, and can affect any body part. Dysmetria is the lack of coordination of movement, and is a subtype of ataxia. Dysmetria is characterised by when the limb undershoots or overshoots the intended position. It is sometimes described as an inability to judge distance or scale. Dysphagia is problem swallowing, which can be a symptom of MS resulting from loss of control over the muscles controlling the pharynx or oesophagus (the tube leading from the mouth to the stomach), or loss of sensation of the pharynx, leading to disruption to the swallowing mechanism. Dysphonia is the weakness or spasticity of the muscles that control the voice, resulting the issues with producing the voice. This can include issues with pitch control and hoarseness of the voice amongst other symptoms. Encephalomyelitis is inflammation of the brain and spinal cord, a characteristic of MS. Epigenetics means on top of genetics. It refers to external modifications to DNA that turn genes ""on"" or ""off."" These modifications do not change the DNA sequence, but instead, they affect how cells ""read"" genes. A flareup or relapse is a period of worsening symptoms that can either be new symptoms or the return or worsening of existing ones. The EDSS is a scoring system for quantifying the impairment brought on by MS. It includes measurements assessing weakness of limbs, tremor, speech and swallowing difficulties, numbness, bowel and bladder function and visual function amongst others. It is a scale from 0 to 10, where 0 = no impairment, 10 = the greatest severity. EAE is an animal model where the mice develop an MS-like illness (an autoimmune demyelination disease), where the animal’s immune system is deliberately made to target the nerve myelin sheath. Mice with EAE are the most common laboratory model of MS used in research. Is a feeling of constant tiredness or weakness and can be physical, mental or a combination of both. It is distinct from and more debilitating than general feelings of sleepiness or physical tiredness. Fatigue is the most commonly reported symptom of MS. A flareup or relapse is a period of worsening symptoms that can either be new symptoms or the return or worsening of existing ones. The Food and Drug Administration is an American government agency which is responsible for regulating and supervising the use of medications and medical devices. One of its roles is to certify medications. Medications are typically submitted to either the FDA or the European equivalent the European Medicines Agency (EMA) before they being submitted to the Australian equivalent known as the Therapeutic Goods Agency (TGA). Free radicals are highly reactive chemicals that can react and damage DNA and proteins within the body. They are by-products of the energy producing mechanism of cells. The body produces antioxidants to help counteract free radicals. Gd is an abbreviation for Gadolinium, a chemical which is sometimes injected into a person’s blood during an MRI. Gadolinium normally cannot pass from the bloodstream into the brain, however during an MS relapse the blood brain barrier is disrupted, allowing gadolinium to enter into the brain where it enters MS lesions, creating a bright spot on an MRI. It is therefore used to identify ‘active’ lesions in the brain to distinguish them from old lesions (scars) or repairing lesions. A gene is the basic physical and functional unit of heredity. Genes, which are made up of DNA, encode instructions to make molecules called proteins. Genetic susceptibility or genetic risk or predisposition is an increased likelihood of developing a particular disease based on an individual’s genetic makeup.  It may be determined by just one gene or by a combination of many genes. Glial cells, sometimes called simply glia, are non-neuronal cells that provide support and protection for neurons in the central and peripheral nervous systems. Hypogeusia is a reduction in ability to detect sweet, sour, bitter, or salty tastes. From a therapeutic point of view, immunomodulation refers to any process in which an immune response is altered. MS can disrupt the nerve signalling between the central nervous system and the bladder, disrupting the control of the movement of urine, causing urine to leave the body at any stage. Inflammation is when the immune system acts to defend the body against invading microbes or to heal damaged tissue. In the skin, inflammation is typically associated with redness, heat, swelling and pain. Is a type of interferon. Interferons are signalling molecules (cytokine) that are found naturally in the body. They are released by cells in response to the presence of foreign objects. Interferon beta can also be manufactured as a drug and is used as a treatment for MS; it is thought act to reduce MS symptoms by modulating inflammatory signals. An injection or infusion of medicines into the fluid filled canal in the spinal cord or the fluid that surrounds the spinal cord. This allows the medicine to directly reach the cerebrospinal fluid that bathes the spinal cord and brain. It is sometimes used to deliver anesthetics or pain relief medicines or certain types of chemotherapy. This drug delivery method allows certain drugs to reach the brain without being stopped or blocked by the ‘[blood-brain barrier]’ – the blood-brain barrier is a barrier that lines the blood vessels in the brain and spinal cord that selectively allows only certain cells and chemicals through to protect the brain. An injection or infusion of medicines directly into a vein in the body. This drug delivery method allows drugs to reach the body that would otherwise be digested or broken down if given as a pill or tablet. It also allows higher doses of medicines to be delivered straight into the blood stream. A lesion is an area of abnormal tissue or scarring (sclerosis) of the brain tissue or spinal cord due to a previous inflammatory attack. In MS these are typically detected during life by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). They can also be seen in post mortem tissue using specialised tissue staining and microscope techniques. A lumbar puncture is a diagnostic test for multiple sclerosis that involves removing and analysing a sample of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), the fluid that surrounds the brain and spinal cord within the skull and backbone. It is also known as a spinal tap. The fluid is then examined to see whether there is a higher than normal white blood cell count and/or higher levels of antibodies (also known as oligoclonal bands due to the test carried out on the fluid). Lymphocytes are cells of the immune system. They are small cells found in the blood that circulate through the body looking for foreign objects/microorganisms. They further subgroup into two major groups B-lymphocytes and T-lymphocytes. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a medical imaging procedure. It uses a magnetic field and radio waves to take pictures of the inside of the body. It is particularly useful to collect pictures of soft tissue such as the brain or spinal cord which can reveal tell-tale MS scars (lesions) on the brain or spinal cord. Methylation is a biochemical process in cells where a chemical tag (a methyl group) is added to DNA. This is a form of epigenetics, or another layer of control over the DNA in cells changing the genes which cells use. Microglia are a special type of immune cell located throughout the brain and spinal cord. They help in defending the brain and spinal cord from infection by engulfing and digests debris, foreign substances, microbes and if needed can attract other cells in the immune system to mount a full response. Mitochondria are small sub-units of cells which turn sugars, fats and proteins that we eat, into forms of chemical energy that cells can use to carry out their functions. MS Hug is a band of tight pain around your torso that can range from dull and achy to sharp and burning. The pain can sometimes make it hard to breathe, giving it the nickname ""MS girdle."" Myelin is a white fatty substance that surrounds the axon of some nerve cells. The myelin sheath forms an electrically insulating layer. It is essential for the proper electrical conduction of nerve signals along nerve axons. The production of the myelin sheath is called myelination. Neurodegeneration is a term to describe the loss of function of neurons, or nerve cells in the brain or spinal cord. Neurodegenerative Disease is an umbrella term which covers conditions which are characterised by progressive nervous system dysfunction. Neurology is the branch of medicine concerned with the study and treatment of disorders of the nervous system. The ability of the central nervous system to form and re-form nerve connections between the brain and muscles of the body in response to education, or to reroute messages around sites of damage or injury to restore muscle function. Neuromyelitis optica (NMO), also known as Devic's syndrome, is a diverse condition consisting of the simultaneous inflammation and demyelination of the optic nerve (optic neuritis) and the spinal cord (myelitis). While MS and NMO are similar, they are considered to be different diseases due to the specific regions under inflammatory attack in NMO. In NMO it known that the immune system targets a protein called AQP4 whereas the target in MS is unknown. Neurons or nerve cells are specialised cells which are electrically excitable. They process and transmit information through electrical and chemical signals. They are the core component of the nervous system which includes the brain, the spinal cord and peripheral nervous system. The brain’s ability to form and re-form connections. This can be in response to learning or other memory forming tasks, or can be the brain rewiring itself to circumvent areas of damage or injury. Nocturia is the need to wake and pass urine at night. Waking up once during the night is considered normal. Nocturia is a when the night-time urination occurs more frequently. Normal appearing white matter or Normal appearing grey matter Areas of the brain that appear normal under standard MRI conditions but look abnormal when pulsed with specific radiofrequencies (known as magnetization transfer MRI). These areas can occur in white matter regions or grey matter regions. Why the normal appearing areas appear in the brain is unknown, but they can be used to help predict the course of the disease. Oligoclonal bands are bands of antibodies that are seen in a patient's blood serum, or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is analysed. They are an important indicator in the diagnosis of MS. More than 95% of all patients with multiple sclerosis have permanently observable oligoclonal bands. The cell in the central nervous system that makes myelin. The nerve that transmits signals from the light sensitive layer at the back of the eye (the retina) to the brain. Inflammation of an optic nerve, causing blurred vision or other visual disturbances. Oxidative stress is an imbalance between the production of free radicals and antioxidants in your body. Free radicals are molecules that can be produced in the body during normal biological processes and during disease. They contain oxygen with an uneven number of electrons which leaves them slightly unstable and able to react easily with other molecules, sometimes causing damage. Antioxidants are molecules naturally found in the body, or also consumed in our food, that can safely react with, and essentially mop up, free radicals. Paresthesia refers to a burning or prickling sensation that is usually felt in the hands, arms, legs, or feet, but can also occur in other parts of the body. The PBAC is an independent expert body appointed by the Australian Government. It is made up of doctors, health professionals, health economists and consumer representatives.  Its primary role is to recommend whether medications should be subsidised on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. Physical therapy is a therapy using mechanical force and movements, in an effort to remediate impairments and promote mobility. An initial study, often with fewer samples or participants, designed in order to determine the effects and results of a drug, procedure or observation and decide whether further larger studies are warranted. A placebo is a substance or treatment of no intended therapeutic value. Common placebos include inactive tablets or injections, but can also include any medical procedure which resembles an active treatment. A placebo is used to prevent the influence of people’s expectation of treatment, which can impact results. Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) is a rare and usually fatal viral disease. It is caused by a virus called the JC virus which is normally controlled by the immune system, but in people whose immune systems are compromised by either disease or by medications which suppress the immune system, the virus can cause progressive damage to the brain. Primary Progressive Multiple Sclerosis affects about 10-15% of people with MS. PPMS is characterised by a progressive worsening of symptoms and disability without periods of recovery or remission. Proteins are large biomolecules made up of amino acids. They perform a vast array of functions within living organisms. Proteins are the functional units encoded by genes; they are the ‘components’ of the living machinery in our cells. A flareup or relapse is a period of worsening symptoms that can either be new symptoms or the return or worsening of existing ones. Relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis is the most common form of MS; it is characterised by flare-ups of the neurological symptoms of MS, also known as relapses or attacks, followed by periods of recovery or remission. A remission is a lessening in the severity of MS symptoms or even their temporary disappearance. Remyelination is the process in which oligodendrocytes (specialised cells in the central nervous system) recreate new protective myelin sheaths to surround nerve fibres. Secondary Progressive Multiple Sclerosis is a secondary phase of relapsing remitting MS; it follows an initial period of relapsing-remitting MS. SPMS is characterised by a progressive worsening of symptoms (accumulation of impairments) over time, with no obvious signs of remission. Spasticity refers to the feeling of stiffness or involuntary muscle spasms. It can range from relatively mild with a feeling of tightness in the muscles, to very severe with large uncontrollable spasms. The human body is made up of different kinds of specialised cells such as muscle cells, nerve cells, fat cells and skin cells. All specialised cells originate from stem cells. A stem cell is a cell that is not yet specialised, and specialises into a specific cell type. Stem cells can be further separated into categories depending on whether they have started the specialisation process, for example haematopoietic stem cells are cells which can give rise to all the different haematopoietic cells. T cells also known as T lymphocytes, are a type of white blood cell in the immune system. T cells can be further divided into subcategories, including T Helper Cells, Cytotoxic T cells, and Memory T cells. Together they help form a full immune response against invading objects or microorganisms. T1 and T2 are technical terms applied to different MRI methods used to generate magnetic resonance images. Specifically, T1 and T2 refers to the time taken between magnetic pulses and the image is taken. These different methods are used to detect different structures or chemicals in the central nervous system. T1 and T2 lesions refers to whether the lesions were detected using either the T1 or T2 method. A T1 MRI image supplies information about current disease activity by highlighting areas of active inflammation. A T2 MRI image provides information about disease burden or lesion load (the total amount of lesion area, both old and new). The Therapeutic Goods Agency is the Australian government agency which is responsible for regulating and supervising the use of medications and medical devices in Australia. Medications are typically submitted to the American FDA (Food and Drug Administration) or the European Medicines Agency (EMA) before being submitted to the TGA. Trigeminal Neuralgia is pain of the nerve (trigeminal nerve) responsible for sensation in the face and motor functions such as biting and chewing. It can manifest in multiple forms including severe, sudden, shock like pain in one side of the face but can include burning and other unpleasant feelings. Uhthoff's phenomenon (also known as Uhthoff's syndrome, Uhthoff's sign, and Uhthoff's symptom) is the worsening of MS symptoms when the body gets overheated, whether it be from hot weather, exercise, fever, or saunas and hot tubs. Vertigo is the feeling that your surroundings are spinning even if you’re standing still. It is a balance issue commonly associated with MS and its interruption of nerve signals. This relates to the central cavity of the inner ear (the vestibule), which affects a person’s balance and movement. A group of vitamins, important for the absorption of calcium, iron, magnesium, phosphate and zinc. Vitamin D is predominantly generated in the body when the skin is exposed to sunlight, with smaller amounts being derived from foods such as liver and fish oils. © 2021 Multiple Sclerosis Research Australia | ABN: 34 008 581 431 │ | | Website by | Managed by We're not around right now.

In 1994, with his wife Marion, he established the John Dystel Multiple Sclerosis Research Fund in honor of their son, John.  The fund provides for the John Dystel Prize for Multiple Sclerosis Research, which is given to a scientist who has made significant contributions to the understanding, treatment or prevention of MS.   The John Dystel Prize for Multiple Sclerosis Research is awarded jointly by the National MS Society and the American Academy of Neurology (AAN). The Prize is currently in the amount of $15,000. Oscar’s wife of 65 years, the former Marion Deitler, and his son, John died in 2003.  He is survived by his daughter Jane, a literary agent, two grandchildren and two great-grandchildren who continue Oscar’s legacy of moving us closer to a world free of MS. © 2020 The National Multiple Sclerosis Society is a tax exempt 501(c)3 nonprofit organization.

It can cause symptoms that come and go, including numbness or tingling, muscle weakness, vision problems and trouble walking or talking. In this protocol, learn about the causes of MS and what treatments are available. Discover how an imbalanced immune system contributes to the inflammation that drives the disease. Vitamin D supplementation has been shown to modulate the immune response in MS and help improve symptoms, in some clinical trials. What is Multiple Sclerosis? Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune and inflammatory disease characterized by destruction of the myelin sheath—the coating that insulates and protects neurons. This demyelination causes disruptions in neural communication and potentially neuronal death, leading to disability. MS may follow several disease courses, the most common of which is relapsing remitting. Relapsing remitting MS is characterized by clearly defined acute attacks followed by periods of remission. Natural interventions such as vitamin D and essential fatty acids may help relieve inflammation and improve symptoms of MS. What are the Risk Factors for Multiple Sclerosis? Genetic predisposition Viral infection (eg, Epstein-Barr virus) Vitamin D deficiency Hormonal imbalance Exposure to organic solvents Food sensitivities Smoking What are the Signs and Symptoms of Multiple Sclerosis? Note: Symptoms of MS vary widely, depending on the location of affected nerve fibers. Symptoms may include: Fatigue Numbness or tingling in limbs Impaired vision Muscle weakness, clumsiness Loss of balance, dizziness, potential nausea and vomiting Bladder dysfunction Changes in memory, reasoning, and spatial perception What are Conventional Medical Treatments for Multiple Sclerosis? Note: There is currently no cure for MS. Treatments include therapies to calm acute attacks, slow or modify the disease course, and alleviate symptoms. Several experimental therapies are currently being evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration. Therapies for acute attacks: Corticosteroids Plasmapheresis (plasma exchange to remove inflammatory factors and antibodies) Disease-modifying therapies: Beta interferons to reduce inflammation and slow disease progression Glatiramer acetate, an immunomodulator Immunosuppressant drugs (eg, mitoxantrone) Monoclonal antibodies (eg, natalizumab) Dalfampridine, a potassium channel blocker, to increase the ability of nerve cells to conduct impulses Symptom management may include: muscle relaxants medications to reduce fatigue antidepressants What are Additional Therapies for Multiple Sclerosis? Physical therapy Occupational therapy Speech therapy Cognitive rehabilitation Vocational rehabilitation Swank low-fat diet Hormone therapy What Natural Interventions May Be Beneficial for Multiple Sclerosis? Vitamin D. As vitamin D deficiency is a risk factor for MS, supplementation may be helpful. Several clinical studies have demonstrated that MS patients taking vitamin D had fewer relapses and less inflammation. Essential fatty acids. Omega-3 (ie, DHA and EPA) and certain omega-6 (ie, GLA) fatty acids have been shown to reduce inflammation and improve some symptoms of MS. Antioxidants. Oxidative stress may play a role in the pathogenesis of MS, and MS patients tend to have low levels of the endogenous antioxidant glutathione peroxidase. Supplementing with selenium, vitamin E, vitamin C, and/or N-acetylcysteine may boost glutathione peroxidase levels for potential benefits. Lipoic acid. Lipoic acid has been shown to inhibit the activity of ICAM-1, a protein believed to be involved in the pathogenesis of MS. Supplementation with lipoic acid reduced ICAM-1 levels and T-cell migration into the central nervous system in patients with MS. Vitamin B12. Patients with MS may be deficient in vitamin B12. Supplementation has been shown in several studies to improve symptoms and the clinical course of the disease in patients with MS. Biotin. Biotin (vitamin B7) has demonstrated positive effects in patients with MS. Studies showed high doses of biotin improved measures of MS-related disabilities in some patients. Other natural interventions that may benefit patients with MS include coenzyme Q10, ginkgo biloba, green tea, and curcumin. 2 Introduction Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a disease of autoimmunity and inflammation characterized by destruction of the myelin sheath that insulates and protects neurons. When a patient experiences an ""attack,"" or episode of increased disease activity, the resultant impairment of neuronal communication can manifest as a broad spectrum of symptoms, affecting sensory processing, locomotion, and cognition. Scientific research suggests both genetic and environmental factors contribute to the development of the disease. Current medical treatments for MS include potent immunosuppressive drugs, which reduce immune function, and anti-inflammatory medications as well as invasive procedures such as plasma exchange, which attempts to reduce inflammatory mediators in a patient's blood. Largely ignored and discounted by mainstream medicine, nutrients offer immune-modifying benefits that can help complement pharmacological and clinical interventions and improve quality of life for MS patients. Furthermore, mounting evidence suggests vitamin D may be a missing link in virtually all autoimmune diseases, including MS. This single vitamin has the ability to modulate the immune system in ways that even pharmaceutical drugs cannot. A multitude of epidemiological studies have revealed that individuals with low levels of vitamin D in their blood are at considerably increased risk for developing MS; in fact, up to 90% of MS patients are deficient in vitamin D.1 3 Understanding Multiple Sclerosis Within the central nervous system (brain and spinal cord) a vast network of neurons are constantly communicating amongst themselves, and with the peripheral nervous system (outside of the brain and spinal cord), to control every aspect of human function, from sight and hearing, to cognition and mobility. The efficiency and accuracy of communication between individual neurons form the basis for our ability to do things as diverse as complete simple daily tasks and comprehend complex philosophical or mathematical ideas. Neuronal communication is similar to the transmission of an electrical current through a series of wires. Droves of neurons work together to deliver messages to every corner of the body by transmitting signals along their long, cylindrical mid-sections called axons and passing it on to the next neuron. This is repeated until the message reaches its destination. Like electrical wires, neuronal axons require insulation to ensure that they are able to transmit a signal accurately, and at high speeds. Specialized cells called oligodendrocytes provide this insulation to neurons by wrapping the axons in an insulating material called myelin. Without this myelin sheath, neuronal communication becomes nearly impossible, and neurons become susceptible to damage. Multiple sclerosis is a disease which ultimately leads to the inability of neurons to communicate amongst themselves. Because multiple sclerosis is not selective for specific neurons, and can progress through the brain and spinal cord randomly, each patient's symptoms may vary considerably. During the initial stages of the disease, symptoms often emerge for a finite time before regressing for an extended period. 4 Pathology of Disease Progression Demyelination MS is an immuno-inflammatory disease in which immune cells enter the central nervous system (CNS) and destroy the myelin sheath. Immune cells, which become activated through complex mechanisms migrate into the CNS, and attack the myelin sheath. The resultant demyelination is thought to be carried out by T lymphocytes, B lymphocytes, and macrophages, three primary classes of immune cells, which are routinely found in MS lesions.2 Loss of myelin followed by subsequent lack of neural communication and neuronal death is accepted as the primary cause of disability in MS patients.3 Axonal transection, or the severing of axons, occurs under conditions of both acute and chronic demyelination.4-6 Remyelination Remyelination is the process by which demyelinated axons are naturally re-wrapped with myelin, restoring nerve conduction and functionality.7 This phenomenon is the result of oligodendrocytes repairing the damage to the myelin sheath that occurs during an episode of increased disease activity. However, as the disease progresses over years (usually decades) the oligodendrocytes begin to lose their ability to repair the damage, and symptoms become progressively worse and episodes more frequent due to remyelination failure. In addition to developing therapies that slow MS disease progression, many laboratories are developing novel therapeutics that aim to promote remyelination and reverse existing CNS damage. Inflammation In addition to immune-mediated loss of myelin, another characteristic feature of MS is inflammation caused by a class of white blood cells called T cells.8,9 Some of the damage in the CNS is directly carried out by two subpopulations of T lymphocytes called T helper 1 and T helper 17 which produce pro-inflammatory factors.10 Recent studies have identified that chemical mediators, interleukin-23 (IL-23) and granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), contribute to the autoimmune characteristics of these T cells. Data suggest absence of these pro-inflammatory signals was sufficient to prevent inflammation in the brain.11 This suggests that therapeutic strategies directed at blocking the production of inflammatory mediators could be effective for treating MS. Vitamin D and Multiple Sclerosis: A Panacea? Mainstream medicine has failed to recognize the pivotal role of vitamin D in regulating the overactive immune system in MS patients. Greater than 30 years have passed since vitamin D was originally hypothesized to be an important environmental determinant of the prevalence of MS.12,13 During the three decades following the initial linking of vitamin D and MS, evidence has continued to mount. It is now known that MS occurs more frequently in individuals with lower blood levels of vitamin D. A study published in the prestigious Journal of the American Medical Association found that, compared to those with the highest vitamin D blood levels, those with the lowest blood levels were 62% more likely to develop MS. MS attacks occur less frequently during seasons corresponding with the highest exposure to sunlight; since vitamin D synthesis depends upon exposure of the skin to sunlight, the summer months also bring the highest blood levels of vitamin D.14 A recent study has quantified the impact of vitamin D blood levels on risk for MS relapse—for each 4 ng/ml increase in 25-hydroxy vitamin D in the blood, the risk for MS relapse is reduced by 12%. The investigators who conducted this study concluded that ""Clinically, raising 25-hydroxy vitamin D levels by [20 ng/ml] could halve the hazard of a relapse.""15 Vitamin D mediates these disease-modifying effects through complex and powerful interactions with the immune system. Hostile immune cells, which attack the myelin sheath, are calmed upon exposure to vitamin D. In fact, when aggressive immune cells taken directly from MS patients are exposed to the active form of vitamin D, the cells divide and reproduce much more slowly, indicating that vitamin D has the ability to impede the aberrant autoimmunity that is a driving force in MS. However, vitamin D does more than just arrest damaging immune cells; it also supercharges protective immune cells. T-reg cells are specialized components of the immune system that help keep immunity balanced. If too few T-reg cells are present, the immune system becomes overactive, as in autoimmune diseases like MS. Vitamin D increases the number of protective T-reg cells, restoring equilibrium to an overactive immune system.16 In a randomized controlled trial, supplementation with doses of vitamin D ranging from 10,000 IU to 40,000 IU daily over the course of 52 weeks resulted in a reduction in relapses and a reduction in the number of aggressive immune cells in patients with MS.17 Despite robust findings across a range of studies on the link between vitamin D and MS, mainstream medicine and the federal government have only just recently begun to realize the need to initiate federally funded trials. Results of a large scale, randomized, controlled clinical trial to assess the effects of vitamin D in MS are currently pending.1 Life Extension customers should not be surprised if vitamin D emerges as a frontline treatment for MS in the coming years. However, instead of waiting for mainstream physicians to begin recommending vitamin D to MS patients, Life Extension suggests all individuals monitor their blood levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D and maintain a blood level of 50–80 ng/mL. This is because low vitamin D levels are also an emerging risk factor for numerous other diseases, such as type 1 diabetes, heart disease, and rheumatoid arthritis.18-22 The amount of supplementation required to achieve this blood level varies from person to person, but it appears many individuals require supplementation of 5,000‒8,000 IU vitamin D daily to reach these levels. More information about the role of vitamin D in health is available in the compelling Life Extension Magazine article entitled ""Startling Findings About Vitamin D Levels in Life Extension Members."" 5 Risk Factors for MS Genetics and Family History Studies have established a definitive role for genetics as contributing factor for developing MS. The most compelling data reveal that while unrelated adopted siblings have a 0‒2% disease risk, identical twins demonstrate a 25% disease risk.23 Several studies have identified susceptibility genes related to many aspects of immune function.24-28 While these genetic links are helpful in understanding MS population clusters, findings such as the 25% disease risk among identical twins and the geographic distribution of MS suggest that up to 75% of MS must be attributable to non-genetic or environmental factors. Infection Infection is one of the more widely suspected non-genetic risk factors for MS. Data suggest that, in genetically predisposed individuals, exposure to an infectious agent may lead to MS.29 One common theory, molecular mimicry, proposes that presentation of foreign antigens that are molecularly similar to self-antigens leads to an autoimmune response.30,31 In other words, viruses involved in the development of autoimmune diseases could possibly display very similar proteins to the proteins found on nerves making these nerves also a target for antibodies. Investigators have probed the involvement of several viruses including: herpes simplex virus (HSV), rubella, measles, mumps, and Epstein Barr virus (EBV).32 Currently, the strongest evidence for the involvement of an infectious agent implicates EBV. Virtually all patients who have MS are infected with the EBV.32 Further, levels of antibodies to EBV are strongly correlated with the risk of developing the disease.33 Low Vitamin D Levels Considering the regulatory role that vitamin D plays in immune system reactivity, it is not surprising that population-based studies have consistently found lower levels of vitamin D in the blood of patients with MS compared to healthy control subjects. Data from the Nurses' Health Study (more than 92,000 women followed from 1980 to 2000) and the Nurses' Health Study II (more than 95,000 women followed from 1991 to 2001), support the notion of a protective effect for vitamin D against the risk of developing MS. The incidence of MS was 33% lower in women that consumed the most vitamin D as compared to those that consumed the least. In addition, those that consumed at least 400 IU daily of vitamin D from supplements had an astounding 41% lower incidence of MS.18 In a recent study, researchers at the University of California, San Francisco discovered low 25-hydroxyvitamin D blood levels in African Americans with MS as compared to controls.34 The senior author, who is also the associate director of UCSF Multiple Sclerosis Center concluded, ""It seems relatively clear low vitamin D levels are a risk factor for developing multiple sclerosis."" Hormones Studies have shown that MS is more common in women than men, and that the disease course is affected by the fluctuation of steroid hormones during the female menstrual cycle.35 It is also widely reported that MS patients who become pregnant experience a significant decrease in relapses, enabling women who have MS to bear children safely.36 Animal models of multiple sclerosis have shown that the pregnancy hormone, estriol, can ameliorate disease and can cause an immune shift.36,37 Other studies note that pregnant women who have MS tend to experience a rebound of their disease within three months post-delivery.38 These findings suggest hormones can regulate the course of MS, and this theory is further supported by research demonstrating that steroid hormones (eg, estrogens, testosterone, progesterone, and, dehydroepiandrosterone [DHEA]) can modulate the immune system.39-41 The specific relationship of hormones to the disease process of MS is complex, with ratios between the individual hormones also playing a role. For example, during a human study that examined the presence of MS lesions by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), patients with high estradiol and low progesterone levels had more lesions that those who had low levels of both hormones. Further, patients with a high estrogen to progesterone ratio had a significantly greater number of ""active,"" inflamed lesions than patients who had a low ratio.42 These studies suggest that maintaining youthful hormone balance may ease the symptoms of MS. A study from Italy provided further evidence that abnormal hormone levels may play a role in the development of MS. The investigators measured hormone levels in 35 women and 25 men with MS, and in 36 people without the disease. Women with low testosterone levels were found to have more brain tissue damage, as determined using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The women with MS had lower levels of testosterone throughout their monthly cycle compared to women who did not have the condition. Testosterone levels did not vary between men with MS and unaffected men. However, men with MS who had the highest levels of the female hormone estradiol were found to have the greatest degree of brain tissue damage.43 More information about optimizing and balancing hormone levels can be found in Life Extension's ""Male Hormone Restoration"" and ""Female Hormone Restoration"" protocols. Organic Solvents In the mid-1990s, researchers in Sweden evaluated 13 studies investigating the connection between solvent exposure and autoimmune disease. Organic solvents include chemicals such as toluene, paint thinner, and acetone, the latter of which is commonly found in nail polish remover. Ten of those studies indicated a significant relationship between organic solvent exposure and MS. All of the analyses suggested exposure to solvents increases a person's relative risk of developing MS.44 In another study scientists analyzed the occupational health records of more than 57,000 workers in Norway, covering a 16-year period. They concluded that workers, such as painters, who are routinely exposed to organic solvents, had twice the risk of developing MS than those who were not occupationally exposed. These results were compatible with the hypothesis that organic solvents are a possible risk factor for MS.45 Individuals interested in protecting themselves from organic solvents and other environmental toxins should read Life Extension's ""Metabolic Detoxification"" protocol. Food Sensitivities Sensitivities to certain foods may also play a role in the development or exacerbation of MS. Antibodies to gluten, which is a protein found in wheat, is more common in patients with MS.46,47 MS is also most prevalent in areas where consumption of wheat gluten and milk are also high.48 This relationship led scientists to explore a possible link between antibodies produced to bovine milk proteins and the ability of those antibodies to cross-react to the protective sheathes around nerves triggering an MS episode. Indeed, this immunologic cross-reactivity has been demonstrated in the laboratory in rodents that have MS.49,50 Further investigations have revealed that in MS patients, higher levels of these antibodies are produced within the central nervous system.51 Additional studies are still needed to understand how this cross-reactivity plays into the development and progression of MS. To help rule out food sensitivities, Life Extension suggests blood testing such as the Food Safe Allergy test and the Celiac Disease Antibody Screen. Call 800-226-2370 for more information on how to obtain this type of testing. Additional information about food allergies is available in the Life Extension Magazine article entitled ""What's Really Making You Sick?"" Smoking A recently published literature review, evaluating more than 3,000 MS cases and 450,000 controls, supports the emerging consensus that smoking increases the risk of developing MS by approximately 50%.52 It is unlikely that smoking alone accounts for the worldwide variation in MS prevalence, and thus, the interplay between genetic markers and smoking has also been investigated. One such study reported that smokers that have two known genetic markers for MS had two times the risk for developing MS than their non-smoking counterparts.53 Another study has also verified that smokers diagnosed with MS but in remission have 3.5 times the risk of reactivating and progression of their disease than their non-smoking counterparts.54,55 6 Symptoms and Diagnosis MS can affect people of all ages; however, the average age of disease onset is between 20 and 40 years.48 Fatigue, numbness in the limbs, impaired vision, muscle weakness, loss of balance, and bladder dysfunction are frequent symptoms. Symptoms of multiple sclerosis vary widely, depending on the location of affected nerve fibers.48 Symptoms affecting mobility tend to appear early in the course of MS and they may include weakness, clumsiness, leg dragging, stiffness, and a tendency to drop objects. Common sensory symptoms include numbness, sensations of heaviness, tingling, and electrical sensations. Visual symptoms are also common, affecting more than one-third of all people who have MS. The classic visual disturbances, such as blurred or foggy vision and eyeball pain, usually appear early in the course of the disease. MS can also interfere with the nerves that supply the vestibular apparatus in the inner ear, which is where balance is perceived. This can result in dizziness, nausea, and vomiting. In the later stages of the disease, involvement of the genitourinary tract may result in loss of bladder, sexual, and bowel function.56 Over 40% of MS patients suffer from changes in memory, reasoning, spatial perception, and verbal fluency.57 Symptoms of MS are often triggered or worsened by an increase in body temperature. MS is a tremendously variable and unpredictable disease. Different patients will experience different symptoms, rates of disease progression, and responses to treatment. Four Disease Courses Have Been Identified in MS Progressive relapsing (PR) MS, which is the least common disease course, shows progression of disability from onset but with clear acute relapses, with or without full recovery. Approximately 5% of people with MS appear to have PRMS at diagnosis. Secondary progressive (SP) MS begins with an initial relapsing-remitting disease course, followed by progression of disability. Typically, secondary-progressive disease is characterized by: less recovery following attacks, persistently worsening functioning during and between attacks, and accompanied by progressive disability. Many patients with RRMS do develop SPMS ultimately. Primary progressive (PP) MS is characterized by progression of disability from onset, without plateaus or remissions or with occasional plateaus and temporary minor improvements. A person with PPMS, by definition, does not experience acute attacks. Ten percent of diagnosed MS are PPMS. Relapsing remitting (RR) MS represents 85% of clinical diagnoses of the disease. It is characterized by clearly defined acute attacks with full recovery or with residual deficit upon recovery. Periods between disease relapses are characterized by a lack of disease progression. Diagnosis No single test gives a definitive diagnosis for MS, and variable symptoms and disease course make early diagnosis a challenge. Most presumptive diagnoses of MS are based on the clinical symptoms seen in an acute attack. These presumptions are then supported by a combination of diagnostic imaging with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), antibody testing of the fluid found in the CNS, measurements to evaluate how efficiently nerves conduct impulses (since demyelination slows nerve conduction) and evaluation of how the symptoms progress through time.58 7 Conventional Therapies A cure for MS has yet to be discovered, and although recent efforts have brought advances in available treatments, substantial room for improvement remains. Presently, conventional medical treatment typically focuses on strategies to treat acute attacks, to slow the progression of the disease, and to treat symptoms. Conventional Medical Treatments to Treat Acute Disease Flares Corticosteroids. For acute MS flares, corticosteroids, such as methylprednisolone, are commonly administered in high doses to suppress the immune system and decrease the production of proinflammatory factors. These drugs are often prescribed for short periods and can be effective at alleviating the symptoms of MS. Corticosteroids should not be used for long-term therapy, however, because of their many side effects, including increased risk of infection, osteoporosis, high blood pressure, cataracts, elevated blood sugar, mood swings and weight gain. Also, while corticosteroids may reduce the symptoms of the disease, they have no effect on its progression.59 Plasma exchange (plasmapheresis). Plasmapheresis is a process in which whole blood is separated into blood cells and plasma, the liquid part of blood. In MS patients the plasma contains unusually high levels of antibodies and proinflammatory factors that exacerbate symptoms. Plasma exchange helps remove these factors quickly and is sometimes used to help combat severe symptoms of multiple sclerosis relapses in people who are not responding to intravenous steroids. Conventional Medical Treatment to Modify the Course of the Disease Beta interferons. Beta interferons (Avonex, Betaseron) reduce inflammation and slow progression of the disease, but like many medications used in conventional medical treatment of MS, the mechanism of action is poorly understood60,61 This specific treatment may be accompanied by adverse effects such as suicidal depression, liver damage, flu-like symptoms, and injection site reactions.62 Glatiramer acetate. Glatiramer acetate (Copaxone) is an MS treatment that yields fewer adverse side effects than beta interferon while still remaining clinically effective. Glatiramer has a chemical structure similar to the protective myelin sheath around nerves and serves as a decoy for antibodies that would otherwise attack this sheath.63 Side effects may include flushing, rapid heartbeat, nausea, shortness of breath after injection, and injection site reactions.64 Mitoxantrone and fingolimod. Mitoxantrone (Novantrone) and fingolimod (Gilenya) are immunosuppressants. Clinical data show these drugs can slow the rates at which disability progresses and the rate at which new lesions form in the brain and spinal cord. These therapies, however, are not used as a first-line treatment as they can cause severe side effects including heart disease, leukemia, decreased white blood cell counts, and increased rates of infection.65 Natalizumab. Natalizumab (Tysabri) is thought to block a protein that allows white blood cells to enter the brain and spinal cord and cause disease progression in MS. Due to an association with three cases of a potentially fatal infection of the CNS,66 this is a controversial drug that is only available for patients enrolled in the Tysabri Outreach Unified Commitment to Health (TOUCH) program.67 This medication is reserved for people who do not see results from other types of treatments. Dalfampridine. Dalfampridine (Ampyra) is a medication approved in 2010 that increases the ability of nerve cells to conduct impulses.68 This drug represents a new class of therapies that is aimed at addressing neurologic deficits directly. Medications to Treat Symptoms Muscle relaxants. Multiple sclerosis patients may experience painful or uncontrollable muscle stiffness or spasms, particularly in the legs. Muscle relaxants such as baclofen (Lioresal) and tizanidine (Zanaflex) may improve muscle spasticity. However, baclofen may increase weakness in the legs, and tizanidine may cause drowsiness or a dry mouth. Medications to reduce fatigue. Drugs such as amantadine (Symmetrel) may help reduce fatigue. Other medications. Medications may also be prescribed for depression, pain and bladder or bowel control problems that may be associated with multiple sclerosis. Medications on the Horizon There are approximately 20 experimental therapies that are on the pathway to approval by the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA). Investigators are making progress toward developing treatments that may be capable of protecting the CNS as well as encouraging repair of brain and spinal cord lesions. Many of these drugs are potentially valuable as treatments for MS, but are months or years from traversing all phases of the FDA process. Laquinimod. Laquinimodhas been shown to decrease proinflammatory factors and increase factors that promote nerve protection without increasing risk of infection. Laquinimod was well tolerated by most patients, with only a few reports of adverse effects.69 Alemtuzumab. Alemtuzumab (Campath) is an antibody specific for mature white blood cells that targets them for destruction by the immune system. This drug is approved for the treatment of certain types of lymphoma and leukemia. In one study, it was shown to be more effective than beta interferon in reducing disability progression and relapse rate, however, the trial was discontinued early due to serious side effects.70 Fumaric acid. Fumaric acid is a substance that has been used in the treatment of psoriasis and shows promise in MS to decrease white blood cell infiltration into the spinal cord.71 Therapy and Rehabilitation to Improve Quality of Life In addition to one or more drug-based therapies, MS patients will often participate in rehabilitation programs intended to maintain or improve their ability to perform at home and at work. More specifically these programs focus on general fitness and aim to address problems related to mobility, speech and swallowing, and cognitive deficits. Common rehabilitation strategies include: Physical therapy. Practices that aide mobility and functionality through structured physical activity on a scheduled basis. Occupational therapy. Skills aimed at using work, self-care, and leisure activities to foster development and limit disability. Speech therapy. Work with speech therapists can help MS patients overcome speech and language difficulties and help with troublesome swallowing. Cognitive rehabilitation. Assistance in managing difficulties with memory, high order thinking, and perception. A variety cognitive rehabilitation options are available. For example, playing chess regularly is a great way to promote neuronal function and communication; computer-based ""brain training"" programs are also helpful. Vocational rehabilitation. Support in making career plans, gaining job skills, and approaches to remaining gainfully employed. 8 Multiple Sclerosis Nutritional Protocol Most patients that employ complementary treatments for MS do so as an accompaniment with conventional drug treatments and find both classes of therapy to provide clinical benefits.72 The following section outlines key details and evidence-based findings concerning the latest complementary approaches to treating MS. Vitamin D As previously mentioned, mainstream medicine has overlooked a critical missing link in MS management—vitamin D. This hormone-like vitamin is capable of safely interacting directly with the genome to modulate a variety of physiological functions, including aspects of immune function involved in autoimmune diseases like MS. Two human clinical trials demonstrated that individuals with MS using vitamin D tended to have fewer relapses and less inflammation.17,73,74 In a year-long Vitamin D study, recurrence rate of MS ""attacks"" was 27% lower compared to baseline.74 In another large-dose Vitamin D trial, MS patients given 28,000‒280,000 IU weekly were found to have fewer active lesions during the 28-week long study.75 In light of the accumulating epidemiological and clinical evidence of the importance of vitamin D in this disease, supplementing the diet with vitamin D appears to be a low cost means to address this risk. Omega-3 Fatty Acids Omega-3 fatty acids (FAs) are polyunsaturated FAs which cannot be synthesized in humans and therefore must be provided via dietary sources. Both plant and animal foods are potential sources of omega-3 FAs. For example, linolenic acid, found in flaxseed, flaxseed oil, and preferably, fish and fish oils have very high levels of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). A small study looking at the effects of omega-3 FAs on MS found that immune cells from treated patients and healthy controls produced significantly fewer pro-inflammatory cytokines after three months of treatment with 6 grams of fish oil per day.76 One double-blind placebo-controlled study exists to date looking at the effect of omega-3 FAs on MS disease progression. In this study 312 patients were given either fish oil or olive oil placebo for two years. The results of this trial exhibited a trend toward decreased disease severity in the omega-3 FA group when compared with control.77 More recent studies have shown that MS patients given 10 grams of fish oil per day for three months exhibited significantly reduced levels of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), a factor correlated with disease progression, and also had greater concentrations of omega-3 FAs in their red blood cell membranes.78 Other work has shown that MS patients, while on a low-fat diet with omega-3 FA supplementation, experienced significantly reduced fatigue and lower relapse rates.79 Based upon clinical data and patient accounts, omega-3 FAs appear to be well tolerated and safe with no reports of adverse events. Linoleic Acid and Omega-6 Fatty Acids Linoleic acid is converted to gamma-linolenic acid (GLA), a beneficial omega-6 FA, after it is taken orally. However, this conversion is occasionally impaired, especially during inflammatory disease states.48,80 GLA has been shown to quell inflammation and research involving an animal model of MS has demonstrated that GLA administration significantly improved clinical outcomes when compared with control treatment.81 Some studies have shown significantly reduced relapse rates and disease progression scores, while others have found no differences between treatment and control groups.81-83 A closer look at data from these trials revealed that patients with lower levels of disability at the beginning of the trial exhibited a smaller increase in disability over the study period than did controls. In addition, linoleic acid was found to reduce the severity and duration of MS episodes in patients at all levels of disease severity.84 Selenium and Vitamin E Patients who have MS tend to have abnormally low levels of glutathione peroxidase, a powerful endogenous antioxidant.85,86 Researchers in Denmark conducted a small study in which patients with MS were given an antioxidant mixture containing about 2,000 mcg selenium, 2 grams vitamin C, and 480 mg vitamin E once daily for five weeks. Although glutathione peroxidase levels were initially lower in patients with MS than in normal control subjects, after five weeks of antioxidant therapy, levels of this antioxidant enzyme increased five-fold and reported side effects were minimal.85 ""[O]xidative stress plays an important role in pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis. This finding also suggests the importance of antioxidants in diet and therapy of MS patients.""87 N-Acetylcysteine An effective strategy for increasing the body's supply of the powerful antioxidant glutathione is taking the oral supplement N-acetylcysteine (NAC), a potent antioxidant that serves as a precursor to glutathione.48,88 NAC's potential benefit in the context of MS has been noted by some researchers.48,89 In a rodent MS model, NAC was able to diminish clinical symptoms and pathological evidence of CNS injury, and attenuate inflammation.90 Lipoic Acid Lipoic acid (LA) is a dietary supplement with antioxidant properties and has been studied specifically in MS. Reactive oxygen species (ROS), generated primarily by immune cells, are implicated as mediators of demyelination and nerve damage.91,92 Known to cross the blood-brain barrier, LA decreases the activity of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), which is thought to play a role in the pathogenesis of MS. It is believed that ICAM-1 and other adhesion molecules are responsible for allowing certain pro-inflammatory immune cells, like T-lymphocytes, to enter the CNS, paving the way for induction or exacerbation of inflammation and tissue damage.93-95 In an animal MS model, LA produced a significant reduction of demyelination and infiltration of the CNS by T lymphocytes.96-98 Other researchers have followed up on these studies. In a pilot clinical trial, 37 patients with MS were randomly assigned to receive various doses of LA (up to 2,400 mg/day) or placebo. After two weeks, patients were assessed for levels of ICAM-1 and tolerability of high-dose LA. In addition to being well tolerated by patients, LA treatment was associated with reduced ICAM-1 levels and reduced T-cell migration into the CNS.99 Coenzyme Q10 Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) is an antioxidant that is an essential part of healthy mitochondrial function and energy production with potential usefulness in treating MS. Decreased levels of CoQ10 are associated with many disease states, including heart disease, cancer, and neurodegenerative diseases.100,101 CoQ10 was low in patients with MS.102 Several clinical trials of CoQ10 have been performed in neurodegenerative disease, such as Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, Alzheimer disease, Friedreich's ataxia, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.103 CoQ10 is a powerful lipid-soluble antioxidant that is also capable of regenerating the antioxidant capacity of vitamin E in the body. Based upon clinical evidence, CoQ10 appears to be well tolerated and safe with potential usefulness in the management of MS. Vitamin B12 Some data suggest patients with MS have abnormally low levels of vitamin B12 in their cerebrospinal fluid, blood serum, or both.104 In fact, clinical vitamin B12 deficiency and MS share remarkably similar characteristics, occasionally rendering correct diagnosis difficult.105 Notably, vitamin B12 plays a key role in the generation of myelin and thus, for decades, integrative physicians have prescribed B12 injections for patients who have MS. Data suggest patients given vitamin B12 supplements have experienced clinical improvements in their symptoms.48 For example, in the United Kingdom, researchers investigated the effects of six months of vitamin B12 (1 mg/week injection) on 138 patients with MS. The researchers concluded that the clinical course of patients with MS improved after beginning vitamin B12 treatment.106 Ginkgo Biloba Ginkgo biloba extracts are primarily composed of flavonoids and terpenoids and have been reported to have properties that can influence neural activity and improve cognitive performance. While controlled trials of the effects of ginkgo biloba on cognitive function have generated inconsistent findings, more recent studies found encouraging results for patients with MS.107-109 In one study, patients received 120 mg of ginkgo biloba extract or placebo twice per day for 12 weeks. Those patients taking ginkgo biloba exhibited improved measures of attention and reported fewer difficulties with memory. Green Tea (Epigallocatechin-3-Gallate) Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) is one of many active ingredients of green tea that have been reported to have beneficial effects on the nervous and immune systems. In an animal study of MS, ECGC was found to prevent severity of clinical signs by decreasing inflammation and protecting nerve cells.110 According to animal research, green tea has the ability to significantly increase regulatory T cells which are critical to providing balance to the immune system and suppressing autoimmunity.111 Curcumin Curcumin is an active component of turmeric, a popular Indian spice. Laboratory studies have demonstrated that curcumin has potent anti-inflammatory effects.112 A research group carrying out animal studies has demonstrated exciting findings that curcumin treatment results in a significant reduction in disease severity and a reduction in duration of acute attacks.113 In a follow-up study, laboratory researchers found curcumin not only suppressed disease severity, but also was associated with reduction of levels of IL-17 a cytokine that has been directly implicated in the progression of MS.114 Biotin Biotin, a water-soluble B-complex vitamin, is sometimes referred to as vitamin B7. Biotin participates in biochemical reactions catalyzed by decarboxylase enzymes, supporting energy production and fatty acid and myelin synthesis.115,116 The Adequate Intake for biotin is 30 micrograms, and low-to-moderate amounts are common in multivitamin supplements.117,118 Biotin's role in neuron functioning is evidenced by its therapeutic effect in a rare genetic disease known as biotin-thiamine responsive basal ganglia disease.118 Children affected by this disease experience progressive neurological dysfunction, including speech and motor dysfunction, mental retardation, seizures, and possibly death. Early treatment with biotin and thiamine (vitamin B1) appears to prevent progression in most cases.119,120 More recently, researchers have been exploring biotin's potential benefits in patients with MS. In the first clinical trial to demonstrate the potential of high-dose biotin in MS therapy, 23 patients with progressive MS were treated with 100–300 mg biotin daily for an average of 9.2 months. While improvements were not seen for two to eight months after initiating biotin therapy—suggesting biotin may instigate a slow and progressive repair of MS-related nerve damage—vision improved in all four participants with MS-related optic nerve injury, and motor function and overall disability improved in 16 of 18 participants (89%) with prominent spinal cord involvement.116,118 In a randomized controlled trial, 154 patients with progressive MS received either 100 mg biotin three times daily or placebo for 12 months. Thirteen (12.6%) of the biotin-treated subjects versus none of the placebo subjects exhibited improvements in measures of MS-related disability after nine months that persisted through the end of the trial. In addition, only 4.2% of biotin-treated subjects compared with 13.6% of placebo subjects had progressively worsening disability scores at nine months. At the end of the 12 months, placebo subjects were switched to high-dose biotin, and overall stabilization of disability was seen in all subjects at a 24-month follow-up.121 Biotin levels in the cerebrospinal fluid of MS patients have been observed to be lower than those of healthy people, leading to speculation that low biotin availability may contribute to the pathology of MS.122 Although the mechanism of biotin's ability to prevent or repair nerve damage is unknown, biotin may prevent progressive demyelination by improving mitochondrial function, increasing brain energy production, supporting myelin production by increasing lipid synthesis, and affecting gene expression.118,123 Biotin is excreted through the urinary system, and high doses appear to be well tolerated in trials to date.118,124 However, high doses of biotin may interfere with certain lab tests, including thyroid function tests, leading to misdiagnosis of thyrotoxicosis.117,125,126 In addition, the possibility of teratogenicity has been suggested by animal research124; therefore, the safety of high-dose biotin in pregnancy is not established. Swank Diet Dr. Roy Swank first proposed a connection between increased consumption of saturated animal fat and the incidence of MS in 1950.127 He conducted a study which enrolled 208 patients with MS in the early 1950s, all of whom had experienced at least two acute relapses, and followed their progress over 34 years.128 In this study, patients maintained the now termed Swank diet, which consists of: less than 15 grams/day of saturated animal fat, 10‒15 grams/day of vegetable oil, 5 grams/day of cod liver oil, and one multivitamin. Long-term follow-up results from this study indicate that the patients adhering to the Swank diet experienced reduced MS disease activity and progression of disability when compared to patients that did not follow the regimen. While these results are encouraging, this trial is criticized for its lack of a proper control group and un-blinded design. Nevertheless, the Swank diet remains one of the most popular complementary approaches to treating MS. Swank Low-Fat Diet: Detailed Guidelines Saturated fat should remain less than 15 grams per day Unsaturated fat should be approximately 20‒50 grams per day No red meat should be consumed during the first year After the first year, a maximum of 3 oz. of red meat per week Dairy products must have 1% butterfat or less Processed foods containing saturated fat should not be eaten A source of omega-3, a multivitamin, and a mineral supplement are recommended daily Wheat, gluten or dairy product quantities are not restricted, unless they are foods which cause allergies or reactions. 9 Hormone Therapy Because women often experience improvement of MS symptoms while pregnant, hormone therapy using estrogen has been studied as a treatment for the disease. In human studies, estriol treatment (8 mg/day) in nonpregnant women with MS was associated with reduced lesion numbers and lesion volumes and when treatment ceased, these values returned to levels observed before treatment.37 Patients given estriol also had enhanced cognitive function. With respect to immune studies, estriol was associated with reduced pro-inflammatory and increased anti-inflammatory cytokine production and these changes correlated well with the reduced formation of lesions.39 Other studies have shown that male MS patients treated with 10 mg of testosterone exhibited improved cognitive performance and reduced brain atrophy, although MRI data showed no change in lesion formation.129 In another similar study, testosterone treatment in males was associated with reduced production of inflammatory cytokines and increased production of neuroprotective factors.130 There is currently debate among researchers about the role of hormones with MS and how that relationship may be exploited as a means of therapy. Some studies argue for hormone replacement as a new therapeutic approach.131 More information can be found in Life Extension's ""Male Hormone Restoration"" and ""Female Hormone Restoration"" protocols.
