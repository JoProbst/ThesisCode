OA_LLama_126,"The term 'birth suppression' likely refers to a method or strategy for controlling the population growth of certain species, typically through the use of contraception.

Antral follicle count (AFC) is a measure used in fertility assessment and monitoring. It involves counting the number of small, resting follicles in the ovaries using ultrasound imaging. This information can be useful in determining a woman's likelihood of conceiving as well as her response to fertility treatments such as ovulation induction or controlled ovarian hyperstimulation.

It is possible that the phrase 'birth suppression antral follicle count' may refer specifically to a research study or program related to fertility control and management. However, without additional context it is difficult to provide more specific information on what this term means.",126,birth control suppression antral follicle count,-0.003882847260683775,0

Verhagen-Kamerbeek, Deborah Pardue, Katharina Buck, Barbara Timm Research question: What concentration of anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) corresponds to an antral follicle count (AFC) >15 for determination of ovarian reserve? Design: A prospective study conducted at 13 US fertility clinics in women aged 21–44 years who presented for AFC evaluation by transvaginal ultrasound. Serum samples were collected at the time of AFC evaluation (menstrual cycle day 2–4). AMH concentrations were measured by the Elecsys AMH immunoassay; oestradiol and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) concentrations were also measured. The serum AMH cut-off able to detect AFC >15 with high sensitivity was determined (derivation cohort). Clinical performance of the AMH assay at the derived cut-off was evaluated (validation cohort). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses were also performed. Results: In the derivation cohort (n = 306), an optimal serum AMH cut-off value of 1.77 ng/ml was determined to correspond to AFC >15 with 89.63% sensitivity and 69.01% specificity, using the Elecsys AMH assay. In the validation cohort (n = 856), this 1.77 ng/ml cut-off could identify women with an AFC >15 with a sensitivity of 88.34% and a specificity of 68.29%; corresponding positive predictive and negative predictive values were 75.19% and 84.34%, respectively. ROC analyses demonstrated that AMH performed better than oestradiol or FSH in predicting AFC, with area under the curves of 85.7%, 57.1% and 69.7%, respectively, in the validation cohort. Conclusion: The Elecsys AMH immunoassay provides a robust and fully automated method to measure serum AMH levels. Women with AMH values below the cut-off of 1.77 ng/ml are unlikely to have AFC >15.

These multiple follicles can be taken out by (egg collection) for use in (IVF), or be given time to ovulate, resulting in which is the ovulation of a larger-than-normal number of eggs, generally in the sense of at least two. When ovulated follicles are fertilised , whether by natural or artificial , there is a very high risk of a . In this article, unless otherwise specified, hyperstimulation will refer to hyperstimulation as part of IVF. In contrast, is ovarian stimulation without subsequent IVF, with the aim of developing one or two ovulatory follicles (the maximum number before recommending with such treatment). Response predictors determine the protocol for ovulation suppression as well as dosage of medication used for hyperstimulation. Response prediction based on ovarian reserve confers substantially higher , lower total costs and more safety. It is commonly agreed not to exclude anyone from their first IVF attempt only on the basis of poor results on response predictors, as the accuracy of these tests can be poor for the prediction of pregnancy. The response to gonadotropins may be roughly approximated by (AFC), estimated by , which in turn reflects how many there are in reserve in the ovary. The definition of """" is the retrieval of less than 4 oocytes following a standard hyperstimulation protocol, that is, following maximal stimulation. On the other hand, the term """" refers to the retrieval of more than 15 or 20 oocytes following a standard hyperstimulation protocol. The used to predict poor responders versus normal versus hyper-responders upon vary in the literature, with that of likely poor response varying between an AFC under 3 and under 12, largely resulting from various definitions of the size follicles to be called antral ones. The following table defines antral follicles as those about 2–8 mm in diameter: Higher than average rate of IVF cycle cancellation Higher than average rate of IVF cycle cancellation Very low risk for IVF cycle cancellation. Some risk for ovarian overstimulation Overstimulation and Very good overall as a group, but potential egg quality issues The incidence of poor ovarian response in IVF ranges from 10 to 20%. Older poor responders have a lower range of pregnancy rates compared with younger ones (1.5–12.7 versus 13.0–35%, respectively). Also, the other way around, there is a lower prevalence of poor responders among young women compared to those of advancing age, with 50% of women aged 43– 44 years being poor responders. Circulating (AMH) can predict excessive and poor response to ovarian stimulation. According to of , an anti-Müllerian hormone level of less than or equal to 5.4 pmol/l (0.8 ng/mL) predicts a low response to ovarian hyperstimulation, while a level greater than or equal to 25.0 pmol/l (3.6 ng/mL) predicts a high response. For predicting an excessive response, AMH has a of 82% and 76%, respectively. Overall it may be superior to AFC and basal FSH. Tailoring the dosage of gonadotrophin administration to AMH level has been shown to reduce the incidence of excessive response and cancelled cycles. Elevated basal (FSH) levels imply a need of more ampoules of gonadotropins for stimulation, and have a higher cancellation rate because of poor response. However, one study came to the result that this method by itself is worse than only AMH by itself, with live birth rate with AMH being 24%, compared with 18% with FSH. causes decreased success rates in ovarian hyperstimulation. In ovarian hyperstimulation combined with , women aged 38–39 years appear to have reasonable success during the first two cycles, with an overall live birth rate of 6.1% per cycle. However, for women aged ≥40 years, the overall live birth rate is 2.0% per cycle, and there appears to be no benefit after a single cycle of COH/IUI. It is therefore recommended to consider after one failed COH/IUI cycle for women aged ≥40 years. Length of , with shorter cycles being associated with poorer response. for the starting dosage of as estimated from age, (AFC) and endogenous serum FSH taken day 3 of the . An example is given in the nomogram, wherein an age of 32 years and an AFC of 12 gives a point on the middle line that, when continued to an FSH of 5 IU/l, results in a starting FSH dosage of almost 200 IU/l. Nomogram for the starting dosage of FSH as estimated from age, (AMH) and endogenous serum FSH taken day 3 of the menstrual cycle (same as previous nomogram but with AMH instead of AFC). In most patients injectable are used, usually . The clinical choice of gonadotrophin should depend on availability, convenience and costs. The optimal dosage is mainly a trade-off between the pregnancy rate and risk of . A meta-analysis came to the result that the optimal daily recombinant FSH stimulation dose is 150 IU/day in presumed normal responders younger than 39 years undergoing IVF. Compared with higher doses, this dose is associated with a slightly lower oocyte yield, but similar and embryo cryopreservation rates. For women predicted to have a poor response, there may not be any benefit to start at a higher FSH dosage than 150 IU per day. When used in medium dosage, a long-acting FSH preparation has the same outcome in regard to live birth rate and risk of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome as compared to daily FSH. A long-acting FSH preparation may cause decreased live birth rates compared to daily FSH when using low dosages (60 to 120 µg of ). FSH (rFSH) appears to be equally effective in terms of live birth rate compared to any of the other types of irrespective of the protocol used for ovulation suppression. Typically approximately 8–12 days of injections are necessary. Administering recombinant in addition to an FSH-preparation has no significant beneficial effect. in addition to gonadotropins may make little or no difference to the live birth rate but may lower the probability of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome. A systematic review showed that using clomifene citrate in addition to low dose gonadotropin (in a GnRH antagonist protocol as described in the following section) resulted in a trend towards better pregnancy rates and a greater number of oocytes retrieved when compared with a standard high-dose FSH regime. Such a protocol avails for using lower dosages of FSH-preparations, conferring lower costs per cycle, being particularly useful in cases where cost is a major limiting factor. Recombinant (rLH) in addition to FSH probably increases pregnancy rates, but it is not certain if the live birth rate is also increased. Using low dose (hCG) to replace FSH during the late follicular phase in women undergoing hyperstimulation as part of IVF may make little or no difference to pregnancy rates, and possibly leads to in an equivalent number of oocytes retrieved, but with less expenditure of FSH. Before ovarian stimulation with antagonist protocols, pretreatment with probably reduces the rate of live birth or ongoing pregnancy, while it is uncertain whether pretreatment with progesterone only has any effect on live birth or ongoing pregnancy rates. For other stimulation protocols, the evidence around pretreatment with combined oral contraceptives and progesterone only is uncertain. Findings are conflicting, but metformin treatment as a complement in IVF cycles may reduce the risk of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome and increase live birth rates. When used in conjunction with (IVF), controlled ovarian hyperstimulation confers a need to avoid spontaneous , since of the mature egg from the or is much harder than from the . The main regimens to achieve ovulation suppression are: administration given continuously before starting the gonadotropin hyperstimulation regimen. Physiologically, GnRH agonists are normally released in a cyclical fashion in the body to normal gonadotropin release, including that triggers ovulation, but continuous exogenous administration of GnRH agonists has the opposite effect of causing cessation of physiological gonadotropin production in the body. administration, which is typically administered in the mid- in stimulated cycles after administration of and prior to triggering of oocytes. The GnRH antagonists that are currently licensed for use in are cetrorelix and ganirelix. In GnRH antagonist cycles, hyperstimulation medication is typically started on the second or third day of a previous natural . Regarding , choosing GnRH agonist protocol for a cycle is approximately as efficient as choosing GnRH antagonist protocol. Still, the two protocols differ on a number of aspects: Practically, the timing of the hyperstimulation and the day of in a GnRH antagonist protocol needs to be timed after the spontaneous initiation of the previous , while the schedule can be started at a time to meet practical needs in a GnRH agonist protocol. The start of GnRH agonist administration can range from a long protocol of 14 to 18 days prior to gonadotrophin administration, to a short protocol where it is started by the time of gonadotrophin administration. Its duration can then be from 3 days to . A long GnRH agonist protocol has been associated with a higher , but there is insufficient evidence for any higher , compared to a short GnRH agonist protocol.For GnRH antagonists, administration from the day after the onset of has been associated with a higher number of mature compared to starting when follicle diameter reaches 12 mm. Regarding time per cycle, on the other hand, the cycle duration using GnRH antagonist protocol is typically substantially shorter than one using a standard long GnRH agonist protocol, potentially resulting in a higher number of cycles in any given time period, which is beneficial for women with more limited time to become pregnant. Regarding , with the GnRH antagonist protocol initial follicular recruitment and selection is undertaken by endogenous endocrine factors prior to starting the exogenous hyperstimulation. This results in a smaller number of growing follicles when compared with the standard long GnRH agonist protocol. This is an advantage in women expected to be high responders, thereby decreasing the risk of . Regarding subsequent , usage of GnRH agonist protocol necessitates subsequent usage of (HCG or hCG) for this purpose, while usage of GnRH antagonist protocol also avails for subsequently using a GnRH agonist for final oocyte maturation. Using a GnRH agonist for final oocyte maturation rather than hCG results in an elimination of the risk of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome, while having a delivery rate after IVF of approximately 6% less. Unlike the agonist protocol, the antagonist protocol is rapidly reversible because the GnRH receptors are merely blocked but functional. Administration of enough GnRH agonist to compete with the antagonist will result in release of FSH and LH which subsequently increases the release of Estrogen. In GnRH agonist protocol, there is a risk of estrogen deprivation symptoms .e.g hot flushes, vagina dryness. This is because the pituitary gonadotropic cells are desensitized .i.e the number of receptors have reduced. Whereas in the antagonist protocol there are no deprivation symptoms because it’s administration occurs after FSH stimulation has been done therefore there’s increased level of estrogen. Thus, in short, a GnRH antagonist protocol may be harder to schedule timewise but has shorter cycle lengths and less (or even eliminated) risk of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome. GnRH antagonist protocol has overall better results for expected poor and hyper-responders; A study of these protocols in women undergoing their first IVF and having a poor predicted response (by an AMH level below 5 pmol/l by DSL assay), using the GnRH antagonist protocol was associated with a substantial drop in cycle cancellation ( 0.20) and required fewer days of gonadotrophin stimulation (10 days versus 14 days) compared to GnRH agonist protocol. Using GnRH antagonist protocol in high responders has been associated with significantly higher clinical pregnancy rates (62 versus 32%). The pregnancy rate is probably higher with long-course GnRH protocols compared to short or ultra-short GnRH agonist protocols. There is no evidence that stopping or reducing GnRH agonist administration at the start of gonadotropin administration results in a decrease in pregnancy rate. There is a concomitant monitoring, including frequently checking the level and, by means of , follicular growth. Cycle monitoring by ultrasound plus serum estradiol compared to monitoring by ultrasound only does not increase live birth or pregnancy rates, but may be useful in preventing ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS), and may therefore be a used in a subset of women to identify those at high risk of OHSS. or supervising the maturation of follicles is performed in order to timely schedule oocyte retrieval. Two-dimensional is conventionally used. Automated follicle tracking does not appear to improve the clinical outcome of assisted reproduction treatment. When used in conjunction with , ovarian hyperstimulation may be followed by , using (hCG), or a GnRH agonist if a GnRH antagonist protocol is used for ovulation suppression. A is then performed just prior to when the follicles would rupture. It is uncertain if , which is ovarian hyperstimulation without induction of final maturation, reduces the risk of . Perhaps the greatest risk associated with controlled ovarian hyperstimulation is (OHSS). OHSS occurs when, following a ""trigger"" injection for final oocyte maturation, excessive VEGF production by numerous follicles acts systemically. This can result in a shift of fluid from the bloodstream to ""third spaces"", including the belly and the space around the lungs. This can make it difficult and painful to breathe or move, and in extremely rare cases can be fatal. Severe cases often require hospitalization, removal of fluid from the abdomen, and replacement of fluid in the blood. OHSS is most prevalent in very high responders, almost always those with more than 20 developing ovarian follicles, who are triggered with hCG. One means of greatly reducing OHSS risk is to trigger with GnRH agonist instead of hCG. This results in a surge of LH from the pituitary, the same hormone that matures the eggs in natural cycles. LH has a much shorter half-life than hCG, so that nearly all of the LH is cleared by the time of egg collection, or about 36 hours after trigger. Any developing signs of OHSS will typically vanish at that point. However, in rare cases, severe OHSS can continue to develop. Reduced success rates have been reported in fresh embryo transfers when the agonist trigger is used without hCG, so that most centers will freeze all embryos in cycles triggered only with the agonist. Ovarian hyperstimulation does not seem to be associated with an elevated risk of , nor with or when neutralizing the of itself. Also, it does not seem to impact increased risk for . Further information: is ovarian stimulation without subsequent IVF, with the aim of developing one or two ovulatory follicles (the maximum number before recommending in such treatments). It is cheaper and easier to perform than controlled ovarian hyperstimulation, and is therefore the preferred initial stimulation protocol in including and oligoovulation. is letting mature , and with this technique ovarian hyperstimulation is not essential. Rather, oocytes can mature outside the body prior to fertilisation by IVF. Hence, gonadotropins does not need to be injected in the body, or at least a lower dose may be injected. However, there is still not enough evidence to prove the effectiveness and safety of the technique.

c634712f-dc93-466a-b798-1d63d17989e0,"Di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate inhibits antral follicle growth, induces atresia, and inhibits steroid hormone production in cultured mouse antral follicles Patrick R. Hannon, Katherine E. Brannick, Wei Wang, Rupesh K. Gupta, Jodi A. Flaws Di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) is a ubiquitous environmental toxicant found in consumer products that causes ovarian toxicity. Antral follicles are the functional ovarian units and must undergo growth, survival from atresia, and proper regulation of steroidogenesis to ovulate and produce hormones. Previous studies have determined that DEHP inhibits antral follicle growth and decreases estradiol levels in vitro; however, the mechanism by which DEHP elicits these effects is unknown. The present study tested the hypothesis that DEHP directly alters regulators of the cell cycle, apoptosis, and steroidogenesis to inhibit antral follicle functionality. Antral follicles from adult CD-1 mice were cultured with vehicle control or DEHP (1-100. μg/ml) for 24-96. h to establish the temporal effects of DEHP on the follicle. Following 24-96. h of culture, antral follicles were subjected to gene expression analysis, and media were subjected to measurements of hormone levels. DEHP increased the mRNA levels of cyclin D2, cyclin dependent kinase 4, cyclin E1, cyclin A2, and cyclin B1 and decreased the levels of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1A prior to growth inhibition. Additionally, DEHP increased the mRNA levels of BCL2-associated agonist of cell death, BCL2-associated X protein, BCL2-related ovarian killer protein, B-cell leukemia/lymphoma 2, and Bcl2-like 10, leading to an increase in atresia. Further, DEHP decreased the levels of progesterone, androstenedione, and testosterone prior to the decrease in estradiol levels, with decreased mRNA levels of side-chain cleavage, 17α-hydroxylase-17,20-desmolase, 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, and aromatase. Collectively, DEHP directly alters antral follicle functionality by inhibiting growth, inducing atresia, and inhibiting steroidogenesis.

c6b63000-50bd-4830-bd0c-8e2b95c7c706,"Mono-hydroxy methoxychlor alters levels of key sex steroids and steroidogenic enzymes in cultured mouse antral follicles Zelieann R. Craig, Traci C. Leslie, Kimberly P. Hatfield, Rupesh K. Gupta, Jodi A. Flaws Methoxychlor (MXC) is an organochlorine pesticide that reduces fertility in female rodents by decreasing antral follicle numbers and increasing follicular death. MXC is metabolized in the body to mono-hydroxy MXC (mono-OH). Little is known about the effects of mono-OH on the ovary. Thus, this work tested the hypothesis that mono-OH exposure decreases production of 17β-estradiol (E) by cultured mouse antral follicles. Antral follicles were isolated from CD-1 mice (age 35-39days) and exposed to dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), or mono-OH (0.1-10μg/mL) for 96h. Media and follicles were collected for analysis of sex steroid levels and mRNA expression, respectively. Mono-OH treatment (10μg/mL) decreased E (DMSO: 3009.72±744.99ng/mL; mono-OH 0.1μg/mL: 1679.66±461.99ng/mL; 1μg/mL: 1752.72±532.41ng/mL; 10μg/mL: 45.89±33.83ng/mL), testosterone (DMSO: 15.43±2.86ng/mL; mono-OH 0.1μg/mL: 17.17±4.71ng/mL; 1μg/mL: 13.64±3.53ng/mL; 10μg/mL: 1.29±0.23ng/mL), androstenedione (DMSO: 1.92±0.34ng/mL; mono-OH 0.1μg/mL: 1.49±0.43ng/mL; 1μg/mL: 0.64±0.31ng/mL; 10μg/mL: 0.12±0.06ng/mL) and progesterone (DMSO: 24.11±4.21ng/mL; mono-OH 0.1μg/mL: 26.77±4.41ng/mL; 1μg/mL: 20.90±3.75ng/mL; 10μg/mL: 9.44±2.97ng/mL) levels.

1a989ce7-a31d-4562-b073-4fddb9f3284e,"Methoxychlor-Induced Ovarian Follicle Toxicity in Mice: Dose and Exposure Duration-Dependent Effects Tessie Paulose, Lawrence V. Tannenbaum, Christina Borgeest, Jodi A. Flaws Background: Methoxychlor (MXC) is specifically known to target ovarian antral follicles, increasing atresia (death via apoptosis) in them. This is of concern because females are born with a finite pool of ovarian follicles. Only limited studies have explored the phenomenon of a reduced fertility threshold for effect based on the percentage of antral follicle atresia. Methods: In this article, we report on adult female CD-1 mice exposed intraperitoneally to various doses of MXC for 5, 10, 20, and 30 days. In the 20-day treatment, mice were dosed with either the vehicle or MXC at 64 or 96 mg/kg/day, whereas in the 30-day treatment, mice were dosed with vehicle or MXC at 48, 64, or 96 mg/kg/day. The mice that were dosed with MXC for 30 days were also mated with untreated males for a determination of overall fertility. Results: A significantly increased percentage (50%) of atretic antral follicles was observed only after 20 and 30 days of treatment. Specifically, mice treated with MXC64 for 20 and 30 days had an increased percentage of atretic antral follicles compared with vehicle-treated mice. Interestingly, mice dosed with MXC96 had an increased percentage of atretic antral follicles after 30 days, but not after 20 days of treatment compared with vehicle-treated mice. Overall fertility of the mice was not different compared with controls. Conclusions: The results indicate that as much as a 50% increase in atretic antral follicles does not affect the immediate fertility of the mice.

ee826918-8207-42b2-828a-536b75dcc63d,"() is a medical condition that can occur in some women who take to stimulate egg growth, and in other women in very rare cases. Most cases are mild, but rarely the condition is severe and can lead to serious illness or death. Symptoms are set into 3 categories: mild, moderate, and severe. Mild symptoms include abdominal bloating and feeling of fullness, nausea, diarrhea, and slight weight gain. Moderate symptoms include excessive weight gain (weight gain of greater than 2 pounds per day), increased abdominal girth, vomiting, diarrhea, darker urine, decreased urine output, excessive thirst, and skin and/or hair feeling dry (in addition to mild symptoms). Severe symptoms are fullness/bloating above the waist, shortness of breath, pleural effusion, urination significantly darker or has ceased, calf and chest pains, marked abdominal bloating or distention, and lower abdominal pains (in addition to mild and moderate symptoms). OHSS may be complicated by , , venous thromboembolism, acute respiratory distress syndrome, electrolytes imbalance, and . Symptoms generally resolve in 1 to 2 weeks, but will be more severe and persist longer if pregnancy occurs. This is due to (hCG) from the pregnancy acting on the in the ovaries in sustaining the pregnancy before the has fully developed. Typically, even in severe OHSS with a developing pregnancy, the duration does not exceed the first trimester. Sporadic OHSS is very rare, and may have a genetic component. therapy can occasionally lead to OHSS, but the vast majority of cases develop after use of therapy (with administration of ), such as , and administration of to and/or trigger , often in conjunction with . The frequency varies and depends on a woman's risk factors, management, and methods of surveillance. About 5% of treated women may encounter moderate to severe OHSS. Risk factors include polycystic ovary syndrome, young age, low BMI, high antral follicle count, the development of many ovarian follicles under stimulation, extreme elevated serum estradiol concentrations, the use of hCG for final oocyte maturation and/or release, the continued use of hCG for luteal support, and the occurrence of a pregnancy (resulting in hCG production). Mortality is low, but several fatal cases have been reported. Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome is particularly associated with injection of a hormone called (hCG) which is used for and/or . The risk is further increased by multiple doses of hCG after ovulation and if the procedure results in pregnancy. Using a instead of hCG for inducing final oocyte maturation and/or release results in an elimination of the risk of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome, but a slight decrease of the delivery rate of approximately 6%. OHSS has been characterized by the presence of multiple luteinized cysts within the leading to ovarian enlargement and secondary complications, but that definition includes almost all women undergoing ovarian stimulation. The central feature of clinically significant OHSS is the development of vascular hyperpermeability and the resulting shift of fluids into the third space. As hCG causes the ovary to undergo extensive luteinization, large amounts of , , and local are released. It is almost certain that (VEGF) is a key substance that induces vascular hyperpermeability, making local ""leaky"", leading to a shift of fluids from the intravascular system to the abdominal and pleural cavity. Supraphysiologic production of VEGF from many follicles under the prolonged effect of hCG appears to be the specific key process underlying OHSS. Thus, while the woman accumulates fluid in the third space, primarily in the form of , she actually becomes and is at risk for respiratory, circulatory (such as arterial thromboembolism since blood is now thicker), and renal problems. Women who are pregnant sustain the ovarian luteinization process through the production of hCG. Avoiding OHSS typically requires interrupting the pathological sequence, such as avoiding the use of hCG. One alternative is to use a GnRH agonist instead of hCG. While this has been repeatedly shown to ""virtually eliminate"" OHSS risk, there is some controversy regarding the effect on pregnancy rates if a fresh non-donor embryo transfer is attempted, almost certainly due to a luteal phase defect. There is no dispute that the GnRH agonist trigger is effective for oocyte donors and for embryo banking (cryopreservation) cycles. OHSS is divided into the categories mild, moderate, severe, and critical. In mild forms of OHSS the ovaries are enlarged (5–12 cm) and there may be additional accumulation of with mild abdominal distension, , nausea, and diarrhea. In severe forms of OHSS there may be , , distension, (decreased urine production), , and . Early OHSS develops before testing and late OHSS is seen in early pregnancy. Criteria for severe OHSS include enlarged ovary, ascites, hematocrit > 45%, WBC > 15,000, oliguria, creatinine 1.0-1.5 mg/dl, creatinine clearance > 50 ml/min, liver dysfunction, and anasarca. Critical OHSS includes enlarged ovary, tense ascites with hydrothorax and pericardial effusion, hematocrit > 55%, WBC > 25,000, oligoanuria, creatinine > 1.6 mg/dl, creatinine clearance < 50 ml/min, , thromboembolic phenomena, and . in the in a woman with mild OHSS, showing a 33 mm wide area behind the uterus in the , which means there was , that is, free fluid in the . Normally, there is up to 5 ml of fluid in the recto-uterine pouch, corresponding approximately to an area up to 10 mm wide. The ovary measured up to 6.5 cm in diameter. Physicians can reduce the risk of OHSS by monitoring of FSH therapy to use this medication judiciously, and by withholding hCG medication. confers a significant reduction in the risk of OHSS in high risk women according to a of randomized studies, but the included trials did not report the or rates. Cabergoline, as well as other , might reduce the severity of OHSS by interfering with the VEGF system. A systematic review and meta-analysis concluded that prophylactic treatment with reduces the incidence, but not the severity of OHSS, without compromising pregnancy outcomes. The risk of OHSS is smaller when using protocol instead of protocol for suppression of ovulation during ovarian hyperstimulation. The underlying mechanism is that, with the GnRH antagonist protocol, initial follicular recruitment and selection is undertaken by endogenous endocrine factors prior to starting the exogenous hyperstimulation, resulting in a smaller number of growing follicles when compared with the standard long GnRH agonist protocol. A Cochrane review found administration of decreases the incidence of severe OHSS. There was insufficient evidence to support routine cryopreservation and insufficient evidence for the relative merits of intravenous albumin versus cryopreservation. Also, , which is ovarian hyperstimulation without induction of final maturation, does not significantly decrease the risk of OHSS. Volume expanders such as albumin and hydroxyethyl starch solutions act providing volume to the circulatory system Treatment of OHSS depends on the severity of the hyperstimulation. Mild OHSS can be treated conservatively with monitoring of abdominal girth, weight, and discomfort on an outpatient basis until either conception or menstruation occurs. Conception can cause mild OHSS to worsen in severity. Moderate OHSS is treated with bed rest, fluids, and close monitoring of labs such as electrolytes and blood counts. Ultrasound may be used to monitor the size of ovarian follicles. Depending on the situation, a physician may closely monitor a women's fluid intake and output on an outpatient basis, looking for increased discrepancy in fluid balance (over 1 liter discrepancy is cause for concern). Resolution of the syndrome is measured by decreasing size of the follicular cysts on 2 consecutive ultrasounds. Aspiration of accumulated fluid (ascites) from the abdominal/pleural cavity may be necessary, as well as opioids for the pain. If the OHSS develops within an IVF protocol, it can be prudent to postpone transfer of the pre-embryos since establishment of pregnancy can lengthen the recovery time or contribute to a more severe course. Over time, if carefully monitored, the condition will naturally reverse to normal – so treatment is typically supportive, although a woman may need to be treated or hospitalized for pain, paracentesis, and/or intravenous hydration.

The average size of a mature follicle on day 10 is approximately 16 to 25 mm. The process of ovulation begins during menstruation where three to five follicles are recruited, and just one is selected to be the dominant follicle. During days 1 through 5 of a females menstrual cycle, selected or recruited follicles that are less than 5 to 10 mm in size regress and become atretic. During this follicle selection period, the goal is to help grow the strongest ones, so that one dominant one can be selected. During days 5 through 7, a follicle that is of 10 mm in size becomes dominant. It will then grow 2 to 3 mm in size each day. By day 10, the follicle should be anywhere between 16 and 25 mm in size. Just prior to ovulation process, the follicle should be between 17 and 27 mm in size. When ovulation begins, the follicle takes on a rapid growth spurt and begins protruding from within the ovarian cortex. The follicle attains a crenated border and explodes the ovum and antral fluid from the ovary. The selection of the follicle does not guarantee that it will ovulate. There are a variety of factors that stop the follicle from producing ovum. What Features Does Infinite Campus Offer for Students?

032a25d5-6db7-4d46-a245-1c8172c182ce,"— Hormones, hormones, hormones. You’re probably most familiar with ones like , , , , and . And if you’ve been pregnant, you may also be aware of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). So anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH) might not be the most talked-about hormone — or even the most well-known related to reproductive health. But it’s certainly worth understanding, especially if you hope to get pregnant in the future. Anti-Mullerian hormone or AMH is a hormone produced by the granulosa cells in your ovarian follicles. According to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), the production of AMH is reflective of your ovarian reserve. Think of your ovarian reserve as a basket of eggs. You’re typically born with a basket full of eggs, and those eggs get used up over your lifetime. An AMH test can tell you your egg count. A low AMH level points to a or low egg count, which is why the hormone is linked to fertility. In other words, if you have DOR, your basket of eggs is starting to empty out. But here’s the kicker: Low AMH DOR but isn’t definite. And also, AMH does tell you if the eggs in the basket are good eggs. Some doctors order an AMH level as a “fertility test.” But that’s problematic, precisely because AMH doesn’t tell the whole story. That’s why the ACOG says this assessment be ordered for people who aren’t infertile to discuss their reproductive status and future fertility potential. In fact, testing AMH if you’re younger than 35 and not diagnosed as infertile may cause unnecessary alarm, says MD, director of Fertility CARE: The IVF Center, and professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the University of Central Florida College of Medicine. “While it’s possible the results of AMH screening may prompt people to electively , extensive counseling on the true meaning of AMH levels is essential,” he explains. If you’re looking for specific answers about natural fertility, AMH levels aren’t the place to look. “That’s because AMH doesn’t predict natural fertility in any accurate manner,” says Trolice. However, if you’re undergoing , Trolice says AMH can be used to predict the number of eggs you may produce as well as the dosage of medication to stimulate egg production. , MD, REI, OB-GYN of u, agrees. “In a non-infertile population, AMH levels don’t predict the time it will take to conceive, and they don’t predict infertility,” she says. (We know “non-infertile” may sound like a tricky double negative, but it refers to people who aren’t trying to conceive and therefore have no proven difficulty.) However, when used as part of an infertility workup, Scotchie says AMH can help doctors understand if the ovaries are aging more rapidly than they should and if there are fewer eggs remaining. “AMH levels can also best predict how ovarian stimulations will progress when used in creating IVF protocols,” she says. Currently, the best measure for determining ovarian aging, according to Trolice, is by combining your chronologic age, antral follicle count (AFC) on a sonogram (ultrasound), and AMH. AFC counts the number of small cysts on the ovary that represent eggs. Since AMH reflects the number of eggs you have remaining in the ovary, Trolice says AFC and AMH are excellent guides to estimate the number () of eggs you have. However, he does point out that your birthday is the best measure of the of eggs. “While both quantity and quality decline as you get older, age is the best indicator for your pregnancy chances,” he says. Additionally, Trolice says the use of a screening test for diminished ovarian reserve in a population at low risk for DOR will yield a larger number of false-positive results. That means labeling people as having DOR when many may, in fact, have a normal ovarian reserve. So he doesn’t recommend using AMH to predict fertility. In other words, if 100 people in their 20s have their AMH level tested, and 15 of them get the DOR label as a result, it could cause undue stress among those 15 — when perhaps only a few of them will go on to have trouble getting pregnant. Testing for your AMH level is a simple blood test. Since the measurement remains mostly stable throughout your cycle, your doctor can order a test at any time. As a general guideline, the following levels (in nanograms per milliliter) represent the: The above levels are considered conservative estimates, and the cutoffs also depend on the lab. Any results should be reviewed with the doctor who ordered the test. According to Trolice, AMH levels below 1.6 ng/mL predict a smaller number of eggs retrieved with IVF. Levels below 0.4 ng/mL are severely low. While test results are helpful, it’s also important to note that as you age, you have fewer eggs. This is normal! It means AMH levels decrease across the reproductive lifespan. Follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) is made by your pituitary gland and is involved in sexual development and functioning. FSH stimulates the eggs in the ovary to grow, which causes estrogen and later progesterone to rise. A FSH usually indicates low ovarian reserve, while a AMH indicates low reserve. As with AMH, your doctor may order a test to find out your FSH levels in order to determine current ovarian reserve. While can be a helpful tool, most agree that AMH may be a more reliable predictor of ovarian reserve because the levels stay consistent throughout the menstrual cycle — and from cycle to cycle. In general, Trolice says that the more eggs produced with IVF stimulation and retrieval, the greater likelihood for a reasonable number of good embryos to develop and transfer. (When eggs are fertilized by sperm, you get embryos. Not every egg retrieved will necessarily be fertilized successfully in IVF.) “As a woman ages, the percentage of chromosomally abnormal eggs contributing to abnormal embryos increases. So, the lower the number of eggs retrieved, the less percentage of embryos,” he says. While lower AMH levels lower IVF success, Trolice says this is more prominent in women in their late 30s and beyond. To again use our egg basket analogy to explain quantity and quality: In your 20s and early 30s, you usually have more eggs — and more “golden” (good) eggs. In your later 30s and beyond, you usually have fewer eggs, and fewer golden eggs. But a young person with few eggs (low AMH) should still have a higher percentage of golden ones, and therefore better IVF success (more high quality eggs retrieved) than an older person. An older person can certainly luck out and have a lot of eggs left, but a higher percentage of those eggs will have lost their “golden status” through aging and may not result in normal embryos. Scothchie points out that lower AMH levels (<1) are associated with: higher risk of cycle cancellation (meaning your IVF cycle is canceled and your eggs aren’t retrieved) Is there any treatment for AMH-related fertility?  Unfortunately, there are no proven ways to increase your AMH levels. But while you can’t increase your egg numbers (quantity), you can work to preserve egg quality by not smoking and maintaining a healthy weight as determined by your doctor. Both and have been associated with lower egg quality. Remember, even if you have fewer eggs, you can still have good ones — and that will increase your fertility success chances. Other than determining your egg count, AMH levels may help your doctor with other medical conditions like and menopause. PCOS is one of the most common female hormonal disorders. But while many people with PCOS have elevated AMH levels, there’s no consensus by medical societies (such as the ) to use AMH levels as a diagnostic criteria for PCOS. When it comes to predicting the start of , the ACOG says the research on the role AMH levels play has given conflicting results. There’s some evidence that AMH can be used as a general gauge but not as a definitive timetable. One recent found that AMH measurement could help doctors estimate your final menstrual period. Some people believe that AMH levels can help predict the gender of a baby, but Trolice says he knows of no evidence that AMH has any impact in determining the gender of a baby. “Male and female fetuses will produce different amounts of AMH during the pregnancy,” he says. AMH levels help determine your ovarian reserve or the number of eggs you have at the time of testing. As you age, these levels decline. Doctors may order an AMH test as a diagnostic tool to help start a conversation about fertility. But AMH levels on their own can’t predict infertility. If you have questions about your AMH levels or concerns related to fertility, it’s important that you talk to your doctor or a reproductive endocrinologist and infertility specialist. — Medically reviewed by Debra Rose Wilson, PhD, MSN, RN, IBCLC, AHN-BC, CHT Today, the average age of a first-time mother is 26.6 years old.

Birth Control Pills May Make Women's Eggs 'Look Old' Taking birth control pills may make women's eggs ""look old"" in a sense, at least based on two tests of fertility, a new study has found. In younger women taking the pill, hormone levels associated with their ability to make mature, healthy eggs, are more akin to those of older women, according to the study. Women on the pill also have fewer structures in their ovaries that can mature into viable eggs. However, the new results don't imply that the birth control pill prematurely ages women's eggs, the researchers said. Instead, the findings suggest the pill obscures a woman's underlying reproductive status, so tests that are typically done to assess women's fertility shouldn't be done on women taking the pill, said Dr. Lubna Pal, director of the menopause and polycystic ovarian syndrome programs at Yale University in Connecticut. ""Women should not be freaking out that they are losing their eggs"" if they're taking birth control, said Pal, who was not involved in the study. ""These [tests] are yardsticks that should be applied only in the context of fertility assessments."" [] A woman's ""ovarian reserve"" is a measure that predicts how well her ovaries produce mature oocytes, or eggs, that can be fertilized. As women age, their ovarian reserve diminishes, leading to fewer eggs, and fewer that reach a mature stage. Most doctors assess ovarian reserve by measuring the levels of anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH) in the blood, as well as by conducting a vaginal ultrasound to count the number of early-stage structures called follicles in the ovary. Together, these two markers are strongly correlated with how a woman's ovaries are aging. (Women who are close to tend to have lower values on these tests.) In the new study, researchers looked at both markers of ovarian reserve in 833 Danish women between ages 18 and 46, including some who used oral contraceptives. Those women who were taking the pill had 19 percent lower levels of AMH, and 16 percent fewer early-stage follicles. Their ovaries were also much smaller than those of women who were not taking the pill. The effect held even when researchers adjusted for other factors known to affect those markers, such as women's body mass index (BMI), and whether they smoked. The findings make sense from a biological perspective, Pal said. The hormone levels the researchers measured generally increase as eggs gradually progress through the stages of maturity inside the follicles, in a process akin to a production line, Pal told Live Science. ""So, if you suppress the ovarian function, particularly with higher-dose oral contraceptives, you are slowing that production line,"" Pal told Live Science. However, that doesn't mean these women's . Instead, hormonal birth control simply suspends women's egg maturation process in an earlier stage. Women who are pregnant see a similar decline in their AMH levels, which soon rebound after pregnancy, she said. Birth control ""just puts a brake on the whole process, and if you take the brake off, it takes a few months and the whole process is reinitiated,"" she said. Once women stop taking the pill, they are usually within a few months, she said. The findings were presented today (July 1) at the European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology conference.    .

4a9c7d75-587f-46e5-beb8-863dd84f4bba,"Follicle count: So in my baseline scan... - Fertility Network UK So in my baseline scan I had 6 follicles, 2 on left that are less than 6mm and 4 on right between 6 and 8mm. I can't help but be totally disappointed. I have DOR so I know I have less than other women my age (33) but I thought I'd have more than that. Am I being stupid to be disappointed? Can I still get an ok number of eggs from that many follicles? Eugh IVF brain overthinks everything! I think you can yes. And remember this is a baseline scan. Once you have EC you may be pleasantly surprised. Good luck xx Of course you can. My friend had only 4 eggs, 1 embryo transferred, nothing to freeze and had a healthy baby from that. You are only 33 so there is a good chance the quality of your eggs is very good even though the count is a bit low. Good luck x Hi claireyana. You're not at egg collection yet, so fingers crossed all will have improved by then. Good luck! Diane Hi I am the same as you and 33! I was told at first scan that I had 7 folicals, in my last scan before trigger shot I was told I had around 10. In the end they got 7 eggs and 5 fertilised. I had one transferred (on my 2WW) and had one to be frozen. I was a little disappointed but remember it only takes one! Just try not to get to disheartened good luck! Xx I was very similar and on my collection they only managed to collect two eggs! When the dr came in to tell me I was devastated but he said it only takes one! That transfer failed but my second egg fET was successful and I’m currently 9 weeks 5 days so try and stay positive and remember it only takes one xx Thank you! This is exactly what I needed to hear. My latest scan was still showing 6 in total, biggest was 13 and the smallest was 5. My doctor was quite disappointed but said he wouldn't cancel unless there are 4 or fewer follicles. I just really wanted to have some to freeze as it's our first round and I know our chances are low. You're right-it only takes one xxx As I said I only had 2, had a fresh transfer and one frozen and my second attempt with the frozen egg had been successful! Best of luck ! Everything is crossed for you x day scan and 8 follicles showed... right not amazing but I wasn't worried, then my 10 day scan... anyone had a follicle count before any treatment started? happy with that! I have one at 12mm already, and then 10 of them are less than 6mm, but that means... I've had day 9 stim scan today and saw 11 follicles 😃 now... Just found out my follicle count is 3 at 34yrs old i wasn't explained the results just given them in Egg collection with low follicle count, outcome better than expected!

807b3f2e-a437-450e-93c5-ebb3b4422b50,"To revisit this article, visit My Profile, then . If you could do without bleeding from your vagina every month, you should know that there are ways to potentially stop your with birth control. “There’s no medical reason why you need to get a monthly period,” , M.D., a professor of clinical obstetrics and gynecology at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, tells SELF. “You can suppress your period for years and years without a problem.” Sure, some people view a period as monthly reassurance that they’re not pregnant or as a way to connect with their bodies. But if that’s not you, and you just want to stop your period, the good news is that birth control might be able to help you out. First, let’s go over how your period generally works when you’re not on birth control. During your , your uterus builds up a lining made of blood and nutrients to nourish a fetus if you happen to get pregnant. If you don’t get pregnant during that cycle, your body expels that lining in what’s known as your period. You might already know that, but the exact way this happens is pretty fascinating and lays the groundwork for how to skip your uterus’s monthly temper tantrum. While you have your period, your pituitary gland makes more follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), which prompts follicles (fluid-filled pockets) to start to develop on your ovaries. Each of these follicles contains an egg. As your finishes, one of these follicles continues to grow while the others are absorbed back into your ovaries. That maturing follicle gives off the hormone estrogen, which makes the lining of your uterus get thicker. At this point, your estrogen levels top off and there’s a rise in luteinizing hormone (LH), which prepares the follicle to release the egg inside of it for potential fertilization. When this happens around the middle of your cycle, it’s known as . After ovulation, the follicle then produces the hormone progesterone to help your uterine lining get thicker and stabilize. If you don’t get pregnant, the egg breaks apart, and your levels of estrogen and progesterone drop. As a result, you shed your uterine lining, have your period, and start the cycle all over again. But OK, it's actually possible to stop your period with birth control. Hear us out, because there are a few different ways of doing this. First, you want to talk to your doctor about your period, your general health, and your options when it comes to skipping your period. There are a few things they might suggest: Some birth control methods are more likely to give you a nonexistent or barely-there period over time. The hormonal IUD is a little T-shaped device that is inserted into the uterus. Hormonal IUDs contain progestin, which works locally to thicken cervical mucus and reduce the lining of your uterus. (Hormonal IUDs also sometimes suppress ovulation, but that’s not a sure thing.) For some people, this results in such little uterine lining that their period straight up poofs and goes away. Since you can keep hormonal IUDs in for between three and five years (), that can mean whole years in which you’re not getting a period. Here’s the thing: You’re not guaranteed to get a period with an IUD or implant. Taraneh Shirazian, M.D., an ob/gyn with NYU Langone Health, tells SELF it totally depends on the person. If you tend to have lighter, shorter periods when you’re not on hormonal birth control, you’re more likely to have no bleeding on a hormonal IUD, she says. “But if you have heavy periods, it’s less reliable,” she adds. If you’re interested in getting an IUD to potentially stop your period, explain that to your doctor. They may recommend an IUD with a of hormones. Either way, you may experience some when you first get a hormonal IUD. This typically abates after a few months but may be annoying in the meantime. This birth control method (sold under the name ) is pretty similar to an IUD in that it secretes progestin. There are a few major differences, though. Nexplanon is a matchstick-sized rod that gets implanted into your upper arm, according to the . As with hormonal IUDs, the progestin in this contraceptive works to thicken your cervical mucus, cut back on your uterine lining, and possibly suppress ovulation. As a byproduct of the progestin's effect on your uterine lining, your period might diminish or disappear. You can keep Nexplanon in for up to three years, according to the , which is a solid amount of time not to deal with a period. But, again, there's no guarantee that your period will cease completely, so talk to your doctor about it first. As with many of the other items on this list, though, you might experience with Nexplanon. Unfortunately, basically everything with some pros has its cons, too. Depo-Provera, also called the shot, is the brand name for medroxyprogesterone acetate, a form of progestin, the says. It’s delivered via injection (usually in your ) every three months. Depo-Provera works to suppress ovulation and thicken your cervical mucus to keep sperm from reaching any eggs. This high dose of progestin involved can prevent the growth of your uterine lining over a long period of time, according to the . The result: “Many women don’t get periods on Depo-Provera,” Mary Jane Minkin, M.D., a clinical professor of obstetrics and gynecology and reproductive sciences at Yale Medical School, tells SELF. However, everyone is different. It’s entirely possible to get your period on Depo-Provera. You might not, or you might get some for months as a parting gift before your period goes away. It’s really all about how your body handles it. Other birth control methods can be used to skip your period—as long as you get the go-ahead from your doctor. Combination hormonal birth control pills use estrogen and progestin (a synthetic form of progesterone) to prevent pregnancy. The estrogen suppresses ovulation, and the progestin thickens your cervical mucus (good luck to sperm trying to get through that) and thins out your uterine lining. “A fertilized egg can only implant in the uterine cavity if there is a cushiony growth of tissue with ample blood supply,” Jonathan Schaffir, M.D., an ob/gyn at the Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center, tells SELF. “If someone is not trying to get pregnant, then it is not necessary to have the lining become thick and vascular.” The most common forms of combination pills have monthly packs containing 21 hormonal pills and seven placebo pills, the explains. In general, you usually get your “period” when you take the placebo pills. This is actually a withdrawal bleed that happens when you stop taking the hormonal pills, Dr. Minkin says. This withdrawal bleed basically mimics what happens in your body naturally when you don’t get pregnant during any given cycle, Dr. Minkin explains. If you don’t want to have your period, you may be able to take the hormonal pills continuously without the placebo days, Dr. Streicher says, though it will depend on the type of pill you’re taking. While doctors generally agree that this is just fine to do, it’s important to point out that this differs from the prescribing information. So if you’re interested in doing this with the pills you take, you really should have a conversation with your doctor first to make sure there’s no reason that they think you shouldn’t do this. For instance, you can’t manipulate your period with progestin-only birth control pills because there’s no placebo week; taking them at the same time every day is central to not getting pregnant. If you’re regularly skipping your placebo week, you may want to ask your doctor about an extended cycle birth control pill like or , which are both designed to only give you a period every three months. Whether you opt for skipping placebo pills with a 28-day pack or take extended cycle birth control pills, be aware that (when you bleed outside of your period) can happen when you first start trying to skip your period, Dr. Shirazian tells SELF. “It’s not an exact science,” she says. “Some women will still spot.” However, it should level off over time, she says. The vaginal , or Nuva Ring, is a round piece of flexible plastic that you insert into your vagina, per the . It works pretty much the same way as combination hormonal birth control pills, minus the whole daily-pill-taking part: It uses progestin and estrogen to suppress ovulation, thicken your cervical mucus, and thin your uterine lining. Nuva Ring is designed to be inserted and left in your vagina for three weeks and then removed for a week. At that point, you’ll typically have your period. If you want to skip that bloody rigamarole, you can theoretically remove the old ring at the end of the third week and put a new one in right away instead of going ring-free for seven days, Dr. Minkin says. Again, you’ll want to talk to your doctor before you do this, given that this is a deviation from the prescribing information. You should make sure they’re on board with that plan. And just as with birth control pills, trying to stop your period with Nuva Ring may cause breakthrough bleeding. Like the ring and the pill, (sold under the name Xulane) delivers progestin and estrogen to your body to help prevent pregnancy. It’s a small, sticky square that you wear on your butt, upper outer arm, stomach, or back, the says, so you can absorb the hormones through your skin. To use this birth control method as directed, you apply a patch and wear it for 21 days before discarding it and going patch-free for seven days (when you’ll get your period). If you’ve decided to skip your period, you would take off the old patch and immediately put on a new one, Dr. Shirazian says. But you’ll want to talk to your doctor first, and there’s also a chance you’ll deal with breakthrough bleeding that makes you wish it were at least happening on a schedule. (See where we’re going with this?) If you just CAN’T with your period anymore, talk to your doctor about the options at your disposal. Don’t wait until you’re looking to stop your period for a specific window of time, like for a wedding or vacation. “Try to give yourself some lead time—if you can give yourself three months, that’s better than the month before,” Dr. Shirazian says. “The longer you’re trying methods to stop your period, the more likely they are to give you no bleeding.” Here’s Exactly How to Find the Best Birth Control Pill for You The Truth About Getting Pregnant When You Have an IUD How to Get Birth Control and STI Testing If You’re on Your Parents' Insurance Korin is a former New Yorker who now lives at the beach.

58317d5e-51ce-46a4-93a8-011c2d66b960,"Researchers detect ""biologically relevant"" AMH levels in human hair samples The prospect of a non-invasive test of ovarian reserve is a little closer following results from a study showing that measurement of a fertility hormone can be accurately taken from a sample of human hair. Anti-Mullerian hormone - or AMH - has become a key marker in the assessment of how women may respond to fertility treatment. The hormone is produced by small cells surrounding each egg as it develops in the ovary and is thus seen as a measure of ovarian reserve. Although studies have not correlated AMH levels to a reliable chance of live birth (nor to forecasting the time of menopause), AMH measurement has become an intrinsic marker in assessing how a patient will respond to ovarian stimulation for IVF - as a normal responder, poor responder (with few eggs), or over-responder (with many eggs and risk of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome, OHSS). (1) AMH is presently measured in serum taken from a blood sample drawn intravenously. The readings represent a measurement at a short moment in time and are relatively invasive to complete. Now, however, a new study presented at the online Annual Meeting of ESHRE has tested the quantification of AMH from human hair and found it to be a less invasive and a ""more appropriate representation of hormone levels"" than from an ""acute"" source like a serum. The results are presented this week in a poster from Ph.D. student Sarthak Sawarkar, working in the laboratory of Professor Manel Lopez-Bejar in Barcelona, with collaborators from MedAnswers Inc in the USA. The study, which still continues, now reports results from 152 women from whom hair and blood samples were routinely collected during hospital visits. AMH measured in serum from the same subjects was used to provide a control, as was an ultrasound count of developing follicles in the ovary (AFC) as a further measure of ovarian reserve. ""Biologically relevant"" AMH levels were successfully detected in the hair samples, with levels declining with patient age, as expected. As ovarian reserve declines with age, so do AMH levels. The AMH levels from hair strongly correlated with both serum levels and AFC. It was also seen that the hair test was able to detect a wide range of AMH levels within individuals from a similar age cohort, suggesting a greater accuracy than from a single blood sample. Researchers explore how different birth experience affect the developing nervous system Earwax sampling could be a cheap, effective way to measure stress hormone FDA approves first oral drug for treating adult patients with advanced prostate cancer Hormones accumulate in hair shafts over a period of months, while hormone levels in serum can change over the course of hours. ""So hair,"" explain the authors, ""is a medium that can accumulate biomarkers over several weeks, while serum is an acute matrix representing only current levels. While hormone levels in the blood can fluctuate rapidly in response to stimuli, hormone levels measured in hair would represent an accumulation over several weeks. A measurement using a hair sample is more likely to reflect the average hormone levels in an individual."" Among the other advantages of a hair test, the authors note that hormone levels are assessed non-invasively, which reduces testing stress and offers a less expensive assay. Testing can be done without visiting a clinic, and thus makes this type of test available to a broader range of women. ""Finally,"" explains Mr. Sawarkar, ""as hair offers a look at the long-term accumulation of hormones, this measurement may allow a better understanding of an individual's hormone levels - unlike blood-based assays, which can only measure the hormone at the moment of the testing."" AMH has so far had an important - though sometimes controversial - role in reproductive medicine. Thus, while its role as a measure of ovarian reserve in predicting response to ovarian stimulation for IVF now seems beyond question, there has been doubting over its broader application as a measure of female fertility in the general population. Commenting on the biology of the test, Mr. Sawarkar explains that hormones are incorporated into the matrix of hair before the growing hair reaches the skin surface, thereby allowing an accumulating measurement of hormone concentration.

Heavy Lifting at Work Linked to Decreased Fertility in Women Heavy lifting at work may take a toll on women's fertility, a new study suggests. In the study, which involved women undergoing fertility treatment, lifting or moving heavy things at work was linked with a reduction in biological markers of fertility. Similar links with decreased fertility were found in night-shift workers, the researchers added. ""Our study suggests that women who are planning pregnancy should be cognizant of the potential negative impacts that non-day shift and heavy lifting could have on their reproductive health,"" study co-author Lidia Mínguez-Alarcón, a research fellow in the Department of Environmental Health at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health in Boston, . However, the researchers noted that because their study included only women seeking fertility treatments, it's not clear whether the findings apply to women attempting to conceive without medical assistance. [Conception Misconceptions: 7 Fertility Myths Debunked] Previous studies have found links between certain aspects of a person's job and fertility problems. For example, a 2015 study found a link between heavy lifting at work and irregular menstrual cycles, and a 2013 study found a link between night-shift work and an increased risk of . Another study, published in 2015, found that female nurses who frequently lifted heavy loads at work took longer to become pregnant when they were trying to conceive, compared with women who never lifted heavy loads at work. However, none of these earlier studies examined biological markers of fertility. In the new study, the researchers analyzed information from nearly 500 women ages 18 to 45 (average age 35) seeking at Massachusetts General Hospital from 2004 to 2015. The participants were surveyed about their work schedules and the physical demands of their jobs. The researchers then assessed several biological markers of fertility, including the number of so-called antral follicles, which are small structures in the ovary that can be used to estimate the number of immature eggs remaining in a woman's ovaries. The researchers also looked at the number of the ovaries produced in response to stimulation with medications (which was a part of the fertility treatment). On average, the women in the study had about 12 antral follicles in their ovaries, and nine mature eggs after treatment with fertility medications. But the women who reported lifting or moving heavy objects at work had 14 percent fewer mature eggs, and 5 percent fewer antral follicles, compared with the women who reported having never lifted or moved heavy objects at work. In addition, the women who reported working night or evening shifts had 24 percent fewer mature eggs, compared with the women who reported working day shifts only. ""These findings have clinical implications, as women with fewer mature oocytes [eggs would have fewer eggs which are capable of developing into healthy embryos,"" the researchers wrote in the Feb. 7 issue of the journal Occupational and Environmental Medicine. Exactly how heavy lifting could affect a woman's egg production and egg quality is not known, the researchers said. Night-shift work may , or the body's internal clock, which could explain the link between this type of work and lower egg yields, the researchers said. The study took into account some factors that could affect women's fertility, including their age, and education level. But it's possible that there are other factors not addressed in the current study that could explain some of the results, the researchers noted. For example, the study wasn't able to take into account all of the aspects of the women's jobs that might impact their fertility (such as stress levels or exposures to certain chemicals). More work is also needed to determine whether avoiding heavy lifting and night shifts could improve fertility, the researchers said.

dea33dfc-a888-45db-94b6-ab4f9631d093,"— Birth control pills are an effective, safe, and low-cost option for preventing pregnancy. As with any medication, you may experience some side effects while taking the pill. Here’s more about why you may spot while on the pill and how to treat this side effect. There are two main types of birth control pills. The first combines man-made versions of the hormones estrogen and progesterone. These are called ethinyl estradiol and progestin. The second type of birth control pill is a progestin-only pill. It’s also called “the minipill.” Your doctor can help you decide which pill is right for you. The combination pill works by suppressing your pituitary gland so that the release of an egg from your ovaries, or ovulation, doesn’t occur. This pill also thickens your cervical mucus to prevent sperm from reaching any available eggs. The lining of your uterus is also altered to prevent implantation. The minipill also alters cervical mucus and the uterine lining. The hormones can also suppress ovulation, but this is less reliable. With perfect use, birth control pills are up to effective in preventing pregnancy. Perfect use means that you take the pill every day at the same time. It doesn’t account for any late, missed, or skipped doses of the medication. With typical use, which allows for some error, the pill is about effective. For the best results, you should aim to take your birth control pills at the same time every day. It’s important to remember that birth control pills don’t protect against sexually transmitted infections (STIs), so you should always use condoms. You should also keep up with annual well woman visits for screenings. The pill is a popular birth control option partly because of it’s limited side effects. Even if you do experience side effects after starting the pill, these symptoms are usually temporary. Spotting is one such symptom. Irregular bleeding or spotting is common in the first three to four months after you start taking the pill. This should subside once your body adjusts to the medication. You may experience spotting later on if you’ve missed or skipped a dose. If this bleeding becomes heavy, don’t stop taking your medication. Continue taking your pill as prescribed and contact your doctor. Many women find that their body adjusts to the pill after a few months and symptoms subside. Although some women may experience spotting the entire time they’re on birth control pills, this side effect typically decreases in severity after about four months of use. In many cases, the cause of the spotting is unknown and harmless. The estrogen in combination pills helps to stabilize the lining of the uterus. This can prevent irregular bleeding and spotting. Women who take progestin-only pills may experience more frequent spotting. an interaction with another medication or supplement missing or skipping doses, which causes hormone levels to fluctuate vomiting or diarrhea, which can prevent proper drug absorption It’s particularly important to pay attention to spotting if you’ve missed doses of your medication and have had unprotected sex. Irregular bleeding with cramps can also be a sign of pregnancy or miscarriage and may require medical attention. Women who take progestin-only pills are at higher risk of spotting. You may have an increased risk of spotting while on the pill if you smoke cigarettes. Let your doctor know of any smoking habits before you get a prescription so you can chat about the potential complications. Women who take continuous birth control pills may also be at a higher risk of spotting. These pills include Seasonale, Seasonique, and Quartette. Occasionally, your doctor may advise you to take a short break from the continuous cycle of hormones to allow your body to have a short period. This may help resolve any irregular bleeding. The pill is also associated with an increased risk of blood clotting. Blood clotting can lead to: The overall risk for blood clotting is low unless you: Your doctor can help you select a birth control option with the least risk. Most cases of spotting while on the pill are temporary and will resolve over time. If you’re concerned, contact your doctor. Be sure to let your doctor know if you experience any of the following: irregular bleeding or spotting, especially if your bleeding is heavy If you have unprotected sex after missing two or more pills or have sex with a partner who may have an STI, speak with your doctor. Once you rule out any underlying causes for your irregular bleeding, your doctor may prescribe a different type of pill or form of birth control. Ask about pills that contain estrogen, since this hormone helps keep the lining of the uterus in place. Monophasic pills keep your levels of estrogen stable over the course of the month. Multiphasic pills change the levels at different points throughout your cycle. Your body may react differently to higher or lower levels of estrogen, so only change pills under the direction of your doctor. Alternatively, your doctor may prescribe a pill with a low dose of estrogen if you’d rather stay on a progestin-only pill. These pills are safe, and your doctor will give you instructions on when to take them for the best results. Spotting typically resolves after the first three to four months of using birth control pills. If you’re spotting and still in this window of time, try your best to stick it out. One of the best ways to prevent or reduce spotting while on the pill is to take your medication at the same time each day. This helps regulate your hormone levels. Wearing panty liners can help prevent unexpected accidents and stained clothing. Be sure to pay attention to your bleeding and other symptoms. Heavy bleeding isn’t a normal reaction to the pill. If it happens, you should make an appointment with your doctor. Though spotting is a nuisance, birth control pills are a safe, effective form of contraception. If you find that birth control pills aren’t the right match for you, don’t fret. There are many different types of birth control options available today. Your doctor can help you find the best fit for your body and your lifestyle.

92ec9e67-295f-4125-934a-0b75d953e987,"Pergoveris 150 IU/75 IU powder and solvent for solution for injection Summary of Product Characteristics Updated 17-Sep-2018 | Merck 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 6.6 Special precautions for disposal and other handling 9. Date of first authorisation/renewal of the authorisation Pergoveris 150 IU/75 IU powder and solvent for solution for injection One vial contains 150 IU (equivalent to 11 micrograms) of follitropin alfa* (r-hFSH) and 75 IU (equivalent to 3 micrograms) of lutropin alfa* (r-hLH). After reconstitution, each mL of the solution contains 150 IU r-hFSH and 75 IU r-hLH per milliliter. * produced in genetically engineered Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. Pergoveris is indicated for the stimulation of follicular development in adult women with severe LH and FSH deficiency. In clinical trials, these patients were defined by an endogenous serum LH level < 1.2 IU/L. Treatment with Pergoveris should be initiated under the supervision of a physician experienced in the treatment of fertility problems. In LH and FSH deficient women (hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism), the objective of Pergoveris therapy is to develop a single mature Graafian follicle from which the oocyte will be liberated after the administration of human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG). Pergoveris should be given as a course of daily injections. Since these patients are amenorrhoeic and have low endogenous oestrogen secretion, treatment can commence at any time. Treatment should be tailored to the individual patient's response as assessed by measuring follicle size by ultrasound and oestrogen response. A recommended regimen commences with one vial of Pergoveris daily. If less than one vial daily is used, the follicular response may be unsatisfactory because the amount of lutropin alfa may be insufficient (see section 5.1). If an FSH dose increase is deemed appropriate, dose adaptation should preferably be after 7-14 day intervals and preferably by 37.5-75 IU increments using a licensed follitropin alfa preparation. It may be acceptable to extend the duration of stimulation in any one cycle to up to 5 weeks. When an optimal response is obtained, a single injection of 250 micrograms of r-hCG or 5,000 IU to 10,000 IU hCG should be administered 24-48 hours after the last Pergoveris injection. The patient is recommended to have coitus on the day of, and on the day following, hCG administration. Alternatively, intrauterine insemination (IUI) may be performed. Luteal phase support may be considered since lack of substances with luteotrophic activity (LH/hCG) after ovulation may lead to premature failure of the corpus luteum. If an excessive response is obtained, treatment should be stopped and hCG withheld. Treatment should recommence in the next cycle at a dose of FSH lower than that of the previous cycle. There is no relevant indication for the use of Pergoveris in the elderly population. Safety and effectiveness of this medicinal product in elderly patients have not been established. Safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetics of this medicinal product in patients with renal or hepatic impairment have not been established. There is no relevant use of this medicinal product in the paediatric population. Pergoveris is intended for subcutaneous administration. The first injection should be performed under direct medical supervision. The powder should be reconstituted immediately prior to use with the solvent provided. Self-administration should only be performed by patients who are well motivated, adequately trained and with access to expert advice. For further instructions on reconstitution of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6. • hypersensitivity to the active substances or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1 • tumours of the hypothalamus and pituitary gland • ovarian enlargement or ovarian cyst unrelated to polycystic ovarian disease and of unknown origin • gynaecological haemorrhages of unknown origin Pergoveris must not be used when an effective response cannot be obtained, such as: • malformations of sexual organs incompatible with pregnancy • fibroid tumours of the uterus incompatible with pregnancy Pergoveris contains potent gonadotrophic substances capable of causing mild to severe adverse reactions, and should only be used by physicians who are thoroughly familiar with infertility problems and their management. Gonadotrophin therapy requires a certain time commitment by physicians and supportive health care professionals, as well as the availability of appropriate monitoring facilities. In women, safe and effective use of Pergoveris calls for monitoring of ovarian response with ultrasound, alone or preferably in combination with measurement of serum oestradiol levels, on a regular basis. There may be a degree of interpatient variability in response to FSH/LH administration, with a poor response to FSH/LH in some patients. The lowest effective dose in relation to the treatment objective should be used in women. Patients with porphyria or a family history of porphyria should be closely monitored during treatment with Pergoveris. In these patients, Pergoveris may increase the risk of an acute attack. Deterioration or a first appearance of this condition may require cessation of treatment. Before starting treatment, the couple's infertility should be assessed as appropriate and putative contraindications for pregnancy evaluated. In particular, patients should be evaluated for hypothyroidism, adrenocortical deficiency, hyperprolactinemia and appropriate specific treatment should be given. Patients undergoing stimulation of follicular growth are at an increased risk of developing hyperstimulation in view of possible excessive oestrogen response and multiple follicular development. A certain degree of ovarian enlargement is an expected effect of controlled ovarian stimulation. It is more commonly seen in women with polycystic ovarian syndrome and usually regresses without treatment. In distinction to uncomplicated ovarian enlargement, OHSS is a condition that can manifest itself with increasing degrees of severity. It comprises marked ovarian enlargement, high serum sex steroids, and an increase in vascular permeability which can result in an accumulation of fluid in the peritoneal, pleural and, rarely, in the pericardial cavities. The following symptomatology may be observed in severe cases of OHSS: abdominal pain, abdominal distension, severe ovarian enlargement, weight gain, dyspnoea, oliguria and gastrointestinal symptoms including nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea. Clinical evaluation may reveal hypovolaemia, haemoconcentration, electrolyte imbalances, ascites, haemoperitoneum, pleural effusions, hydrothorax, or acute pulmonary distress, and thromboembolic events. Very rarely, severe OHSS may be complicated by ovarian torsion or thromboembolic events such as pulmonary embolism, ischaemic stroke or myocardial infarction. Independent risk factors for developing OHSS include young age, lean body mass, polycystic ovarian syndrome, higher doses of exogenous gonadotrophins, high absolute or rapidly rising serum oestradiol level (> 900 pg/mL or > 3,300 pmol/L in anovulation), previous episodes of OHSS and large number of developing ovarian follicles (3 follicles of ≥ 14 mm in diameter in anovulation). Adherence to recommended Pergoveris and FSH dosage and regimen of administration can minimise the risk of ovarian hyperstimulation. Monitoring of stimulation cycles by ultrasound scans as well as oestradiol measurements are recommended to early identify risk factors. There is evidence to suggest that hCG plays a key role in triggering OHSS and that the syndrome may be more severe and more protracted if pregnancy occurs. Therefore, if signs of OHSS occur such as serum oestradiol level > 5,500 pg/mL or > 20,200 pmol/L and/or ≥ 40 follicles in total, it is recommended that hCG be withheld and the patient be advised to refrain from coitus or to use barrier contraceptive methods for at least 4 days. OHSS may progress rapidly (within 24 hours) or over several days to become a serious medical event. It most often occurs after hormonal treatment has been discontinued and reaches its maximum at about seven to ten days following treatment. Usually, OHSS resolves spontaneously with the onset of menses. Therefore patients should be followed for at least two weeks after hCG administration. If severe OHSS occurs, gonadotropin treatment should be stopped if still ongoing. The patient should be hospitalised and specific therapy for OHSS started. This syndrome occurs with higher incidence in patients with polycystic ovarian disease. When a risk of OHSS is assumed, treatment discontinuation should be considered. Ovarian torsion has been reported after treatment with other gonadotropins. This may be associated with other risk factors such as OHSS, pregnancy, previous abdominal surgery, past history of ovarian torsion, previous or current ovarian cyst and polycystic ovarian syndrome. Damage to the ovary due to reduced blood supply can be limited by early diagnosis and immediate detorsion. In patients undergoing induction of ovulation, the incidence of multiple pregnancies and births is increased compared with natural conception. The majority of multiple conceptions are twins. Multiple pregnancy, especially high order, carry an increased risk of adverse maternal and perinatal outcomes. To minimise the risk of multiple pregnancy, careful monitoring of ovarian response is recommended. The patients should be advised of the potential risk of multiple births before starting treatment. When risk of multiple pregnancies is assumed, treatment discontinuation should be considered. The incidence of pregnancy loss by miscarriage or abortion is higher in patients undergoing stimulation of follicular growth for ovulation induction than in the normal population. Women with a history of tubal disease are at risk of ectopic pregnancy, whether the pregnancy is obtained by spontaneous conception or with fertility treatments. The prevalence of ectopic pregnancy after assisted reproductive technologies (ART) was reported to be higher than in the general population. There have been reports of ovarian and other reproductive system neoplasms, both benign and malignant, in women who have undergone multiple regimens for infertility treatment. It is not yet established whether or not treatment with gonadotropins increases the risk of these tumours in infertile women. The prevalence of congenital malformations after ART may be slightly higher than after spontaneous conceptions. This is thought to be due to differences in parental characteristics (e.g. maternal age, sperm characteristics) and multiple pregnancies. In women with recent or ongoing thromboembolic disease or women with generally recognised risk factors for thromboembolic events, such as personal or family history, thrombophilia or severe obesity (body mass index > 30 kg/m), treatment with gonadotrophins may further increase the risk. In these women, the benefits of gonadotrophin administration need to be weighed against the risks. It should be noted however, that pregnancy itself as well as OHSS also carries an increased risk of thromboembolic events. Pergoveris contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i.e. essentially “sodium-free”. 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction Pergoveris should not be administered as a mixture with other medicinal products, in the same injection, except follitropin alfa for which studies have shown that co-administration does not significantly alter the activity, stability, pharmacokinetic nor pharmacodynamic properties of the active substances. There is no indication for the use of Pergoveris during pregnancy. Data on a limited number of exposed pregnancies indicate no adverse reactions of follitropin alfa and lutropin alfa on pregnancy, embryonal or foetal development, parturition or postnatal development following controlled ovarian stimulation. No teratogenic effect of such gonadotropins has been reported in animal studies. In case of exposure during pregnancy, clinical data are not sufficient to exclude a teratogenic effect of Pergoveris. Pergoveris is not indicated during breast-feeding. Pergoveris is indicated for use in infertility (see section 4.1). Pergoveris has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. The most commonly reported adverse reactions are headache, ovarian cysts and local injection site reactions (e.g. pain, erythema, haematoma, swelling and/or irritation at the site of injection). Mild or moderate OHSS has been commonly reported and should be considered as an intrinsic risk of the stimulation procedure. Severe OHSS is uncommon (see section 4.4). Thromboembolism may occur very rarely, usually associated with severe OHSS (see section 4.4). Adverse reactions are listed below by MedDRA system organ class and by frequency. The frequency categories used are: very common (≥1/10), common (≥1/100 to <1/10), uncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100), rare (≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000), very rare (<1/10,000), not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). Mild to severe hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylactic reactions and shock Thromboembolism, usually associated with severe OHSS Abdominal pain, abdominal distension, abdominal discomfort, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea Breast pain, pelvic pain, mild or moderate OHSS (including associated symptomatology) Severe OHSS (including associated symptomatology) (see section 4.4) General disorders and administration site conditions Mild to severe injection site reactions (e.g. pain, erythema, haematoma, bruising, swelling and/or irritation at the site of injection) Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via: Website: www.mhra.gov.uk/yellowcard or search for MHRA Yellow Card in the Google Play or Apple App Store The effects of an overdose of Pergoveris are unknown. Nevertheless there is a possibility that OHSS may occur, which is further described in section 4.4. Pharmacotherapeutic group: Sex hormones and modulators of the genital system, gonadotropins. ATC code: G03GA30. Pergoveris is a preparation of recombinant human follicle stimulating hormone (follitropin alfa, r-hFSH) and recombinant human luteinising hormone (lutropin alfa, r-hLH) produced in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells by recombinant DNA technology. In clinical trials the efficacy of the combination of follitropin alfa and lutropin alfa has been demonstrated in women with hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. In the stimulation of follicular development in anovulatory women deficient in LH and FSH, the primary effect resulting from administration of lutropin alfa is an increase in oestradiol secretion by the follicles, the growth of which is stimulated by FSH. In clinical trials, patients with severe FSH and LH deficiency were defined by an endogenous serum LH level < 1.2 IU/L as measured in a central laboratory. However, it should be taken into account that there are variations between LH measurements performed in different laboratories. In these trials the ovulation rate per cycle was 70-75%. In one clinical study of women with hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism and an endogenous serum LH concentration below 1.2 IU/L the appropriate dose of r-hLH was investigated. A dose of 75 IU r-hLH daily (in combination with 150 IU r-hFSH) resulted in adequate follicular development and oestrogen production. A dose of 25 IU r-hLH daily (in combination with 150 IU r-hFSH) resulted in insufficient follicular development. Therefore, administration of less than one vial of Pergoveris daily may provide too little LH-activity to ensure adequate follicular development. Follitropin alfa and lutropin alfa have shown the same pharmacokinetic profile as follitropin alfa and lutropin alfa separately. Following intravenous administration, follitropin alfa is distributed to the extracellular fluid space with an initial half-life of around 2 hours and eliminated from the body with a terminal half-life of about one day. The steady state volume of distribution is 10 L. Following subcutaneous administration, the absolute bioavailability is about 70%. Following repeated administration, follitropin alfa accumulates 3-fold achieving asteady-state within 3-4 days. In women whose endogenous gonadotrophin secretion is suppressed, follitropin alfa has nevertheless been shown to effectively stimulate follicular development and steroidogenesis, despite unmeasurable LH levels. Total clearance is 0.6 L/h and one-eighth of the follitropin alfa dose is excreted in the urine. Following intravenous administration, lutropin alfa is rapidly distributed with an initial half-life of approximately one hour and eliminated from the body with a terminal half-life of about 10-12 hours. The steady state volume of distribution is around 10-14 L. Lutropin alfa shows linear pharmacokinetics, as assessed by AUC which is directly proportional to the dose administered. Following subcutaneous administration, the absolute bioavailability is approximately 60%; the terminal half-life is slightly prolonged. The lutropin alfa pharmacokinetics following single and repeated administration of lutropin alfa are comparable and the accumulation ratio of lutropin alfa is minimal. The mean residence time is approximately 5 hours. Total clearance is around 2 L/h, and less than 5% of the dose is excreted in the urine. There is no pharmacokinetic interaction with follitropin alfa when administered simultaneously. Clinical studies with Pergoveris were conducted with a freeze-dried formulation. A comparative clinical study between the freeze-dried and the liquid formulation showed bioequivalence between the two formulations. Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety pharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity.

The following will cause bleeding when on birth control: * Break-through bleeding * Withdrawal bleeding * Pregnancy * UTI * Morning after pill * Recently stopping/starting BCP * Missed a pill(s) Can stopping the birth control pill cause irregular bleeding? Its due to the decreasing amount of hormones in your body from the pill. Dont worry. Can stopping the birth control pill cause headaches? Some women may have headaches when stopping the birth control pill. A decrease in estrogen is the most common migraine trigger in women (e.g. menstruation, stopping birth control pills). Can stopping birth control cause irregular periods? Yes it is possible to experience an irregular menstral cycle when you discontinue taking birth control. This is because when you take birth control it actually regulates your period. By stopping birth control you may experience breakthrough bleeding. Breakthrough bleeding is when you menstruate at times when you normally would not begin your menstral cycle. Breakthrough bleeding can possibly last for up to a full period or longer. Stopping birth control may also stop your period for a month or longer or you may not receive your period around the normal time of which you used to when you were taking your birth control.It depends sometimes you're period gets normal after birth control but sometimes it may still keep being irregular. It depends on the person and or pills Can stopping the birth control pill cause heavy bleeding?

Some women will have spotting after missing birth control pills, and others will not. Is it normal to get your period after stopping birth control and then not having it for a month and half? On hormonal birth control your menstrual cycle is suppressed, as you no longer ovulate you no longer menstruate, instead women get a withdrawal bleed due to the drop in synthetic hormones when going from active to inactive pills or stopping the pills. If you come off hormonal birth control then it can take a few months for your menstrual cycles to return thus it can cause irregular or absent bleeding. Can you get your period again a few days after stopping your birth control pills midpack? Yes the bleeding experienced while taking the inactive pill is not a period, it is withdrawal bleeding caused by hormones dropping. Stopping the pill mid-pack will cause the same withdrawal bleeding. Your periods will resume after your uterine lining starts building up and shedding - if you are not pregnant. It takes 4 to 6 weeks from the end of a packet - stopping mid cycle will cause spotting but should not delay your cycle from returning. Start new birth control pack haven't started period?

3c689646-9aae-41d4-bc50-9ce5392eb818,"A birth control pill pack with 21 active pills and seven placebos When the was being developed in the late 1950s, the inventors knew that they could control the length of a woman's menstrual cycle. A woman could have a period every 25 days, 45 days or even 90 days. A dosage of 21 active pills followed by seven pills was chosen because it would mimic a woman's natural cycle. The inventors figured that maintaining a traditional 28-day cycle would help women adjust to the idea of taking birth control pills, and that monthly bleeding would also provide reassurance that the method hadn't failed. That was particularly important in a time when home pregnancy tests weren't the convenient option they are today. Inventor John Rock, a devout Catholic, also thought he could win approval for birth control from the Catholic Church by mimicking a woman's cycle as closely as possible. ­Rock's gamble failed, but over time, women did pick up on what Rock and his fellow inventors knew: that by skipping the week of placebo pills in their birth control pack, they could skip a period. Some women may have done this occasionally, in anticipation of a vacation or a hot date, while some women may have adopted the practice to avoid particularly painful menstrual periods. It's worth pointing out that if a woman is on traditional birth control, she's not even having real periods per se. In a normal period, the uterine lining sheds because the egg remains unfertilized, while a woman only bleeds while on birth control because the lack of hormones causes the uterine lining to weaken. Bleeding while on birth control, as opposed to bleeding without birth control, doesn't serve any purpose for health. If a woman doesn't need to bleed every 21 days, then making the jump to every 84 days, as regulated by Seasonale, isn't so weird, right? While many doctors and the FDA support extended-cycle menstruation, not everyone is convinced that menstrual suppression is a good idea. Dr. Susan Rako, who wrote a book on the risks of menstrual suppression, called it ""the largest uncontrolled experiment in the history of medical science"" [sources: , , ]. Rako and other doctors opposed to menstrual suppression worry about a woman's hormonal levels. Oral contraceptives cause a drop in testosterone, which can affect libido, bone strength and . And while less-frequent menstruation may prevent ovarian cancer, long-term use of estrogen has been linked with breast cancer [source: ]. There are no studies of long-term use of menstrual suppressing oral contraceptives, so there may indeed be hormonal surprises in the wings. Additionally, we don't know how fertility is affected after long-term menstrual suppression. Another unknown is how menstrual suppression affects adolescents, because most testing is performed on subjects older than 18. Any form of oral contraceptive can prove dangerous to a woman over 35 who smokes. The possible side effects and risks, including blood clots, are the same for these extended cycle birth control pills as other oral contraceptives, but so far one major drawback has been identified: breakthrough bleeding, or spotting, between periods. The amount of breakthrough bleeding led many women to withdraw from trials of extended cycle oral contraceptives [source: ]. So while research has shown that about two-thirds of women would get rid of their period if they could do so safely, tampon makers may not need to cower in fear yet [source: ]. There are some women who will always want the monthly assurance that they're not pregnant. And, as we mentioned in the introduction, there are people who think that playing God with a woman's natural hormonal balance is tinkering with the very meaning of what it is to be a woman.

6e5a9672-9ad2-498d-849a-0412a313eec4,"| | Cetrotide Injection SC Cetrotide Injection SC Vial (Local Pickup Only) Cetrotide (cetrorelix acetate for injection) is a synthetic decapeptide with gonadotropinreleasing hormone (GnRH) antagonistic activity. Cetrotide (cetrorelix acetate for injection) is indicated for the inhibition of premature LH surges in women undergoing controlled ovarian stimulation. Ovarian stimulation therapy with gonadotropins (FSH, HMG) is started on cycle Day 2 or 3. The dose of gonadotropins should be adjusted according to individual response. CetrotideTM (cetrorelix acetate for injection) may be administered subcutaneously either once daily (0.25 mg dose) or once (3 mg dose) during the early- to mid-follicular phase. In the single dose regimen, 3 mg of Cetrotideä is administered when the serum estradiol level is indicative of an appropriate stimulation response, usually on stimulation day 7 (range day 5-9). If hCG has not been administered within four days after injection of Cetrotide 3 mg, CetrotideT0.25 mg should be administered once daily until the day of hCG administration. In the multiple dose regimen, 0.25 mg of Cetrotideä is administered on either stimulation day 5 (morning or evening) or day 6 (morning) and continued daily until the day of hCG administration. When assessment by ultrasound shows a sufficient number of follicles of adequate size, hCG is administered to induce ovulation and final maturation of the oocytes. No hCG should be administered if the ovaries show an excessive response to the treatment with gonadotropins to reduce the chance of developing ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS). Administration CetrotideT 0.25 mg and 3 mg can be administered by the patient herself after appropriate instructions by her doctor. Directions for using CetrotideT 0.25 mg and 3 mg: 1. Wash hands thoroughly with soap and water. 2. Flip off the plastic cover of the vial and wipe the aluminum ring and the rubber stopper with an alcohol swab. 3. Put the injection needle with the yellow mark (20 gauge) on the pre-filled syringe. 4. Push the needle through the rubber stopper of the vial and slowly inject the solvent into the vial. 5. Leaving the syringe on the vial, gently agitate the vial until the solution is clear and without residues. Avoid forming bubbles. 6. Draw the total contents of the vial into the syringe. If necessary, invert the vial and pull back the needle as far as needed to withdraw the entire contents of the vial. 7. Replace the needle with the yellow mark by the injection needle with the grey mark (27 gauge). 8. Invert the syringe and push the plunger until all air bubbles have been expelled. 9. Choose an injection site at the lower abdominal wall, preferably around the navel. If you are on a multiple dose (0.25 mg) regimen, choose a different injection site each day to minimize local irritation. Use the second alcohol swab to clean the skin at the injection site. Gently pinch up the skin surrounding the site of injection. 10. Insert the needle completely into the skin at an angle of about 45 degrees. 11. Once you have inserted the needle completely, release your grasp of the skin. 12. Gently pull back the plunger of the syringe to check the correct positioning of the needle. · If no blood appears, inject the entire solution by slowly pushing the plunger. Thereafter, withdraw the needle and gently press the alcohol swab on the injection site. · If blood appears, withdraw the needle with the syringe and gently press the alcohol swab on the injection site. Discard the syringe and the drug vial. Use a new pack and repeat the procedure. 13. Use the syringe and needles only once. Dispose of the syringe and needles properly after use. If available, use a medical waste container for disposal. GnRH induces the production and release of luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) from the gonadotrophic cells of the anterior pituitary. Due to a positive estradiol (E2) feedback at midcycle, GnRH liberation is enhanced resulting in an LHsurge. This LH-surge induces the ovulation of the dominant follicle, resumption of oocyte meiosis and subsequently luteinization as indicated by rising progesterone levels. Cetrotide competes with natural GnRH for binding to membrane receptors on pituitary cells and thus controls the release of LH and FSH in a dose-dependent manner. The onset of LH suppression is approximately one hour with the 3 mg dose and two hours with the 0.25 mg dose. This suppression is maintained by continuous treatment and there is a more pronounced effect on LH than on FSH. An initial release of endogenous gonadotropins has not been detected with Cetrotide, which is consistent with an antagonist effect. The effects of Cetrotide™ on LH and FSH are reversible after discontinuation of treatment. In women, Cetrotide delays the LH-surge, and consequently ovulation, in a dose-dependent fashion. FSH levels are not affected at the doses used during controlled ovarian stimulation. Following a single 3 mg dose of Cetrotide, duration of action of at least 4 days has been established. A dose of Cetrotide 0.25 mg every 24 hours has been shown to maintain the effect.

Prior to initiation of treatment with Gonal-f RFF Redi-ject: Perform a complete gynecologic and endocrinologic evaluation 1.2 Development of Multiple Follicles in Ovulatory Women as Part of an Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART) Cycle. Prior to initiation of treatment with Gonal-f RFF Redi-ject: Perform a complete gynecologic and endocrinologic evaluation, and diagnose the cause of infertility Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. Gonal-f RFF Redi-ject is a pre-filled disposable auto-injection device intended for multiple dose use. Gonal-f RFF Redi-ject can be set in 12.5 International Units increments. Administer Gonal-f RFF Redi-ject subcutaneously in the abdomen as described in Instructions for Use Do not attempt to mix any other medications inside of the device with Gonal-fRFF Redi-ject. Instruct women to remove the Gonal-f RFF Redi-ject from the refrigerator at least 30 minutes prior to use in order to allow Gonal-f RFF Redi-ject to warm to room temperature and avoid the discomfort of a cold injection. The dosing scheme is stepwise and is individualized for each woman . Starting doses less than 37.5 International Units have not been studied in clinical trials and are not recommended. A starting daily dose of 75 International Units of Gonal-f RFF Redi-ject is administered subcutaneously daily for 14 days in the first cycle of use. In subsequent cycles of treatment, the starting dose (and dosage adjustments) of Gonal-f RFF Redi-ject should be determined based on the history of the ovarian response to Gonal-f RFF Redi-ject. The following should be considered when planning the woman's individualized dose: Appropriate Gonal-f RFF Redi-ject dose adjustment(s) should be used to prevent multiple follicular growth and cycle cancellation. The maximum, individualized, daily dose of Gonal-f RFF Redi-ject is 300 International Units per day. If indicated by the ovarian response after the initial 14 days, make an incremental adjustment in dose, up to 37.5 International Units. If indicated by the ovarian response, make additional incremental adjustments in dose, up to 37.5 International Units, every 7 days. Treatment should continue until follicular growth and/or serum estradiol levels indicate an adequate ovarian response. When pre-ovulatory conditions are reached, administer human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) to induce final oocyte maturation and ovulation. Withhold hCG in cases where the ovarian monitoring suggests an increased risk of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) on the last day of Gonal-f RFF Redi-ject therapy . Encourage the woman and her partner to have intercourse daily, beginning on the day prior to the administration of hCG and until ovulation becomes apparent. Discourage intercourse when the risk for OHSS is increased . 2.3 Recommended Dosing for Assisted Reproductive Technology The dosing scheme follows a stepwise approach and is individualized for each woman. Beginning on cycle day 2 or 3, a starting dose of 150 International Units of Gonal-f RFF Redi-ject is administered subcutaneously daily until sufficient follicular development, as determined by ultrasound in combination with measurement of serum estradiol levels, is attained. In most cases, therapy should not exceed 10 days. In women under 35 years of age whose endogenous gonadotropin levels are suppressed, initiate Gonal-f RFF Redi-ject administration at a dose of 150 International Units per day. In women 35 years of age and older whose endogenous gonadotropin levels are suppressed, initiate Gonal-f RFF Redi-ject administration at a dose of 225 International Units per day. Adjust the dose after 5 days based on the woman's ovarian response, as determined by ultrasound evaluation of follicular growth and serum estradiol levels. Do not make additional dosage adjustments more frequently than every 3-5 days or by more than 75-150 International Units at each adjustment. Continue treatment until adequate follicular development is evident, and then administer hCG. The administration of hCG should be withheld in cases where the ovarian monitoring suggests an increased risk of OHSS on the last day of Gonal-f RFF Redi-ject therapy Doses greater than 450 International Units per day are not recommended. Gonal-f RFF Redi-ject 300 International Units per 0.5 mL in prefilled, multiple dose disposable delivery system Gonal-f RFF Redi-ject 450 International Units per 0.75 mL in prefilled, multiple dose disposable delivery system Gonal-f RFF Redi-ject 900 International Units per 1.5 mL in prefilled, multiple dose disposable delivery system Gonal-f RFF Redi-ject is contraindicated in women who exhibit: Prior hypersensitivity to recombinant FSH products High levels of FSH indicating primary gonadal failure Pregnancy Gonal-f RFF Redi-ject may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman . Gonal-f RFF Redi-ject is contraindicated in women who are pregnant. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if the woman becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the woman should be apprised of the potential hazard to a fetus. Presence of uncontrolled non-gonadal endocrinopathies (e.g., thyroid, adrenal, or pituitary disorders) Sex hormone dependent tumors of the reproductive tract and accessory organs Ovarian cyst or enlargement of undetermined origin, not due to polycystic ovary syndrome Gonal-f RFF Redi-ject should only be used by physicians who are experienced in infertility treatment. Gonal-f RFF Redi-ject contains a gonadotropic substance capable of causing Ovarian Hyperstimulation Syndrome (OHSS) in women with or without pulmonary or vascular complications [see , , , ] and multiple births . Gonadotropin therapy requires the availability of appropriate monitoring facilities . The lowest effective dose should be used. Careful attention should be given to the diagnosis of infertility and the selection of candidates for Gonal-f RFF Redi-ject therapy [see , and , ]. Serious systemic hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, have been reported in the postmarketing experience with Gonal-fand Gonal-f RFF. Symptoms have included dyspnea, facial edema, pruritis, and urticaria. If an anaphylactic or other serious allergic reaction occurs, initiate appropriate therapy including supportive measures if cardiovascular instability and/or respiratory compromise occur, and discontinue further use. In order to minimize the hazards associated with abnormal ovarian enlargement that may occur with Gonal-f RFF Redi-ject therapy, treatment should be individualized and the lowest effective dose should be used Use of ultrasound monitoring of ovarian response and/or measurement of serum estradiol levels is important to minimize the risk of ovarian stimulation . If the ovaries are abnormally enlarged on the last day of Gonal-f RFF Redi-ject therapy, hCG should not be administered in order to reduce the chance of developing Ovarian Hyperstimulation Syndrome (OHSS) . Intercourse should be prohibited in women with significant ovarian enlargement after ovulation because of the danger of hemoperitoneum resulting from rupture of ovarian cysts . OHSS is a medical entity distinct from uncomplicated ovarian enlargement and may progress rapidly to become a serious medical event. OHSS is characterized by a dramatic increase in vascular permeability, which can result in a rapid accumulation of fluid in the peritoneal cavity, thorax, and potentially, the pericardium. The early warning signs of development of OHSS are severe pelvic pain, nausea, vomiting, and weight gain. Abdominal pain, abdominal distension, gastrointestinal symptoms including nausea, vomiting and diarrhea, severe ovarian enlargement, weight gain, dyspnea, and oliguria have been reported with OHSS. Clinical evaluation may reveal hypovolemia, hemoconcentration, electrolyte imbalances, ascites, hemoperitoneum, pleural effusions, hydrothorax, acute pulmonary distress, and thromboembolic reactions . Transient liver function test abnormalities suggestive of hepatic dysfunction with or without morphologic changes on liver biopsy, have been reported in association with OHSS. OHSS occurs after gonadotropin treatment has been discontinued and it can develop rapidly, reaching its maximum about seven to ten days following treatment. Usually, OHSS resolves spontaneously with the onset of menses. If there is evidence that OHSS may be developing prior to hCG administration , the hCG must be withheld. Cases of OHSS are more common, more severe, and more protracted if pregnancy occurs; therefore, women should be assessed for the development of OHSS for at least two weeks after hCG administration. If serious OHSS occurs, gonadotropins, including hCG, should be stopped and consideration should be given as to whether the woman needs to be hospitalized. Treatment is primarily symptomatic and overall should consist of bed rest, fluid and electrolyte management, and analgesics (if needed). Because the use of diuretics can accentuate the diminished intravascular volume, diuretics should be avoided except in the late phase of resolution as described below. The management of OHSS may be divided into three phases as follows: : Management should be directed at preventing hemoconcentration due to loss of intravascular volume to the third space and minimizing the risk of thromboembolic phenomena and kidney damage. Fluid intake and output, weight, hematocrit, serum and urinary electrolytes, urine specific gravity, BUN and creatinine, total proteins with albumin: globulin ratio, coagulation studies, electrocardiogram to monitor for hyperkalemia, and abdominal girth should be thoroughly assessed daily or more often based on the clinical need. Treatment, consisting of limited intravenous fluids, electrolytes, human serum albumin, is intended to normalize electrolytes while maintaining an acceptable but somewhat reduced intravascular volume. Full correction of the intravascular volume deficit may lead to an unacceptable increase in the amount of third space fluid accumulation. : After the acute phase is successfully managed as above, excessive fluid accumulation in the third space should be limited by instituting severe potassium, sodium, and fluid restriction. : As third space fluid returns to the intravascular compartment, a fall in hematocrit and increasing urinary output are observed in the absence of any increase in intake. Peripheral and/or pulmonary edema may result if the kidneys are unable to excrete third space fluid as rapidly as it is mobilized. Diuretics may be indicated during the resolution phase, if necessary, to combat pulmonary edema. Ascitic, pleural, and pericardial fluid should not be removed unless there is the necessity to relieve symptoms such as pulmonary distress or cardiac tamponade. OHSS increases the risk of injury to the ovary. Pelvic examination or intercourse may cause rupture of an ovarian cyst, which may result in hemoperitoneum, and should therefore be avoided. If bleeding occurs and requires surgical intervention, the clinical objective should be to control the bleeding and retain as much ovarian tissue as possible. A physician experienced in the management of this syndrome, or who is experienced in the management of fluid and electrolyte imbalances should be consulted. During clinical trials with Gonal-f RFF, OHSS occurred in 7.2% of 83 women and 4.6% of 237 women treated with Gonal-f RFF for ovulation induction and during Assisted Reproductive Technology, respectively. Serious pulmonary conditions (e.g., atelectasis, acute respiratory distress syndrome and exacerbation of asthma) have been reported in women treated with gonadotropins. In addition, thromboembolic events both in association with, and separate from OHSS have been reported in women treated with gonadotropins including Gonal-f RFF. Intravascular thrombosis and embolism, which may originate in venous or arterial vessels, can result in reduced blood flow to critical organs or the extremities. Women with generally recognized risk factors for thrombosis, such as personal or family history, severe obesity, or thrombophilia, may have an increased risk of venous or arterial thromboembolic events, during or following treatment with gonadotropins. Sequelae of such reactions have included venous thrombophlebitis, pulmonary embolism, pulmonary infarction, cerebral vascular occlusion (stroke), and arterial occlusion resulting in loss of limb and rarely in myocardial infarctions. In rare cases, pulmonary complications and/or thromboembolic reactions have resulted in death. In women with recognized risk factors, the benefits of ovulation induction and assisted reproductive technology need to be weighed against the risks. It should be noted that pregnancy also carries an increased risk of thrombosis. Ovarian torsion has been reported after treatment with gonadotropins. This may be related to OHSS, pregnancy, previous abdominal surgery, past history of ovarian torsion, previous or current ovarian cyst and polycystic ovaries. Damage to the ovary due to reduced blood supply can be limited by early diagnosis and immediate detorsion. Multi-fetal gestation and births have been reported with all gonadotropin therapy including therapy with Gonal-f RFF. During clinical trials with Gonal-f RFF, multiple births occurred in 20% of live births in women receiving therapy for ovulation induction and 35.1 % of live births in women undergoing ART. The woman and her partner should be advised of the potential risk of multi-fetal gestation and birth before beginning therapy with Gonal-f RFF Redi-ject. The incidence of congenital malformations after some ART [specifically in vitro fertilization (IVF) or intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI)] may be slightly higher than after spontaneous conception. This slightly higher incidence is thought to be related to differences in parental characteristics (e.g., maternal age, maternal and paternal genetic background, sperm characteristics) and to the higher incidence of multi-fetal gestations after IVF or ICSI. There are no indications that the use of gonadotropins during IVF or ICSI is associated with an increased risk of congenital malformations. Since infertile women undergoing ART often have tubal abnormalities, the incidence of ectopic pregnancy may be increased. Early confirmation of intrauterine pregnancy should be determined by β-hCG testing and transvaginal ultrasound. The risk of spontaneous abortion (miscarriage) is increased with gonadotropin products. However, causality has not been established. The increased risk may be a factor of the underlying infertility. There have been infrequent reports of ovarian neoplasms, both benign and malignant, in women who have had multiple drug therapy for controlled ovarian stimulation, however, a causal relationship has not been established. In most instances, treatment of women with Gonal-f RFF Redi-ject will result only in follicular growth and maturation. In the absence of an endogenous LH surge, hCG is given when monitoring of the woman indicates that sufficient follicular development has occurred. This may be estimated by ultrasound alone or in combination with measurement of serum estradiol levels. The combination of both ultrasound and serum estradiol measurement are useful for monitoring follicular growth and maturation, timing of the ovulatory trigger, detecting ovarian enlargement and minimizing the risk of the OHSS and multiple gestation. The clinical confirmation of ovulation is obtained by direct or indirect indices of progesterone production as well as sonographic evidence of ovulation. Direct or indirect indices of progesterone production: Menstruation following a shift in basal body temperature The following serious adverse reactions are discussed elsewhere in the labeling: Hypersensitivity Reactions and Anaphylaxis Abnormal Ovarian Enlargement Ovarian Hyperstimulation Syndrome Atelectasis, acute respiratory distress syndrome and exacerbation of asthma Thromboembolic events Ovarian Torsion Multi-fetal Gestation and Birth Congenital Malformations Ectopic Pregnancy Spontaneous Abortion Ovarian Neoplasms Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trial of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. The safety of Gonal-f RFF was examined in two clinical studies (one ovulation induction study and one ART study). In a multiple cycle (3), assessor-blind, multinational, multicenter, active comparator study vs. a recombinant FSH comparator, a total of 83 oligo-anovulatory infertile women were randomized and underwent ovulation induction with Gonal-f RFF. Adverse reactions occurring in at least 2.0% of women receiving Gonal-f RFF are listed in Table 1. Table 1: Common Adverse Reactions Reported at a Frequency of ≥ 2% in an Ovulation Induction Study In a single cycle, assessor-blind, multinational, multicenter, active comparator study vs. a recombinant FSH comparator, a total of 237 normal ovulatory infertile women were randomized and received Gonal-f RFF as part of an ART [in vitro fertilization (IVF) or intracytoplasmic sperm injection cycle (ICSI)] cycle. All women received pituitary down-regulation with gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist before stimulation. Adverse Reactions occurring in at least 2.0% of women are listed in Table 2. Table 2: Common Adverse Reactions Reported at a Frequency of ≥ 2% in an Assisted Reproductive Technologies Study The following adverse reactions have been reported during postmarketing use of Gonal-f RFF. Because these reactions were reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, the frequency or a causal relationship to Gonalf RFF cannot be reliably determined. hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylactoid reactions thromboembolism No drug-drug interaction studies have been performed. Embryofetal development studies with recombinant human FSH in rats, where dosing occurred during organogenesis, showed a dose dependent increase in difficult and prolonged parturition in dams, and dose dependent increases in resorptions, pre- and post-implantation losses, and stillborn pups at doses representing 5 and 41 times the lowest clinical dose of 75 IU based on body surface area. Pre-/post-natal development studies with recombinant human FSH in rats, where dosing occurred from mid-gestation through lactation, showed difficult and prolonged parturition in all dams dosed at 41 times the lowest clinical dose of 75 IU based on body surface area, along with maternal death and stillborn pups associated with the difficult and prolonged parturition. This toxicity was not observed in dams and offspring dosed at a level 5 times the lowest clinical dose of 75 IU based on body surface area. It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in the nursing infant from Gonal-f RFF Redi-ject, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother. Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. Safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetics of Gonal-f RFF Redi-ject in women with renal or hepatic insufficiency have not been established. Aside from possible OHSS and multiple gestations there is no additional information on the consequences of acute overdosage with Gonal-f RFF Redi-ject. Gonal-f RFF Redi-ject contains human follicle stimulating hormone (hFSH), a glycoprotein hormone manufactured by recombinant DNA technology. The active drug substance, follitropin alfa, has a dimeric structure consisting of two non-covalently linked, non-identical glycoproteins designated as the α-and β-subunits. The α-and β-subunits have 92 and 111 amino acids, respectively, and their primary and tertiary structures are indistinguishable from those of human follicle stimulating hormone. Recombinant human FSH production occurs in genetically modified Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells cultured in bioreactors. Purification by immunochromatography using an antibody specifically binding FSH results in a highly purified preparation with a consistent FSH isoform profile, and a high specific activity. The protein content is assessed by size exclusion high pressure liquid chromatography. The biological activity of follitropin alfa is determined by measuring the increase in ovary weight in female rats. The biological activity of follitropin alfa has been calibrated against the first International Standard for recombinant human follicle stimulating hormone established in 1995 by the Expert Committee on Biological Standards of the World Health Organization. Gonal-f RFF Redi-ject contains no luteinizing hormone (LH) activity. Based on available data derived from physico-chemical tests and bioassays, follitropin alfa and follitropin beta, another recombinant follicle stimulating hormone product, are indistinguishable. Gonal-f RFF Redi-ject is a disposable, prefilled drug delivery system intended for the subcutaneous injection of multiple and variable doses of a liquid formulation of follitropin alfa. Each Gonal-f RFF Redi-ject is filled with 415 International Units (30 mcg), 568 International Units (41 mcg), or 1026 International Units (75 mcg) follitropin alfa to deliver at least 300 International Units (22 mcg) in 0.5 mL, 450 International Units (33 mcg) in 0.75 mL, or 900 International Units (66 mcg) in 1.5 mL, respectively. Each Redi-ject also contains 60 mg/mL sucrose, 3.0 mg/mL m-cresol, 1.1 mg/mL di-sodium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate, 0.45 mg/mL sodium dihydrogen phosphate monohydrate, 0.1 mg/mL methionine, 0.1 mg/mL Poloxamer 188. O-phosphoric acid and/or sodium hydroxide may be used for pH adjustment. Under current storage conditions, Gonal-f RFF Redi-ject may contain up to 10% of oxidized follitropin alfa. Follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), the active component in Gonal-f RFF Redi-ject, is required for normal follicular growth, follicular maturation, and gonadal steroid production. The level of FSH is critical for the onset and duration of follicular development, and consequently for the timing and number of follicles reaching maturity. Gonal-f RFF Redi-ject stimulates ovarian follicular growth in women who do not have primary ovarian failure. In order to effect the final phase of follicle maturation, resumption of meiosis, and rupture of the follicle in the absence of an endogenous LH surge, human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) must be given following treatment with Gonal-f RFF Redi-ject when monitoring of the woman indicates that appropriate follicular development parameters have been achieved. There is inter-woman variability in response to FSH administration. Single-dose pharmacokinetics of follitropin alfa were determined following subcutaneous administration of 300 International Units of Gonal-f RFF Redi-ject to 21 pre-menopausal healthy female volunteers who were pituitary down-regulated with a GnRH agonist. The descriptive statistics for the pharmacokinetic parameters are presented in Table 3. Table 3: Pharmacokinetic parameters of FSH following administration of Gonal-f RFF Redi-ject (300 International Units subcutaneously in a single dose) Abbreviations are:C: peak concentration (above baseline)t: time of C t: elimination half life The absorption rate of Gonal-f RFF Redi-ject following subcutaneous administration is slower than the elimination rate. Hence, the pharmacokinetics of Gonal-f RFF Redi-ject are absorption rate-limited. Human tissue or organ distribution of FSH has not been determined for Gonal-f RFF Redi-ject. FSH metabolism and excretion following administration of Gonal-f RFF Redi-ject have not been studied in humans. 13.1 Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Long-term studies in animals have not been performed to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of Gonal-f RFF Redi-ject. However, follitropin alfa showed no mutagenic activity in a series of tests performed to evaluate its potential genetic toxicity including, bacterial and mammalian cell mutation tests, a chromosomal aberration test and a micronucleus test. Impaired fertility has been reported in rats, exposed to pharmacological doses of follitropin alfa (greater than or equal to 40 International Units per kg per day, greater than or equal to 5 times the lowest clinical dose of 75 International Units) for extended periods, through reduced fecundity. The safety and efficacy of Gonal-f RFF were examined in two clinical studies (one ovulation induction study and one ART study). Ovulation induction was evaluated in a randomized, assessor-blind, multinational, multicenter, active-controlled, study in oligo-anovulatory infertile women. Women were randomized to either Gonal-f RFF (n=83), administered subcutaneously, or a comparator recombinant human FSH. The use of insulin-sensitizing agents was allowed during the study. The study was designed to evaluate and compare mean ovulation rates in the first cycle of treatment. Results for Gonal-f RFF are presented in Table 4. Also presented in this table are secondary outcome results from cycle 1 through cycle 3. The study was not powered to demonstrate differences in any of the secondary outcomes. Table 4: Cumulative Ovulation and Clinical Pregnancy Rates in Ovulation Induction Cumulative rates were determined per woman over cycles 1, 2, and 3. Clinical pregnancy was defined as a pregnancy for which a fetal sac (with or without heart activity) was visualized by ultrasound on day 34-36 after hCG administration. Non-inferior to comparator recombinant human FSH based on a two-sided 95% confidence interval, intent-to-treat analysis. Secondary efficacy outcomes. The study was not powered to demonstrate differences in these outcomes. The efficacy of Gonal-f RFF was evaluated in a randomized, assessor-blind, multinational, multicenter, active controlled study in healthy normal ovulatory, infertile women treated for one cycle with controlled ovarian stimulation, as part of an ART [in vitro fertilization (IVF), or intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI)] cycle. Women were randomized to either Gonal-f RFF (n=237), administered subcutaneously, or a comparator recombinant human FSH. Randomization was stratified by insemination technique, (IVF vs. ICSI). All women received pituitary down-regulation with a GnRH agonist before stimulation with recombinant FSH. Efficacy was assessed using the mean number of fertilized oocytes the day after insemination. The initial doses of Gonal-f RFF were 150 International Units per day for women less than 35 years of age and 225 International Units per day for women 35 years of age and older. The maximum dose given for both age groups was 450 International Units per day. Treatment outcomes for Gonal-f RFF are summarized in Table 5. Non-inferior to comparator recombinant human FSH based on a two-sided 95% confidence interval, intent-to-treat analysis. Subgroup analyses.

OHSS can cause fluid to suddenly build up in the area of your stomach, chest, and heart, and can cause blood clots to form. In rare cases OHSS has caused death. OHSS may also happen after you stop using Gonal-f RFF Redi-ject. Stop using Gonal-f RFF Redi-ject and call your healthcare provider right away if you have symptoms of OHSS, including: Gonal-f RFF Redi-ject may cause serious lung problems including fluid in your lungs (atelectasis), trouble breathing (acute respiratory distress syndrome), and worsening of asthma. Gonal-f RFF Redi-ject may increase your chance of having blood clots in your blood vessels. Blood clots can cause: Gonal-f RFF Redi-ject may increase the chance of your ovary twisting if you already have certain conditions such as OHSS, pregnancy and previous abdominal surgery. Twisting of your ovary may lead to blood flow being cut off to your ovary. Gonal-f RFF Redi-ject may increase your chance of having a pregnancy with more than 1 baby. Having a pregnancy and giving birth to more than 1 baby at a time increases the health risk for you and your babies. Your healthcare provider should tell you about your chances of multiple births. A baby born after an ART cycle may have an increased chance of having birth defects. Your chances of having a baby with birth defects may increase depending on: Gonal-f RFF Redi-ject may increase your chance of having a pregnancy that is abnormally outside of your womb. Your chance of having a pregnancy outside of your womb is increased if you also have fallopian tube problems. Your chance of loss of an early pregnancy may be increased if you had difficulty becoming pregnant. If you have used medicines like Gonal-f RFF Redi-ject more than 1 time to get pregnant, you may have an increased chance of having tumors in your ovary(ies) (including cancer).

The Dose Information Display is used for setting your dose, to confirm a completed dose, and to display the amount remaining to complete your intended dose. Take the carton out of the refrigerator at least 30 minutes before you inject to let it warm to room temperature. Caution: Do not use a microwave or other heating element to warm up the pen. Prepare a clean, flat surface, such as a table or countertop, in a well-lit area. Identify a firm, vertical surface, such as the side of your Gonal-f RFF Redi-ject carton or a wall. Fill in the first 5 columns of the treatment diary. Refer to the treatment diary for sample entries. You will also need a sharps container, alcohol pads, and a writing utensil (not included). Get familiar with the parts of your pen and needle *The numbers on the Dose Information Display and reservoir represent the number of International Units (IU) of medicine. Wash your hands with soap and water and dry them well. Caution: Do not shake the pen. If you shake the pen, air bubbles may appear in the medicine. Check the expiration date on the pen label. Warning: Do not use an expired pen. Get a new pen from your healthcare provider or pharmacist. Your healthcare provider should show you the injection sites to use around your stomach area. Select your injection site and wipe the skin with an alcohol pad to clean the site. Choose a different injection site each time you give your injection to reduce redness, irritation, or other skin problems. Make sure the plastic reservoir that holds the medicine is not cracked. Confirm the medicine is clear, colorless, and does not contain particles. If the plastic is cracked or if the liquid is discolored or cloudy, get a new pen from your healthcare provider or pharmacist. Check that the needle's peel-off seal is not broken. If it is, get a new needle. Push the needle on the clear, plastic end of the pen, and twist the needle until you cannot twist is anymore. Caution: Do not attach the needle too tightly, the needle could be difficult to remove after the injection. Pull off the outer needle cap and save it for removing the needle after the injection. Keeping the needle pointing up, carefully pull off the green inner needle shield and throw it away.

After injecting, fill in Column 7 of the treatment diary by recording the number you see in the Dose Information Display. If the Dose Information Display shows ""0"", you have completed your dose. If the Dose Information Display does not show ""0"", you did not complete your dose. You need to inject the number shown in the Dose Information Display using a second pen. Follow the instructions in : Completing an Incomplete dose. The amount you need to inject using the second pen might be less than expected because of the extra medicine (see note below). Always inject the amount you wrote in Column 7 of the treatment diary to complete your dose. The pen contains extra medicine to ensure that you receive the full amount indicated on the pen (300 IU, 450 IU, or 900 IU). The number recorded in Column 7 in the treatment diary indicates the number you need to dial with the second pen to complete today's intended dose. To complete the dose with a second pen, repeat Steps 1 through 7. If you do not see a droplet of liquid on the tip of the needle when using a pen for the first time, turn the dose knob until the Dose Information Display reads ""25"". With the needle pointing up, gently tap the reservoir so that any air bubbles rise to the top. Hold the pen with the needle pointing up. Slowly press the dose knob in all the way. One or more tiny drops of liquid will appear at the tip of the needle. Release the dose knob. Make sure that the Dose Information Display reads ""0"".

Haseltine, M. L. Polan, H. R. Behrman Follicular fluid (FF) and oocytes were obtained from 94 follicles of 36 women for fertilization in vitro. Ovulation was induced with human menopausal gonadotropin, and follicular aspiration was performed 36 h after an ovulatory injection of hCG. The concentrations of immunoreactive hCG, FSH, and PRL were correlated with the degree of maturation of the oocytecorona- cumulus complex mass (OCCC), fertilization, rate of cleavage, and the incidence of pregnancy after embryo transfer. Immature OCCC were derived from follicles that contained significantly lower levels of FSH than those from which intermediate and mature OCCC were derived (5.2 ± 0.6 vs. 11.1 ± 1.2 mlU/ml; P < 0.05). FF from oocytes that were successfully fertilized contained higher levels of both hCG and FSH than FF surrounding oocytes that did not fertilize (136.7 ± 8.7 vs. 108.5 ± 10.3 mlU/ml hCG; 10.55 ± 0.6 vs. 5.3 ± 0.8 mlU FSH, respectively). There was no correlation between early embryonic growth rate and FF concentrations of FSH, hCG, and PRL. Ova reaching the two-cell stage 40 h after fertilization in vitro were associated with the same FF concentrations of FSH, hCG, and PRL as those that cleaved to the four-cell stage. The PRL concentration in FF was significantly higher in mature fertilized ova and in fertilized ova that were associated with a successful pregnancy. It is suggested that the intrafollicular concentration of FSH is associated with the degree of mucification of the OCCC, but FF levels of both FSH and hCG are associated with successful fertilization. High levels of PRL in FF were associated with successful pregnancy and may imply a role of this hormone in oocyte maturation.

212ac3a2-42bf-48f3-9017-7a1a10f910c8,"7 Reasons Why Your Period Is Late After Stopping the Birth Control Pill — The birth control pill is designed to not only prevent pregnancy, but also to help regulate your menstrual cycle. Depending which pill you take, you may be used to having a period every month. (This is known as a .) Or you may take your pill packs back to back and never have a monthly bleed. So what does it mean when you stop taking your pill and find that your period is late, or find that you don’t have a period at all? “It’s common not to get a period after stopping the pill,” explains , MD, assistant professor of clinical medicine at Northwestern Memorial Hospital in Illinois. “The phenomenon is called ,” Dr. Weiss continues. “The pill suppresses your body’s normal production of hormones that are involved in your menstrual cycle.” He says it can take several months for your body to return to its normal production, and therefore several months for your period to return. But, in some cases, there is another reason for late or missed periods. It can be something as simple as lifestyle factors like or exercise. Or it could be an underlying condition like . Discover other factors that could be causing your post-pill period problem, and how to get your cycle back on track. Stress can affect the that controls your menstrual cycle. “Stress induces the hormone cortisol,” says , MD, who specializes in OB-GYN and maternal fetal medicine. This, she says, “can interfere with the hormonal regulation of menses via the circuit between the brain, ovaries, and uterus.” Other of stress to look out for include muscle tension, , and sleeplessness. You may also experience signs of stomach discomfort such as , or mood problems like sadness and irritability. While small amounts of stress are unlikely to cause changes, long-term or significant stress levels can stop periods. If you do still have a period, you may find that stress results in a more painful one. It can even cause your overall menstrual cycle to become shorter or longer. Finding ways to is important for your overall well-being. Try deep breathing techniques and exercising regularly to start. You can also talk to a mental health professional who may suggest (CBT) or even prescribe medication. Intense exercise has an effect similar on periods. It, too, can alter the hormones needed for menstruation. Working out too much can deplete your body’s energy stores to the point where reproductive functions are slowed or in favor of more essential processes. The hormones responsible for ovulation are affected, and this can lead to a late period. Adults should aim to carry out moderately intense exercise, like brisk walking, for spread out over the course of the week. If you’re , your body will let you know. You may feel lightheaded or more tired than usual, and you might also experience joint pain. Both rapid and can wreak havoc on your menstrual cycle. Sudden weight loss can halt the production of ovulation-controlling hormones, stopping periods altogether. Being overweight, on the other hand, can result in excess estrogen. Too much estrogen can disrupt reproductive processes, sometimes altering the frequency of your period. If you’re concerned about your weight or noticing like tiredness and appetite changes, consult with your doctor. They can check for underlying health conditions and advise on the best steps going forward. Both uterine polyps and are growths that appear in the uterus. An excess of hormones can promote the growth of fibroids and polyps. People with polyps or fibroids may have irregular periods, or notice . These growths can also “make periods heavy, due to changes in the way the uterine lining is shed,” says Dr. Weiss. Most of the symptoms associated with uterine polyps are period-related. But some people may experience . Fibroids, on the other hand, can cause other symptoms like: Sometimes, polyps and fibroids don’t need treatment. But if they’re causing problems, they . Birth control can suppress the symptoms of underlying conditions. But as soon as you stop taking the pill, these symptoms can flare up once again. An underactive thyroid, known as , means your thyroid hormone levels are lacking. This can cause several period-related problems, including no periods, heavy periods, or . An overactive thyroid — or — can result in similar menstrual effects, as well as shorter or lighter periods. This time, it’s because the thyroid is producing too much hormone. Other symptoms of hyperthyroidism include weight loss, sleeping problems, and anxiety. Thyroid imbalances can be treated with medication, so it’s important to consult with your doctor if you’re noticing these symptoms. (PCOS) is another underlying condition that can emerge after you stop birth control. It “causes an imbalance between your ovaries and your brain,” says Dr. Weiss. Irregular periods are one of the associated with PCOS. This is because polycystic ovaries can struggle to release an egg, meaning ovulation doesn’t occur. People with PCOS also typically have higher levels of male hormones, which can lead to or on the face and body. A exist to relieve the symptoms of PCOS. Your doctor may prescribe medications and recommend lifestyle changes. A late period is often associated with pregnancy. But people who’ve been on the pill often don’t think in this way. Believing that it takes a while to conceive after stopping the pill is one of the biggest contraceptive misconceptions. “The quickness with which one becomes pregnant varies” from person to person, explains Dr. Gaither. Generally, she says, it takes between one and three months. So if you’ve had unprotected sex and have noticed menstrual irregularities, take a pregnancy test as soon as possible — just to be on the safe side. What else might you experience after stopping the pill? Different people will notice different effects after discontinuing the pill, Dr. Gaither says. Heavy periods may resume, and some people may have acne or (PMS). According to Dr. Weiss, you may also experience , mild headaches, and mood swings. In some cases, there are some positives. For example, may return, notes Dr. Weiss. What can you do if you want to prevent pregnancy after stopping the pill? As soon as you stop taking the pill, you should use another form of . You can use a condom every time you have sex, or look to an alternative long-term contraceptive like the implant. It can take a few months for your menstrual cycle to return to normal. But if you haven’t had a period after three months of stopping the pill, you should book a doctor’s appointment. They can test for any underlying conditions and help you decide on next steps. Some people also choose to see a doctor before they come off the pill. That way, your physician can prepare you for changes to your body once you stop taking birth control. They can also recommend other forms of contraception to prevent pregnancy, or to relieve symptoms that your pill was treating. Stopping the pill can temporarily affect your menstrual cycle, but it’s not the only thing that can cause a late period. If things haven’t got back to normal within three months or if you’re experiencing other symptoms, you should consult with your primary care physician. They’ll work to find out the exact cause of your period problem, and set you on the path to a more regular cycle. Lauren Sharkey is a journalist and author specializing in women’s issues.

Retrieved Jan 20 2021 from https://www.thefreelibrary.com/Intraovarian+control+of+selective+follicular+growth+and+induction+of...-a0414135520 Introduction In the ovary, oocytes become surrounded by somatic cells to form the complex known as the follicle-enclosed oocyte. Subsequently, growth and differentiation are induced within the follicle. Follicular development is a continuous, selective process in mammals by which a species-specific number of oocytes from the pool of quiescent follicles progress to mature and ovulate. The meiotic division of oocytes begins prenatally in the follicles and stops at the diplotene stage of prophase I just before or immediately after birth. Oocytes remain under meiotic arrest until concentrations of the ovulatory gonadotropins (follicle-stimulating hormone [FSH] and luteinizing hormone [LH]) peak rapidly, thereby stimulating the resumption of meiosis in preovulatory follicles. After the FSH--LH surge, the oocyte resumes meiosis, proceeds through meiosis I, enters the second cycle of meiotic division, and arrests at metaphase II. This is the process called oocyte maturation. Persistent questions in mammals are how a small number of follicle-enclosed oocytes are recruited to survive during the process of follicular development (follicular selection), how meiosis is arrested at the diplotene stage, and how the resumption of oocyte meiosis (oocyte maturation) is triggered. I and my colleagues have identified the substances involved in follicular selection and in the arrest and resumption of oocyte meiosis. This article describes these achievements and proposed hypotheses regarding the roles of these factors in these processes. 1. The mechanism controlling selective follicular development in mammals A small percentage of the ovarian follicles in fetuses and newborns are in the process of development. (1) Although the number of oocytes drops steadily after birth, hundreds of thousands of oocytes are present at puberty, and only a species-specific proportion of these (less than 1%) will reach full maturation in adult mammals. The remaining follicles degenerate through a process termed ""atresia"". (2) In this manner, follicular development is a selective process through which a few oocytes are recruited to ovulate. An FSH inhibitor, the ovarian glycosaminoglycans (oGAGs), and angiogenic factors involved in follicular selection in mammals have been identified as described below. 1) An inhibitor of FSH suppresses follicular development. All ovarian follicles are not equally responsive to the same cyclic condition, and local inductive factors for follicular selection are surmised to reside in individual follicles.1) These morphologic observations led to our identification of an FSH inhibitor in bovine and porcine follicular fluid. (3-5) To this end, bovine follicular fluid was precipitated by using ammonium sulfate at 14.5% to 18.5%; the resulting fraction was separated into two peaks during Sephadex G-200 column chromatography. The second peak, detectable as a single band by polyacrylamide gel disc electrophoresis, contained all of the inhibitory activity necessary to suppress compensatory ovavian hypertrophy in mice. (4,5) Serum FSH levels of unilaterally ovariectomized mice were lower in those given injections of the inhibitor compared with saline. In addition, the inhibitor suppressed FSH binding to granulosa cells in vitro. (6) These results suggested that this inhibitor has two modes of action: suppression of FSH levels in serum and suppression of FSH binding to granulosa cells. Although purification of the inhibitor from bovine follicular fluid was more difficult than that of the porcine inhibitor, their patterns of elution by column chromatography and disc electrophoresis, and their modes of action, are very similar, indicating their similar molecular weights and physiologic properties. However, the porcine inhibitor was almost twice as effective as the bovine form in suppressing compensatory ovarian hypertrophy in mice. In addition, immunohistochemistry revealed that the porcine protein was present at the granulosa cells in 62% of antral follicles but was absent from all other follicles, including those lacking an antrum. (7) Our results suggest that the follicles containing this inhibitor in their follicular fluid are prevented from progressing developmentally and that this protein may be a local regulator of selective follicular growth. Consistent with our findings, inhibin was subsequently identified as a prominent peptide in the control of FSH secretion in the pituitary gland. (8) 2) Capillary networks are associated with follicular development and atresia. The angiogenesis of ovarian follicles plays an important role in folliculogenesis. A recent study using corrosion casts for scanning electron microscopy has revealed the microvascular structure of the ovary. (9,10) For example, porcine ovaries have coiled arteries in the hilus and spiraling branches in the cortex. In addition, small arterioles originating from the cortical coiled arteries straighten before entering the vascular complexes of the follicles (Fig. 1). Follicles 150 to 300 pm in diameter are surrounded by a polygonal meshwork comprising several large capillary meshes, but no basket-like structure is visible. In comparison, follicles 500 to 700 pm in diameter have a spherical meshwork comprising just a few capillaries, and the capillary network is arranged as a thin single layer of capillaries. The microvascular architecture of follicles of 1000 to 2000 pm in diameter contains three layers of vascular plexuses. The inner plexus consists of a small spherical basket-like capillary network that is not well developed. The middle layer consists of small arterioles and venules, and the outer layer is a coarse capillary plexus. (9,10) The recruitment, selection, and dominance of follicles occur at regular intervals, and only the follicle that is dominant during the follicular phase ovulates. (11,12) The dominance of follicles is influenced by vascularization, and increased vascularity has been proposed to be the primary determinant of follicular dominance. Our studies have demonstrated that dominant follicles are more vascular than are non-dominant follicles. (13-16) Specifically, dominant follicles have a more vascular theca than do other antral follicles; consequently uptake of serum gonadotropins is increased in dominant follicles. In addition, the follicular capillary network influences follicular development. In mice, oocytes grow from 10 to 50 pm in diameter during days 1 through 5 after birth. According to our observations, follicles containing oocytes 20 to 30 pm in diameter become surrounded by capillary networks (Fig. 2), suggesting that the association of follicles with capillaries promotes oocyte growth. (17) Follicles containing oocytes with germinal vesicles are surrounded by a few layers of basketlike capillary wreaths that lie adjacent to the follicular basement membrane. Just before ovulation in Graafian follicles, some thecal cells differentiate into hypertrophic cells and the follicular basement membrane fragments. Then, the capillaries within the theca interna dilate, become hyperpermeable, and appear to be injured. The capillary wreath extends into the follicle via the hypertrophied theca interna. After ovulation, the follicular wall becomes markedly edematous. Capillary branches invade the granulosa cell layer of the ruptured follicle from the region of extravasation to form intricate capillary networks. (17) The capillary network also influences follicular atresia. Decreased proliferation of thecal capillary endothelial cells leads to reduced thecal vasculature, which is one of the earliest events during follicular atresia. The inhibition of blood supply to ovarian follicles may trigger their atresia. (13-15) 3) Ovaries contain glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) with angiogenic activity. Given that gonadotropins induce rapid, striking follicular and vascular changes in the ovary and because the increase in vascularization may be dependent on the secretion of angiogenic factor(s), we injected mice with gonadotropins and examined their ovarian extracts for angiogenic activity. (18,19) Specifically, we injected immature female mice with pregnant mare serum gonadotropin (PMSG) or human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). The ovaries were excised 48 h after injection (that is, before ovulation) and homogenized in 0.5 M ammonium carbonate for 10 min. After freeze-thawing, the homogenates were centrifuged at 54,000 x g for 1 h, and the supernatant was lyophilized. The ovarian extracts were packed in polymer ""sandwiches"". (18) The thin, transparent film of Elvax 40 containing lyophilized ovarian extracts was cut into squares by using a razor blade. Each square of this slow-releasing polymer sandwich contained 2 or 6 mg of extract. To determine tissue response to the film, the films were implanted in the lateral wall of the sheath of the rectus abdominis muscle. On the 20th day after implantation, the abdominal wall was examined by means of stereomicroscopy for vascularization. Tissue samples, including the films, were excised, fixed in 10% buffered formalin, embedded in paraffin, sectioned, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. The control (untreated) extract elicited neovascularizing reaction in 24% to 29% of mice, whereas those from hCG- and PMSG-treated mice induced neovascularization in 32% to 60% and 77% to 85%. At equivalent dose, the PMSG-treated extract had a greater angiogenic activity than did that from hCG-treated mice. Because neovascularization may occur in association with inflammation, the tissue samples were examined for signs of inflammatory reactions, and some specimens did contain inflammatory cells. When the number of macrophages and other inflammatory cells around the film exceeded that obtained with plain Elvax film (control), the response was considered as inflammation and not scored as neovascularization. Inflammatory reactions were present in 5% to 10% of the mice implanted with films containing ovarian extract. Our finding that ovarian extract from untreated mice showed angiogenic activity (24% to 29%) suggests that the factor is present in the immature ovary. The greater potency of ovarian extracts prepared from PMSG- and hCG-treated mice indicates that hormonal administration enhances the angiogenic activity. However, note that this phenomenon is not a consequence of an inflammatory reaction. The PMSG used in the cited study (18) can induce follicular growth because 5 to 10 IU of this hormone promotes the development of antral follicles in mice. Hence, the follicle-stimulating and angiogenic activities may be related. Ovarian extract prepared from hCG-treated mice induced neovascularization, although a higher dose was necessary. It is well known that hCG induces luteinization of follicular cells and carries intrinsic FSH activity. Taken together, these findings suggest that gonadotropins induce the production of an angiogenic factor that stimulates the proliferation of capillaries from the vascular wreath present in the theca layer and promotes follicular development. Our 1982 report describing the angiogenic activity in mouse ovaries stimulated later studies on ovarian angiogenesis. This angiogenic factor has been partially purified and identified to contain glycosaminoglycan-like substances, (20) which have since been given the collective name ""ovarian glycosaminoglycans"" (oGAGs). 4) oGAGs potentiate the angiogenic activity of epidermal growth factor. Epidermal growth factor (EGF) is produced by thecal and interstitial cells in the ovary (21) and was shown in the 1980s to enhance the proliferation of vascular endothelial cells in vitro. (22) In vivo, EGF also promotes neovascularization. For example, when EGF in a slow-release polymer composed of Elvax 40 was implanted in the rabbit cornea, capillary proliferation was induced. (23) EGF therefore is considered to be a key angiogenic factor in the ovary. Furthermore, EGF is soluble in tissue fluid, can be translocated in tissues, and induces endothelial cells to proliferate and form capillaries. In the ovary, however, rapid and profound angiogenesis is restricted to a specific region (thecal layer). (13) We have demonstrated that oGAGs from ovarian extracts potentiate the angiogenic activity of EGF in mice, suggesting that oGAGs potentiate endogenous EGF in inducing angiogenesis, (24) so that the tissue specificity inducing angiogenesis may be due to the localization of ovarian components, including oGAGs and EGF, to a specific region (thecal layer) in ovaries allowing angiogenesis to occur. (1,24) In the ovaries of 3-day-old newborn mice, oGAGs accumulate within follicles and the outer layer of growing follicles containing oocytes larger than 30 pm in diameter. (25,26) It may be possible that oGAGs interact with EGF to induce vascularization, which accelerates the growth of the oocytes within the follicles. Indeed, histologic analysis has revealed well-developed blood vessels around follicles containing oocytes larger than 30 pm in diameter (26) (Fig. 3). The observation that granulosa cell proliferation is associated with improved rates of oocyte growth in vitro suggests that oocyte growth and follicular development are interrelated. (27,28) Blood circulation perhaps initially affects granulosa cell proliferation and then affects oocyte growth. These lines of evidence appear to indicate that blood vessels influence oocyte and follicular growth directly and accelerate the selective growth of oocytes larger than 30 pm in diameter via granulosa cell proliferation in mice. 5) oGAGs are involved in oocyte survival and macrophage activation in apoptotic follicles. Studies of the effect of FSH on nuclear degeneration of oocytes revealed that the pattern of nuclear degeneration was strongly correlated with the developmental stage of the follicle or oocyte. (29) Nuclear degeneration of oocytes was observed in 52.2% of preantral (types 4 through 5) follicles and in 39.2% of antral (types 6 through 7) follicles. Whereas degenerative changes, such as pyknosis and the disappearance of chromosomes, predominated in preantral follicles, about 80% of oocytes in antral follicles showed signs of induction of pseudo-maturation division (Fig. 4). The administration of FSH significantly increased the numbers of antral follicles but not of preantral follicles and decreased the numbers of both preantral and antral follicles with degenerating oocytes. Numerous macrophages were identified immunohistochemically in the interstitial tissue around the follicles. Macrophages cluster around atretic follicles and are involved in their clean up of the atretic follicles. CD44 functions as a sinaling receptor in a variety of cell types including macrophages. (30) Then we next evaluated levels of CD44 mRNA, protein, and antigen glycosylation in macrophages during follicular atresia in pigs. Levels of CD44 protein in the follicle were increased, as was posttranslational polylactosamine modification of CD44 on macro phages at atretic follicles; these changes may be involved in the removal of apoptotic granulosa cells. (31) Another series of our results (32) suggested that the hyaluronan (HA) concentration in follicular fluids increases during atresia. In addition, hyaluronan synthase 1 may be the dominant enzyme in thecal cells that produces HA in pig ovaries and stimulates the removal of degenerating follicles and oocytes. FSH likely stimulates the clearance of atretic follicles via production of HA, which induces macrophage activity. (32) In addition, we noted that a significant number of oocytes underwent segmentation when cultured for 3 or more days in vitro. The observation that segmentation occurred more often with cumulusfree oocytes suggests that cumulus cells produce a component(s) that delays the degenerative process. In this regard, oGAGs isolated from porcine and bovine follicular fluid prevented segmentation in isolated mouse, porcine, and bovine oocytes cultured in vitro. (33-36) The oocytes underwent segmentation, forming ""blastomeres"" or ""cellular segments"" containing none, a few, or several chromosomal fragments or clumps of chromatin material, according to staining with Hoechst dye. Cumulus cells synthesize GAGs and proteoglycans to organize the cumulus matrices during cumulus expansion, and glucosamine is used to produce their components, especially HA and chondroitin sulfate. To determine whether changes in cumulus expansion are reflected in GAG synthesis, we measured [[SUP.3]H]-glucosamine incorporation into intact and oocytectomized cumulus--oocyte complexes (COCs) and demonstrated that 1) oocytectomy decreased cumulus expansion of porcine COCs, 2) GAG synthesis had a time-dependent profile with a dramatic rise after 16 h, 3) total GAG synthesis in intact COCs was reflective of HA rather than chondroitin sulfate, and 4) oocytectomy reduced this HA synthesis. These results suggest that an oocyte-dependent mechanism regulates HA synthesis by porcine COCs. (37) These findings imply that FSH-induced production of HA promotes oocyte survival and stimulates macrophages to degrade and remove atretic follicles. These data support the involvement of HA in both follicular development and atresia. Moreover, as mentioned earlier, GAGs (including HA) participate in the neovascularization of a specific region (theca layer) of growing follicles. Therefore, we propose that an oocyte-associated factor stimulates the production of oGAGs in the granulosa cells, which then accumulate in the theca layer and bind to EGF, subsequently increasing the concentration of EGF in the theca layer for rapid and profound neovascularization. In addition, granulosa-produced oGAGs feed back to the oocyte to support its survival and growth (Fig. 3). 6) Fragments of the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) gene enhance thecal angiogenesis associated with follicular development. During the 2000s, we continued our efforts to clarify the role of angiogenic factors in follicular development. During the 1990s, VEGF was identified as a potent angiogenic factor. We then showed that the local administration of VEGF during follicular development increased the number of oocytes ovulated in rats. (38) These findings raised the possibility that the enhancement of circular concentrations of VEGF around the follicles could stimulate follicular development process. To test this hypothesis, we performed in vivo injection of VEGF gene fragments into pig ovaries in an attempt to over-produce VEGF and enhance the thecal angiogenesis associated with follicular development. (39-42) Histologic examination revealed that the vascular density in the theca interna of follicles in VEGF-treated ovaries increased two-fold compared with that in untreated ovaries. The pattern of perifollicular angiogenesis in the VEGF-treated group was essentially the same as that during follicular development after treatment with equine chorionic gonadotropin (eCG). In addition, whereas large follicles (diameter, >5 mm) protruded on the ovarian surface of eCG-treated gilts both with and without injection of VEGF gene fragments, the mean number of large follicles was significantly increased in the VEGF-treated ovaries. Furthermore, the large follicles on the surface of VEGF-treated ovaries were particularly rich in visible blood vessels containing erythrocytes. VEGF-treated ovaries were significantly heavier than were those from pigs treated with eCG only or left untreated. These changes clearly indicate the stimulation of thecal angiogenesis is involved in the follicular development. Because perifollicular vessels supply gonadotropins and many growth factors to the granulosa cells of follicles, increases in perifollicular angiogenesis are associated with the promotion of follicular development. In addition to the stimulation of follicular development, the increase in vascular density around the antral follicles contributes to the inhibition of atresia. When placed in culture oocyte in early atretic follicles can regenerate, suggesting that the follicle remains in the atretic state due to a decrease in vascularity that limits access to nutrients, substrates, and trophic hormones. (43) We found that VEGF-induced promotion of thecal vascularization contributed to the decrease in atretic follicles. (44) In pig ovaries, as in those of other species, apoptotic cell death induces follicular atresia. Therefore, VEGF may suppress granulosa cell apoptosis and inhibit follicular atresia. 2. The intraovarian mechanism controlling the induction of oocyte maturation in mammals In antral follicles, cumulus cells surround the oocyte; together, they form the COC. Cells in the innermost layer of the cumulus, the corona radiate, extend cytoplasmic processes through the intervening zona pellucida to the oolemma. Gap junctions occur where the processes of cumulus cells contact the oolemma. Shortly before ovulation, the physical integrity of the COC is disrupted. The cytoplasmic processes joining the cumulus cells to the oocyte retract, and the ionic coupling and metabolic cooperation between the cumulus cells and oocyte decrease greatly. (44)-46) Using dye coupling, we correlated the physical integrity between cumulus cells and an oocyte with the maturation stage of that oocyte. (47) At the time of cumulus expansion, the oocytes in preovulatory follicles resume meiosis I after their activation by the ovulation-induced release of gonadotropins. (48) These intercellular communications are vital--first to keep the oocyte arrested at prophase I of meiosis and later to signal the oocyte to resume meiosis at the time of ovulation. This phenomenon, known as ""cumulus expansion"", facilitates the detachment of the COC from the follicular wall, the extrusion of the COC during ovulation, (49) and its capture by the oviductal fimbria; (50) promotes the acrosomal reaction in spermatozoa; (51 and transports the ovulated COC in the oviduct. (52) Furthermore, we have clarified that granulosa cells express an inhibitor of the induction of meiotic resumption and that cumulus expansion interferes with this inhibitor to induce the resumption of meiosis in oocytes in mammals. (53-56) 1) Two types of inhibitor for the resumption of meiosis in oocytes. Isolated follicle-enclosed oocytes remain arrested in the dictyate stage. When released from the follicles, the oocytes undergo spontaneous maturation, indicating that an inhibitor of meiotic resumption within the follicles maintains the oocytes in the dictyate stage. (53) Several maturation-preventing factors have been identified in follicular fluid and granulosa cells. (54-59) The resumption of meiosis in cumulus-enclosed oocytes can be prevented by being in contact with the granulosa cell layer, (54,55) and the meiotic-arresting activity of granulosa cells occurs only when they adhere to an oocyte surrounded by cumulus cells. (55) A substance with maturation-preventing activity (designated as meiosis-arresting factor, MAF) has been isolated from the intercellular matrix and external surfaces of granulosa cells. (55,56) Other maturation-preventing factors in follicular fluid are oocyte maturation inhibitor (57) and hypoxanthine, (58) which acts only in combination with cAMP. (60) Follicular fluid may contain another kind of nucleotide that has maturation-preventing activity when in combination with cAMP. (59,60) Among these arresting factors, MAF is the most potent agent. Nonetheless, at least two types of factors--one peptide, the other non-peptide--appear to be necessary to sustain meiotic arrest. The small molecular size of the non-peptide factor enables it to translocate between cells through gap junctions. Related to MAF, we have clarified that GAGs accumulated between the COC and granulosa cells prevent the action of MAF on COC. (54) During cumulus expansion, cells in the periphery of the cumulus separate and begin to disperse as the oocyte undergoes maturation. (61) The resumption of meiosis in oocytes surrounded by dispersed cumulus is not inhibited even when COCs are in contact with a layer of adherent granulosa cells. Therefore, the dispersion of the cumulus cells, due to the accumulation of GAGs in the intercellular matrix, (62) promotes maturation. Gonadotropins (FSH and LH) stimulate the preovulatory follicle to produce GAGs, which accumulate on the surface of and between cumulus cells. (62) After cumulus expansion, the oocytes undergo maturation. Among the various GAGs, heparin and heparan sulfate interact with MAF and nullify its maturation-inhibiting activity. (63) These combined data prompt the following hypothesis to explain the mechanism of meiotic arrest and the resumption of meiosis in mammalian oocytes (Fig. 5). According to this hypothesis, MAF is located on the external surface of and in the intercellular spaces between the granulosa cells. Through direct contact between the granulosa cells and the COC, MAF sustains the oocyte in meiotic arrest. Gonadotropins stimulate the production and accumulation of GAGs in the intercellular space of the cumulus cells. The net result is a disruption of the interaction between the cumulus cells and the oocyte. In addition, GAGs bind MAF to prevent its translocation and subsequent action on the oocyte. In this manner, the oocyte is released from the arresting influence of MAF and resumes meiosis. Related to the function of MAF, we have identified that, in culture, adrenomedullin (ADM), a multifunctional hormone that regulates cell growth, potently suppresses germinal vesicle breakdown (GVBD), the initial morphologic change in the induction of oocytes. (64) Mouse cumulus cells but not the associated oocytes express ADM receptor and proteins that modify the activity of this receptor. Although ADM alone is insufficient to inhibit GVBD, ADM in the presence of nitric oxide significantly inhibits GVBD, and Akt blockade abrogates the ADM-dependent inhibition of GVBD. In addition, Akt expression and phosphorylation was inhibited by ADM, suggesting that Akt signaling in cumulus cells is responsible for GVBD. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that ADM is localized in the granulosa cells of developed follicles, implying that ADM physiologically affects oocyte maturation in vivo. 2) The accumulation of GAGs between COCs and the granulosa cell layer influences the induction of oocyte maturation. In preovulatory follicles, we noted that the majority of the cumulus cells associated with oocytes were round in shape. (48) The region of heterologous cell interaction appeared to be distributed randomly over the entire surface of the oocyte, and oocyte microvilli were displaced to accommodate this contact. After gonadotropin administration, the cumulus cells of COCs in which the oocytes underwent GVBD became dispersed due to the deposition of copious amounts of intercellular material. Most of the processes of the cumulus cells that extended through the zona pellucida to the oocyte became undulated and withdrew. The contact between cumulus cells themselves decreased but was not completely eliminated; junctional apparatuses were still frequent between these projections and the oolemma at the points of contact. The accumulation of intercellular material seems to be more active in the peripheral region of the cumulus than in its inner region. Cumulus expansion initially is due to the accumulation of GAGs at the periphery of the cumulus cell mass and then gradually involves its central portion. In the final stage, the attachment of the cumulus to the oocyte is disrupted, and cell-to-cell communication between cumulus and granulosa cells may start to disintegrate at the beginning of cumulus dispersion. (65) These morphologic observations support our hypothesis regarding the release of oocytes from the inhibitory action of granulosa cells in the ovary. Other morphologic studies demonstrated the collection of colloidal iron (Fig. 6) between COCs and the granulosa cell layer of mouse ovaries. (65) Materials deposited between the cumulus cells of Graafian follicles in gonadotropin-treated mouse ovaries were stained with colloidal iron. Specifically, just before the induction of GVBD, colloidal ironpositive material was clearly visible along the periphery of the cumulus cell mass. Histochemical analysis suggests that this colloidal iron-positive material is composed of GAGs. The cells at the connection site between the COC and granulosa cell layer then became enlarged, and colloidal ironpositive substances were present in the intercellular spaces between these enlarged cells, and in the inner part of the cumulus mass. This histologic evidence supports the hypothesis shown in Fig. 5. 3) Follicular fluid and the has2 gene control cumulus expansion. As mentioned earlier, the attachment of the COC to the granulosa cell layer inhibits the resumption of meiosis in oocytes, and the accumulation of GAGs between the COC and granulosa cell layer prevents the action of MAF and induces the resumption of meiosis in the oocytes in preovulatory follicles. Our next step was to attempt to clarify the mechanism underlying the control of cumulus expansion. To this end, we sought to purify from porcine follicular fluid the active substance(s) that promote cumulus expansion in pig oocytes matured in vitro. (66-68) The follicular fluid yielded four fractions after prolonged ultracentrifugation. COCs were then cultured in each of the reconstituted fractions. After 24 h of culture, oocytes that matured in fraction 1 showed marked expansion of the surrounding cumulus, as did oocytes cultured in complete pig follicular fluid; COCs cultured in the remaining fractions exhibited very little or no expansion. The degree of cumulus expansion did not differ whether the follicular fluid was collected from small, medium, or large follicles. Additional analysis of fraction 1 by HPLC gave several subfractions, one of which induced significantly greater expansion of the cumulus than did the others. The active factor(s) responsible for cumulus expansion was heat stable at 100[degrees]C for 15 min, resistant to freezing and thawing, and did not become completely inactive after proteinase K digestion. The estimated molecular mass of the active factor is 6.5 kDa. We confirmed the expression of hyaluronan synthase (has) family genes and of the CD44 gene in porcine cumulus cells and oocytes. (69) has2 is expressed in cumulus cells, whereas has3 mRNA is expressed only in oocytes; has1 mRNA was not detected in COCs. To investigate whether the two has genes are involved in cumulus expansion, we used RT-PCR to confirm the expression of has2 mRNA in COCs and oocytes. (69) Both eCG and porcine follicular fluid induced the expression of has2 mRNA. Given the presence of CD44 in and on cumulus cells, we speculated that CD44 is involved not only in the retention of HA in the extracellular matrix but also in cumulus cell--matrix interactions as a signaling receptor for HA in porcine COCs during oocyte maturation. 4) Phosphorylation of Cx43 induced by the signal of the HA-CD44 interaction shuts down cell-to-cell communication in COCs. Elucidation of the role of the HA--CD44 interaction during the induction of meiotic resumption is important in understanding the induction of oocyte maturation. Meiotic resumption in mammalian oocytes is accompanied by a substantial increase in the activity of several kinases. The central component of this activity is maturation-promoting factor (MPF), which is a serine--threonine protein kinase composed of a regulatory subunit (cyclin B) and a catalytic subunit (p34cdc2). (70) In all species studied so far, MPF activity appears shortly before GVBD, peaks in metaphase I oocytes, decreases dramatically during the transition from metaphase I to metaphase II, and regains its maximal level in metaphase II oocytes. (71) To elucidate the role of the HA--CD44 interaction in oocyte maturation, we examined its effect on MPF activity and GVBD in porcine oocytes. (72) COCs were cultured for 24 h with 6-diazo-5-oxo-1-norleucine (to inhibit HA synthesis) or anti-CD44 antibody (to inhibit HA binding). (73) Oocytes from COCs showed a low level of MPF activity immediately after their collection from follicles. After 24 h in culture, MPF activity and GVBD rates in oocytes cultured in drug-free medium significantly increased compared with those before culture. In contrast, the exposure of COCs to 6-diazo-5-oxo-1-norleucine or anti-CD44 antibody during 24 h of culture significantly suppressed MPF activity and GVBD rates compared with those of untreated COCs. Consequently, the HA--CD44 interaction is required for the resumption of meiosis in porcine oocytes. CD44 is expressed in cumulus cells but not in oocytes.72) Given these results, the HA--CD44 interaction may promote the resumption of meiosis in porcine oocytes via the cumulus cells. The coordinated function of COCs is mediated by cell-to-cell communication that involves gap junctions. (74) Early studies showed that oocyte growth and development are strictly dependent on the supply of nutrients from the follicle cells. Later studies demonstrated that the meiotic maturation of oocytes is subject to regulation by the somatic compartment of the ovarian follicle. (75) This control is mediated by the transmission of cAMP from cumulus cells, which maintains the oocyte in meiotic arrest. (75) Cyclic AMP is synthesized in cumulus cells and transported into oocytes via the numerous gap junctions in COCs. Interruption of the gap junctions in COCs, which occurs in response to the preovulatory surge of gonadotropins, leads to a drop in the intraoocyte cAMP concentration followed by the resumption of meiosis. (76) These reports led to the conclusion that the disruption of gap junctions in COCs induces the resumption of meiosis in oocytes. Gap junctions are specialized regions in closely apposed membranes of neighboring cells; these junctions allow cells to exchange small molecules, thus coordinating cellular activities. Each gap junction channel comprises two symmetrical hemispheres (termed connexons) derived from two neighboring cells. The connexon is a hexagonal arrangement of six subunits of a protein named connexin (Cx). Connexins are encoded by members of a multigene family, are defined by their molecular weight, and share high homology. To date, at least 15 connexin genes have been reported in mammals, and seven genes (Cx26, Cx30, Cx32, Cx37, Cx43, Cx45, and Cx60) are expressed in the ovary. (77) We consequently examined the effect of the HA--CD44 interaction on the expression of Cx43, the most abundant Cx in ovarian follicles (78) and COCs. (73) Exposure of COCs in vitro to 6-diazo-5-oxo-1-norleucine or anti-CD44 antibody had no effect on the expression of total Cx43 but significantly inhibited its tyrosine phosphorylation. Several laboratories have shown that when a tyrosine kinase (such as pp60Src) is active, Cx43 is phosphorylated on tyrosine residues and intercellular junctional communication is inhibited.79) Therefore, the HA--CD44 interaction is required to disrupt Cx43 gap junctional communication in COCs. Expression of Cx43 is suggested to be restricted to cumulus and granulosa cells, whereas oocytes exclusively produce Cx37. (77) In pigs, we demonstrated that localization of Cx43 is restricted to cumulus cells, with no Cx43 detected in the oocytes, (73) and we used cell fractionation analysis to examine the cellular distribution of CD44 in COCs. (73) CD44 was detected exclusively in the membrane fraction; no corresponding band was detected in the nuclear, cytoplasmic, or insoluble fractions. Moreover, indirect immunofluorescence analysis of COCs confirmed the localization of CD44 on or in the membrane of cumulus cells in every tomogram and the three-dimensional reconstruction of the confocal sections. (73) The result of the immunohistochemical analysis confirmed the biochemical evidence showing CD44 localization in cumulus cells. (72) Collectively these findings, along with the abovementioned reports regarding cAMP and nonpeptide inhibitors in oocytes, strongly suggest that the HA--CD44 interaction in cumulus cells induces disruption of the Cx43 gap junctions between cumulus cell and adjacent cumulus cell in COCs, inhibits the transport of cAMP and non-peptide inhibitors from cumulus cells into oocytes, and leads to the resumption of meiosis in oocytes (Fig. 7). As mentioned above, we have isolated MAF from the intercellular matrix and external surface of granulosa cells and proposed the hypothesis how MAF sustains the oocyte in meiotic arrest and how GAG releases the oocyte from arresting influence of MAF (Fig. 5). Our experiments shows that shut down cell-to-cell communication in COCs is induced at the almost same time with the release of COCs from the influence of MAF of granulosa cells. (47,65) 5) Translocation of phosphorylated MAP kinase into GVs for the induction of meiotic resumption in mammalian oocytes. During meiotic maturation, protein phosphorylation and dephosphorylation play key roles in a series of events including nuclear envelope breakdown, chromosome condensation, and cytoskeletal change. (80) Mitogen-activated protein kinases/extracellular signal-regulated kinases (MAPKs/ERKs) are activated by phosphorylation on both tyrosine and serinethreonine residues by upstream kinases identified as a dual-specific MAPK kinase or MAPK/ERK kinase. (81) The MAPK kinase cascade may play a critical role in the diverse intracellular signaling processes by which external signals trigger the G0/ G1 transition of the cell cycle. (82) Cultured mouse oocytes resume their maturation within 1 h after culture. This rapid transition of the cell cycle could complicate the detection of changes in kinase activation. In contrast, meiosis in pig oocytes resumes after about 24 h of culture. (83) This long duration of the GV stage facilitates analysis of the meiotic events occurring in the nuclei. We demonstrated that MAPK with molecular masses of 42 kDa and 44 kDa (ERK2 and ERK1, respectively) exist in porcine GV-stage oocytes and that their amounts do not change during oocyte maturation. (83) MAPK activity was low in GV-stage oocytes, might require GVBD, remained high until metaphase II, and showed a transient slight decrease at the time of first polar body extrusion. These results indicate that the activation of MAPK is involved in the regulation of meiotic maturation in pig oocytes. The cytoplasmic localization of MAPK kinase is determined by the nuclear export signal in its near-N-terminal region (residues 33 through 44), and inactive MAPK is localized to the cytoplasm through its specific association with MAPK kinase. (84) The nuclear accumulation of MAPK is accompanied by dissociation of the complex between MAPK and MAPK kinase after activation of the MAPK pathway and is essential for the transduction of various extracellular signals to the nucleus. (84) To investigate the possible function of MAPK as a transducer of the maturation-inducing signal in porcine immature oocytes, we clarified the subcellular localization of MAPK in porcine GV-stage oocytes by using immunofluorescence and immunoblotting. (85,86) We showed that two MAPKs (ERK1 and ERK2) were inactive and entirely localized within the cytoplasm. However, phosphorylated MAPKs translocated into GVs just before GVBD. Furthermore, only the phosphorylated, active form of MAPK was detected in GVs, although both active and inactive ERK1/2 were present in the ooplasm after culture for 25 h (that is, just before GVBD). These results agree well with the localization mechanism mentioned earlier, and they strongly support the hypothesis that MAPK is involved in the transduction pathway of the maturation-inducing signal and that MAPK itself transmits these signals from the cytoplasm to GVs. To test this hypothesis, immature GV-arrested oocytes were microinjected with active MAPK, (85) but cytoplasmic injection of MAPK did not increase MAPK activity or accelerate GVBD. However, the MAPK we used was not specifically modified against dephosphorylation, so dephosphorylation may have prevented the injected active MAPK from increasing the total MAPK activity. Although cytoplasmic injection of MAPK did not induce an abrupt increase in MAPK activity and consequently prevent GVBD, a gradual and partial activation of MAPK occurred between 0 and 30 h of culture. This trend appears to support the proposal that the activation of MAPK occurs prior to and therefore does not require GVBD. However, it may be possible that GVBD is required for the full activation of MAPK: a positive feedback loop occurs between MAPK and maturation promoting factor, (87,88) the activation of which is exactly analogous to the relation between MAPK and GVBD. It has been reported that the timing of MAPK activation varies in mammalian species, and that MAPK activation delayed compared with MPF activation in some culture conditions. (89,90) However, our results show that, in porcine oocytes, inactive MAPK localizes in the cytosol of immature germinal-vesicle oocytes and that activated MAPK translocates into the GVs just before GVBD, indicating that MAPK mediates the maturation-inducing signal from the cytoplasm into the nucleus and induces meiotic resumption (Fig. 7). Our results also suggest a possible requirement for cytoplasmic maturation prior to MAPK activation. We consider that the putative MAPK-suppressing factor(s) shown in Fig. 6 would be disrupted or inhibited and the mechanism(s) for activating the MAPK cascade would be completed during cytoplasmic maturation.

Profile Eimei Sato was born in Hokkaido in 1948, graduated from Kyoto University in 1971, and started his research career in 1973 by studying mammalian oocyte maturation in culture at the Faculty of Agriculture (Kyoto University). He established initial in vitro culture system of domestic mammalian oocytes obtained at the slaugterhouse and subsequently expanded his research area to include intraovarian control mechanisms of ovarian follicular development and oogenesis. Sato obtained his doctoral degree from Kyoto University (1979) for identifying follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) inhibitor and meiosis-arresting factor and demonstrating their roles as regulators of selective follicular growth and meiotic arrest in mammalian oocytes. He was appointed as Assistant Professor (1974) and Associate Professor (1988) of the Faculty of Agriculture (Kyoto University). During his stay in Kyoto, he completed a special postdoctoral Rockefeller Foundation fellowship and determined the angiogenic factor involved in mammalian follicular development. Subsequent appointments include Associate Professor at The Institute of Medical Science (The University of Tokyo, 1992) and Full Professor (1997) at the Graduate School of Agriculture Science (Tohoku University), and Distinguished Professor (2009) (Tohoku University), where he continued his research into the intraovarian control mechanisms of selective follicular development and meiotic arrest and the resumption of meiosis in oocytes. After retiring from Tohoku University in 2013, Sato became the President of National Livestock Breeding Center, Incorporated Administrative Agency, Japan. He served as president of the Japanese Society of Reproduction and Development (2003-2006), Japan Society of Fertilization and Implantation (2006-2010), and Japanese Society of Animal Science (2007-2009) and has been a member of the Science Council of Japan since 2011. In 2008, Sato was appointed as a foreign fellow of The Royal Swedish Academy of Agriculture and Forestry. Awards received include those from the Japanese Society of Animal Science (1991), Japan Society of Agricultural Science (2005), and the Japan Academy (2013) and the Medal with Purple Ribbon (2009).

If this has happened used a condom for 4 weeks. If not then see your Doctor. Will you have your regular cycle while taking orovite? Taking Orovite has absolutely nothing to do with your menstrual cycle. If your menstrual cycle is regular then it will continue to be regular while taking this. Should you take your sugar pills if you have your period while still on your active pills? No, you should continue taking the birth control pill as scheduled, regardless of any bleeding. If you miss your period while on birth control should you wait to start your next cycle until you are sure you are not pregnant or should you continue to take the birth control? Many women have no period on the BCP. Do not stop taking it as directed. What happens if you don't get your period while taking the pill? If you don't get your period while taking the pill, nothing happens and this is nothing to worry about. Many women find that their periods are lighter or disappear altogether when they are taking the pill. Should you continue your new birth control even though you did not get your period taking the sugar pills? Yes, continue taking your pills. Many woman stop menstruating while taking birth control pills. If you are questioning the possibility of pregnancy take a HPT (home pregnancy test), if it is negative you can be assured that you are not pregnant and the pill is working as it should. Are you supposed to continue taking birth control while on your period or you resume on another day? Yes, take one pill every day as scheduled - skipping pills reduces the effectiveness. Being that the antibotics may remove all the good bacteria in your stomach, it's best to eat yogurt to help replace that. If you do not, you could have diarrhea. If you start while still taking active pills to you continue with the active ones or switch to the sugar pills? Keep taking your pills all in order-do not skip any active pills...did you miss any pills -sometimes that can cause you to start your period early...also-maybe put a call in to your doc- if you didn't miss any pills,you shouldn't start your period while still taking active pills What if you get your period early while you're on the birth control pill? Continue taking your pills until you reach your non-hormone week. Do not stop taking them if your period started early! Start taking the next month on time. You probably started break through bleeding. If you are new to the pill, this should stop after a few months once your body adjusts. Is it normal to skip your period during the first pack of pills? Many women do not have monthly bleeding while on BCP - take a pregnancy test to be sure and continue taking The Pill as directed as long as it is negative. Do i continue taking my pill if my period has come when I'm still on the pill? let your period bleed for a while, and then when it's going away you could start taking the hormonal pills again. Try not to forget. Although apparently you only need 3 days of bleeding to be healthy and allow your cycle to keep moving even on the pill. So 3 days of period is enough. When does your period start while on birth control? Your period usually starts from Tuesday to Thursday after taking the reminder pills. When should you start your period while on the pill? If you are taking a birth control pill with active and inactive pills, you should begin having your period while you are taking the inactive pills - usually 2-3 days into them. If you are taking seasonale, you will have 4 periods per year. Is it possible to not have your period while on the birth control pill? Yes it is a side effect of the pills suppressing ovulation - many woman have no period while taking the pill. Whether to continue taking such medicine is something you need to discuss with your doctor since it's not good for the fetus at all but some women need it to be able to continue. If you miss your period while on birth control do you continue to the next pack? No, if you miss your period on the pill you should go see your doctor immediately. Can you get pregnant on your period and just started taking birth control pills? If you had sex it is possible you are pregnant. The chance of getting pregnant on your period, while taking BCP is quite small. Your period will stop while taking ibuprofen. It is not recommended, it can have serious side effects. I have been taking them because I have some health issues and my period was lasting more than a month at a time.Don't do it without consulting your doctor first!!!! What's the most outdated thing you still use today? What does it mean when the flag is not flying at the White House? Which actor would play you in a movie about your life? When did organ music become associated with baseball? While taking antibotics you got your period being on the pill do you continue to take your pill? Multiply Media, LLC. All Rights Reserved.

69d48f79-bef0-4c43-b9e4-5612e5838245,"If you're considering using birth control, you have many options — including natural family planning, over-the-counter products, prescription contraceptives and sterilization. To choose the birth control method that's best for you, consider your lifestyle, personal preferences and health status. For instance, how do you feel about: It's also important to honestly assess yourself, your partner and your relationship. You may have different birth control needs if you have sex often or you're not in a monogamous relationship. Ideally, you'll find a solution that benefits both you and your partner. Birth control pills — also called oral contraceptives — are a common type of contraception. If you're considering taking birth control pills, you may have more choices than you'd think. You'll start by choosing either combination birth control pills or minipills. If you choose combination birth control pills, you'll have another choice — between using conventional packs, or extended or continuous dosing. With conventional birth control pills, you'll have a period every month. With extended or continuous dosing birth control pills, you may have a period only a few times a year or you may eliminate your period entirely. Similar to combination birth control pills, the vaginal ring prevents pregnancy by releasing hormones into your body. The hormones suppress ovulation — keeping your ovaries from releasing an egg. Each type of birth control pill has its own risks and benefits. So does the vaginal ring. Understand the basics, then work with your doctor, nurse practitioner or other health care provider to determine whether a birth control pill or a vaginal ring might best meet your needs. If you know you want to become pregnant someday — just not anytime soon — long-acting reversible contraception may be a good choice. Long-acting reversible contraception provides effective birth control with little day-to-day hassle. Options for long-acting reversible contraception include: An intrauterine device (Mirena, ParaGard, Skyla, others) You need a prescription from your doctor for this type of birth control. Besides its effectiveness and ease of use, long-acting reversible contraception allows for a return to fertility once you stop using the contraception. With the intrauterine device and contraceptive implant, the return to fertility is prompt. With the contraceptive injection, return to fertility may take a little longer. The intrauterine device or contraceptive implant requires a visit to your doctor for removal if you decide you no longer want to use this type of birth control. When you think of birth control options, what comes to mind? Birth control pills are a popular choice, but don't stop there. Other birth control options abound — and the choice is up to you. If you need birth control only occasionally, over-the-counter male or female condoms might be appropriate birth control options. Condoms also provide protection against sexually transmitted infections. The contraceptive sponge is another option that's available without a prescription. As you consider your birth control options, be open to all possibilities. Get familiar with how different types of birth control work, as well as the risks and benefits of specific birth control options. Natural family planning may be an appealing birth control option if you can't or choose not to use other contraceptives. Natural family planning is a method of birth control that helps you predict when ovulation will happen — and when you need to avoid unprotected sex if you don't want to conceive a child. This birth control method may involve charting your temperature daily, tracking changes in cervical mucus and paying attention to other key fertility indicators. Another type of natural family planning is withdrawal, in which the penis is removed from the vagina before ejaculation to try to prevent pregnancy. Natural family planning requires motivation, diligence and self-control. Natural family planning isn't as effective as other types of birth control, but it's inexpensive and doesn't have any side effects. If you're sure that you don't want a future pregnancy, you may consider sterilization. For men, vasectomy is the only option for sterilization. During this straightforward surgery, the tubes that carry sperm into the semen are cut and sealed. Women may choose a sterilization option such as tubal ligation, a surgical procedure that permanently blocks the fallopian tubes. Another option is complete removal of the fallopian tubes (salpingectomy), which may reduce ovarian cancer risk, too. Sterilization is an effective method of birth control. But the decision to pursue sterilization must be taken seriously. Although reversal is sometimes possible after vasectomy or tubal ligation, sterilization of any type is considered permanent. Emergency contraception helps prevent pregnancy after unprotected sex. Emergency contraception isn't meant to be used in place of routine birth control. But it's an option if you have unprotected sex, your method of birth control fails or you miss a birth control pill. To be effective, emergency contraception must be used as soon as possible after unprotected sex. Options include emergency contraception pills and the copper intrauterine device (IUD). Emergency contraception pills — such as Next Choice One Dose, Plan B One-Step and Ella — can be used up to five days after unprotected sex. But the pills are more effective the sooner you take them. A copper IUD (ParaGard) can also be used as emergency contraception. To prevent pregnancy, the IUD must be inserted within five days after unprotected sex. Frequently asked questions.

cd2d966b-e129-4de8-bb62-4f9e625dacdf,"It is recommended that you also refer to as the Summary of Product Characteristics may have been updated since this copy was printed. United Drug House, Magna Drive, Magna Business Park, Citywest Road, Dublin 24, , Ireland Summary of Product Characteristics last updated on medicines.ie: 27/1/2016 Menopur 600IU powder and solvent for solution for injection MENOPUR 600 IU Powder and Solvent for Solution for Injection Each vial with powder contains highly purified menotrophin (human menopausal gonadotrophin, HMG) corresponding to follicle stimulating hormone activity FSH 600IU and luteinizing hormone activity LH 600IU. After reconstitution, 1 ml of the reconstituted solution contains 600 IU of highly purified menotrophin. Human Chorionic Gonadotrophin (hCG), a naturally occurring hormone in postmenopausal urine, is present in MENOPUR and is the main contributor of the LH activity. Appearance of powder: white to off-white lyophilisation cake MENOPUR is indicated for the treatment of infertility in the following clinical situations: • Anovulation, including polycystic ovarian disease (PCOD), in women who have been unresponsive to treatment with clomiphene citrate. • Controlled ovarian hyperstimulation to induce the development of multiple follicles for assisted reproductive technologies (ART) (e.g in vitro fertilisation/embryo transfer (IVF/ET), gamete intra-fallopian transfer (GIFT) and intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI). Treatment with MENOPUR should be initiated under the supervision of a physician experienced in the treatment of fertility problems. There are great inter-individual variations in the response of the ovaries to exogenous gonadotrophins. This makes it impossible to set a uniform dosage scheme. The dosage should, therefore, be adjusted individually depending on the ovarian response. MENOPUR can be given alone or in combination with a gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist or antagonist. Recommendations about dosage and duration of treatment may change depending on the actual treatment protocol. The object of MENOPUR therapy is to develop a single Graafian follicle from which the oocyte will be liberated after the administration of human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG). MENOPUR therapy should start within the initial 7 days of the menstrual cycle. The recommended initial dose of MENOPUR is 75-150 IU daily, which should be maintained for at least 7 days. Based on clinical monitoring (including ovarian ultrasound alone or in combination with measurement of oestradiol levels) subsequent dosing should be adjusted according to the individual patient response. Adjustments in dose should not be made more frequently than every 7 days. The recommended dose increment is 37.5 IU per adjustment, and should not exceed 75 IU. The maximum daily dose should not be higher than 225 IU. If a patient fails to respond adequately after 4 weeks of treatment, the cycle should be abandoned and the patient should recommence treatment at a higher starting dose than in the abandoned cycle. When an optimal response is obtained, a single injection of 5,000 IU to 10,000 IU hCG should be given 1 day after the last MENOPUR injection. The patient is recommended to have coitus on the day of and the day following hCG administration. Alternatively intrauterine insemination (IUI) may be performed. If an excessive response to MENOPUR is obtained, treatment should be stopped and hCG withheld (see section 4.4) and the patient should use a barrier method of contraception or refrain from having coitus until the next menstrual bleeding has started. Women undergoing controlled ovarian hyperstimulation for multiple follicular development for assisted reproductive technologies (ART): In a protocol using down-regulation with a GnRH agonist, MENOPUR therapy should start approximately 2 weeks after the start of agonist treatment. In a protocol using down-regulation with a GnRH antagonist, MENOPUR therapy should start on day 2 or 3 of the menstrual cycle. The recommended initial dose of MENOPUR is 150-225 IU daily for at least the first 5 days of treatment. Based on clinical monitoring (including ovarian ultrasound alone or in combination with measurement of oestradiol levels) subsequent dosing should be adjusted according to individual patient response, and should not exceed more than 150 IU per adjustment. The maximum daily dose given should not be higher than 450 IU daily and in most cases dosing beyond 20 days is not recommended. When a suitable number of follicles have reached an appropriate size, a single injection of up to 10,000 IU hCG should be administered to induce final follicular maturation in preparation for oocyte retrieval. Patients should be followed closely for at least 2 weeks after hCG administration. If an excessive response to MENOPUR is obtained, treatment should be stopped and hCG withheld(see section 4.4) and the patient should use a barrier method of contraception or refrain from having coitus until the next menstrual bleeding has started. There is no relevant use of MENOPUR in the paediatric population. After reconstitution with the solvent provided, MENOPUR 600IU is intended for subcutaneous (S.C.) injection, as the syringe provided is for S.C. administration only. The powder should be reconstituted prior to use. The reconstituted solution is for multiple injections and can be used for up to 28 days. Shaking should be avoided. The solution should not be used if it contains particles or if it is not clear. - Tumours of the pituitary gland or hypothalamus - Hypersensitivity to the active substance or any of the excipients listed in see section 6.1 - Gynaecological haemorrhage of unknown aetiology - Ovarian cysts or enlarged ovaries not due to polycystic ovary disease In the following situations treatment outcome is unlikely to be favourable, and therefore MENOPUR should not be administered: - Malformation of sexual organs incompatible with pregnancy - Fibroid tumours of the uterus incompatible with pregnancy MENOPUR is a potent gonadotrophic substance capable of causing mild to severe adverse reactions, and should only be used by physicians who are thoroughly familiar with infertility problems and their management. Gonadotrophin therapy requires a certain time commitment by physicians and supportive health professionals. Monitoring of ovarian response requires ultrasonography, alone or in combination with monitoring of oestradiol levels, on a regular basis. There is considerable inter-patient variability in response to menotrophin administration, with a poor response to menotrophin in some patients. The lowest effective dose in relation to the treatment objective should be used. The first injection of MENOPUR should be performed under direct medical supervision. Before starting treatment, the couple's infertility should be assessed as appropriate and putative contraindications for pregnancy evaluated. In particular, patients should be evaluated for hypothyroidism, adrenocortical deficiency, hyperprolactinaemia and pituitary or hypothalamic tumours, and appropriate specific treatment given. Patients undergoing stimulation of follicular growth, whether in the frame of a treatment for anovulatory infertility or ART procedures may experience ovarian enlargement or develop hyperstimulation. Adherence to the recommended MENOPUR dosage and regimen of administration, and careful monitoring of therapy will minimise the incidence of such events. Acute interpretation of the indices of follicle development and maturation requires a physician who is experienced in the interpretation of the relevant tests. OHSS is a medical event distinct from uncomplicated ovarian enlargement. OHSS is a syndrome that can manifest itself with increasing degrees of severity. It comprises marked ovarian enlargement, high serum sex steroids, and an increase in vascular permeability which can result in an accumulation of fluid in the peritoneal, plural and, rarely, in the pericardial cavities. The following symptoms may be observed in severe cases of OHSS: abdominal pain, abdominal distension, severe ovarian enlargement, weight gain, dyspnoea, oliguria and gastrointestinal symptoms including nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea. Clinical evaluation may reveal hypovolemia, haemoconcentration, electrolyte imbalances, ascites, haemoperitoneum, pleural effusions, hydrothorax, acute pulmonary distress and thromboembolic events. In very rare cases, severe OHSS may be life-threatening. Excessive ovarian response to gonadotrophin treatment seldom gives rise to OHSS unless hCG is administered to trigger ovulation. Therefore, in cases of ovarian hyperstimulation it is prudent to withhold hCG and advise the patient to refrain from coitus or to use barrier methods for at least 4 days. OHSS may progress rapidly (within 24 hours to several days) to become a serious medical event, therefore patients should be followed up for at least two weeks after the hCG administration. Adherence to recommended MENOPUR dosage, regimen of administration and careful monitoring of therapy will minimise the incidence of ovarian hyperstimulation and multiple pregnancy (see sections 4.2 and 4.8). In ART, aspiration of all follicles prior to ovulation may reduce the occurrence of hyperstimulation. OHSS may be more severe and more protracted if pregnancy occurs. Most often, OHSS occurs after hormonal treatment has been discontinued and reaches its maximum severity at about seven to ten days following treatment. Usually, OHSS resolves spontaneously with the onset of menses. If severe OHSS occurs, gonadotrophin treatment should be stopped if still ongoing, the patient hospitalised and specific therapy for OHSS started. This syndrome occurs with higher incidence in patients with polycystic ovarian disease. Multiple pregnancy, especially high order, carries an increased risk of adverse maternal and perinatal outcomes. In patients undergoing ovulation induction with gonadotrophins, the incidence of multiple pregnancies is increased compared with natural conception. The majority of multiple conceptions are twins. To minimise the risk of multiple pregnancy, careful monitoring of ovarian response is recommended. In patients undergoing ART procedures the risk of multiple pregnancy is related mainly to the number of embryos replaced, their quality and the age of the patient. The patient should be advised of the potential risk of multiple births before starting treatment. The incidence of pregnancy wastage by miscarriage or abortion is higher in patients undergoing stimulation of follicular growth for ART procedures than in the normal population. Women with a history of tubal disease are at risk of ectopic pregnancy, whether the pregnancy is obtained by spontaneous conception or with fertility treatment. The prevalence of ectopic pregnancy after IVF has been reported to be 2 to 5 %, as compared to 1 to 1.5% in the general population. There have been reports of ovarian and other reproductive system neoplasms, both benign and malignant, in women who have undergone multiple drug regimens for infertility treatment. It is not yet established if treatment with gonadotrophins increases the baseline risk of these tumours in infertile women. The prevalence of congenital malformations after ART may be slightly higher than after spontaneous conceptions. This is thought to be due to differences in parental characteristics (e.g. maternal age, sperm characteristics) and multiple pregnancies. Women with generally recognised risk factors for thromboembolic events, such as personal or family history, severe obesity (Body Mass Index > 30 kg/m) or thrombophilia may have increased risk of venous or arterial thromboembolic events, during or following treatment with gonadotrophins. In these women, the benefits of gonadotrophin administration need to be weighed against the risks. It should be noted however, that pregnancy itself also carries an increased risk of thromboembolic events. This product contains lactose monohydrate. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, the Lapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medication. 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction No interaction studies have been performed with MENOPUR in humans. Although there is no controlled clinical experience, it is expected that the concomitant use of MENOPUR and clomiphene citrate may enhance the follicular response. When using GnRH agonist for pituitary desensitisation, a higher dose of MENOPUR may be necessary to achieve adequate follicular response. MENOPUR is indicated for use in infertility (see section 4.1). MENOPUR is contraindicated in women who are pregnant (see section 4.3). There are no or limited amount of data from the use of menotrophins in pregnant women. No animal studies have been carried out to evaluate the effects of MENOPUR during pregnancy (see section 5.3). MENOPUR is contraindicated in women who are lactating (see section 4.3) No studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed. However, MENOPUR is unlikely to have influence on the patient's ability to drive and use machines. The most frequently reported adverse drug reactions (ADR) during treatment with MENOPUR in clinical trials are ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS), headache, abdominal pain, abdominal distension and injection site pain. None of these ADRs have been reported with an incidence rate of more than 5%. The table below displays the main ADRs in women treated with MENOPUR in clinical trials distributed by system organ classes (SOCs) and frequency. Further, the ADRs seen during post-marketing experience are mentioned with unknown frequency. Abdominal pain, Abdominal distension, Nausea General disorders and administration site condition Musculoskeletal & connective tissue disorders Individual cases of temporary amaurosis, diplopia, mydiasis, scotoma, photopsia, vitreous floaters, vision blurred and vision impairment have been reported as visual disorders during the post-marketing period Most frequently reported injection site reaction was injection site pain. Cases of localised or generalised allergic reactions, including anaphylactic reaction, along with associated symptomatology have been reported rarely. Musculoskeletal pain includes arthralgia, back pain, neck pain and pain in extremities. Gastrointestinal symptoms associated with OHSS such as abdominal distension and discomfort, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea have been reported with MENOPUR in clinical trials. In cases of severe OHSS ascites and pelvic fluid collection, pleural effusion, dyspnoea, oliguria, thromboembolic events and ovarian torsion have been reported as rare complications. Pelvic pain includes ovarian pain and adnexa uteri pain. Breast complaints include breast pain, breast tenderness, breast discomfort, nipple pain and breast swelling. Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via HPRA Pharmacovigilance, Earlsfort Terrace, IRL - Dublin 2. Tel: +353 1 6764971; Fax: +353 1 6762517; Website: ; E-mail: . The effect of an overdose is unknown, nevertheless one could expect ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome to occur. Menotrophin, which contains both FSH and LH activity, induces ovarian follicular growth and development as well as gonadal steroid production in women who do not have primary ovarian failure. FSH is the primary driver of follicular recruitment and growth in early folliculogenesis, while LH is important for ovarian steroidogenesis and is involved in the physiological events leading to the development of a competent pre-ovulatory follicle. Follicular growth can be stimulated by FSH in the total absence of LH, but the resulting follicles develop abnormally and are associated with low oestradiol levels and inability to luteinize to a normal ovulatory stimulus. Human Chorionic Gonadotrophin (hCG), a naturally occurring hormone in postmenopausal urine, is present in MENOPUR and is the main contributor of the LH activity. Oestradiol levels associated with treatment with MENOPUR are higher than with recombinant FSH preparations in downregulated IVF/ICSI cycles. This issue should be considered when monitoring patients´ response based on oestradiol levels. The difference in oestradiol levels is not found when using low-dose ovulation induction protocols in anovulatory patients. The pharmacokinetic profile of the FSH in MENOPUR has been documented. After 7 days of repeated dosing with 150 IU MENOPUR in downregulated healthy female volunteers, maximum plasma FSH concentrations Cmax (baseline-corrected) (mean ± SD) were 8.9 ± 3.5 IU/L and 8.5 ± 3.2 IU/L for the SC and IM administration, respectively. Maximum FSH concentrations were reached (Tmax) within 7 hours for both routes of administration. After repeated administration, FSH was eliminated with a half-life (mean ± SD) of 30 ± 11 hours and 27 ± 9 hours for the SC and IM administration, respectively. Although the individual LH concentration versus time curves show an increase in the LH concentration after dosing with MENOPUR, the data available were too sparse to be subjected to a pharmacokinetic analysis. Menotrophin is excreted primarily via the kidneys. The pharmacokinetics of MENOPUR in patients with renal or hepatic impairment has not been investigated. Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans, which is not known from the extensive clinical experience. Reproduction toxicity studies have not been carried out to evaluate the effects of MENOPUR during pregnancy or post partum as MENOPUR is not indicated during these periods. MENOPUR consist of naturally occurring hormones and should be expected to be non-genotoxic. Carcinogenicity studies have not been carried out as the indication is for short term treatment. Sodium phosphate dibasic heptahydrate (for pH adjustment) Phosphoric acid (concentrated) (for pH adjustment) MENOPUR should not be administered in the same injection with other products. After reconstitution, the solution may be stored for a maximum of 28 days at not more than 25°C. Do not freeze. The patient should write the date of first preparation of MENOPUR on the outer carton. Store in a refrigerator (2°C – 8°C). Do not freeze. For storage conditions after reconstitution of the medicinal product, see section 6.3. Powder: 2ml colourless glass (type 1 glass) vial with rubber stopper closed with a cap. Solvent: 1ml pre-filled syringe (type 1 glass) with rubber tip cap and plunger rubber stopper. The product is supplied as a pack of 1 vial of powder, 1 pre-filled syringe with solvent for reconstitution, 1 needle for reconstitution, 9 alcohol pads and 9 disposable syringes for administration graduated in FSH/LH units with pre-fixed needles. 6.6 Special precautions for disposal and other handling The powder should only be reconstituted with the solvent provided in the package. Attach the reconstitution needle to the prefilled syringe. MENOPUR 600 IU must be reconstituted with one pre-filled syringe with solvent before use. The powder should dissolve quickly to a clear solution. If not, roll the vial gently between the hands until the solution is clear. Shaking should be avoided. The single use administration syringes with pre-fixed needle are graduated in FSH/LH units from 37.5 – 600 IU. Draw up the reconstituted solution from the vial into the administration syringe for injection according to the prescribed dose and administer the dose immediately. Each ml of reconstituted solution contains 600 IU FSH and LH. Each reconstituted MENOPUR 600 IU vial should be for individual patient use only. The reconstituted solution should not be administered if it contains particles or is not clear. Any unused product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local requirements. 9.

Each active, white tablet (21) contains 0.1 mg of levonorgestrel, d (-)-13β-ethyl-17α-ethinyl-17β- hydroxygon-4-en-3-one, a totally synthetic progestogen, and 0.02 mg of ethinyl estradiol, 17α-ethinyl- 1,3,5(10)-estratriene-3,17β-diol. The inactive ingredients present are croscarmellose sodium, lactose monohydrate, magnesium stearate, microcrystalline cellulose, and povidone. Each inactive, peach tablet (7) contains the following inactive ingredients: FD&C Yellow #6, lactose anhydrous, lactose monohydrate, magnesium stearate, and microcrystalline cellulose. Combination oral contraceptives act by suppression of gonadotropins. Although the primary mechanism of this action is inhibition of ovulation, other alterations include changes in the cervical mucus (which increase the difficulty of sperm entry into the uterus) and the endometrium (which reduce the likelihood of implantation). No specific investigation of the absolute bioavailability of Lutera in humans has been conducted. However, literature indicates that levonorgestrel is rapidly and completely absorbed after oral administration (bioavailability about 100%) and is not subject to first-pass metabolism. Ethinyl estradiol is rapidly and almost completely absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract but, due to first-pass metabolism in gut mucosa and liver, the bioavailability of ethinyl estradiol is between 38% and 48%. After a single dose of Lutera to 22 women under fasting conditions, maximum serum concentrations of levonorgestrel are 2.8 ± 0.9 ng/mL (mean ± SD) at 1.6 ± 0.9 hours. At steady state, attained from day 19 onwards, maximum levonorgestrel concentrations of 6 ± 2.7 ng/mL are reached at 1.5 ± 0.5 hours after the daily dose. The minimum serum levels of levonorgestrel at steady state are 1.9 ± 1 ng/mL. Observed levonorgestrel concentrations increased from day 1 (single dose) to days 6 and 21 (multiple doses) by 34% and 96%, respectively (Figure I). Unbound levonorgestrel concentrations increased from day 1 to days 6 and 21 by 25% and 83%, respectively. The kinetics of total levonorgestrel are non-linear due to an increase in binding of levonorgestrel to sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG), which is attributed to increased SHBG levels that are induced by the daily administration of ethinyl estradiol. Following a single dose, maximum serum concentrations of ethinyl estradiol of 62 ± 21 pg/mL are reached at 1.5 ± 0.5 hours. At steady state, attained from at least day 6 onwards, maximum concentrations of ethinyl estradiol were 77 ± 30 pg/mL and were reached at 1.3 ± 0.7 hours after the daily dose. The minimum serum levels of ethinyl estradiol at steady state are 10.5 ± 5.1 pg/mL. Ethinyl estradiol concentrations did not increase from days 1 to 6, but did increase by 19% from days 1 to 21 (Figure I). TABLE I provides a summary of levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol pharmacokinetic parameters. TABLE I: MEAN (SD) PHARMACOKINETIC PARAMETERS OF LUTERA OVER A 21-DAY DOSING PERIOD Levonorgestrel in serum is primarily bound to SHBG. Ethinyl estradiol is about 97% bound to plasma albumin. Ethinyl estradiol does not bind to SHBG, but induces SHBG synthesis. The most important metabolic pathway occurs in the reduction of the Δ4-3-oxo group and hydroxylation at positions 2α, 1β, and 16β, followed by conjugation. Most of the metabolites that circulate in the blood are sulfates of 3α,5β-tetrahydro-levonorgestrel, while excretion occurs predominantly in the form of glucuronides. Some of the parent levonorgestrel also circulates as 17β- sulfate. Metabolic clearance rates may differ among individuals by several-fold, and this may account in part for the wide variation observed in levonorgestrel concentrations among users. Cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYP3A4) in the liver are responsible for the 2- hydroxylation that is the major oxidative reaction. The 2-hydroxy metabolite is further transformed by methylation and glucuronidation prior to urinary and fecal excretion. Levels of Cytochrome P450 (CYP3A) vary widely among individuals and can explain the variation in rates of ethinyl estradiol 2- hydroxylation. Ethinyl estradiol is excreted in the urine and feces as glucuronide and sulfate conjugates, and undergoes enterohepatic circulation. The elimination half-life for levonorgestrel is approximately 36 ± 13 hours at steady state. Levonorgestrel and its metabolites are primarily excreted in the urine (40% to 68%) and about 16% to 48% are excreted in feces. The elimination half-life of ethinyl estradiol is 18 ± 4.7 hours at steady state. Based on the pharmacokinetic study with Lutera, there are no apparent differences in pharmacokinetic parameters among women of different races. No formal studies have evaluated the effect of hepatic disease on the disposition of Lutera. However, steroid hormones may be poorly metabolized in patients with impaired liver function. No formal studies have evaluated the effect of renal disease on the disposition of Lutera. Lutera is indicated for the prevention of pregnancy in women who elect to use oral contraceptives as a method of contraception. Oral contraceptives are highly effective. Table II lists the typical accidental pregnancy rates for users of combination oral contraceptives and other methods of contraception. The efficacy of these contraceptive methods, except sterilization, the IUD, and Norplant System, depends upon the reliability with which they are used. Correct and consistent use of methods can result in lower failure rates.

United States. % of Women Experiencing an Unintended Pregnancy within the First Year of Use Emergency Contraceptive Pills: The FDA has concluded that certain combined oral contraceptives containing ethinyl estradiol and norgestrel or levonorgestrel are safe and effective for use as postcoital emergency contraception. Treatment initiated within 72 hours after unprotected intercourse reduces the risk of pregnancy by at least 75%.

Among couples attempting to avoid pregnancy, the percentage who continue to use a method for one year. Among typical couples who initiate use of a method (not necessarily for the first time), the percentage who experience an accidental pregnancy during the first year if they do not stop use for any other reason. Among couples who initiate use of a method (not necessarily for the first time) and who use it perfectly (both consistently and correctly), the percentage who experience and accidental pregnancy during the first year if they do not stop use for any other reason. The treatment schedule is one dose within 72 hours after unprotected intercourse, and a second dose 12 hours after the first dose. The FDA has declared the following dosage regimens of oral contraceptives to be safe and effective for emergency contraception: for tablets containing 50 mcg of ethinyl estradiol and 500 mcg norgestrel 1 dose is 2 tablets; for tablets containing 20 mcg of ethinyl estradiol and 100 mcg of levonorgestrel 1 dose is 5 tablets; for tablets containing 30 mcg of ethinyl estradiol and 150 mcg of levonorgestrel 1 dose is 4 tablets. However, to maintain effective protection against pregnancy, another method of contraception must be used as soon as menstruation resumes, the frequency or duration of breastfeeds is reduced, bottle feeds are introduced, or the baby reaches 6 months of age. The percents becoming pregnant in columns (2) and (3) are based on data from populations where contraception is not used and from women who cease using contraception in order to become pregnant. Among such populations, about 89% become pregnant within one year. This estimate was lowered slightly (to 85%) to represent the percent who would become pregnant within one year among women now relying on reversible methods of contraception if they abandoned contraception altogether. Foams, creams, gels, vaginal suppositories, and vaginal film. Cervical mucus (ovulation) method supplemented by calendar in the pre-ovulatory and basal body temperature in the post-ovulatory phases. In a clinical trial with levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol tablets, 1,477 subjects had 7,720 cycles of use and a total of 5 pregnancies were reported. This represents an overall pregnancy rate of 0.84 per 100 woman-years. This rate includes patients who did not take the drug correctly. One or more pills were missed during 1,479 (18.8%) of the 7,870 cycles; thus all tablets were taken during 6,391 (81.2%) of the 7,870 cycles. Of the total 7,870 cycles, a total of 150 cycles were excluded from the calculation of the Pearl index due to the use of backup contraception and/or missing 3 or more consecutive pills. Oral contraceptives should not be used in women with any of the following conditions: A history of deep-vein thrombophlebitis or thromboembolic disorders Cerebrovascular or coronary artery disease (current or past history) Valvular heart disease with thrombogenic complications Known or suspected carcinoma of the breast or personal history of breast cancer Carcinoma of the endometrium or other known or suspected estrogen-dependent neoplasia Cholestatic jaundice of pregnancy or jaundice with prior pill use Hepatic adenomas or carcinomas, or active liver disease Hypersensitivity to any of the components of Lutera Are receiving Hepatitis C drug combinations containing ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir, with or without dasabuvir, due to the potential for ALT elevations (see Warnings, RISK OF LIVER ENZYME ELEVATIONS WITH CONCOMITANT HEPATITIS C TREATMENT). Cigarette smoking increases the risk of serious cardiovascular side effects from oral-contraceptive use. This risk increases with age and with the extent of smoking (in epidemiologic studies, 15 or more cigarettes per day was associated with a significantly increase risk) and is quite marked in women over 35 years of age. Women who use oral contraceptives should be strongly advised not to smoke. The use of oral contraceptives is associated with increased risks of several serious conditions including venous and arterial thrombotic and thromboembolic events (such as myocardial infarction, thromboembolism, and stroke), hepatic neoplasia, gallbladder disease, and hypertension, although the risk of serious morbidity or mortality is very small in healthy women without underlying risk factors. The risk of morbidity and mortality increases significantly in the presence of other underlying risk factors such as certain inherited or acquired thrombophilias, hypertension, hyperlipidemias, obesity, diabetes, and surgery or trauma with increased risk of thrombosis (see ). Practitioners prescribing oral contraceptives should be familiar with the following information relating to these risks. The information contained in this package insert is principally based on studies carried out in patients who used oral contraceptives with higher doses of estrogens and progestogens than those in common use today. The effect of long-term use of the oral contraceptives with lower doses of both estrogens and progestogens remains to be determined. Throughout this labeling, epidemiological studies reported are of two types: retrospective or case control studies and prospective or cohort studies. Case control studies provide a measure of the relative risk of disease, namely, a ratio of the incidence of a disease among oral-contraceptive users to that among nonusers. The relative risk does not provide information on the actual clinical occurrence of a disease. Cohorts studies provide a measure of attributable risk, which is the difference in the incidence of disease between oral-contraceptive users and nonusers. The attributable risk does provide information about the actual occurrence of a disease in the population. For further information, the reader is referred to a text on epidemiological methods. 1. Thromboembolic Disorders and Other Vascular Problems An increased risk of myocardial infarction has been attributed to oral-contraceptive use. This risk is primarily in smokers or women with other underlying risk factors for coronary-artery disease such as hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, morbid obesity, and diabetes. The relative risk of heart attack for current oral-contraceptive users has been estimated to be two to six. The risk is very low under the age of 30. Smoking in combination with oral-contraceptive use has been shown to contribute substantially to the incidence of myocardial infarction in women in their mid-thirties or older with smoking accounting for the majority of excess cases. Mortality rates associated with circulatory disease have been shown to increase substantially in smokers over the age of 35 and nonsmokers over the age of 40 (FIGURE II) among women who use oral contraceptives. Oral contraceptives may compound the effects of well-known risk factors, such as hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemias, age and obesity. In particular, some progestogens are known to decrease HDL cholesterol and cause glucose intolerance, while estrogens may create a state of hyperinsulinism. Oral contraceptives have been shown to increase blood pressure among users (see ). Similar effects on risk factors have been associated with an increased risk of heart disease. Oral contraceptives must be used with caution in women with cardiovascular disease risk factors An increased risk of venous thromboembolic and thrombotic disease associated with the use of oral contraceptives is well established. Case control studies have found the relative risk of users compared to non-users to be 3 for the first episode of superficial venous thrombosis, 4 to 11 for deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism, and 1.5 to 6 for women with predisposing conditions for venous thromboembolic disease. Cohort studies have shown the relative risk to be somewhat lower, about 3 for new cases and about 4.5 for new cases requiring hospitalization. The approximate incidence of deep-vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism in users of low dose (<50 mcg ethinyl estradiol) combination oral contraceptives is up to 4 per 10,000 women-years compared to 0.5-3 per 10,000 woman-years for non-users. However, the incidence is less than that associated with pregnancy (6 per 10,000 woman-years). The excess risk is highest during the first year a woman ever uses a combined oral contraceptive. Venous thromboembolism may be fatal. The risk of thromboembolic disease due to oral contraceptives is not related to length of use and disappears after pill use is stopped. A two- to four-fold increase in relative risk of postoperative thromboembolic complications has been reported with the use of oral contraceptives. The relative risk of venous thrombosis in women who have predisposing conditions is twice that of women without such medical conditions. If feasible, oral contraceptives should be discontinued at least four weeks prior to and for two weeks after elective surgery of a type associated with an increase in risk of thromboembolism and during and following prolonged immobilization. Since the immediate post-partum period is also associated with an increased risk of thromboembolism, oral contraceptives should be started no earlier than four to six weeks after delivery in women who elect not to breast-feed, or a midtrimester pregnancy termination. Oral contraceptives have been shown to increase both the relative and attributable risks of cerebrovascular events (thrombotic and hemorrhagic strokes), although, in general, the risk is greatest among older (>35 years), hypertensive women who also smoke. Hypertension was found to be a risk factor for both users and non-users, for both types of strokes, while smoking interacted to increase the risk for hemorrhagic strokes. In a large study, the relative risk of thrombotic strokes has been shown to range from 3 for normotensive users to 14 for users with severe hypertension. The relative risk of hemorrhagic stroke is reported to be 1.2 for nonsmokers who used oral contraceptives, 2.6 for smokers who did not use oral contraceptives, 7.6 for smokers who used oral contraceptives, 1.8 for normotensive users and 25.7 for users with severe hypertension. The attributable risk is also greater in older women. Oral contraceptives also increase the risk for stroke in women with other underlying risk factors such as certain inherited or acquired thrombophilias. Women with migraine (particularly migraine/headaches with focal neurological symptoms, see ) who take combination oral contraceptives may be at an increased risk of stroke. d. Dose-related risk of vascular disease from oral contraceptives A positive association has been observed between the amount of estrogen and progestogen in oral contraceptives and the risk of vascular disease. A decline in serum high-density lipoproteins (HDL) has been reported with many progestational agents. A decline in serum high density lipoproteins has been associated with an increased incidence of ischemic heart disease. Because estrogens increase HDL cholesterol, the net effect of an oral contraceptive depends on a balance achieved between doses of estrogen and progestogen and the nature and absolute amount of progestogen used in the contraceptive. The amount of both hormones should be considered in the choice of an oral contraceptive. Minimizing exposure to estrogen and progestogen is in keeping with good principles of therapeutics. For any particular estrogen/progestogen combination, the dosage regimen prescribed should be one which contains the least amount of estrogen and progestogen that is compatible with a low failure rate and the needs of the individual patient. New acceptors of oral contraceptive agents should be started on preparations containing less than 50 mcg of estrogen. There are two studies which have shown persistence of risk of vascular disease for ever-users of oral contraceptives. In a study in the United States, the risk of developing myocardial infarction after discontinuing oral contraceptives persists for at least 9 years for women 40-49 years who had used oral contraceptives for five or more years, but this increased risk was not demonstrated in other age groups. In another study in Great Britain, the risk of developing cerebrovascular disease persisted for at least 6 years after discontinuation of oral contraceptives, although excess risk was very small. However, both studies were performed with oral contraceptive formulations containing 50 mcg or higher of estrogens. One study gathered data from a variety of sources which have estimated the mortality rate associated with different methods of contraception at different ages (TABLE III). These estimates include the combined risk of death associated with contraceptive methods plus the risk attributable to pregnancy in the event of method failure. Each method of contraception has its specific benefits and risks. The study concluded that with the exception of oral-contraceptive users 35 and older who smoke and 40 and older who do not smoke, mortality associated with all methods of birth control is less than that associated with childbirth. The observation of a possible increase in risk of mortality with age for oral-contraceptive users is based on data gathered in the 1970's—but not reported until 1983. However, current clinical practice involves the use of lower estrogen dose formulations combined with careful restriction of oral contraceptive use to women who do not have the various risk factors listed in this labeling. Because of these changes in practice and, also, because of some limited new data which suggest that the risk of cardiovascular disease with the use of oral contraceptives may now be less than previously observed, the Fertility and Maternal Health Drugs Advisory Committee was asked to review the topic in 1989. The Committee concluded that although cardiovascular disease risks may be increased with oral- contraceptive use after age 40 in healthy non-smoking women (even with the newer low-dose formulations), there are greater potential health risks associated with pregnancy in older women and with the alternative surgical and medical procedures which may be necessary if such women do not have access to effective and acceptable means of contraception. Therefore, the Committee recommended that the benefits of oral contraceptive use by healthy non- smoking women over 40 may outweigh the possible risks. Of course, older women, as all women who take oral contraceptives, should take the lowest possible dose formulation that is effective. TABLE III: ANNUAL NUMBER OF BIRTH-RELATED OR METHOD- RELATED DEATHS ASSOCIATED WITH CONTROL OF FERTILITY PER 100,000 NONSTERILE WOMEN, BY FERTILITY-CONTROL METHOD AND ACCORDING TO AGE Adapted from H.W. Ory, Family Planning Perspectives, :57-63, 1983. 3. Carcinoma of the Reproductive Organs and Breasts Numerous epidemiological studies have examined the association between the use of oral contraceptives and the incidence of breast and cervical cancer. The risk of having breast cancer diagnosed may be slightly increased among current and recent users of combination oral contraceptives. However, this excess risk appears to decrease over time after combination oral contraceptive discontinuation and by 10 years after cessation the increased risk disappears. Some studies report an increased risk with duration of use while other studies do not and no consistent relationships have been found with dose or type of steroid. Some studies have reported a small increase in risk for women who first use combination oral contraceptives at a younger age. Most studies show a similar pattern of risk with combination oral contraceptive use regardless of a women's reproductive history or her family breast cancer history. Breast cancers diagnosed in current or previous OC users tend to be less clinically advanced than in nonusers. Women with known or suspected carcinoma of the breast or personal history of breast cancer should not use oral contraceptives because breast cancer is usually a hormonally-sensitive tumor. Some studies suggest that oral contraceptive use has been associated with an increase in the risk of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia or invasive cervical cancer in some populations of women. However, there continues to be controversy about the extent to which such findings may be due to differences in sexual behavior and other factors. In spite of many studies of the relationship between oral contraceptive use and breast and cervical cancers, a cause-and-effect relationship has not been established. Benign hepatic adenomas are associated with oral-contraceptive use, although the incidence of these benign tumors is rare in the United States. Indirect calculations have estimated the attributable risk to be in the range of 3.3 cases/100,000 for users, a risk that increases after four or more years of use. Rupture of rare, benign, hepatic adenomas may cause death through intra-abdominal hemorrhage. Studies from Britain have shown an increased risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma in long-term (>8 years) oral-contraceptive users. However, these cancers are extremely rare in the U.S. and the attributable risk (the excess incidence) of liver cancers in oral-contraceptive users approaches less than one per million users. 5. RISK OF LIVER ENZYME ELEVATIONS WITH CONCOMITANT HEPATITIS C TREATMENT During clinical trials with the Hepatitis C combination drug regimen that contains ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir, with or without dasabuvir, ALT elevations greater than 5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN), including some cases greater than 20 times the ULN, were significantly more frequent in women using ethinyl estradiol-containing medications such as COCs. Discontinue Lutera prior to starting therapy with the combination drug regimen ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir, with or without dasabuvir . Lutera can be restarted approximately 2 weeks following completion of treatment with the combination drug regimen. There have been clinical case reports of retinal thrombosis associated with the use of oral contraceptives that may lead to partial or complete loss of vision. Oral contraceptives should be discontinued if there is unexplained partial or complete loss of vision; onset of proptosis or diplopia; papilledema; or retinal vascular lesions. Appropriate diagnostic and therapeutic measures should be undertaken immediately. 7. Oral-Contraceptive Use Before or During Early Pregnancy Extensive epidemiological studies have revealed no increased risk of birth defects in women who have used oral contraceptives prior to pregnancy. Studies also do not suggest a teratogenic effect particularly insofar as cardiac anomalies and limb-reduction defects are concerned, when taken inadvertently during early pregnancy (see section). The administration of oral contraceptives to induce withdrawal bleeding should not be used as a test for pregnancy. Oral contraceptives should not be used during pregnancy to treat threatened or habitual abortion. It is recommended that for any patient who has missed two consecutive periods, pregnancy should be ruled out. If the patient has not adhered to the prescribed schedule, the possibility of pregnancy should be considered at the time of the first missed period. Oral contraceptive use should be discontinued if pregnancy is confirmed. Combination oral contraceptives may worsen existing gallbladder disease and may accelerate the development of this disease in previously asymptomatic women. Earlier studies have reported an increased lifetime relative risk of gallbladder surgery in users of oral contraceptives and estrogens. More recent studies, however, have shown that the relative risk of developing gallbladder disease among oral contraceptive users may be minimal. The recent findings of minimal risk may be related to the use of oral-contraceptive formulations containing lower hormonal doses of estrogens and progestogens. Oral contraceptives have been shown to cause glucose intolerance in a significant percentage of users. Oral contraceptives containing greater than 75 mcg of estrogens cause hyperinsulinism, while lower doses of estrogen cause less glucose intolerance. Progestogens increase insulin secretion and create insulin resistance, this effect varying with different progestational agents. However, in the nondiabetic woman, oral contraceptives appear to have no effect on fasting blood glucose. Because of these demonstrated effects, prediabetic and diabetic women should be carefully observed while taking oral contraceptives. A small proportion of women will have persistent hypertriglyceridemia while on the pill. As discussed earlier (see and ), changes in serum triglycerides and lipoprotein levels have been reported in oral-contraceptive users. An increase in blood pressure has been reported in women taking oral contraceptives and this increase is more likely in older oral-contraceptive users and with continued use. Data from the Royal College of General Practitioners and subsequent randomized trials have shown that the incidence of hypertension increases with increasing quantities of progestogens. Women with a history of hypertension or hypertension-related diseases, or renal disease should be encouraged to use another method of contraception. If women with hypertension elect to use oral contraceptives, they should be monitored closely and if significant elevation of blood pressure occurs, oral contraceptives should be discontinued (see section). For most women, elevated blood pressure will return to normal after stopping oral contraceptives, and there is no difference in the occurrence of hypertension among ever- and never-users. The onset or exacerbation of migraine or development of headache with a new pattern that is recurrent, persistent or severe requires discontinuation of oral contraceptives and evaluation of the cause. (See and ) Breakthrough bleeding and spotting are sometimes encountered in patients on oral contraceptives, especially during the first three months of use. The type and dose of progestogen may be important. If bleeding persists or recurs, nonhormonal causes should be considered and adequate diagnostic measures taken to rule out malignancy or pregnancy in the event of breakthrough bleeding, as in the case of any abnormal vaginal bleeding. If pathology has been excluded, time or a change to another formulation may solve the problem. In the event of amenorrhea, pregnancy should be ruled out. Some women may encounter post-pill amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea, especially when such a condition was pre-existent. Ectopic as well as intrauterine pregnancy may occur in contraceptive failures. Patients should be counseled that oral contraceptives do not protect against transmission of HIV (AIDS) and other sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) such as chlamydia, genital herpes, gential warts, gonorrhea, hepatitis B, and syphilis. A periodic personal and family medical history and complete physical examination are appropriate for all women, including women using oral contraceptives. The physical examination, however, may be deferred until after initiation of oral contraceptives if requested by the woman and judged appropriate by the clinician. The physical examination should include special reference to blood pressure, breasts, abdomen, and pelvic organs, including cervical cytology, and relevant laboratory tests. In case of undiagnosed, persistent, or recurrent abnormal vaginal bleeding, appropriate diagnostic measures should be conducted to rule out malignancy. Women with a strong family history of breast cancer or who have breast nodules should be monitored with particular care. Women who are being treated for hyperlipidemias should be followed closely if they elect to use oral contraceptives. Some progestogens may elevate LDL levels and may render the control of hyperlipidemias more difficult. (See and ) A small proportion of women will have adverse lipid changes while taking oral contraceptives. Nonhormonal contraception should be considered in women with uncontrolled dyslipidemias. Persistent hypertriglyceridemia may occur in a small population of combination oral contraceptive users. Elevations of plasma triglycerides may lead to pancreatitis and other complications. If jaundice develops in any woman receiving such drugs, the medication should be discontinued. Steroid hormones may be poorly metabolized in patients with impaired liver function. Oral contraceptives may cause some degree of fluid retention. They should be prescribed with caution, and only with careful monitoring, in patients with conditions which might be aggravated by fluid retention. Patients becoming significantly depressed while taking oral contraceptives should stop the medication and use an alternate method of contraception in an attempt to determine whether the symptom is drug related. Women with a history of depression should be carefully observed and the drug discontinued if depression recurs to a serious degree. Contact-lens wearers who develop visual changes or changes in lens tolerance should be assessed by an ophthalmologist. Diarrhea and/or vomiting may reduce hormone absorption resulting in decreased serum concentrations. Changes in Contraceptive Effectiveness Associated with Coadministration of Other Products Contraceptive effectiveness may be reduced when hormonal contraceptives are coadministered with antibiotics, anticonvulsants, and other drugs that increase the metabolism of contraceptive steroids. This could result in unintended pregnancy or breakthrough bleeding. Examples include rifampin, rifabutin, barbiturates, primidone, phenylbutazone, phenytoin, dexamethasone, carbamazepine, felbamate, oxcarbazepine, topiramate, griseofulvin, and modafinil. In such cases a back-up nonhormonal method of birth control should be considered. Several cases of contraceptive failure and breakthrough bleeding have been reported in the literature with concomitant administration of antibiotics such as ampicillin and other penicillins, and tetracyclines. However, clinical pharmacology studies investigating drug interactions between combined oral contraceptives and these antibiotics have reported inconsistent results. Several of the anti-HIV protease inhibitors have been studied with co-administration of oral combination hormonal contraceptives; significant changes (increase and decrease) in the plasma levels of the estrogen and progestin have been noted in some cases. The safety and efficacy of oral contraceptive products may be affected with coadministration of anti-HIV protease inhibitors. Healthcare providers should refer to the label of the individual anti-HIV protease inhibitors for further drug-drug interaction information. Herbal products containing St. John's Wort (Hypericum perforatum) may induce hepatic enzymes (cytochrome P 450) and p-glycoprotein transporter and may reduce the effectiveness of contraceptive steroids. This may also result in breakthrough bleeding. Increase in Plasma Levels Associated with Co-Administered Drugs Co-administration of atorvastatin and certain oral contraceptives containing ethinyl estradiol increases AUC values for ethinyl estradiol by approximately 20%. Ascorbic acid and acetaminophen increase the bioavailability of ethinyl estradiol since these drugs act as competitive inhibitors for sulfation of ethinyl estradiol in the gastrointestinal wall, a known pathway of elimination for ethinyl estradiol. CYP 3A4 inhibitors such as indinavir, itraconazole, ketoconazole, fluconazole, and troleandomycin may increase plasma hormone levels. Troleandomycin may also increase the risk of intrahepatic cholestasis during coadministration with combination oral contraceptives. Combination hormonal contraceptives containing some synthetic estrogens (eg, ethinyl estradiol) may inhibit the metabolism of other compounds. Increased plasma concentrations of cyclosporin, prednisolone and other corticosteroids, and theophylline have been reported with concomitant administration of oral contraceptives. Decreased plasma concentrations of acetaminophen and increased clearance of temazepam, salicylic acid, morphine, and clofibric acid, due to induction of conjugation (particularly glucuronidation), have been noted when these drugs were administered with oral contraceptives. The prescribing information of concomitant medications should be consulted to identify potential interactions. Concomitant Use with HCV Combination Therapy – Liver Enzyme Elevation Do not co-administer Lutera with HCV drug combinations containing ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir, with or without dasabuvir, due to potential for ALT elevations see Warnings, RISK OF LIVER ENZYME ELEVATIONS WITH CONCOMITANT HEPATITIS C TREATMENT). Certain endocrine- and liver-function tests and blood components may be affected by oral contraceptives: Increased prothrombin and factors VII, VIII, IX, and X; decreased antithrombin 3; increased norepinephrine-induced platelet aggregability. Increased thyroid-binding globulin (TBG) leading to increased circulating total thyroid hormone, as measured by protein-bound iodine (PBI), T by column or by radioimmunoassay. Free T resin uptake is decreased, reflecting the elevated TBG; free T concentration is unaltered. Other binding proteins may be elevated in serum i.e., corticosteroid binding globulin (CBG), sex hormone-binding globulins (SHBG) leading to increased levels of total circulating corticosteroids and sex steroids respectively. Free or biologically active hormone concentrations are unchanged. Triglycerides may be increased and levels of various other lipids and lipoproteins may be affected. Serum folate levels may be depressed by oral contraceptive therapy. This may be of clinical significance if a woman becomes pregnant shortly after discontinuing oral contraceptives. Small amounts of oral contraceptive steroids have been identified in the milk of nursing mothers, and a few adverse effects on the child have been reported, including jaundice and breast enlargement. In addition, combination oral contraceptives given in the postpartum period may interfere with lactation by decreasing the quantity and quality of breast milk. If possible, the nursing mother should be advised not to use oral contraceptives but to use other forms of contraception until she has completely weaned her child. Safety and efficacy of Lutera tablets have been established in women of reproductive age. Safety and efficacy are expected to be the same for postpubertal adolescents under the age of 16 and for users 16 years and older. Use of Lutera before menarche is not indicated. Lutera has not been studied in women over 65 years of age and is not indicated in this population. An increased risk of the following serious adverse reactions (see section for additional information) has been associated with the use of oral contraceptives: Thromboembolic and thrombotic disorders and other vascular problems (including thrombophlebitis and venous thrombosis with or without pulmonary embolism, mesenteric thrombosis, arterial thromboembolism, myocardial infarction, cerebral hemorrhage, cerebral thrombosis), carcinoma of the reproductive organs and breasts, hepatic neoplasia (including hepatic adenomas or benign liver tumors), ocular lesions (including retinal vascular thrombosis), gallbladder disease, carbohydrate and lipid effects, elevated blood pressure, and headache including migrane. The following adverse reactions have been reported in patients receiving oral contraceptives and are believed to be drug related (alphabetically listed): Anaphylactic/anaphylactoid reactions, including urticarial, angioedema, and severe reactions with respiratory and circulatory symptoms Breast changes: tenderness, pain, enlargement, secretion Gastrointestinal symptoms (such as abdominal pain, cramps, and bloating) Infertility after discontinuation of treatment, temporary Lactation, diminution in, when given immediately postpartum Weight or appetite (increase or decrease), change in The following adverse reactions have been reported in users of oral contraceptives: Optic neuritis, which may lead to partial or complete loss of vision Symptoms of oral contraceptive overdosage in adults and children may include nausea, vomiting, and drowsiness/fatigue; withdrawal bleeding may occur in females. There is no specific antidote and further treatment of overdose, if necessary, is directed to the symptoms. The following noncontraceptive health benefits related to the use of oral contraceptives are supported by epidemiological studies which largely utilized oral contraceptive formulations containing doses exceeding 0.035 mg of ethinyl estradiol or 0.05 mg of mestranol. Decreased blood loss and decreased incidence of iron-deficiency anemia Decreased incidence of fibroadenomas and fibrocystic disease Decreased incidence of acute pelvic inflammatory disease To achieve maximum contraceptive effectiveness, Lutera® (levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol tablets) must be taken exactly as directed and at intervals not exceeding 24 hours. The dosage of Lutera is one white tablet daily for 21 consecutive days, followed by one peach inert tablet daily for 7 consecutive days, according to the prescribed schedule. It is recommended that Lutera tablets be taken at the same time each day. The dispenser should be kept in the wallet supplied to avoid possible fading of the pills. If the pills fade, patients should continue to take them as directed. The possibility of ovulation and conception prior to initiation of medication should be considered. The patient should be instructed to begin taking Lutera on either the first Sunday after the onset menstruation (Sunday Start) or on Day 1 of menstruation (Day 1 Start). The patient is instructed to begin taking Lutera on the first Sunday after the onset of menstruation. If menstruation begins on a Sunday, the first tablet (white) is taken that day. One white tablet should be taken daily for 21 consecutive days, followed by one peach inert tablet daily for 7 consecutive days. Withdrawal bleeding should usually occur within three days following discontinuation of white tablets and may not have finished before the next pack is started. During the first cycle, contraceptive reliance should not be placed on Lutera until a white tablet has been taken daily for 7 consecutive days, and a nonhormonal back-up method of birth control should be used during those 7 days. During the first cycle of medication, the patient is instructed to begin taking Lutera during the first 24 hours of her period (day one of her menstrual cycle). One white tablet should be taken daily for 21 consecutive days, followed by one peach inert tablet daily for 7 consecutive days. Withdrawal bleeding should usually occur within three days following discontinuation of white tablets and may not have finished before the next pack is started. If medication is begun on day one of the menstrual cycle, no back-up contraception is necessary. If Lutera tablets are started later than day one of the first menstrual cycle or postpartum, contraceptive reliance should not be placed on Lutera tablets until after the first 7 consecutive days of administration, and a nonhormonal back-up method of birth control should be used during those 7 days. The patient begins her next and all subsequent courses of tablets on the day after taking her last peach tablet. She should follow the same dosing schedule: 21 days on white tablets followed by 7 days on peach tablets. If in any cycle the patient starts tablets later than the proper day, she should protect herself against pregnancy by using a nonhormonal back-up method of birth control until she has taken a white tablet daily for 7 consecutive days. Switching from another hormonal method of contraception When the patient is switching from a 21-day regimen of tablets, she should wait 7 days after her last tablet before she starts Lutera. She will probably experience withdrawal bleeding during that week. She should be sure that no more than 7 days pass after her previous 21-day regimen. When the patient is switching from a 28-day regimen of tablets, she should start her first pack of Lutera on the day after her last tablet. She should not wait any days between packs. The patient may switch any day from a progestin-only pill and should begin Lutera the next day. If switching from an implant or injection, the patient should start Lutera on the day of implant removal or, if using an injection, the day the next injection would be due. In switching from a progestin-only pill, injection, or implant, the patient should be advised to use a nonhormonal back-up method of birth control for the first 7 days of tablet-taking. If spotting or breakthrough bleeding occur, the patient is instructed to continue on the same regimen. This type of bleeding is usually transient and without significance; however, if the bleeding is persistent or prolonged, the patient is advised to consult her physician. While there is little likelihood of ovulation occurring if only one or two white tablets are missed, the possibility of ovulation increases with each successive day that scheduled white tablets are missed. Although the occurrence of pregnancy is unlikely if Lutera is taken according to directions, if withdrawal bleeding does not occur, the possibility of pregnancy must be considered. If the patient has not adhered to the prescribed schedule (missed one or more tablets or started taking them on a day later than she should have), the probability of pregnancy should be considered at the time of the first missed period and appropriate diagnostic measures taken. If the patient has adhered to the prescribed regimen and misses two consecutive periods, pregnancy should be ruled out. The risk of pregnancy increases with each active (white) tablet missed. For additional patient instructions regarding missed tablets, see the section in the below. Lutera may be initiated no earlier than day 28 postpartum in the nonlactating mother or after a second trimester abortion due to the increased risk of thromboembolism (see , , and concerning thromboembolic disease). The patient should be advised to use a non-hormonal back-up method for the first 7 days of tablet taking. Lutera may be initiated immediately after a first trimester abortion or miscarriage. If the patient starts Lutera immediately, back-up contraception is not needed. Lutera® tablets (0.1 mg levonorgestrel and 0.02 mg ethinyl estradiol) are available in a 28 Tablet Dispenser, arranged in 3 rows of 7 active tablets and 1 row of inert tablets, as follows: 21 active tablets: white, round tablet debossed with ""WATSON"" on one side and ""949"" on the other side. 7 inert tablets: peach, round tablet debossed with ""WATSON"" on one side and ""P1"" on the other side. Store at 20° to 25°C (68° to 77°F). [See USP controlled room temperature]. This product (like all oral contraceptives) is intended to prevent pregnancy. Oral contraceptives do not protect against transmission of HIV (AIDS) and other sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) such as chlamydia, genital herpes, genital warts, gonorrhea, hepatitis B, and syphilis. Oral contraceptives, also known as ""birth-control pills"" or ""the pill"", are taken to prevent pregnancy, and when taken correctly, have a failure rate of approximately 1.0% (1 pregnancy per 100 women per year of use) when used without missing any pills. The average failure rate of large numbers of pill users is approximately 5% (5 pregnancies per 100 women per year of use) when women who miss pills are included. For most women oral contraceptives are also free of serious or unpleasant side effects. However, forgetting to take pills considerably increases the chances of pregnancy. For the majority of women, oral contraceptives can be taken safely. But there are some women who are at high risk of developing certain serious diseases that can be life-threatening or may cause temporary or permanent disability or death. The risks associated with taking oral contraceptives increase significantly if you: have high blood pressure, diabetes, high cholesterol, or a tendency to form blood clots. have or have had clotting disorders, heart attack, stroke, angina pectoris, cancer of the breast or sex organs, jaundice, malignant or benign liver tumors, or major surgery with prolonged immobilization. You should not take the pill if you suspect you are pregnant or have unexplained vaginal bleeding. Although cardiovascular disease risks may be increased with oral-contraceptive use are age 40 in healthy, nonsmoking women, there are also greater potential health risks associated with pregnancy in older women. Cigarette smoking increases the risk of serious adverse effects on the heart and blood vessels from oral-contraceptive use. This risk increases with age and with the amount of smoking (15 or more cigarettes per day has been associated with a significantly increased risk) and is quite marked in women over 35 years of age. Women who use oral contraceptives should not smoke. Most side effects of the pill are not serious. The most common such effects are nausea, vomiting, bleeding between menstrual periods, weight gain, breast tenderness, and difficulty wearing contact lenses. These side effects, especially nausea and vomiting, may subside within the first three months of use. The serious side effects of the pill occur very infrequently, especially if you are in good health and do not smoke. However, you should know that the following medical conditions have been associated with or made worse by the pill: Blood clots in the legs (thrombophlebitis), lungs (pulmonary embolism), blockage or rupture of a blood vessel in the brain (stroke), blockage of blood vessels in the heart (heart attack and angina pectoris) or other organs of the body. As mentioned above, smoking increases the risk of heart attacks and strokes and subsequent serious medical consequences. Women with migraine also may be at increased risk of stroke with pill use. Liver tumors, which may rupture and cause severe bleeding. A possible but not definite association has been found with the pill and liver cancer. However, liver cancers are extremely rare. The chance of developing liver cancer from using the pill is thus even rarer. High blood pressure, although blood pressure usually returns to normal when the pill is stopped. The symptoms associated with these serious side effects are discussed in the detailed leaflet given to you with your supply of pills. Notify your doctor or health-care provider if you notice any unusual physical disturbances while taking the pill. In addition, drugs such as rifampin, as well as some anticonvulsants and some antibiotics, herbal preparations containing St. John's Wort (Hypericum perforatum), and HIV/AIDS drugs may decrease oral-contraceptive effectiveness. Various studies give conflicting reports on the relationship between breast cancer and oral contraceptive use. Oral contraceptive use may slightly increase your chance of having breast cancer diagnosed, particularly if you started using hormonal contraceptives at a younger age. After you stop using hormonal contraceptives, the chances of having breast cancer diagnosed begin to go down and disappear 10 years after stopping use of the pill. It is not known whether this slightly increased risk of having breast cancer diagnosed is caused by the pill. It may be that women taking the pill were examined more often, so that breast cancer was more likely to be detected. You should have regular breast examinations by a health-care provider and examine your own breasts monthly. Tell your health-care provider if you have a family history of breast cancer or if you have had breast nodules or an abnormal mammogram. Women who currently have or have had breast cancer should not use oral contraceptives because breast cancer is usually a hormone sensitive tumor. Some studies have found an increase in the incidence of cancer of the cervix in women who use oral contraceptives. However, this finding may be related to factors other than the use of oral contraceptives. Taking the pill provides some important noncontraceptive benefits. These include less painful menstruation, less menstrual blood loss and anemia, fewer pelvic infections, and fewer cancers of the ovary and the lining of the uterus. Be sure to discuss any medical condition you may have with your health-care provider. Your health-care provider will take a medical and family history before prescribing oral contraceptives and will examine you. The physical examination may be delayed to another time if you request it and the health-care provider believes that it is appropriate to postpone it. You should be reexamined at least once a year while taking oral contraceptives. The detailed patient information leaflet gives you further information which you should read and discuss with your health-care provider. BE SURE TO READ THESE DIRECTIONS: Before you start taking LUTERA.AndAnytime you are not sure what to do. THE RIGHT WAY TO TAKE THE PILL IS TO TAKE ONE PILL EVERY DAY AT THE SAME TIME. If you miss pills you could get pregnant. This includes starting the pack late. The more pills you miss, the more likely you are to get pregnant. See """" below. MANY WOMEN HAVE SPOTTING OR LIGHT BLEEDING, OR MAY FEEL SICK TO THEIR STOMACH DURING THE FIRST 1-3 PACKS OF PILLS. If you feel sick to your stomach, do not stop taking LUTERA. The problem will usually go away. If it doesn't go away, check with your health-care provider. MISSING PILLS CAN ALSO CAUSE SPOTTING OR LIGHT BLEEDING, even when you make up these missed pills. On the days you take 2 pills to make up for missed pills, you could also feel a little sick to your stomach. IF YOU HAVE VOMITING (within 4 hours after you take your pill), you should follow the instructions for WHAT TO DO IF YOU MISS PILLS. IF YOU HAVE DIARRHEA or IF YOU TAKE SOME MEDICINES, including some antibiotics, your pills may not work as well. Use a back-up nonhormonal method (such as condoms or spermicide) until you check with your health-care provider. IF YOU HAVE TROUBLE REMEMBERING TO TAKE THE PILL, talk to your health-care provider about how to make pill-taking easier or about using another method of birth control. IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS OR ARE UNSURE ABOUT THE INFORMATION IN THIS LEAFLET, call your health-care provider. DECIDE WHAT TIME OF DAY YOU WANT TO TAKE YOUR PILL. It is important to take it at about the same time every day. LOOK AT YOUR PILL PACK. The pill pack has 21 ""active"" white pills (with hormones) to take for 3 weeks, followed by 1 week of reminder peach pills (without hormones). FIND: in what order to take the pills (follow the arrow). BE SURE YOU HAVE READY AT ALL TIMES:ANOTHER KIND OF BIRTH CONTROL (such as condoms or spermicide) to use as a back-up in case you miss pills.AN EXTRA, FULL PILL PACK. You have a choice of which day to start taking your first pack of pills. Decide with your health-care provider which is the best day for you. Pick a time of day which will be easy to remember. Pick the day label strip that starts with the first day of your period. Place this day label strip over the area that has the days of the week (starting with Sunday) pre-printed on the tablet dispenser.     Note: if the first day of your period is a Sunday, you can skip step #1. Take the first ""active"" white pill of the first pack during the You will not need to use a back-up nonhormonal method of birth control, since you are starting the pill at the beginning of your period. Take the first ""active"" white pill of the first pack on the even if you are still bleeding. If your period begins on Sunday, start the pack that same day. (such as condoms or spermicide) as a backup method if you have sex anytime from the Sunday you start your first pack until the next Sunday (7 days). Take one pill at the same time every day until the pack is empty. Do not skip pills even if you are spotting or bleeding between monthly periods or feel sick to your stomach (nausea).Do not skip pills even if you do not have sex very often. When you finish a pack: Start the next pack on the day after your last ""reminder"" pill. Do not wait any days between packs. IF YOU SWITCH FROM ANOTHER BRAND OF COMBINATION PILLS Wait 7 days to start taking LUTERA. You will probably have your period during that week. Be sure that no more than 7 days pass between the 21-day pack and taking the first white LUTERA pill (""active"" with hormone). Start taking the first white LUTERA pill (""active"" with hormone) on the day after your last reminder pill. Do not wait any days between packs. LUTERA may not be as effective if you miss white ""active"" pills, and particularly if you miss the first few or the last few white ""active"" pills in a pack. Take it as soon as you remember. Take the next pill at your regular time. This means you may take 2 pills in 1 day. You COULD BECOME PREGNANT if you have sex in the after you restart your pills. You MUST use a nonhormonal birth-control method (such as condoms or spermicide) as a back-up for those 7 days. If you white ""active"" pills in a row in of your pack: Take 2 pills on the day you remember and 2 pills the next day. You COULD BECOME PREGNANT if you have sex in the after you restart your pills. You MUST use a nonhormonal birth-control method (such as condoms or spermicide) as a back-up for those 7 days. If you white ""active"" pills in a row in THROW OUT the rest of the pill pack and start a new pack that same day. Keep taking 1 pill every day until Sunday. On Sunday, THROW OUT the rest of the pack and start a new pack of pills that same day. You may not have your period this month but that is expected. However, if you miss your period 2 months in a row, call your health-care provider because you might be pregnant. You COULD BECOME PREGNANT if you have sex in the after you restart your pills. You MUST use a nonhormonal birth-control method (such as condoms or spermicide) as a back-up for those 7 days. If you white ""active"" pills in a row (during the first 3 weeks): THROW OUT the rest of the pill pack and start a new pack that same day. Keep taking 1 pill every day until Sunday. On Sunday, THROW OUT the rest of the pack and start a new pack of pills that same day. You may not have your period this month but that is expected. However, if you miss your period 2 months in a row, call your health-care provider because you might be pregnant. You COULD BECOME PREGNANT if you have sex in the after you restart your pills. You MUST use a nonhormonal birth-control method (such as condoms or spermicide) as a back-up for those 7 days. If you forget any of the 7 peach ""reminder"" pills in Week 4: Keep taking 1 pill each day until the pack is empty. You do not need a back-up nonhormonal birth-control method if you start your next pack on time. FINALLY, IF YOU ARE STILL NOT SURE WHAT TO DO ABOUT THE PILLS YOU HAVE MISSED Use a BACK-UP NONHORMONAL BIRTH-CONTROL METHOD anytime you have sex. KEEP TAKING ONE PILL EACH DAY until you can reach your health-care provider. If you do not wish to become pregnant after stopping the pill, speak to your health-care provider about another method of birth control. This product (like all oral contraceptives) is intended to prevent pregnancy. Oral contraceptives do not protect against HIV (AIDS) and other sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) such as chlamydia, gential herpes, genital warts, gonorrhea, hepatitis B, and syphilis. Any woman who considers using oral contraceptives (the ""birth-control pill"" or ""the pill"") should understand the benefits and risks of using this form of birth control. This leaflet will give you much of the information you will need to make this decision and will also help you determine if you are at risk of developing any of the serious side effects of the pill. It will tell you how to use the pill properly so that it will be as effective as possible. However, this leaflet is not a replacement for a careful discussion between you and your health-care provider. You should discuss the information provided in this leaflet with him or her, both when you first start taking the pill and during your revisits. You should also follow your health-care provider's advice with regard to regular check-ups while you are on the pill. Oral contraceptives or ""birth-control pills"" or ""the pill"" are used to prevent pregnancy and are more effective than most other nonsurgical methods of birth control. When they are taken correctly, without missing any pills, the chance of becoming pregnant is approximately 1% per year (1 pregnancy per 100 women per year of use). Typical failure rates are approximately 5% per year (5 pregnancies per 100 women per year of use) when women who miss pills are included. The chance of becoming pregnant increases with each missed pill during each 28-day cycle of use. In comparison, average failure rates for other methods of birth control during the first year of use are as follows: Cigarette smoking increases the risk of serious adverse effects on the heart and blood vessels from oral-contraceptive use. This risk increases with age and with the amount of smoking (15 or more cigarettes per day has been associated with a significantly increased risk) and is quite marked in women over 35 years of age. Women who use oral contraceptives should not smoke. Some women should not use the pill. For example, you should not use the pill if you have any of the following conditions: Blood clots in the legs (thrombophlebitis), lungs (pulmonary embolism), or eyes. A history of blood clots in the deep veins of your legs. Known or suspected breast cancer or cancer of the lining of the uterus, cervix or vagina, or certain hormonally-sensitive cancers. Unexplained vaginal bleeding (until a diagnosis is reached by your health-care provider). Liver tumor (benign or cancerous) or acute liver disease. Take any Hepatitis C drug combination containing ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir, with or without dasabuvir. This may increase levels of the liver enzyme""alanine aminotransferase"" (ALT) in the blood. Yellowing of the whites of the eyes or of the skin (jaundice) during pregnancy or during previous use of the pill Heart valve or heart rhythm disorders that may be associated with formation of blood clots. Allergy or hypersensitivity to any of the components of LUTERA (levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol tablets). Tell your health-care provider if you have ever had any of these conditions. Your health-care provider can recommend another method of birth control. OTHER CONSIDERATIONS BEFORE TAKING ORAL CONTRACEPTIVES Tell your health-care provider if you or any family member has ever had: Breast nodules, fibrocystic disease of the breast, an abnormal breast X-ray or mammogram. Women with any of these conditions should be checked often by their health-care provider if they choose to use oral contraceptives. Also, be sure to inform your doctor or health-care provider if you smoke or are on any medications. Although cardiovascular disease risks may be increased with oral contraceptive use in healthy, non-smoking women over 40 (even with the newer low-dose formulations), there are also greater potential health risks associated with pregnancy in older women. Blood clots and blockage of blood vessels are the most serious side effects of taking oral contraceptives and can cause death or serious disability. In particular, a clot in the legs can cause thrombophlebitis and a clot that travels to the lungs can cause a sudden blocking of the vessel carrying blood to the lungs. Rarely, clots occur in the blood vessels of the eye and may cause blindness, double vision, or impaired vision. Users of combined oral contraceptives have a higher risk of developing blood clots compared to non-users. This risk is highest during the first year of combination oral-contraceptive use. If you take oral contraceptives and need elective surgery, need to stay in bed for a prolonged illness, or have recently delivered a baby, you may be at risk of developing blood clots. You should consult your doctor about stopping oral contraceptives three to four weeks before surgery and not taking oral contraceptives for two weeks after surgery or during bed rest. You should also not take oral contraceptives soon after delivery of a baby or a midtrimester pregnancy termination. It is advisable to wait for at least four weeks after delivery if you are not breast-feeding. If you are breast-feeding, you should wait until you have weaned your child before using the pill. (See also the section on .) The risk of blood clots is greater in users of combination oral contraceptives compared to nonusers. This risk may be higher in users of high-dose pills (those containing 50 mcg or more of estrogen) and may also be greater with longer use. In addition, some of these increased risks may continue for a number of years after stopping combination oral contraceptives. The risk of abnormal blood clotting increases with age in both users and nonusers of combination oral contraceptives, but the increased risk from the oral contraceptive appears to be present at all ages. The excess risk of blood clots is highest during the first year a woman ever uses a combined oral contraceptive. This increased risk is lower than blood clots associated with pregnancy. The use of combination oral contraceptives also increases the risk of other clotting disorders, including heart attack and stroke. Blood clots in veins cause death in 1% to 2% of cases. The risk of clotting is further increased in women with other conditions. Examples include: smoking, high blood pressure, abnormal lipid levels, certain inherited or acquired clotting disorders, obesity, surgery or injury, recent delivery or second trimester abortion, prolonged inactivity or bed rest. If possible, combination oral contraceptives should be stopped before surgery and during prolonged inactivity or bedrest. Cigarette smoking increases the risk of serious cardiovascular events. This risk increases with age and amount of smoking and is quite pronounced in women over 35. Women who use combination oral contraceptives should be strongly advised not to smoke. If you smoke you should talk to your health care professional before taking combination oral contraceptives. Oral contraceptives may increase the tendency to develop strokes or transient ischemic attacks (blockage or rupture of blood vessels in the brain) and angina pectoris and heart attacks (blockage of blood vessels in the heart). Any of these conditions can cause death or serious disability. Smoking greatly increases the possibility of suffering heart attacks and strokes. Furthermore, smoking and the use of oral contraceptives greatly increase the chances of developing and dying of heart disease. Women with migraine (especially migraine/headache with neurological symptoms) who take oral contraceptives also may be at higher risk of stroke and must not use combination oral contraception (see section ). Oral-contraceptive users probably have a greater risk than nonusers of having gallbladder disease, although this risk may be related to pills containing high doses of estrogens. Oral contraceptives may worsen existing gallbladder disease or accelerate the development of gallbladder disease in women previously without symptoms. In rare cases, oral contraceptives can cause benign but dangerous liver tumors. These benign liver tumors can rupture and cause fatal internal bleeding. In addition, a possible but not definite association has been found with the pill and liver cancers in two studies in which a few women who developed these very rare cancers were found to have used oral contraceptives for long periods. However, liver cancers are extremely rare. The chance of developing liver cancer from using the pill is thus even rarer. Various studies give conflicting reports on the relationship between breast cancer and oral contraceptive use. Oral contraceptive use may slightly increase your chance of having breast cancer diagnosed, particularly if you started using hormonal contraceptives at a younger age. After you stop using hormonal contraceptives, the chances of having breast cancer diagnosed begin to go down and disappear 10 years after stopping use of the pill. It is not known whether this slightly increased risk of having breast cancer diagnosed is caused by the pill. It may be that women taking the pill were examined more often, so that breast cancer was more likely to be detected. You should have regular breast examinations by a health-care provider and examine your own breasts monthly. Tell your health-care provider if you have a family history of breast cancer or if you have had breast nodules or an abnormal mammogram. Women who currently have or have had breast cancer should not use oral contraceptives because breast cancer is usually a hormone sensitive tumor. Some studies have found an increase in the incidence of cancer of the cervix in women who use oral contraceptives. However, this finding may be related to factors other than the use of oral contraceptives. There have been reports of increases of blood cholesterol and triglycerides in users of combination oral contraceptives. Increases in triglycerides have led to inflammation of the pancreas (pancreatitis) in some cases. ESTIMATED RISK OF DEATH FROM A BIRTH-CONTROL METHOD OR PREGNANCY All methods of birth control and pregnancy are associated with a risk of developing certain diseases which may lead to disability or death. An estimate of the number of deaths associated with different methods of birth control and pregnancy has been calculated and is shown in the following table. ANNUAL NUMBER OF BIRTH-RELATED OR METHOD- RELATED DEATHS ASSOCIATED WITH CONTROL OF FERTILITY PER 100,000 NONSTERILE WOMEN, BY FERTILITY-CONTROL METHOD AND ACCORDING TO AGE In the above table, the risk of death from any birth-control method is less than the risk of childbirth, except for oral-contraceptive users over the age of 35 who smoke and pill users over the age of 40 even if they do not smoke. It can be seen in the table that for women aged 15 to 39, the risk of death was highest with pregnancy (7 to 26 deaths per 100,000 women, depending on age). Among pill users who do not smoke, the risk of death was always lower than that associated with pregnancy for any age group, except for those women over the age of 40, when the risk increases to 32 deaths per 100,000 women, compared to 28 associated with pregnancy at that age. However, for pill users who smoke and are over the age of 35, the estimated number of deaths exceeds those for other methods of birth control. If a woman is over the age of 40 and smokes, her estimated risk of death is four times higher (117/100,000 women) than the estimated risk associated with pregnancy (28/100,000 women) in that age group. The suggestion that women over 40 who do not smoke should not take oral contraceptives is based on information from older high-dose pills. An Advisory Committee of the FDA discussed this issue in 1989 and recommended that the benefits of oral-contraceptive use by healthy, nonsmoking women over 40 years of age may outweigh the possible risks. Older women, as all women, who take oral contraceptives, should take an oral contraceptive which contains the least amount of estrogen and progestogen that is compatible with the individual patient needs. If any of these adverse effects occur while you are taking oral contraceptives, call your health-care provider immediately: Sharp chest pain, coughing of blood, or sudden shortness of breath (indicating a possible clot in the lung). Pain in the calf (indicating a possible clot in the leg). Crushing chest pain or heaviness in the chest (indicating a possible heart attack). Sudden severe headache or vomiting, dizziness or fainting, disturbances of vision or speech, weakness, or numbness in an arm or leg (indicating a possible stroke). Sudden partial or complete loss of vision (indicating a possible clot in the eye). Breast lumps (indicating possible breast cancer or fibrocystic disease of the breast; ask your health-care provider to show you how to examine your breasts). Severe pain or tenderness in the stomach area (indicating a possibly ruptured liver tumor). Difficulty in sleeping, weakness, lack of energy, fatigue, or change in mood (possibly indicating severe depression). Jaundice or a yellowing of the skin or eyeballs, accompanied frequently by fever, fatigue, loss of appetite, dark-colored urine, or light-colored bowel movements (indicating possible liver problems). 1. Unscheduled or breakthrough vaginal bleeding or spotting Unscheduled vaginal bleeding or spotting may occur while you are taking the pills. Unscheduled bleeding may vary from slight staining between menstrual periods to breakthrough bleeding which is a flow much like a regular period. Unscheduled bleeding occurs most often during the first few months of oral-contraceptive use, but may also occur after you have been taking the pill for some time. Such bleeding may be temporary and usually does not indicate any serious problems. It is important to continue taking your pills on schedule. If the bleeding occurs in more than one cycle or lasts for more than a few days, talk to your health-care provider. If you wear contact lenses and notice a change in vision or an inability to wear your lenses, contact your health-care provider. Oral contraceptives may cause edema (fluid retention) with swelling of the fingers or ankles and may raise your blood pressure. If you experience fluid retention, contact your health-care provider. A spotty darkening of the skin is possible, particularly of the face. Other side effects may include nausea, breast tenderness, change in appetite, headache, nervousness, depression, dizziness, loss of scalp hair, rash, vaginal infections, inflammation of the pancreas, and allergic reactions. If any of these side effects bother you, call your healthcare provider. 1. Missed periods and use of oral contraceptives before or during early pregnancy. There may be times when you may not menstruate regularly after you have completed taking a cycle of pills. If you have taken your pills regularly and miss one menstrual period, continue taking your pills for the next cycle but be sure to inform your health-care provider before doing so. If you have not taken the pills daily as instructed and missed a menstrual period, or if you missed two consecutive menstrual periods, you may be pregnant. Check with your health-care provider immediately to determine whether you are pregnant. Stop taking oral contraceptives if you are pregnant. There is no conclusive evidence that oral-contraceptive use is associated with an increase in birth defects, when taken inadvertently during early pregnancy. Previously, a few studies had reported that oral contraceptives might be associated with birth defects, but these studies have not been confirmed. Nevertheless, oral contraceptives should not be used during pregnancy. You should check with your health-care provider about risks to your unborn child of any medication taken during pregnancy. If you are breast-feeding, consult your doctor before starting oral contraceptives. Some of the drug will be passed on to the child in the milk. A few adverse effects on the child have been reported, including yellowing of the skin (jaundice) and breast enlargement. In addition, oral contraceptives may decrease the amount and quality of your milk. If possible, do not use oral contraceptives while breast- feeding. You should use another method of contraception since breast-feeding provides only partial protection from becoming pregnant and this partial protection decreases significantly as you breast-feed for longer periods of time. You should consider starting oral contraceptives only after you have weaned your child completely. If you are scheduled for any laboratory tests, tell your doctor you are taking birth-control pills. Certain blood tests may be affected by birth-control pills. Certain drugs may interact with birth-control pills to make them less effective in preventing pregnancy or cause an increase in breakthrough bleeding. Such drugs include rifampin, drugs used for epilepsy such as barbiturates (for example, phenobarbital) and phenytoin (Dilantin is one brand of this drug), primidone (Mysoline), topiramate (Topamax), carbamazepine (Tegretol is one brand of this drug), phenylbutazone (Butazolidin is one brand), some drugs used for HIV or AIDS such as ritonavir (Norvir), modafinil (Provigil) and possibly certain antibiotics (such as ampicillin and other penicillins, and tetracyclines), and herbal products containing St. John's Wort (Hypericum perforatum). You may also need to use a nonhormonal method of contraception during any cycle in which you take drugs that can make oral contraceptives less effective. You may be at higher risk of a specific type of liver dysfunction if you take troleandomycin and oral contraceptives at the same time. You should inform your health-care provider about all medicines you are taking, including nonprescription products. This product (like all oral contraceptives) is intended to prevent pregnancy. It does not protect against transmission of HIV (AIDS) and other sexually transmitted diseases such as chlamydia, genital herpes, genital warts, gonorrhea, hepatitis B, and syphilis. BE SURE TO READ THESE DIRECTIONS: Before you start taking LUTERA. THE RIGHT WAY TO TAKE THE PILL IS TO TAKE ONE PILL EVERY DAY AT THE SAME TIME. If you miss pills you could get pregnant. This includes starting the pack late. The more pills you miss, the more likely you are to get pregnant. See """" below. MANY WOMEN HAVE SPOTTING OR LIGHT BLEEDING, OR MAY FEEL SICK TO THEIR STOMACH DURING THE FIRST 1-3 PACKS OF PILLS. If you feel sick to your stomach, do not stop taking LUTERA. The problem will usually go away. If it doesn't go away, check with your health-care provider. MISSING PILLS CAN ALSO CAUSE SPOTTING OR LIGHT BLEEDING, even when you make up these missed pills. On the days you take 2 pills to make up for missed pills, you could also feel a little sick to your stomach. IF YOU HAVE VOMITING (within 4 hours after you take your pill), you should follow the instructions for WHAT TO DO IF YOU MISS PILLS. IF YOU HAVE DIARRHEA or IF YOU TAKE SOME MEDICINDES, including some antibiotics, your pills may not work as well. Use a back-up nonhormonal method (such as condoms or spermicide) until you check with your health care provider.

The incidence of pill failure resulting in pregnancy is approximately 1 per year (1 pregnancy per 100 women per year of use) if taken every day as directed, but the more typical failure rate is approximately 5% per year (5 pregnancies per 100 women per year of use) including women who do not always take the pill exactly as directed without missing any pills. If you do become pregnant, the risk to the fetus is minimal, but you should stop taking your pills and discuss the pregnancy with your health-care provider. There may be some delay in becoming pregnant after you stop using oral contraceptives, especially if you had irregular menstrual cycles before you used oral contraceptives. It may be advisable to postpone conception until you begin menstruating regularly once you have stopped taking the pill and desire pregnancy. There does not appear to be any increase in birth defects in newborn babies when pregnancy occurs soon after stopping the pill. If you do not wish to become pregnant after stopping the pill, you should use another method of birth control immediately after stopping LUTERA. Speak to your health-care provider about another method of birth control. Overdosage may cause nausea, vomiting, breast tenderness, dizziness, abdominal pain and fatigue/drowsiness. Withdrawal bleeding may occur in females. In case of overdosage, contact your health-care provider or pharmacist. Your health-care provider will take a medical and family history before prescribing oral contraceptives and will examine you. The physical examination may be delayed to another time if you request it and your health-care provider believes that it is appropriate to postpone it. You should be reexamined at least once a year. Be sure to inform your healthcare provider if there is a family history of any of the conditions listed previously in this leaflet. Be sure to keep all appointments with your healthcare provider, because this is a time to determine if there are early signs of side effects of oral-contraceptive use. Do not use the drug for any condition other than the one for which it was prescribed. This drug has been prescribed specifically for you; do not give it to others who may want birth-control pills. In addition to preventing pregnancy, use of oral contraceptives may provide certain benefits. Blood flow during menstruation may be lighter, and less iron may be lost. Therefore, anemia due to iron deficiency is less likely to occur. Pain or other symptoms during menstruation may be encountered less frequently. Ectopic (tubal) pregnancy may occur less frequently. Noncancerous cysts or lumps in the breast may occur less frequently. Acute pelvic inflammatory disease may occur less frequently. Oral-contraceptive use may provide some protection against developing two forms of cancer: cancer of the ovaries and cancer of the lining of the uterus. If you want more information about birth-control pills, ask your health-care provider or pharmacist. They have a more technical leaflet called the Professional Labeling which you may wish to read.

d2a35f23-7044-4627-b855-968adf1230f4,"Everything You Need to Know About Post-Birth Control Syndrome Medically reviewed by — When people stop taking hormonal birth control, it isn’t uncommon for them to notice changes. While these effects are widely recognized by doctors, there’s some debate over one term used to describe them: post-birth control syndrome. An area lacking in research, post-birth control syndrome has fallen into the domain of naturopathic medicine. Some doctors believe the syndrome doesn’t exist. But, as naturopaths say, that doesn’t mean it’s not real. From symptoms to potential treatments, here’s everything you need to know about it. Post-birth control syndrome is “a set of symptoms that arise 4 to 6 months following the discontinuation of oral contraceptives,” says , a functional medicine naturopathic physician. The symptoms tend to be seen in people who have been taking a . But coming off any hormonal contraceptive — including , implant, and ring — can result in the changes characterized by post-birth control syndrome. One simple reason: When it comes to post-birth control symptoms, conventional medicine isn’t a fan of the term “syndrome.” Some doctors believe symptoms that arise after stopping a hormonal contraceptive but rather the body returning to its natural self. For example, a person may have been prescribed the pill for period-related issues. So it wouldn’t be surprising to see those issues return as soon as the pill’s effects wear off. Although the syndrome isn’t an official medical condition, the word “syndrome” has been used for more than a decade to describe negative post-birth control experiences. says she coined the term “post-OC (oral contraceptive) syndrome” in her 2008 textbook, “Botanical Medicine for Women’s Health.” But, even now, there isn’t any research into the condition as a whole — only studies looking at individual symptoms and stories from people who have experienced it. “For as long as the pill has been around, it’s actually surprising we don’t have more long-term studies about its effect while on it and after discontinuing,” Brighten notes. There needs to be more research, she says, to help understand why so many people “around the world have similar experiences and complaints when they discontinue birth control.” “Post-birth control syndrome is the result of both the effects birth control can have on the body and the withdrawal of exogenous synthetic hormones,” Brighten states. To understand the cause of any such symptoms, you first need to understand how hormonal contraceptives work. Pills and other hormonal contraceptive methods suppress the body’s natural reproductive processes. The hormones they contain in a number of ways. Most stop ovulation from happening. Some also make it more difficult for sperm to reach eggs and block fertilized eggs from implanting in the womb. As soon as you stop taking birth control, your body will begin to rely on its natural hormone levels once more. As Brighten explains, this is “a significant hormonal shift for which we’d expect to see some issues arise.” Everything from skin to the menstrual cycle can be affected. And if you had hormonal imbalances before taking birth control, these may flare up again. Does everyone who goes off birth control experience it? No, not everyone. Some people won’t experience any detrimental symptoms after quitting hormonal birth control. But others will feel the effects as their body adjusts to its new state. For those who were on the pill, it for menstrual cycles to return to normal. Some post-pill users, however, report for a regular cycle. Brighten says there seems to be a connection between the likelihood of symptoms and two factors: the length of time a person has been taking hormonal birth control But aside from anecdotal evidence, there’s little research to back up the theory that younger first-time users and long-term users are more likely to experience post-birth control syndrome. Most people will notice symptoms within 4 to 6 months of stopping the pill or other hormonal contraceptive. Brighten notes that for some, these symptoms can resolve in a matter of months. Others may need more long-term support. But, with the right help, symptoms can usually be treated. The most talked about symptoms revolve around — whether it’s no periods, infrequent periods, heavy periods, or painful ones. (There’s a name for a lack of menstruation after coming off an oral contraceptive: post-pill amenorrhea.) can be caused by natural hormonal imbalances your body had before birth control. Or they can be a result of your body taking its time to return to the normal hormone production needed for menstruation. “Because you have hormone receptors in every system of your body, the symptoms can also present in systems outside of the reproductive tract,” Brighten explains. Hormonal alterations can lead to skin issues like , fertility issues, and hair loss. Digestive problems can ensue, ranging from excessive gas and bloating to traditional upsets. People may also experience attacks, weight gain, and signs of a mood disorder, such as anxiety or depression. That last one has caused some concern — particularly after the publication of a large-scale . It found a link between hormonal contraception and depression diagnoses along with antidepressant usage. “There are many lifestyle and dietary factors that can support your body in recovering,” Brighten says. Living an active, healthy lifestyle and consuming a is a good place to start. Ensure that you’re getting a healthy intake of fiber, protein, and fat. There’s to suggest that oral contraceptives may reduce levels of certain nutrients in the body. a whole host of vitamins, including B-2, B-6, B-12, C, and E So, taking supplements to boost levels of the above may help symptoms of post-birth control syndrome. You can also try regulating your body’s circadian rhythm. Aim to get enough sleep each night. Limit by avoiding devices like TVs. In the daytime, ensure you spend enough time in the sunlight too. No matter what you try, it’s important to remember that post-birth control syndrome can be complex. To know exactly what your body might need, it’s always best to see a medical professional. They can help you determine your next best steps. Brighten advises consulting with your doctor if you have significant symptoms or are concerned in any way. If you don’t have a period within 6 months of stopping your birth control, it’s also wise to book a doctor’s appointment. (People looking to get pregnant may want to see a doctor after 3 months without a period.) Essentially, anything that’s having a big impact on your life signals a need for professional help. Hormonal medication is the only clinical treatment likely to make a big difference. If you’re adamant you don’t want to return to birth control, your doctor can still help with symptoms. Usually, your doctor will first test your blood for hormonal imbalances. Once assessed, they will then advise you of various ways to alter your lifestyle. This may include activity changes and supplement recommendations, along with referrals to other practitioners, like a nutritionist. Specific symptoms can have their own specific treatments. Acne, for example, can be treated with prescription-strength medications. The possibility of post-birth control syndrome shouldn’t scare you into steering clear of hormonal contraceptives. If you’re happy with your method, stick with it. What’s important to know is the potential effects of quitting birth control and what can be done to remedy them. This particular condition requires a lot more research, it’s true. But being aware of its existence will help you make informed decisions that are right for you and your lifestyle.

It may also happen after you switch to a different type of contraceptive or to a pill with a different estrogen dose. is not usually a cause for concern, but sometimes it can be related to an underlying medical condition. Light spotting isn’t as worrisome as heavy or continuous breakthrough bleeding. Take note of how much you bleed, when it happens, and how long it lasts. This information can provide important clues to help your doctor diagnose the cause of your bleeding. A few factors can lead to breakthrough bleeding when you’re on the pill, including the type of pill you use and other medications you may be taking. Some types of birth control are more likely than others to cause breakthrough bleeding. Combination pills are the most commonly used type of oral contraceptive. They contain synthetic forms of the hormones progestin and estrogen. These pills are available in different cycle lengths that determine how often you get your period. Cycles range from 28 days to months, depending on the type you choose. Anywhere from of people using combination birth control pills experience breakthrough bleeding in the first three to six months of use. This drops to 10 to 30 percent by the third month. Lower doses of estrogen are associated with more episodes of bleeding. Progestin-only pills, also called the minipill, contain progestin but not estrogen. They are most often prescribed to people who can’t take estrogen for health reasons, such as a history of , or people over age 35 who smoke. The minipill is continuous, meaning it consists of only active pills, so there is no break. You may not have a period while taking these pills, but some people do. Breakthrough bleeding is the most common side effect of the minipill. The pattern of unscheduled bleeding is also more unpredictable with the minipill than with combined birth control pill. It’s more likely to happen if you don’t take the pill at the same time every day. Missing your pill by just three hours significantly increases the risk of bleeding as well as the risk of . You’re more likely to experience breakthrough bleeding on continuous birth control. Continuous birth control pills, such as Yaz and , contain only active pills that are taken continuously for three months or the minipill, which is taken continuously without a break. A missed dose is a common cause of breakthrough bleeding on the pill. Remembering to take your pill every day may reduce or prevent episodes of breakthrough bleeding. If you’re using the minipill, it’s important to take it at the same time every day. According to the , people who smoke are more likely to have breakthrough bleeding on the pill than those who don’t. Smoking also significantly increases your risk of other complications on the pill, such as heart attack and stroke. Starting a new medication or supplement can interfere with birth control and cause breakthrough bleeding. Always speak to your doctor before starting a new drug or supplement. This is especially important if you are on the pill. Persistent or can prevent your body from absorbing the hormones in your birth control pill. This may cause spotting or cause your pill to be ineffective. These symptoms are more likely to develop in people with gastrointestinal disorders such as or .

e76d0b00-4436-418e-8e10-74cee2b50361,"Can you take pills to stop your period if taking the mini pill? Can taking 3 birth control pills cause you to miss your period? Yes, taking three birth control pills or taking the morning after pill can cause a missed period. How do you delay period when you are taking contraceptive pill? Continue taking the active pill, one for each day you want to delay your period, before taking the non-active pills. How do you prolong my period for a few days on the pill? Keep taking the normal pill and you won't get your period.. Skip the sugar pills completely. You are on the pill and you have been on your period for 2 weeks? Breakthrough bleeding is fairly common when you start using most hormonal contraceptives. If you are using a mini - progestin only pill (POP) you should call your doctor, having a period while taking mini pills can also mean you are ovulating. If your period is a week early on the pill should you continue taking extra pills? Yes take a pill once every day at the same time. Even if your period starts before you get to the end of the pill pack. This is normal. Do not stop taking your pills or you could get pregnant. Can you skip period on purpose while using mini pill? No, you can't. Every pill is exactly the same on the minipill, and there are no placebo pills to skip. When should you take your next pill if you get your period early while taking pills? You should continue taking the pill as scheduled regardless of any bleeding. When should you start your period while on the pill? If you are taking a birth control pill with active and inactive pills, you should begin having your period while you are taking the inactive pills - usually 2-3 days into them. If you are taking seasonale, you will have 4 periods per year. What is considered a birth control mini-pill and how does it differ from other birth control pills? the mini pill only contains progestin, while the other pills contain both estrogen and progestin. A popular mini pill brand is Micronor. Women with high blood pressure or predisposition to heart attacks and the like are usually prescribed the mini pill. Another major difference between POPs and Combination Pills is that the mini pill does not include a week of placebo pills; each mini pill contains the same dosage of progestin and must be taken continuously around the same time each day. If you are even three hours late taking the mini pill, your chances for pregnancy are drastically increased. In cases like that, it is recommended you use a back-up method in addition to continuing your pill regimin for at least 5 days. Taking combination pills at EXACTLY the same time each day is not as crucial. If i am on the birth control pill and in the middle of the pack and haven't missed taking a pill why do i have my period? this is bad, you should definitely ask your local pharmacist or family doctor. you are supposed to get your period when you stop taking the pills for 7 days or take your sugar pills. Would taking two birth control pills at the same time cause you to miss your period that month? No, it wouldn't. Taking the ""mini pill"" or Progesterone only (POP) BCP - missing one pill is enough to allow ovulation - which could cause pregnancy. In a combination pill you have to miss 3 or more pills in a cycle for ovulation to happen. Going period free is a side effect of many BCP. If you have been on the pill for over 6 months and this is the only period you have ever missed - taking a pregnancy test to reassure yourself wouldn't hurt anything. Is it possible to not have your period while on the birth control pill? Yes it is a side effect of the pills suppressing ovulation - many woman have no period while taking the pill. Do you start taking your birth control pill the day after your period is finished? That depends on the pill. If you are taking a Sunday start pill you should start taking the pills the Sunday after your period starts. There should be an information sheet with your pills that will tell you when to start. Otherwise, you might try contacting the pharmacists to make sure you're using them correctly. Keep taking your pill all the way through the placebo ones, then after you are done taking the sugar pills don't take the next months pills. You may or may not get your period that next month. Everyone is different. Will taking two birth control pills in a day stop your period sooner? There is no guarantee that taking two birth control pills in a day will stop your period sooner. Generally speaking the only time you should take two of these pills in one day is if you forgot to take a pill the day before. Taking two pills on the same day may have no effect on your period but will reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Is it normal if you started taking the birth control Yasmin on the Sunday before your period and are now taking the sugar pills but don't have a period? Your period would probably not come until your 3rd or 4th sugar pill. If you started taking the pills on the Sunday before your period did that period come? Which color birth control pill stops period early? There is no pill like that. The different pills in a pill pack mean different things.

Some brown pills contain iron, but they don't stop you're period. Will you get pregnant if you stop taking pills after your means? Taking or not taking a pill before, after or during your menstrual period does not make you pregnant. Sexual intercourse does that. I just started taking the pill two days ago and I'm supposed to get my period the weekend after next will i get it on time? Most likely the pill will force your period to move up to the days when you are taking the placebo (inactive pills) in your pill pack. Is it possible to be pregnant while breastfeeding a 12-month-old and taking the mini-pill and missing a few pills but no period? Where in you cycle do you begin taking birth control pills? The first pill is taken on the first day of your period. What if you take the pill before your period is over? It's perfectly fine. It just cuts it shorter, depending on how many placebo pills you have and when the next normal pill is after your placebo pills.

HUNTER, M.D., and JAMES J. STERRETT, PHARM.D., Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, South Carolina   See related patient information handout on , written by the authors of this article. Abstract Abstract Recent diagnostic and pharmacologic developments have focused renewed attention on polycystic ovary syndrome. Clinical features of the syndrome include anovulation, hyperandrogenism and menstrual dysfunction, but several other abnormalities, including hyperinsulinemia, luteinizing hormone hypersecretion, elevated testosterone levels and acyclic estrogen production, have been documented. Accompanying obesity and lipid abnormalities compound the risk of developing diabetes mellitus or cardiovascular disease, and chronic anovulation increases the risk for endometrial cancer. A careful history and physical examination should guide diagnostic testing. Slowly progressive hyperandrogenic symptoms with anovulation of peripubertal onset often represent polycystic ovary syndrome. Treatment goals include symptom management and the identification and prevention of potential cardiovascular risks. Treatment should take into account the patient's desire for fertility. Advances in transvaginal ultrasonography and infertility treatments, including newer medications, have facilitated assisted reproduction in patients with polycystic ovary syndrome. Ongoing pharmacologic research focusing on the treatment of insulin resistance appears promising in reversing the long-term complications of the syndrome. Polycystic ovary syndrome, one of the most common endocrine disorders, affects approximately 6 percent of women of reproductive age. The syndrome is the most frequent cause of anovulatory infertility, with its underlying etiology unknown. The classic description of the syndrome, which includes clinical findings of amenorrhea, hirsutism and bilaterally enlarged ovaries, is representative of more advanced cases. Polycystic ovary syndrome is now recognized as a heterogeneous syndrome. Affected women often have signs and symptoms of elevated androgen levels, menstrual irregularity and amenorrhea, without a well-defined cause of androgen excess. The syndrome has an initial onset in the peripubertal years and is progressive. Recent developments in pelvic ultrasonography have enabled more detailed descriptions of bilaterally enlarged cystic ovaries. Studies on the treatment of underlying metabolic disturbances associated with polycystic ovary syndrome are presently being conducted. Current treatment approaches are directed at preventing potential long-term consequences of the chronic anovulation and metabolic disturbances that are often associated with the syndrome. Abstract The underlying defect in polycystic ovary syndrome remains unknown, but there is growing consensus that key features include insulin resistance, androgen excess and abnormal gonadotropin dynamics. Recent evidence suggests that the principal underlying disorder is one of insulin resistance, with resulting hyperinsulinemia stimulating excess ovarian androgen production. Based on the two-cell two-gonadotropin theory of ovarian steroidogenesis, androgens produced by luteinizing hormone (LH)–stimulated theca cells normally undergo aromatization to estrogens by follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH)–stimulated granulosa aromatase. This shift from an androgenic to an estrogenic environment follows an increase in aromatase activity within the developing follicle, and ovulation usually follows. In patients with polycystic ovary syndrome, the ratio of follicular androstenedione to estradiol is high, suggesting an aromatization defect, and a recent P450 aromatase gene mutation has been found to cause a form of the syndrome. This increase in intraovarian androgens is believed to play a significant role in the anovulatory process. When any anovulatory state exists for a period of time, the “polycystic ovary” emerges. As an end result, affected women develop bilaterally enlarged polycystic ovaries, defined by the presence of more than eight follicles per ovary, with the follicles less than 10 mm in diameter. These ultrasound findings are present in more than 90 percent of women with polycystic ovary syndrome, but they are also present in up to 25 percent of normal women. Gonadotropin abnormalities in polycystic ovary syndrome include elevated levels of testosterone and LH or an elevated LH-to-FSH ratio, an increased LH pulse frequency and altered diurnal rhythm of LH secretion. Elevated serum LH levels are present in a significant proportion of women with the syndrome but are not necessary for its diagnosis. Abstract Although anovulation, obesity, hirsutism and bilateral polycystic ovaries are considered classic manifestations, polycystic ovary syndrome is perhaps best viewed as a spectrum of symptoms, pathologic findings and laboratory abnormalities. In 1990, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) proposed new diagnostic criteria for this disorder—hyperandrogenism and chronic anovulation—excluding other causes such as adult-onset congenital adrenal hyperplasia, hyperprolactinemia and androgen-secreting neoplasms. Women with polycystic ovary syndrome may display a wide range of clinical symptoms , but they usually present for three primary reasons: menstrual irregularities, infertility and symptoms associated with androgen excess (e.g., hirsutism and acne). In one study, 70 percent of affected women reported menstrual dysfunction. A smaller percentage of women with polycystic ovary syndrome actually have normal cycles. Most women with the syndrome experience menarche at a normal age but have irregular menstrual periods that gradually become more abnormal, often leading to amenorrhea. The rightsholder did not grant rights to reproduce this item in electronic media. For the missing item, see the original print version of this publication. Clinical signs include those associated with a hyperandrogenic anovulatory state. Hirsutism and acne are common. Approximately 70 percent of affected women manifest growth of coarse hair in androgen-dependent body regions (e.g., sideburn area, chin, upper lip, periareolar area, chest, lower abdominal midline and thigh), as well as upper-body obesity with a waist-to-hip ratio of greater than 0.85. Patients usually retain normal secondary sexual characteristics and rarely exhibit virilizing signs such as clitorimegaly, deepening of the voice, temporal balding or masculinization of body habitus. Obesity is present in up to 70 percent of patients. Ovarian enlargement may be unilateral or absent. In recent years, it has become apparent that polycystic ovary syndrome is also associated with insulin resistance and an increased risk for the development of glucose intolerance or type 2 diabetes mellitus. Although not always recognized in the early stages, hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance occur at higher rates in women with the syndrome than in weight-matched control subjects. Hyperinsulinemia is also believed to be a key factor leading to hyperproduction of ovarian androgens. Acanthosis nigricans, which commonly occurs in persons with high states of insulin resistance, may also be present. Abstract Untreated polycystic ovary syndrome may be regarded as a disorder that progresses until the time of menopause. Ongoing studies lend support to the hypothesis that women with the syndrome are at increased risk for the development of cardiovascular disease. Because the syndrome is also associated with lipid abnormalities, affected women could benefit from measures to prevent cardiovascular disease and the other sequelae of longstanding hypertension and diabetes mellitus that are associated with the syndrome. Other long-term effects of polycystic ovary syndrome are related to the clinical consequences of persistent anovulation. These effects include infertility, menstrual irregularities ranging from amenorrhea to dysfunctional uterine bleeding, hirsutism and acne. More important, the long-term effects of unopposed estrogen place women with the syndrome at considerable risk for endometrial cancer, endometrial hyperplasia and, perhaps, breast cancer. The risk of endometrial cancer is three times higher in women with polycystic ovary syndrome than in normal women. In addition, small observational studies have suggested that chronic anovulation during the reproductive years is associated with a three to four times increased risk of breast cancer in the postmenopausal years. Other studies have failed to find an association with increased rates of breast cancer. Although no evidence shows that outcomes are improved, mammography and endometrial sampling to search for underlying estrogen-stimulated cancer should be considered in high-risk women with dysfunctional uterine bleeding. Abstract Polycystic ovary syndrome is one of the most common endocrine disorders in women of reproductive age. However, anovulation in the reproductive years may also be due to rapid fluctuations in weight or extreme physical exertion (normal FSH and LH levels), eating disorders (low FSH and LH levels), premature ovarian failure (high FSH and LH levels), use of certain medications (i.e., progestational agents), pituitary adenoma with elevated prolactin levels, or hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism . Other potential causes of androgen excess and menstrual irregularities include conditions unique to pregnancy, such as luteoma and a hyperactive luteal body. Differential Diagnosis of Anovulatory Disorders and Associated Serum Laboratory Findings Differential Diagnosis of Anovulatory Disorders and Associated Serum Laboratory Findings Although as many as 20 percent of healthy eumenorrheic patients have morphologic features consistent with polycystic ovary syndrome, only a fraction of these women have the accompanying endocrinologic abnormalities of menstrual irregularity and hyperandrogenism. Abstract In the absence of pregnancy and when amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea has persisted for six months or more without a diagnosis, a careful history and physical examination should be undertaken, with particular attention to patterns of hair distribution and a search for acanthosis nigricans. Like the clinical symptoms, the laboratory biochemical findings in polycystic ovary syndrome lack uniformity, and some controversy exists concerning the diagnostic criteria that should be used to identify the disorder . Polycystic ovary syndrome is primarily a clinical diagnosis, and the evaluation should be tailored to the clinical presentation. Compared with healthy control subjects, many women with this syndrome have elevated levels of testosterone, androstenedione, LH, estradiol, estrone and fasting insulin, an elevated LH-to-FSH ratio, and reduced levels of sex hormone–binding globulin. Suggested Diagnostic Criteria for Polycystic Ovary Syndrome* Amenorrhea, oligomenorrhea or dysfunctional uterine bleeding Elevated luteinizing hormone concentration with normal to mildly elevated Radiologic abnormalities on ultrasound examination Multiple (nine or more) subcortical follicular cysts *—The diagnosis is based on the presence of some or all of the common clinical features and is confirmed by the presence of biochemical or radiologic evidence of endocrine abnormality and the exclusion of other etiologies.

Am J Med 1995;98:33S–9S. With respect to hyperandrogenism, some debate exists about whether the diagnosis should be based on assays of circulating androgens or on the clinical signs and symptoms of hirsutism and/or acne. Use of clinical assays of elevated testosterone has been advocated because a substantial number of women with polycystic ovary syndrome have no overt clinical signs of androgen excess. Attention has also been given to ovarian morphology as a primary distinguishing characteristic. With this approach, the diagnosis of polycystic ovary syndrome is based on the finding of more than eight discrete follicles in the ovary, with the follicles less than 10 mm in diameter and usually peripherally arrayed around an enlarged hyperechogenic ovarian stroma. Typically, the multiple follicles resemble a “pearl necklace” on ultrasound examination. Improvements in ultrasound assessment using a transvaginal approach have allowed better delineation of multiple follicular cysts. Inappropriate gonadotropin secretion has been used to diagnose polycystic ovary syndrome. LH and FSH levels and the LH-to-FSH ratio are used to facilitate diagnosis, and many researchers consider an LH-to-FSH ratio of 3:1 diagnostic of the syndrome. The suggested laboratory and radiologic evaluation of women with chronic hyperandrogenic anovulation is presented in . The urine human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) level should be measured to exclude pregnancy in any woman of reproductive age who has menstrual irregularities or amenorrhea. In the absence of pregnancy-related conditions, hCG is low or absent in patients with polycystic ovary syndrome.

Polycystic ovary syndrome: current and future treatment paradigms. Am J Obstet Gynecol 1998;179:S101–8. Although serum testosterone levels may be mildly to moderately elevated in women with polycystic ovary syndrome, testosterone levels are generally measured to rule out virilizing tumors. In particular, a virilizing tumor should be suspected when hirsutism is rapidly progressive. The presence of a virilizing tumor is strongly suggested when the mean of three separate serum testosterone measurements is greater than 150 to 200 ng per dL. Consideration should also be given to measuring dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS) levels to screen for a virilizing adrenal tumor in women with rapidly progressive hirsutism. DHEAS levels above 700 μg per dL in premenopausal women are suggestive of such a tumor. In women with androgen excess, the prolactin level should also be measured to exclude a possible prolactinoma. Although up to 22 percent of women with polycystic ovary syndrome may have mildly elevated prolactin levels, profound prolactinemia should be investigated further. The serum 17-hydroxyprogesterone (17-OHP) measurement is a screening test for adult-onset congenital adrenal hyperplasia. This test should be considered when the initial evaluation for polycystic ovary syndrome is nondiagnostic in hyperandrogenic anovulatory women. Common signs of hyperandrogenism in postadolescent women with adult-onset congenital adrenal hyperplasia are hirsutism, acne and menstrual irregularity. As many as 25 percent of women with adult onset of this disorder also exhibit LH hypersecretion. Serum levels of 17-OHP should be drawn at 8 a.m. in the morning. Basal follicular-phase serum 17-OHP levels above 5 ng per mL suggest adult-onset congenital adrenal hyperplasia caused by 21-hydroxylase deficiency. In contrast, serum 17-OHP levels are normal in women with polycystic ovary syndrome. An overnight dexamethasone suppression test should be performed in women with physical features of cortisol excess, such as hypertension, central obesity, facial plethora, easy bruising, striae, proximal muscle weakness and/or increased cervicodorsal-supra-clavicular fat. For this test, 1 mg of dexamethasone is administered orally at 11 p.m., and serum cortisol measurements are taken at 8 a.m. the following morning. Serum cortisol levels below 5 μg per dL (140 nmol per L) make the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome unlikely but are routinely present in women with polycystic ovary syndrome. All obese hyperandrogenic anovulatory women should be screened for abnormal glucose metabolism because of the association of glucose intolerance with polycystic ovary syndrome. A fasting glucose measurement is a reasonable screening test for diabetes mellitus. If the fasting glucose level is less than 110 mg per dL (6.1 mmol per L), the patient probably has normal glucose metabolism, whereas a finding of fasting glucose values greater than 126 mg per dL (7.0 mmol per L) on two separate occasions is diagnostic of diabetes mellitus. Fasting glucose levels between 110 and 126 mg per dL indicate some degree of glucose intolerance. To aid in the possible prevention of cardiovascular disease, consideration should be given to screening for lipid abnormalities and monitoring blood pressure annually. Identified abnormalities should be treated appropriately with dietary and pharmacologic interventions. Abstract Because the primary cause of polycystic ovary syndrome is unknown, treatment is presently directed at the symptoms of the disorder. Few treatment approaches improve all aspects of the syndrome, and the patient's desire for fertility may preclude treatment despite the presence of symptoms. Treatment goals should include maintaining a normal endometrium, antagonizing the actions of androgens on target tissues, reducing insulin resistance (when present) and correcting anovulation. The patient's desire for fertility is an important consideration, because the available treatments, particularly those used to induce ovulation, have their own complications. Note that spontaneous resumption of menses, along with improved pregnancy rates, has occurred. Behavior modifications, including weight reduction, diet and exercise, are recommended for all women with polycystic ovary syndrome. These measures remain important even when pharmacologic therapy is used. Weight reduction decreases serum androgen (testosterone), insulin and LH levels. Frequently, weight reduction also improves lipid abnormalities. Medroxyprogesterone (Provera), in a dosage of 5 to 10 mg per day for 10 to 14 days each month, or norethindrone (Norlutin), in a dosage of 5 to 20 mg per day for 10 to 14 days each month, can be used in women who do not wish to conceive and are not at risk for pregnancy. Monthly progestin therapy avoids abnormal endometrial proliferation but does not suppress ovarian androgen production. Low-dose oral contraceptive pills are another option in patients who do not desire pregnancy. Advantages of this approach include contraception, prevention of endometrial hyperplasia and cancer, normalization of menstrual cycles and treatment of hirsutism and acne. Women with hirsutism usually notice clinical improvement after approximately six months of treatment with oral contraceptive pills, although additional electrolysis or depilatory therapy may be necessary. Antiandrogens may be combined with oral contraceptive pills for the treatment of hirsutism. Up to 75 percent of women report clinical improvement with this combination therapy. If used alone, antiandrogens may produce irregular uterine bleeding. The most commonly used antiandrogens are spironolactone (Aldactone), flutamide (Eulexin) and cyproterone (Cyprostat). These agents should not be used in pregnant women. Spironolactone, in a dosage of 25 to 100 mg administered twice daily, is the most commonly used antiandrogen because of its safety, availability and low cost. Flutamide is usually given in a dosage of 250 mg twice daily, and cyproterone is given in a dosage of 25 to 50 mg per day for 10 days each month. Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analogs such as luprolide (Lupron) should be reserved for use in women who do not respond to combination hormonal therapy or cannot tolerate oral contraceptive pills. The GnRH analogs should be used cautiously, with particular attention given to long-term consequences (e.g., hot flushes, bone demineralization, atrophic vaginitis) that can occur secondary to hypoestrogenemia induced by these agents. Ovulation-inducing agents are usually employed in patients who desire pregnancy. These patients are often best managed by a reproductive endocrinologist or a primary care physician who is familiar with ovulation induction. Clomiphene citrate (Clomid) is a mainstay of treatment. Ovulation is successful in approximately 75 percent of women treated with clomiphene, but subsequent pregnancy rates are only 30 to 40 percent. Women who do not respond to clomiphene or are unable to conceive with clomiphene therapy may be treated with human menopausal gonadotropins such as follitropin alpha (Gonal-F). This therapy has achieved pregnancy rates of 58 to 82 percent, but the risks from ovarian hyperstimulation and multiple pregnancies remain of concern. Treatment with an insulin-sensitizing agent such as metformin (Glucophage), in a dosage of 500 mg two to three times daily, has been shown to improve insulin sensitivity and decrease serum LH and free testosterone levels. Studies have found that metformin restores menstrual cyclicity in 68 to 95 percent of patients treated for as short a time as four to six months. Although insulin-sensitizing agents show promise in the treatment of polycystic ovary syndrome, there are no studies of adequate power or design to allow them to be recommended as standard therapy, especially in women with normal glucose function. Specific details about selected pharmacologic options are presented in .

Recent successes with ovulation-inducing agents has decreased the use of ovarian wedge resection surgery. Newer surgical techniques such as ovarian drilling often provide temporary results and do not address the underlying metabolic disturbances in patients with polycystic ovary syndrome. A significant percentage of women who undergo ovarian cautery or laser vaporization via laparoscopic techniques have spontaneous restoration of ovulation with subsequent pregnancy, but postoperative complications, including adhesion formation, tend to overshadow the potential benefits of these surgical interventions.

03a09798-3e62-4af7-a6f9-6f343e7264d6,"How long does it take for your breast to grow while taking birth control pills? There is no guarantee that breasts will swell while taking birth control pills. Breast tenderness and swelling are two common side effects of oral contraceptives. Other common side effects include cramping, nausea and ankle swelling. These side effects usually go away as the body gets acclimated to the pills. How long after you start taking birth control pills will you breast start growing? Birth control pills do not make your breasts grow. Can you drink your girlfriends breast milk if she is taking birth control pills? What happens if you take birth control pills out of sequence? There is no harm in taking the birth control pills out of sequence as long as you were not taking placebos (sugar pills) when you should have been taking active pills. What are the signs if wife is taking birth control pills? Packet of birth control pills on the kitchen counter, receipts from the pharmacy for birth control pills, or your wife asking, ""Have you seen my birth control pills?"" Can you get pregnant if you switched from taking the shot to birth control pills but no longer take the birth control pills? If you were on the shot but you switched to taking birth control pills, but you do not take the birth control pills anymore, you have a high chance of pregnancy if you have been having unprotected intercourse. All the active hormones from the birth control will have little or no effect after 3 days of not taking birth control. Can taking multiple birth control pills cause spotting? Yes, taking multiple birth control pills can cause spotting. Can taking birth control pills result in down syndrome? Birth control pills do not increase the risk of birth defects in babies conceived by women who are or were taking them. If he is taking female birth control pills forget him. They contain hormones and he is not taking them for birth control. Can taking 3 birth control pills cause you to miss your period? Yes, taking three birth control pills or taking the morning after pill can cause a missed period. Side effects of overdose oral contraceptive pills? Taking too many birth control pills can cause nausea or breast tenderness. It does not cause abortion or infertility. Birth control pills are female hormones, a man should not take them. There are no known drug interactions between OxyContin and birth control pills. What are the most common birth control side effects seen in women? Mood swings, headaches, breast tenderness, bloating and breakthrough bleeding are common side effects for women taking birth control pills. Birth control pills were approved for use in the United States in 1960. You took birth control pills before taking a pregnancy test will that affect it? Birth control pills have no effect on pregnancy tests. What if you took 3 birth control pills in one day? There is no harm in taking three birth control pills in one day, other than possible side effects like nausea or breast tenderness. This is the older approach to emergency contraception. But, unless you needed the morning after pill or were advised by your health care provider to take pills this way for bleeding, there is no benefit in taking three birth control pills in one day. No, birth control pills will not harm or end an existing pregnancy. But a pregnant women stops taking birth control because it is of no use. What happens if you delay your period for a week while on birth control and then do not get your period straight away when you start taking the sugar pills? Continue taking your birth control pills as scheduled. Do you still take birth control pills if you are pregnant? No you discontinue taking birth control pills when you become pregnant. Birth control is a method used to prevent pregnancy. You are already pregnant so birth control has no use. Also, it may possibly cause bad side effects to continue taking birth control pills while you are pregnant. Birth control's affect on teens that just began puberty and are taking pills? You should not mix pills with your birth control pills. This candamage your insides or cause your birth control to be ineffective. Mixing pills is dangerous. What are the effects of overdosing on birth control pills? An overdose of birth control pills could cause nausea and breast tenderness. It will not kill you, cause an abortion, or make you infertile. What if you had your IUD removed an started taking birth control pills you stop taking the pills 2 days before ovulation and had unprotected sex is there a chance you could be pregnant? If you are taking birth control pills you won't ovulate until about two weeks after you stop taking them. When you stop taking birth control pills, you are able to get pregnant, so be careful. When can you except your period on your first pack of birth control pills? When did organ music become associated with baseball?

e1201a36-57df-42f8-bc8f-a42f13c30047,"Expect a series of blood tests if you're having trouble conceiving. Once you've identified if you have a hormone imbalance, treatment options can be discussed. You really only need three things to become pregnant the old-fashioned way. You need an egg. A woman needs to and have regular menstrual periods to become pregnant. You need sperm. A man needs to produce healthy sperm. And you need to have sex. While baby-making seems pretty easy, the reality of getting pregnant can be a bit tricky. You need to have sex regularly, and that sex needs to be well timed (increase the romance a few days before ovulation for the best chances). Sometimes it's more than bad timing, though. More than 6 million American women are considered , which means they have had unprotected sex regularly for six months to a year (depending on age) and haven't become pregnant or haven't been able to carry a pregnancy to term [source: ]. See, in addition to well-timed sex, your body also needs to have all its processes well timed. And for many women, that timing is off. One of the most common reasons why this well-coordinated arrangement may get thrown off-balance? Hormones. Hormones run the ovulation process, which works like this: At the beginning of a woman's , the brain signals the that it's time to prep some eggs. The pituitary gland produces a hormone called the follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), which in turn signals the ovaries to begin maturing eggs for this cycle. As these follicles mature, the level of estrogen in the body rises, signaling the pituitary gland that an egg is ready. This first half of the menstrual cycle is called the follicular phase. When high estrogen levels signal an egg is ready, the pituitary gland then produces a luteinizing hormone (LH), triggering the ovary to release the mature egg -- ovulation usually occurs about 24 to 48 hours after this LH surge [source: ]. The day ovulation happens is the first day of the second half of the cycle, the luteal phase. During the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle the ovaries (specifically the corpus luteum, which is the follicle that produced the mature egg) begin to increase the levels of progesterone in the body. Progesterone is a hormone that prepares the lining of the uterus for pregnancy. If the egg is fertilized and implants, the body continues to produce progesterone -- and if not, then progesterone levels fall, and that month's menstrual period begins. If the timing is off in any part of the process, ovulation may be disrupted, causing fertility problems. Let's look into how these hormones can negatively impact fertility, as well as some ways to tell if your own hormones are out of line. Ovulation problems are probably more common than you'd guess: As many as 25 percent of women with fertility problems suffer from ovulation problems, although many may not know it until they seek treatment for infertility [source: ]. There are a few clues your body may be giving you, if you know what to look for. First, your periods. Are they regular? , as well as periods that are increasingly lighter or heavier than normal, are a red flag that FSH and LH levels may be off. Hormonal imbalances may also cause some women to gain weight, grow hair in unwanted places (including the upper lip, chin, abdomen and chest), lose hair on the scalp and develop acne. Sometimes, it's simply your daily life that throws hormones out of whack. Stress, weight loss or gain and even a new intense workout are all enough to cause temporary problems with ovulation, but sometimes hormone imbalances occur because your body's systems are malfunctioning. Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS), for example, is an endocrine disorder that affects as many as 10 percent of women [source: ]. PCOS is a disruption in communication between the brain, the pituitary gland and the ovaries, but we don't currently know the cause. PCOS is characterized by irregular or lack of ovulation, irregular or lack of menstrual periods, elevated levels of androgens (hyperandrogensim) including testosterone, androstenedione and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEA-S), abnormal levels of LH, FSH and estrogen and small cysts covering enlarged ovaries (polycystic ovaries). It also is associated with obesity and difficulty losing weight, insulin resistance, cardiovascular disease, hair and skin changes, endometrial cancer, sleep apnea and depression. PCOS is also one of the most common causes of infertility among women of reproductive age, and may also increase a woman's miscarriage rate by 45 percent or more [source: ]. PCOS is a heavy-hitter, but it's not the only hormonal disorder that might disrupt fertility. A condition known as premature ovarian failure (POF) -- not to be confused with , despite similar symptoms -- is an ovulation disorder affecting, typically, women under the age of 40. Women with POF have ovaries that have stopped working, causing irregular periods (or none at all). Women with POF may have no follicles remaining in their ovaries, or the follicles they do have are not functioning as they should. Because of this, they tend to always be in the follicular phase of their cycle -- the pituitary gland keeps pumping out FSH to mature an egg, but it falls on deaf ears, or in this case ovaries. Women with this disorder also typically have low estrogen levels because no follicle becomes mature enough to trigger estrogen levels to rise in preparation for ovulation. Thyroid disease may also cause hormonal imbalances that affect fertility. Thyroid hormones play important roles in many of our body's systems -- hyperthyroidism is the condition where the thyroid gland produces too many hormones and when too few hormones are produced it's called hypothyroidism. Either scenario may disrupt a woman's menstrual cycle. And hypothyroidism may be associated with a condition known as luteal phase dysfunction (LPD), or luteal phase defect. LPD is a problem with the uterine lining (the endometrium), caused when the ovaries don't produce enough progesterone after ovulation or when the uterine lining just doesn't properly thicken in response to progesterone. Hormone imbalances are not solely a female fertility problem. Male fertility may decrease if there is a problem with testosterone levels among other hormones produced by the pituitary and thyroid glands. Often, women experiencing fertility problems are asked to track their temperature each day to determine if and when ovulation takes place. For women trying to get pregnant, a hormone imbalance is not necessarily an insurmountable barrier, but one that more likely than not will need to be managed by a reproductive specialist. To make an accurate diagnosis of the cause behind your infertility, your health care provider will likely do a series of diagnostic tests. When a hormonal imbalance is suspected, expect tests to check your thyroid function, estradiol (estrogen) levels, progesterone levels, prolactin levels, and tests to determine your ovarian reserve, as well as a urine sample to test the level of LH. You may also be asked to track your basal body temperature on a daily basis to pinpoint when (or if) ovulation occurs -- a woman's body temperature rises slightly when she ovulates. Women who do not wish to become pregnant may find relieve the symptoms associated with hormone imbalances. Women with ovulation problems who do wish to become pregnant are most often prescribed fertility-enhancing drugs, including clompiphene citrate (Clomid) or gonadotropins (such as Follistim) to stimulate the and induce ovulation. Women with high levels of prolactin may find bromocriptine (Parlodel) restores their ovulation. Women with who may also have insulin resistance may find that insulin-sensitizing medications such as glucophage (metformin) help not only to improve insulin resistance and glucose tolerance, but also helps to lower androgen levels and restore ovulation. In addition to prescription drugs, women may find their hormones are better balanced when they maintain a healthy weight -- women who are overweight or obese may re-establish healthy menstrual cycles by losing as little as 10 pounds (4.3 kilograms) [source: ]. While some women may have luck restoring their fertility with hormone-stimulating drugs, other women may need to try reproductive therapies in addition to hormone treatments. Assisted reproductive techniques (ART) include treatments such as in vitro fertilization (with or without an egg donor) and intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI), all of which have different success rates based on a woman's age and her fertility complications.

3b1e753c-2002-4d26-8460-8f9e021e8017,"Expect a series of blood tests if you're having trouble conceiving. Once you've identified if you have a hormone imbalance, treatment options can be discussed. You really only need three things to become pregnant the old-fashioned way. You need an egg. A woman needs to and have regular menstrual periods to become pregnant. You need sperm. A man needs to produce healthy sperm. And you need to have sex. While baby-making seems pretty easy, the reality of getting pregnant can be a bit tricky. You need to have sex regularly, and that sex needs to be well timed (increase the romance a few days before ovulation for the best chances). Sometimes it's more than bad timing, though. More than 6 million American women are considered , which means they have had unprotected sex regularly for six months to a year (depending on age) and haven't become pregnant or haven't been able to carry a pregnancy to term [source: ]. See, in addition to well-timed sex, your body also needs to have all its processes well timed. And for many women, that timing is off. One of the most common reasons why this well-coordinated arrangement may get thrown off-balance? Hormones. Hormones run the ovulation process, which works like this: At the beginning of a woman's , the brain signals the that it's time to prep some eggs. The pituitary gland produces a hormone called the follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), which in turn signals the ovaries to begin maturing eggs for this cycle. As these follicles mature, the level of estrogen in the body rises, signaling the pituitary gland that an egg is ready. This first half of the menstrual cycle is called the follicular phase. When high estrogen levels signal an egg is ready, the pituitary gland then produces a luteinizing hormone (LH), triggering the ovary to release the mature egg -- ovulation usually occurs about 24 to 48 hours after this LH surge [source: ]. The day ovulation happens is the first day of the second half of the cycle, the luteal phase. During the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle the ovaries (specifically the corpus luteum, which is the follicle that produced the mature egg) begin to increase the levels of progesterone in the body. Progesterone is a hormone that prepares the lining of the uterus for pregnancy. If the egg is fertilized and implants, the body continues to produce progesterone -- and if not, then progesterone levels fall, and that month's menstrual period begins. If the timing is off in any part of the process, ovulation may be disrupted, causing fertility problems. Let's look into how these hormones can negatively impact fertility, as well as some ways to tell if your own hormones are out of line. Ovulation problems are probably more common than you'd guess: As many as 25 percent of women with fertility problems suffer from ovulation problems, although many may not know it until they seek treatment for infertility [source: ]. There are a few clues your body may be giving you, if you know what to look for. First, your periods. Are they regular? , as well as periods that are increasingly lighter or heavier than normal, are a red flag that FSH and LH levels may be off. Hormonal imbalances may also cause some women to gain weight, grow hair in unwanted places (including the upper lip, chin, abdomen and chest), lose hair on the scalp and develop acne. Sometimes, it's simply your daily life that throws hormones out of whack. Stress, weight loss or gain and even a new intense workout are all enough to cause temporary problems with ovulation, but sometimes hormone imbalances occur because your body's systems are malfunctioning. Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS), for example, is an endocrine disorder that affects as many as 10 percent of women [source: ]. PCOS is a disruption in communication between the brain, the pituitary gland and the ovaries, but we don't currently know the cause. PCOS is characterized by irregular or lack of ovulation, irregular or lack of menstrual periods, elevated levels of androgens (hyperandrogensim) including testosterone, androstenedione and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEA-S), abnormal levels of LH, FSH and estrogen and small cysts covering enlarged ovaries (polycystic ovaries). It also is associated with obesity and difficulty losing weight, insulin resistance, cardiovascular disease, hair and skin changes, endometrial cancer, sleep apnea and depression. PCOS is also one of the most common causes of infertility among women of reproductive age, and may also increase a woman's miscarriage rate by 45 percent or more [source: ]. PCOS is a heavy-hitter, but it's not the only hormonal disorder that might disrupt fertility. A condition known as premature ovarian failure (POF) -- not to be confused with , despite similar symptoms -- is an ovulation disorder affecting, typically, women under the age of 40. Women with POF have ovaries that have stopped working, causing irregular periods (or none at all). Women with POF may have no follicles remaining in their ovaries, or the follicles they do have are not functioning as they should. Because of this, they tend to always be in the follicular phase of their cycle -- the pituitary gland keeps pumping out FSH to mature an egg, but it falls on deaf ears, or in this case ovaries. Women with this disorder also typically have low estrogen levels because no follicle becomes mature enough to trigger estrogen levels to rise in preparation for ovulation. Thyroid disease may also cause hormonal imbalances that affect fertility. Thyroid hormones play important roles in many of our body's systems -- hyperthyroidism is the condition where the thyroid gland produces too many hormones and when too few hormones are produced it's called hypothyroidism. Either scenario may disrupt a woman's menstrual cycle. And hypothyroidism may be associated with a condition known as luteal phase dysfunction (LPD), or luteal phase defect. LPD is a problem with the uterine lining (the endometrium), caused when the ovaries don't produce enough progesterone after ovulation or when the uterine lining just doesn't properly thicken in response to progesterone. Hormone imbalances are not solely a female fertility problem. Male fertility may decrease if there is a problem with testosterone levels among other hormones produced by the pituitary and thyroid glands. Often, women experiencing fertility problems are asked to track their temperature each day to determine if and when ovulation takes place. For women trying to get pregnant, a hormone imbalance is not necessarily an insurmountable barrier, but one that more likely than not will need to be managed by a reproductive specialist. To make an accurate diagnosis of the cause behind your infertility, your health care provider will likely do a series of diagnostic tests. When a hormonal imbalance is suspected, expect tests to check your thyroid function, estradiol (estrogen) levels, progesterone levels, prolactin levels, and tests to determine your ovarian reserve, as well as a urine sample to test the level of LH. You may also be asked to track your basal body temperature on a daily basis to pinpoint when (or if) ovulation occurs -- a woman's body temperature rises slightly when she ovulates.

Medical Editor: Definition and facts about hormonal methods of birth control What are the types and brands of birth control pills available in the US? Definition and facts about hormonal methods of birth control ""The pill"" was introduced in the United States in 1962 and signaled the beginning a new era for women, as they were now able, for the first time, to reliably control their . According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the pill represents the leading method used by US women younger than 30 years of age. Longer-acting implants, injections, rings, and patches that employ hormones to prevent or to create a hostile environment for sperm are also available. There are several types of hormonal , for example: Side effects of hormonal methods of birth control depend upon the method, but may include: Birth control does not protect a person from contracting sexually transmitted diseases (). The ultimate decision of which birth control method to use is best made by each individual woman in consultation with her health-care professional. Each method has risks, benefits, advantages, and disadvantages. Birth control pills, also known as oral contraceptives, have been marketed in the United States since 1962. Over the past 40 years, the type of estrogen and progestin (hormones) used in the pills has been altered and the amounts/potencies of hormones in these products has been decreased. Birth control pills today are designed so as to enhance safety and reduce side effects. Lower doses of estrogen are associated with a decrease in side effects, such as weight gain, breast tenderness, and . Birth control pills are taken by mouth and swallowed with a liquid. Several types of birth control pills are chewable. These pills contain the same hormones, progestin and estrogen, that are present in standard birth control pills. Some packages contain 21 active pills and 7 inactive pills to be taken throughout one . You may chew the pills or swallow them whole. If you chew the pill, you should drink eight ounces of water afterward to make sure the full dose is absorbed from your stomach. The chewable version has similar side effects to other birth control pills, such as an increased risk for blood clots, heart attacks, and strokes. Side effects related to birth control usage include Birth control pills do not consistently provide protection from (). Taking the pills daily and consistently (the same time every day) is important. If the birth control pill is stopped, it may take several months for ovulatory menstrual cycles to resume. If menstrual periods have not resumed within six months of stopping oral contraceptives her health-care professional should be contacted for evaluation. What if I miss taking one of my birth control pills? If a woman misses 1 or 2 pills, she should take 1 tablet as soon as she remembers. She then takes 1 tablet twice daily until each of the missed pills has been accounted for. Women who have missed more than 2 consecutive pills should be advised to use a backup method of birth control and finish her pack of pills until the onset of her next menses. The pills work primarily by preventing ovulation (release of an egg from the ovary). What are the types and brands of birth control pills available in the US? Over 60 different combinations of birth control pills are available in the United States. Many of the combinations of these pills have 21 hormonally active pills followed by seven pills containing no hormones. A woman begins taking a pill on the first day of her period or the first Sunday after her period has begun. By taking a pill a day, a woman can usually take pills consistently throughout her cycle. There are a variety of types of birth control pills. Three of these include monophasic, biphasic, and diphasic pills. These have a constant dose of both estrogen and progestin in each of the hormonally active pills. In these combination pills, the dosage of one or both hormones changes so as to mimic a normal menstrual cycle. rates range from 0.1% with perfect use to 5% with typical use. Birth control pills are used to treat irregular menstrual periods. Women can manipulate the cycle to avoid a period during certain events, such as vacations or weekends by extending the number of days of hormonally active pills or by skipping the inert pill week. Birth control pills prevent certain conditions, such as breast disease, (), and functional formation. Functional cysts are prevented by the suppression of stimulation of the ovaries. Ectopic pregnancies cannot occur as ovulation does not occur. Birth control pills have been known to prevent certain ovarian and endometrial cancers. Which of the following are methods for contraception? Some women may be at risk for formation (venous thrombosis). At particular risk are heavy smokers (especially those older than 35 years), women with high or abnormal blood (), and women with severe , , and/or . The association of birth control pill usage and has been controversial. More recent studies have shown that birth control pill usage does not increase the risk of . The relationship between birth control pill use and also is somewhat controversial. Risk factors for include the age at first sexual intercourse and exposure to the . The current opinion is that if birth control pills increase the risk of cervical , the risk is small and related to sexual behavior. Thus, women who are sexually active and use birth control pills for should have a periodic . The FDA has approved several birth control pills that you take for 12 weeks of hormonally active pills (84 days) followed by one week (seven days) of an inactive pill. A occurs during that week, so that a period occurs only once every three months. These extended-cycle pills contain the same hormones which are found in the 28 day cycle pills. Although users of these products have fewer scheduled menstrual cycles, the data from clinical trials has shown that many women, especially in the first few cycles of use, had more unplanned bleeding and spotting between the expected menstrual periods than women taking a conventional 28-day cycle birth control pill. These pills are effective for prevention of pregnancy when used as directed. The of using these products are similar to the risks of other birth control pills and include an increased risk of blood clots, heart attack, and . The labeling also carries the warning that increases the risk of serious heart-related side effects from the use of combination estrogen-and progestin-containing contraceptives, particularly in users over the age of 35. Because users can expect to have fewer periods, the label also advises women to consider the possibility of pregnancy if they miss any anticipated periods. Progestin-only pills, also known as mini-pills, are not widely used in the United States. Fewer than 1% of oral users employ them as their sole method of birth control. Their primary utility is found in women who are or who cannot take estrogen for medical reasons. A transdermal contraceptive patch (worn on the skin) that releases estrogen and directly through the skin () is approved for usage in the United States. Each patch contains a one-week supply of hormones. It releases a low daily dose equivalent to the lowest-dose oral contraceptive. The birth control patch is easy for women to use because it works for a week, and women do not have to remember a pill every day. A new patch is applied every week for three weeks, and a patch is not worn during the fourth week, during which a menstrual period occurs. It is available by prescription. What are the side effects of the birth control patch? Side effects for the birth control patch are similar to those experienced by women using oral contraceptives. However, the patch may cause skin irritation at the site of application (near the bikini line, on the buttocks, or the lower abdomen). Occasionally they patch may become dislodged, for example, in the shower, and its absence may not be noticed. In August 2002, the FDA listed a failure rate for the patch of one pregnancy per 100 women per year, similar to that of other combination hormonal methods. It may be less effective for women who weigh more than 198 pounds. The patch does not protect against STDs. Birth Control Methods, Side Effects and Effectiveness The vaginal ring () is a newer form of birth control. The actual design of a vaginal ring as a birth control device was first developed in the 1970s. The vaginal ring can deliver progesterone or progesterone/estrogen combinations. The hormones are released slowly into the bloodstream. Preliminary studies show that, as with oral contraceptives, they will safely prevent pregnancy with few side effects. The patches would be used in the same schedule as birth control pills, with three weeks of ring usage and one week without to produce a menstrual period. If the ring comes out on its own and remains out for more than three hours, you must use another form of birth control until the ring has been back in place for at least seven days. It is available by prescription. The vaginal ring does not prevent STDs. Currently, in the United States, an implantable method of birth control is enjoying wide popularity. With this form of contraception a small plastic rod containing a form of progesterone is inserted beneath the skin of the upper arm. This product, called Nexplanon, provides consistent birth control for three years. It is inserted by a health-care professional in the office using local anesthetic.

Since tools have since been developed so that administrators can apply deletion norms to public logs and data fields on the wiki, these criteria might be considered for removal. At this time, edit filter logs cannot be revision deleted. They can only be suppressed, and only users who are oversighters can suppress them. This option is only available when applying an indefinite block to a Wikipedia user account. Setting a block with the suppress option ticked triggers a script that executes and performs the suppression of all affected edits and logs automatically.

Hfm1 participates in Golgi-associated spindle assembly and division in mouse oocyte meiosis Hfm1 participates in Golgi-associated spindle assembly and division in mouse oocyte meiosis     , Article number:  () HFM1 (helicase for meiosis 1) is widely recognized as an ATP-dependent DNA helicase and is expressed mainly in germ-line cells. HFM1 is a candidate gene of premature ovarian failure (POF), hence it is also known as POF9. However, the roles of HFM1 in mammalian oocytes remain uncertain. To investigate the functions of HFM1, we established a conditional knockout (cKO) mouse model. Specific knockout of Hfm1 in mouse oocytes from the primordial follicle stage resulted in depletion of ovarian follicular reserve and subfertility of mice. In particular, abnormal spindle, misaligned chromosomes, loss of cortical actin cap, and failing polar body extrusion were readily observed in Hfm1-cKO oocytes. Further studies indicated that in addition to its cytoplasmic distribution, Hfm1 accumulated at the spindle poles, colocalized with the Golgi marker protein, GM130. Generally, GM130 signals overlapped with p-Mapk at the two spindle poles to regulate meiotic spindle assembly and asymmetric division. In this research, centrosome associated proteins, such as GM130 and p-Mapk, detached from the spindle poles in Hfm1-cKO oocytes. In conclusion, our data suggest that Hfm1 participates in Golgi-associated spindle assembly and division in mouse oocyte meiosis. These findings provide clues for pathogenesis of POF. HFM1 (helicase for meiosis 1), also known as MER3, POF9, Si-11, SEC63D1, and Si-11-6, is regarded to be an ATP-dependent DNA helicase and is expressed mainly in germ-line cells. POF9 is derived from premature ovarian failure, which is now commonly named as primary ovarian insufficiency (POI) or premature ovarian insufficiency (POI). POI is characterized by ovarian impairment/failure before the age of 40 years, which is a major cause of female infertility. The etiology of POI is complicated that although substantial evidence suggests a genetic basis for POI, the majority of cases remain unexplained. In 2014, exome sequencing of samples obtained from two Chinese sisters with POI and their parents identified a shared compound heterozygous mutation in HFM1. A verification study was then performed in a small sample size of sporadic POI and controls, in which another HFM1 compound heterozygous mutation was identified in one case. Our previous research also proved that the mutation rate of HFM1 in sporadic POI patients was significantly higher than that in controls and six different variants of HFM1 gene were identified in POI group. A novel heterozygous splice-altering mutation have also been reported recently, which further confirmed that the mutation of the HFM1 gene might be associated with POI in Chinese population. Previous Hfm1 knockout mice model illustrated that Hfm1 is required to form normal numbers of crossovers and to complete synapsis in spermatogenesis process. Correspondingly, direct sequencing of the coding regions in HFM1 gene proved that HFM1 gene variants may associate with idiopathic oligo/azoospermia in Chinese men. Moreover, female mice showed a significant reduction in ovary size and a decreased number of follicles. However, it is not clear how Hfm1 participates in oogenesis process. Oocyte maturation is crucial to female reproductive biology, and it is a complex process that includes both nuclear and cytoplasmic maturation. Nuclear maturation mainly includes resumption of meiosis I, polar body extrusion, and maintaining metaphase of meiosis II (MII) stage. In addition, cytoplasmic maturation involves organelles reorganization, the mRNA, proteins storage, and transcriptional regulation. The synchrony between nuclear and cytoplasmic maturation regulates oocyte asymmetric division by spindle assembly and migration, which is a unique hallmark of meiosis. Unlike mitotic cells, mammalian oocytes lack typical centrosomes, but contain multiple microtubule organizing centers (MTOCs), a complex of centrosome proteins that form the spindle poles and organize the microtubule network. Some Golgi apparatus proteins have unexpected roles in MTOC formation. The most prominent one is GM130, a cis-Golgi protein, which is particularly enriched in the spindle poles at both MI and MII stages, regulating spindle organization, migration, and asymmetric division during oocyte maturation. To date, HFM1 may be a compelling candidate gene for POI, but its explicit role in oocyte meiosis remains unclear. In this study, we aimed to investigate the detailed functions of Hfm1 during mouse oocyte maturation by utilizing an oocyte specific Hfm1 knockout mouse model and hoped to provide novel clues for the pathogenesis of POI. To assess the role of Hfm1 during oocyte development, mice carrying Gdf9-Cre transgenes and a floxed allele of Hfm1 were designed to delete exons 6 and 7 (Fig. ), which express the Cre recombinase specifically in oocytes from primordial follicle stage (Fig. ). The Hfm1, Gdf9-Cre female mice were referred to as Hfm1-cKO and Hfm1 female mice were referred to as Control. The body weight (Fig. ) and ovary weight (Fig. ) of young adult (2 months old) Hfm1-cKO mice were comparable to control group. To verify that Hfm1 was deleted in Hfm1-cKO oocytes, histology immunofluorescence was performed and showed that Hfm1 was nearly undetectable in oocytes of Hfm1-cKO ovaries (Fig. ). Furthermore, we isolated fully grown oocytes from mice and performed single-oocyte immunofluorescence (Fig. ). The expression level of Hfm1 in Hfm1-cKO oocytes showed an ~70% reduction compared with controls (Fig. ), and Hfm1 protein was enriched in the spindle poles in MII oocytes (Fig. , white arrow). To confirm whether Hfm1-cKO influenced reproductive function, follicle counts of all stages, including primordial, primary, secondary, and antral follicles, were recorded according to acknowledged morphological criteria. In young adult mice (2-month-old), Hfm1-cKO ovaries showed a significant decrease in primordial follicles ( < 0.01), but no difference in growing follicles (primary, secondary and antral follicles) compared with control group (Fig. ). However, in older female mice (9-month-old), all stages follicles decreased significantly in Hfm1-cKO females compared with controls (Fig. ). Despite no overt decrease was observed in growing follicles of Hfm1-cKO young adult mice, fertility competence was further evaluated to validated whether there were any alterations in oogenesis. Fertility testing revealed that, Hfm1-cKO female mice were premature infertile (Fig. ) and produced about four pups per litter on average, which was significantly lower than about seven pups per litter in control group during 7 months breeding (Fig. ). However, prepubertal Hfm1-cKO mice (3-week-old) were over-ovulated an average of 47 oocytes, which had no difference with an average of 60 oocytes in control group (Fig. ). Furthermore, in vitro fertilization (IVF) testing were performed with normal sperms. The results suggested that about 83% of the Hfm1-cKO mice ovulated oocytes underwent successful fertilization, but 30% or less of the fertilized Hfm1-cKO eggs developed to blastocysts in culture, which were significantly lower than that in control group (94% fertilization and 65% developed to blastocysts) (Fig. ). In sum, reproductive potential was severely compromised in Hfm1-cKO female mice. To investigate the potential mechanism of subfertility in Hfm1-cKO mouse, oocyte meiotic progression was examined because meiotic errors reduced oocyte quality and oocyte competency is the key to embryo potential. Therefore, we collected fully grown oocytes from superovulated female mice of each genotype and performed in vitro maturation (IVM) (Fig. ). Only about 50% Hfm1 knockout oocytes produced the first polar body, which was significant lower than ~90% in control group (Fig. ). In vivo mature MII oocytes were assessed for spindle morphology by immunofluorescence, and about 45% mutant oocytes demonstrated abnormal spindles while only 7% in control group (Fig. ). The major defect in Hfm1-cKO oocytes was no spindle formation (Fig. ), and other abnormities included incomplete spindle division (Fig. ), spindles with no poles and deformed spindles with astral microtubules. In addition, spindle migration is an actin-related process. Actin cap formation was disrupted in about 40% Hfm1 knockout oocytes, which was much higher than that in control oocytes (Fig. ), and actin filament signals at the cortex decreased visibly in Hfm1-cKO oocytes (Fig. ). Hfm1 functions in Golgi-associated spindle assembly and division As shown in Fig. , in germinal vesicle (GV) stage control oocytes, Hfm1 was dispersed throughout the cytoplasm and seemingly concentrated in the interior than at the cortex. In MII stage control oocytes, Hfm1 was localized at the spindle poles in a crescent shape (white arrow). The apparent redistribution of Hfm1 was similar with the reorganization of Golgi apparatus in oocyte cytoplasmic maturation. To confirm whether Hfm1 was co-localized with the Golgi apparatus, double immunofluorescent staining was preformed including Hfm1 and known Golgi marker-GM130. Hfm1 followed the same localization pattern as that of GM130 and their signals overlapped at GV, MI, and MII stage (Fig.). As is known, GM130 accumulated at the spindle poles in MI and MII stages, but the localization of GM130 was altered and dispersed into the cytoplasm in Hfm1-cKO oocytes (Fig., white arrow). GM130 might cooperate with the MAPK pathway to participate in spindle organization, migration, and asymmetric division. To further determine the involvement of Hfm1 in spindle formation, the localization of phospho-p44/42 mitogen activated protein kinase (p-Mapk) was measured, which was proved enriched in spindle poles and crucial for proper spindle formation during oocyte meiosis. After GV stage oocytes cultured for 8 h, p-Mapk was localized at spindle poles in control MI oocytes, whereas p-Mapk detached from spindle poles and was detected on the spindle fibers or dispersed to the cytoplasm in Hfm1-cKO MI oocytes (Fig. , white arrow). Moreover, misaligned chromosomes were also observed in Hfm1-cKO MI oocytes (Fig. ). Western Blot analysis showed that the expression levels of Erk1/2 in Hfm1-cKO ovaries were comparable to that of control ovaries (Fig. ), while the expression levels of p-Mapk were significantly higher in Hfm1-cKO ovaries (Fig. ). Moreover, the expressions of p-Mapk in Hfm1 knockout MI oocytes were upregulated as well compared with controls (Fig. ). The current study was designed to explore the role of Hfm1 involving in mouse oocyte maturation. In this research, we found that Hfm1 special deletion from primordial follicle stage oocytes led to accelerated exhaustion of the ovarian follicular reserve in mice, which may related to premature reproductive aging (Fig. ). The irregular follicle development compromised fertility (Fig. ) and affected oocyte quality in female mice (Fig. ). As was observed, the preimplantation embryo developmental capacity gradually decreased in Hfm1-cKO group, along with increasing number of cell division times (Fig. ), which implied a clue to spindle apparatus. Oocytes with absent or abnormal spindles, if fertilized, have a lower potential to form normal embryos. In clinical settings, gene mutations may lead to meiotic defects and then impair early embryonic development. During oocyte meiotic maturation, Hfm1 was partly concentrated at oocyte spindle poles (Fig. , white arrow). Even though prepubertal Hfm1-cKO mice ovulated a similar number of oocytes in comparison to control group (Fig. ), the first polar body extrusion rate decreased visibly in IVM testing (Fig. ). To exclude the interference of in vitro culture conditions, spindle morphology was explored using in vivo mature MII oocytes. Results of immunofluorescence showed that about 45% oocytes ovulated by Hfm1-cKO mice neither completed the first meiosis, nor formed MII spindles normally (Fig. ). Strikingly, actin cap, an actin enriched zone in the cortex during MII, was disrupted in Hfm1-cKO oocyte (Fig. , yellow arrow), together with actin signals at the cortex was significantly reduced in Hfm1 deletion oocytes compared with controls (Fig. ). Recent works have revealed that oocyte spindles require not only microtubules but also actin to promote asymmetric division. Actin dynamic networks are indispensable to spindle formation and migration. Collectively, all of these results indicated that the failure of oocyte maturation might be due to aberrant spindle assembly and division. Over the past decade, oocyte nuclear maturation has been well studied, while cytoplasmic maturation is still controversial. The proper temporal and spatial dynamics of organelles and the cytoskeleton must occur for the oocyte to ensure oocyte competency, which is a key to fertilization and subsequent embryo development. The Golgi apparatus is not only a chief in protein modified and transferred, but also an anchor to microtubule minus ends, participating in cell polarization, migration, and division. In GV mouse oocytes, the Golgi apparatus spreads among the cytoplasm in the form of a continuous membranous system and slightly more concentrated in the interior than at the cortex. Then, the Golgi apparatus is fragmented and dispersed in MI oocytes, and this debris state is maintained following extrusion of the first polar body in MII oocytes. Notably, GM130, a marker of the Golgi apparatus, localizes at the spindle poles at both MI and MII stages (Fig. , white arrow) and plays a role in spindle organization, migration, and asymmetric division during mouse oocyte maturation. Hfm1 had a similar localization pattern with GM130 (Fig. ) in this study, which may hint at a functional mechanism. In addition, a recent study has demonstrated that vesicle-based actin network is essential for asymmetric spindle positioning and polar body extrusion in mouse oocytes, while the vesicles are derived from Golgi complexes during oocyte growth. Actin and associated proteins play a significant role in Golgi structure and function. Hence, we hypothesized that Hfm1 might participate in Golgi-associated spindle assembly and division in mouse oocyte meiosis. The spindle apparatus is responsible for separating homologous chromosomes during meiosis I and sister chromatids during meiosis II to produce haploid oocytes. Despite the absence of common centrosomes, oocytes express many centrosomal proteins. Some of these proteins, such as GM130, p-Mapk, γ-Tubulin, and Plk1, have been mapped to the centriolar MTOCs, which functionally replace centrosomes to form the spindle poles and organize the microtubule network in mouse oocytes. Commonly, the two sister kinetochores of each chromosome are paired and face toward the same spindle pole during meiosis I, but Hfm1-cKO oocyte showed misaligned chromosomes (Fig. ). To further confirm the involvement of Hfm1 in spindle assembly and division, the situation of p-Mapk was examined, which has been demonstrated enriched in spindle poles and essential for proper spindle formation during oocyte meiosis. As shown in Fig. , Hfm1 knockout resulted in the disrupted localization and the increased expression of p-MAPK in MI oocytes. Moreover, the Hfm1-cKO ovaries showed MAPK pathway excessive activation, which provided us a hint that Hfm1 may participate in the MAPK signaling pathway to regulate the spindle migration and asymmetric division. Although several studies have reported that MAPK signaling pathway was indispensable to the maturation of the mouse oocyte and can regulate the Golgi-associated spindle migration and asymmetric division in oocyte meiosis, the present study was the first time to point out that Hfm1 may involve in this process. However, the detailed mechanism of Hfm1 in this ambiguous network must be further explored in the future. Up to now, the complete functions and mechanisms of Hfm1 in oogenesis are still unclear. Here, we revealed the role of Hfm1 in oocyte maturation and illustrated some of the mechanisms by which Hfm1 takes part in the occurrence and development of POI. In conclusion, these results suggest that Hfm1 participates in Golgi-associated spindle assembly and division in mouse oocyte meiosis. We hope such findings provided better understanding of the relationship between HFM1 and POI that ultimately aid the advances in the treatments. Mice carrying the a floxed (loxP-flanked) allele of Hfm1(hereafter referred to as Hfm1) or the Gdf9-Cre transgenic (hereafter referred to as Gdf9-Cre) were produced from GemPharmatech Co;Ltd (Nanjing, China). These mice were maintained on identical C57BL/6J genetic background. Hfm1;Gdf9-Cre mice were produced by crossing Hfm1 mice with Gdf9-Cre transgenic mice (hereafter referred to as Hfm1-cKO) and Hfm1 mice were used as control group. All animal experiments were approved by the institutional ethics committee of Nanjing Medical University and were performed by the National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. Mice were genotyped by PCR using primers as shown in Supplementary Table and Supplementary Fig. . Fertility tests were carried out by mating 2-month-old Hfm1-cKO and control females with normal adult C57BL/6J males until 9 months old. The number of pups for each litter was recorded at birth, and the average number of pups per litter was calculated at the end of the testing period. For each genotype, four females were used. For histology staining, ovaries from 2-month-old and 9-month-old mice were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde at room temperature overnight, and stored at 4 °C in fresh 75% ethanol until further use. Ovaries were then dehydrated, embedded in paraffin, and 5 μm serial sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) using standard protocol. Ovaries from five females per group were used ( = 5). The follicles containing oocytes with a visible nucleus were counted in every fifth section of the entire ovary and were scored as primordial, primary, secondary, or antral follicles based on their morphological appearances as described previously. Briefly, primordial follicles were classified as an oocyte surrounded by one layer of flattened granulosa cells; primary follicles were classified as an oocyte surrounded by one layer of cuboidal granulosa cells; secondary follicles were classified as an oocyte surrounded by more than one layer of cuboidal granulosa cells with no visible antrum; and antral follicle were classified as an oocyte surrounded by multiple layers of cuboidal granulosa cells and containing one or more antral spaces. For immunofluorescence analysis, paraffin-embedded sections were dewaxed, and heat-mediated antigen retrieval was performed by microwaving for 20 min in 10 mM sodium citrate (pH 6.0) (P0083, Beyotime). The sections were cooled for 15 min, washed in deionized water and then rinsed twice in PBS. The sections were incubated in 5% goat serum for 30 min and then incubated overnight at 4 °C with a primary Rabbit antibody against Hfm1 (PA5-83256, 1:100, ThermoFisher), followed by incubation with CoraLite488 conjugated Goat Anti-Rabbit IgG(H + L) (SA00013-2, 1:200, Proteintech) for 1 h at room temperature. DAPI (C1006, Beyotime) was used for DNA counterstaining. Two random fields per slide (two slides per animal, three animals per group,  = 12) were examined. The signals were acquired by performing the same immunostaining procedure and setting up the same parameters with a confocal microscope (Nikon, Japan). To obtain GV stage oocytes, 3-week-old female mice were primed with 5 IU pregnant mare’s serum gonadotropin (PMSG, Ningbo A Second Hormone Factory, China) 44–46 h prior to ovary collection. Ovaries were collected in M2 medium (M7167, Sigma) and supplemented with 2.5 μM milrinone (M4659, Sigma) to maintain meiotic arrest. Cumulus oocyte complexes were collected and oocytes were mechanically denuded of cumulus cells according to standard procedures. To obtain MII oocytes, 3-week-old female mice were primed with PMSG (5 IU) and injected 5 IU human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG, Ningbo A Second Hormone Factory, China) 44 h later. After 14–16 h, MII oocytes were collected from the ampulla of oviducts. For immunofluorescence, oocytes were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, ThermoFisher) at room temperature for 30 min. They were then permeabilized with 0.3% Triton X-100 in PBS for 30 min and blocked with 0.3% BSA in PBS for 30 min. Oocytes incubated in a Rabbit anti-Hfm1 antibody (PA5-83256, 1:100, ThermoFisher), a Mouse anti-GM130 antibody (610822, 1:100, BD Biosciences), a Alexa Fluor 488 conjugate β-Tubulin (9F3) Rabbit antibody (3623, 1:200, CST) or a Rabbit anti-Phospho-p44/42 MAPK (Erk1/2) antibody (4370, 1:100, CST) overnight at 4 °C. The next morning, some oocytes were washed three times and incubated with CoraLite488 conjugated Goat Anti-Rabbit IgG(H + L) (SA00013-2, 1:200, Proteintech) or CoraLite594 conjugated Goat Anti-Mouse IgG(H + L) (SA00013-3, 1:200, Proteintech) for 1 h at room temperature. DAPI (C1006, Beyotime) was used for DNA counterstaining. TRITC-Phalloidin (MX4405,1:100, Cytoskeleton) was used for F-actin counterstaining. Oocytes were imaged using confocal microscope (Nikon, Japan). Every experiment was repeated three times and the data were analyzed using ImageJ software. In vitro maturation, fertilization, and embryo culture For in vitro maturation, GV stage denuded oocytes were collected by stripping off the cumulus cells of cumulus–oocyte complexes as described previously. Denuded oocytes were cultured in M2 medium (M7167, Sigma), and samples of oocytes at GV, GVBD, Metaphase I (M I), and Metaphase II (MII) were then collected at the time points of 0, 4, 8, 14 h during culture. For in vitro fertilization and embryo culture, MII oocytes were obtained from the ampulla of oviducts following standard hyperstimulation protocols and inseminated with normal sperm isolated from C57BL/6J adult males. Fertilized zygotes were confirmed by the presence of pronuclei, and they were then transferred into KSOM medium at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO in air. The number of the zygotes, the 2-cell, 4-cell, 8-cell, and blastocyst stages were counted. For each genotype, four females were used. The proteins were extracted from mouse ovaries or oocytes from different stages using protein-loading buffer and heated at 100 °C for 5 min, then subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE. Separated proteins were transferred to a PVDF membrane. The membranes were blocked for 1 h at room temperature in TBST buffer [20 mM Tris, 137 mM NaCl, and 0.05% (w/v) Tween 20] containing 5% non-fat milk and were probed with specific rabbit polyclonal anti-Hfm1 (PA5-83256, 1:500, ThermoFisher), anti-Hfm1 (PA5-109810, 1:500, ThermoFisher), anti-Erk1/2 (11257-1-AP, 1:1000, Proteintech), anti- Phospho-p44/42 MAPK (Erk1/2) (4370, 1:1000, Cell Signaling Technology) and anti-Gapdh (10494-1-AP, 1:2000, Proteintech) antibodies at 4 °C overnight. After washing three times (10 min each) with TBST, the membranes were incubated at 37 °C with a HRP-conjugated Goat Anti-Rabbit IgG (H + L) (SA00001-2, 1:5000, Proteintech) for 1 h. After that, the membranes were washed three times in TBST and the blots were imaged using a ChemiDoc XRS + Molecular Imager (Bio-Rad) with Pierce ECL Western Blotting Substrate (32209, Thermo Fisher). To quantify Western blot results, band intensity values were measured by ImageJ software. All graphs and statistical analyses were generated using GraphPad Prism version 7 (GraphPad Software).

cd0a291e-a779-40d8-8c7d-f99eb2b49027,"May the Odds Be Ever in Your Favor: Can You Get Pregnant While on the Pill? Medically reviewed by — The birth control pill can be your BFF when it comes to enjoying your sex life free from worry. It’s the most popular method of reversible contraception in the United States, ages 15 to 49. While it’s not the right solution for everyone, many people rely on the pill as their primary form of birth control and family planning. But it’s not perfect, and there’s still a slight chance you could get pregnant on the pill — especially if you miss a dose or two. Knowledge is power when it comes to birth control. The more you understand about how the pill works, the better you’ll be at taking it effectively (and thus not getting pregnant until you to get pregnant). Here’s how the science shakes out and how you can minimize your risk. In an ideal world, the birth control pill does its job pretty freaking well. Planned Parenthood estimates that when taken perfectly, the pill is at preventing pregnancy. It does this by stopping ovulation, which means an egg isn’t released from your ovary each month to be fertilized by sperm. The birth control pill also thickens your cervical mucus, making it less hospitable for sperm to reach an egg. It essentially turns your uterus into a fiercely guarded surveillance zone, unsurvivable to outside invaders (which, TBH, sounds badass). There are two types of birth control pills: combination pills and progestin-only pills. Combination pills, the most popular type, contain two hormones: estrogen and progestin. For (likely due to family history of blood clots or migraine), the progestin-only pill, sometimes called the mini pill, is another option. Regardless of which type of pill you’re taking, it’s best to take it at the same time every day. Making it part of your daily routine can help prevent missed doses and ensure that the pill is as effective as possible. If you use a progestin-only pill, it’s essential to take it within the same 3-hour window every day. But let’s be real: Humans aren’t perfect. Sometimes you forget to pick up your refill pack or you miss a pill one day and take two the next. According to Planned Parenthood, the average person takes the pill at a accuracy rate, meaning 9 of every 100 people who use the pill will get pregnant. Those odds aren’t great, which is why it’s super important to be diligent about taking your pill on schedule. It happens to the best of us. Even when you’re on a rigorous schedule of taking your pill each day, you’ll inevitably have times where you get out of your routine and just forget. If you miss a pill, it’s OK to take two the next day to get back on track. If you miss just one combination pill, you’re safe without a backup contraceptive. But if you miss one progestin-only pill or more than one consecutive combination pill, use a condom or abstain from sex for the next week. This is all super confusing, we know. If you need more details on what to do when you miss a pill, from Cornell Health that breaks it all down. For maximum effectiveness, take the pill at the same time every day. This is especially important with the progestin-only pill, which must be taken within the same 3-hour window each day. Most antibiotics won’t mess with your birth control’s effectiveness, but Rifampin is an exception. Talk with your doctor if you’re concerned about an antibiotic prescription. Antifungals don’t usually interfere with birth control, but this particular medication is a special case. This herb, which is often used to treat depression and symptoms of menopause, can contribute to irregular periods and breakthrough bleeding when taken with birth control pills. Before starting a new prescription of this nature, check with your healthcare provider to make sure it won’t interact with your birth control in any way. Getting into a routine is the easiest way to ensure you won’t forget a pill. Even if the last week of your pill pack is placebos (which you technically don’t to take), it’s best to take them anyway to stay on schedule. Having a daily alarm on your phone will help you remember when to pop your pill. A barrier method, like a condom or diaphragm, can be used alongside the pill as another line of defense. Condoms are also the best way to lower your risk of contracting STIs. If you’re in a monogamous relationship and trust your partner, you can also rely on the method — but don’t use this as your only birth control. According to the CDC, it’s only on its own. Here’s some surprising scientific intel for you: There’s evidence that the birth control pill can be used to help people get pregnant. Before you say “Huh?” and start to worry, hear us out. A found that using birth control leading up to in vitro fertilization could actually make it easier to conceive quickly. And in a , by suppressing ovulation for months and then restarting it, some IVF users were able to conceive within just a few menstrual cycles. The existing research still mostly pertains to IVF, not natural conception. That said, the birth control pill can also mask menstrual irregularities that may make it difficult to conceive. Some people have in the first few months after they stop taking birth control. If your periods were inconsistent before starting the pill due to polycystic ovary syndrome, stress, weight changes, or other causes, they may still be irregular once you ditch the contraceptive. Before going off birth control, talk to your doctor about any specific concerns you have. Been taking the pill, but worried that something went wrong and you might be pregnant? include morning sickness, a missed period, breast tenderness, and fatigue. These symptoms can also come from other causes, including stress, weight changes, or an infection. To find out for sure, take an at-home . These tests detect elevated hCG, a hormone that will show up in your urine and blood around the . But don’t rush to quit your birth control the second you suspect you’re pregnant. There’s of fetal development issues from taking birth control at this early stage. If you find out you’re actually pregnant, then you can stop taking your pill. In the unlikely event that you get pregnant while taking the pill, the pregnancy is slightly more likely to be ectopic if you’re taking a progestin-only pill. An ectopic pregnancy occurs when a fertilized egg attaches somewhere outside the uterus, typically in the fallopian tubes. Ectopic pregnancy is very rare (only ) but requires immediate medical attention. Symptoms include those typical of early pregnancy, as well as sharp and severe abdominal pain or cramping and vaginal bleeding. All birth control pills ultimately protect against ectopic pregnancy by greatly decreasing your overall chances of getting pregnant. While the birth control pill is 99 percent effective if taken perfectly, most people take it at about 91 percent effectiveness. This means 9 out of every 100 people who rely on pill will get pregnant. There are two types of birth control pills: combination pills and progestin-only pills. It’s best to take the pill at the same time each day. This is especially important for progestin-only pills, which must be taken in the same 3-hour window every day. If you miss a pill one day, you can take two the next day — but, depending on the type of pill, you may need to use backup contraception for a week or so afterward. Certain medications or supplements, including the antibiotic Rifampin and the herb St. John’s wort, can decrease your birth control’s effectiveness. Talk with your doctor for details. Take your pill on a schedule to develop a solid habit, and use a backup method like condoms or withdrawal for another layer of protection. Studies have shown that taking the pill may help some women conceive through IVF, but so far, this research doesn’t apply to natural conception. If you find out you’re pregnant on the pill, don’t worry — it’s not known to cause any fetal development issues. Simply stop taking the pill once you’ve confirmed you’re actually pregnant.

Adachi, The involvement of cyclic AMP (cAMP) in mammalian oocyte maturation was assessed using cultures of rabbit cumulus-oocyte complexes and in-vitro perfused rabbit ovaries. Rabbit cumulus-oocyte complexes were cultured in Brackett's medium with or without dibutyryl cyclic AMP ((Bu)cAMP) at 10, 10 or 10 M for 4-12 h. At 4 h spontaneous meiotic maturation was significantly inhibited by (Bu)cAMP (P < 0.025). With prolonged incubation, spontaneous maturation progressed despite exposure to (Bu)cAMP. When ovaries were continuously perfused in vitro for 12 h with (Bu)cAMP (10 M) or medium alone, (Bu)cAMP stimulated ovarian progesterone production, but did not affect ovulation or maturation of follicular oocytes. When ovaries were perfused in vitro with or without (Bu)cAMP (10, 10 or 10 M) for the first 2 h and then transferred to medium without (Bu)cAMP for an additional 10 h, ovulation did not occur, but transient exposure to (Bu)cAMP stimulated a dose-related increase in maturation of follicular oocytes. Degeneration of follicle-enclosed oocytes and cumulus-oocyte complexes was not affected by exposure to (Bu)cAMP. These results suggest that transient, but not continuous, elevation of cAMP after the gonadotrophin surge may be required for the initiation of oocyte maturation.

dc263815-c5bc-4bb6-9222-08320fabc5b7,"— When it comes to preventing pregnancies and treating , hormonal birth control is a very popular choice. Birth control options include: Among these options, pills are used by sexually active women in the United States. All forms of hormonal birth control work by preventing the ovaries from releasing an egg every month and by thickening the body’s cervical mucus at the opening of the uterus. Together, these prevent a female’s eggs from being fertilized. Many forms of hormonal birth control are either inserted into the vagina, injected into the skin, or taken by mouth. The latter includes “extended or continuous use” birth control pills. These are taken orally every day to help prevent unwanted pregnancy. However, a few types of birth control only give the body 21 days of hormones and allow for one week of no hormones. This is the case with birth control patches, , and 21-day combined pills. Patches are usually reapplied once a week for three weeks, and then aren’t worn for one week. A vaginal ring is worn for three weeks, and then taken out during a fourth week. Similarly, after taking three weeks of combined pills, you may either not take any pills or begin taking “placebo” pills. The placebo pills don’t contain hormones. During your break week, you’ll experience something called withdrawal bleeding. This bleeding is similar to the regular menstrual period you would get if you weren’t using birth control patches, rings, or pills. Which types of birth control cause withdrawal bleeding to occur? There are many birth control options on the market, but only certain hormonal birth control has the potential to cause withdrawal bleeding. Here’s an overview of the most common hormonal birth control options: Injections that contain progestin include the Depo-Provera shot, which must be taken once every three months, and the Nexplanon implant, which lasts up to three years. They don’t cause withdrawal bleeding if taken continuously as prescribed. You may still have . Hormonal IUDs that contain progestin last about three to five years. They may result in no period or a light period after being inserted. The timing of periods can be irregular, especially right after the IUD is placed. Copper IUDs last about 10 years. These are hormone-free, so your body will cycle through periods just like it did without the IUD. Some women notice a slight increase in menstrual flow for the first year after having the IUD placed. Patches that contain estrogen and progestin are reapplied every week for three weeks, with an optional fourth week off before the cycle repeats. They cause withdrawal bleeding during the break week if taken as prescribed. Pills come in a 21-day estrogen and progestin combined pill, an estrogen and progestin combined pill intended for extended or continuous use, and a progestin-only “minipill.” The 21-day pill pack causes withdrawal bleeding during the break week if taken as prescribed. Extended or continuous cycle pills also have a week scheduled for a withdrawal bleed, but there is a longer amount of time between periods on these pills. This is a 21-day estrogen and progestin vaginal ring. It causes withdrawal bleeding if worn for 21 days and then removed for a week as prescribed. Taking a 21-day pack of combined pills with a week-long break after the last active pill in your pack means that you’ll experience withdrawal bleeding before taking your next active pill. The same goes if you reapply a birth control patch once a week for three weeks and then don’t apply it during the fourth week, or wear a vaginal ring for three weeks and remove it during the fourth week. Much like a regular menstrual period, withdrawal bleeding is caused by a drop in hormone levels in the body. The drop in hormones triggers the release of some blood and mucus from the lining of the uterus out through the vagina. Birth control pills come in higher and lower doses. Low-dose forms of birth control are highly recommended by doctors because they carry the lowest risk of blood clotting, heart attack, stroke, and other serious side effects. These low-dose medications usually cause lighter and shorter withdrawal bleeding than high-dose medications. Withdrawal bleeding on a patch, ring, or combined 21-day pack of birth control isn’t the same as a regular menstrual period. It’s usually much lighter and shorter and causes fewer symptoms. However, some women still experience menstruation-like symptoms while on hormonal birth control. These may include: a mix of blood and mucus that passes through the vagina during your break week digestive issues, such as constipation or diarrhea& While many women feel more comfortable having what feels like a “period,” it’s not medically necessary to have withdrawal bleeding each month. In fact, many women who see withdrawal bleeding as a nuisance take extended or continuous use pills with no break to . However, a major benefit is that having withdrawal bleeding may help you better keep track of your health. Having withdrawal bleeding is a sign that you’re not pregnant. Not experiencing withdrawal bleeding when you should could indicate a change in your health, including pregnancy caused by birth control failure. Keep in mind that this is rare, but . Meanwhile, with extended or continuous-use hormonal birth control, you will never have withdrawal bleeding, and so you may not notice signs of birth control failure and early pregnancy. When taken correctly at the same time every day (aside from your break week, if you have one), hormonal birth control is 91 to 99 percent effective at preventing pregnancy. It may seem like you’re getting your period when you begin your break week of not taking hormonal birth control. But withdrawal bleeding isn’t the same as a regular menstrual period. When a woman of reproductive age isn’t on birth control, the lining of her uterus thickens throughout each month. This is to prepare the body for a possible pregnancy. If she doesn’t get pregnant, she will shed this lining as blood and mucus through her vagina. This is called a menstrual period. When a woman of reproductive age takes hormonal birth control, the lining of her uterus doesn’t thicken in the same way. The hormones in the medication prevent that from happening. However, when the hormones are cut off during the break week, some blood and mucus will be shed through the vagina. This withdrawal bleeding is usually lighter than a natural menstrual period and lasts for fewer days. Withdrawal bleeding happens during the last week of the course of your four-week hormonal birth control. But you may also notice some bleeding before your week of withdrawal bleeding. This is called . It’s common to have breakthrough bleeding when on hormonal birth control, especially within the first three months of starting a new medication. You may also experience breakthrough bleeding if you: miss one or more doses of your birth control pills are taking a medication or supplement that interferes with hormonal birth control continue taking your birth control during your break week If you wear your patches or ring for all three prescribed weeks, or take all 21 active pills in the packet, you’ll still be protected from unwanted pregnancy during your break week. So it’s still safe to have sex during withdrawal bleeding, as long as you’ve taken your hormonal birth control as prescribed. If you’ve missed any doses, use a backup method of birth control during your break week. Can you have withdrawal bleeding after stopping birth control? After stopping hormonal birth control, most women will have withdrawal bleeding within two to four weeks. After this withdrawal bleeding, your natural menstrual period should come back itself the following month. This period will be heavier and longer than withdrawal bleeding. You may also experience some symptoms. It make take several months for your period to become a monthly occurrence. However, underlying medical conditions and other factors such as stress and exercise may reduce the regularity of your natural periods. As soon as you get off hormonal birth control, you’re no longer protected from pregnancy.

There are no birth control properties in xanax. Should you take xanax if you become pregnant? No, unless your doctor says you should. Even then, I wouldn't. From a nursing perspective. What effect does depression medicine have on those without depression? Depending on the type you are asking about it is different. Medications like xanax, citolopram, lorenzopram are highly addictive and create a sleepy/drowsy nodding off effect. Daily medications will generally do the same but will not be as severe. Why cant you get high off of xanax after taking suboxone? Suboxone and Xanax are actually potentially dangerous together, since they can have a synergistic effect, meaning the effect of each dosage separate is less than the identical dosages taken together. Unless specifically notified by your physician, do not take these two medications together. If Suboxone appears to have a Xanax-blocking effect for you, it is likely the unique way your own body is processing the Xanax as well as your own perception. Ativan can be stronger than Xanax. However, it depends on the milligram dosage. Both Ativan and Xanax are anti-anxiety prescription medications. xanax is p.o. or by mouth. There are injectables of medicines with the same effect.

You can overly suppress your system causing death. Never combine these medications EVER I've been taking xanax and cymbalta together for 2 years now with no adverse reactions so I'm curious about this response??

No zoloft is an anti depressant while Xanax and Ativan are anti anxiety medications that belong in the benzodiazepine famy No, tizanidine also known as Zanaflex, does not have the same effect as Xanax.

Our general interest e-newsletter keeps you up to date on a wide variety of health topics. Birth control pill FAQ: Benefits, risks and choices Get the facts about common concerns and questions about birth control pills. If you take the birth control pill (oral contraceptive), you're probably happy with its convenience and reliability. Still, you may have questions about how birth control pills could affect your health, the benefits and risks of birth control pills, and newer options available. Can I use birth control pills to delay or stop my period? Yes, you can. Birth control pills were once only packaged as 21 days of active hormone pills and seven days of placebo pills. While taking placebo pills, menstrual period-like bleeding occurs. Today women have many more options — from regimens with 24 days of active pills and four days of placebo pills to regimens that are all active pills. Some extended-cycle pill regimens have active hormone pills every day for three months, followed by a week of placebo or low-dose estrogen pills. You experience menstrual bleeding during that week. Newer extended-cycle regimens involve taking active pills continuously for one year and can stop all menstrual bleeding. Continuous or extended-cycle regimens have several potential benefits. They prevent hormone changes responsible for bleeding, cramping, headaches and other period-related discomforts. It can be convenient to skip a period during important events or trips. For women who experience iron deficiency due to heavy menstrual bleeding, using continuous regimens can reduce bleeding and there is less chance of developing iron deficiency. Unscheduled bleeding and spotting often occur during the first few months on this type of regimen. It usually stops with time, but it continues in some women long after using the pills. Do I need special pills or can I use ordinary birth control pills to prevent having a period? There are birth control pill regimens designed to prevent bleeding for three months at a time or for as long as a year. But it's possible to prevent your period with continuous use of any birth control pill. This means skipping the placebo pills and starting right away on a new pack. Continuous use of your birth control pills works best if you're taking a monophasic pill — with the same hormone dose in the three weeks of active pills. If I plan to have a baby, how soon after stopping the birth control pill can I conceive? Most women ovulate again about two weeks after stopping the pill. As soon as you ovulate again, you can get pregnant. If this happens during your first cycle off the pill, you may not have a period at all. Check a pregnancy test if you've had unprotected sex and your period hasn't returned. Is there an advantage to waiting a few months after stopping the pill before trying to conceive? Doctors were once concerned that if you conceived immediately after stopping the pill, you had a higher risk of miscarriage. However, these concerns have proved to be largely unfounded. The hormones in birth control pills don't remain in your system. Most women start periods again a few weeks after they stop using the pill. However, if your periods were infrequent before you started taking the pill, they will likely be that way again after you stop the pill. Some women find that it takes a couple of months before they return to regular ovulation cycles. After stopping the pill, if you're not ready to conceive, then you may want to consider using a backup form of birth control. What happens if I stop taking the birth control pill and my period doesn't come back? If you don't have a period for several months, you may have what's known as post-pill amenorrhea. The pill prevents your body from making hormones involved in ovulation and menstruation. When you stop taking the pill, it can take some time for your body to return to normal production of these hormones. Your period typically resumes within three months after you stop taking the pill. But some women, especially those who took the pill to regulate their menstrual cycles, may not have a period for several months. If you don't have a period within three months, take a pregnancy test to make sure you're not pregnant and then see your doctor. Will a pregnancy test be accurate if I'm taking the birth control pill? You can get accurate results from a pregnancy test while you're on the pill. Pregnancy tests work by measuring a specific pregnancy-related hormone — human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) — in your blood or urine. The active ingredients in birth control pills don't affect how a pregnancy test measures the level of HCG in your system. What happens if I take birth control pills while pregnant? Don't worry if you kept taking your birth control pill because you didn't know you were pregnant. Despite years of this accident happening, there's very little evidence that exposure to the hormones in birth control pills causes birth defects. Once you learn that you're pregnant, stop taking the birth control pill. Can I use several birth control pills at once for emergency contraception? It's possible to use standard estrogen-progestin birth control pills for emergency contraception, but check with your doctor for the proper dose and timing of the pills. Certain types of pills are specifically designed to keep you from becoming pregnant if you've had unprotected sex. These medications are sometimes referred to as the ""morning-after pill."" Morning-after pills contain either levonorgestrel (Plan B One-Step, Take Action, Next Choice One Dose, others) or ulipristal acetate (ella). Levonorgestrel pills are available over-the-counter to women or men of any age. Levonorgestrel pills work best when used as soon as possible — and within 3 days — after unprotected sex. Ulipristal acetate (ella) is a nonhormonal medication available only by prescription. This medication is taken as a single dose for up to 5 days after unprotected sex. Does how much I weigh reduce the effectiveness of emergency birth control pills? If your body mass index (BMI) is more than 30 — especially if you use levonorgestrel — emergency contraception may not be as effective, and you could be at risk of still being pregnant after taking the pill or pills. BMI is not as much of a concern when using ulipristal or the copper intrauterine device. I have taken birth control pills for years and want to stop. Can I stop at any time or should I finish my current pill packet? In terms of your overall health, it makes little difference when you stop taking the pill. When you finally do stop the pill, you can expect some bleeding, which may change the rhythm of your menstrual cycle. But you can stop at any time. Can I get pregnant during the week of nonactive (placebo) pills? Taking the nonactive pills doesn't put you at higher risk of unintended pregnancy. If you're taking birth control pills exactly as directed, they're about 99 percent effective at preventing pregnancy. But if you miss a pill — or several pills — during a cycle, you might be at higher risk of unintended pregnancy during that cycle. To be safe, use a backup form of contraception, such as a condom, especially if you miss several pills during a cycle. Many women think so. But studies have shown that the effect of the birth control pill on weight is small — if it exists at all. Instead, you may be retaining more fluid, which can make you feel as if you've put on weight, particularly in your breasts, hips and thighs. The estrogen in birth control pills does affect fat (adipose) cells, making them larger but not more numerous. Scientific evidence suggests using birth control pills for longer periods of time increases your risk of some cancers, such as cervical cancer and liver cancer, but the results aren't consistent. Most data shows that birth control pills don't increase your overall risk of cancer. On the flip side, the birth control pill may decrease your risk of other types of cancer, including ovarian cancer and endometrial cancer. Regarding breast cancer risk, some very early studies showed a link between pill use and breast cancer — likely due to the high estrogen dose found in contraceptive pills used in the 1970s. But, today's pills have a much lower estrogen dose, and more recent studies show no increase in breast cancer risk if you take birth control pills. Studies also have found no link between breast cancer risk and use of birth control pills in women who have a family history of breast cancer. Birth control pills can affect your cholesterol levels. How much of an effect depends on the type of pill you're taking and what concentration of estrogen or progestin it contains. Birth control pills with more estrogen can have a slightly beneficial overall effect on your blood lipid levels. In general, though, the changes aren't significant and don't affect your overall health. Birth control pills may slightly increase your blood pressure. If you take birth control pills, have your blood pressure checked regularly. If you already have high blood pressure, talk with your doctor about whether you should consider another form of birth control. Can women older than age 35 continue taking birth control pills? If you're healthy and you don't smoke, you can continue taking birth control pills after age 35. However, birth control pills aren't recommended if you're 35 or older and you smoke because of the risk of cardiovascular disease. In that case, you need to quit smoking before you can safely continue using birth control pills. Can antibiotics decrease the effectiveness of birth control pills? The effects of antibiotics on birth control pills may be overstated — except in the case of one antibiotic, rifampin (Rimactane). Rifampin does decrease the effectiveness of birth control pills in preventing ovulation, but this antibiotic isn't widely used today. Kaunitz AM.

I have gained weight and I have high cortisol level. Do I have Cushing's syndrome? Answered by and medically This is a published on Dec 25, 2015 and last reviewed on: Apr 01, 2019 I am suffering with and polycystic ovaries. Over last three years, I have gained 15 kg of weight. I am taking T4 150 mg, Glucophage 850 mg and Yasmin. I think I have . My cortisol level in blood is 34 in the morning but in 24 hour urine test it is in normal level. Also my ACTH is 63.4 whereas the upper limit is 64. I am eating healthy diet and I exercise every day. Over three years now, but I cannot find a solution for this problem. I visited an endocrinologist and also a dietitian but of no use. I also have acne. If I do not take birth control pills then I will not get my periods. I am very tired all day and I even feel very difficult to move. I have anxiety too. Please help. There may be three possibilities. Either your and hypothyroidism are two separate disorders or it may be a pituitary or which affects many organs. When did you last check your thyroid levels? If it is too low, then you will have disturbed periods. Pituitary is the master endocrine gland which controls all other glands. Please do the following tests, which will show whether there is any , TRH (thyrotropin-releasing hormone), GnRH (gonadotropin-releasing hormone) and repeat ACTH (adrenocorticotropic hormone). If any problem in the above tests then is affected and the treatment differs. Also get (cytoplasmic anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody), p-ANCA (perinuclear anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody) and ANA (anti-nuclear antibody) tests to rule out autoimmune disease. If any abnormalities seen in these tests, then you may have an autoimmune disease, which can be controlled by drugs. Revert back with the test reports to an --> https://www.icliniq.com/ask-a-doctor-online/internal-medicine-physician In my MRI brain and pituitary, nothing was found abnormal. I also had my kidney ultrasound which looks normal. I did blood tests for autoimmune disease and they were negative. My recent , which is above the limit. What else should I do? Even if MRI brain and pituitary are normal, we cannot rule out pituitary disease. Minor problems in pituitary are not seen by MRI. My advice is to do the above tests to rule out which can cause variation in prolactin level. Since your reports for autoimmune disorders are negative, We can relax in that area. Since you are using birth control pills for a long time, it can also cause severe weight gain and Cushing's syndrome like symptoms. Please do the above tests and also consult your gynecologist regarding side effects of oral birth control pills. Revert back with the blood report to an --> https://www.icliniq.com/ask-a-doctor-online/internal-medicine-physician I got some tests done. My MRI, nerves and adrenal are normal. I did cortisol test after tablet Dexamethasone 1 mg. The value went from 34 mg/dL in the morning to 3.4 mg/L and ACTH from 63.4 pg/mL to 5.7 pg/mL. Other values are FT4 1.98 ng/dL, GH 4.4 ng/mL, SM-C 104 ng/mL, anti-TPO 9 IU/mL, anti-TG 40 IU/mL and creatinine 0.60 mg/dL. GnRH and TRH are yet to be done. From the results, what is your opinion about my condition? ? Should I take Signifor or Metyrapone? I went through the reports () posted by you. Your reports are fine and definitely you do not have Cushing's. Moreover, your BMI (body mass Index) is 25 which is quite normal (high normal). So, I do not think you have any disease that is causing you unusual weight gain. can cause weight gain but in your case your free T4 is slightly on the higher side. It would have been more informative if you had uploaded TSH report. The other possibility is the birth control pills that you take even . From your side what you need to do is keep your thyroid levels under control. Kindly upload me your recent TSH so that I can adjust your medication dose. Ask your gynecologist, an alternative medication for your periods problem. Continue exercising and make slight increments in the time or intensity of exercise. Otherwise, you do not have any endocrinological problem. One more advise is to get tested for diabetes. Revert back with TSH report to an --> https://www.icliniq.com/ask-a-doctor-online/internal-medicine-physician My main problem is that . I was 55 kg and now I am 75 kg. I put on 8 kg in a month when the doctor changed the T4 dose from 75 mg to 50 mg. Gained 5 kg in two weeks when the doctor changed T4 from 150 mg to 100 mg. I exercise every day and my diet includes healthy foods such as salads, fruits, vegetables, turkey and chicken. Definitely there is something wrong. Should I control cortisol levels with pills? My TSH level is 1.98. Your TSH is in normal range. So, the decision to reduce your thyroid medication dose is right. Coming to your cortisol levels, normal morning levels of cortisol is 7 - 28 ug/dL. In your case it is 34, which is a mild elevation. This mild elevation can be explained by your consumption of Yasmin tablet. My recommendation is to stop taking Yasmin for two months and monitor your weight. Also repeat serum cortisol after two months. I strongly feel after stopping Yasmin with continued exercise and diet, you shall start losing weight. For further information consult an --> https://www.icliniq.com/ask-a-doctor-online/internal-medicine-physician Even I have tried this before. I have stopped Yasmin twice for 6 months and nothing happened. I cannot lose weight and I cannot reduce T4 dose because I will gain even more weight. My morning cortisol is 34 and prolactin is 28. Should I use Metyrapone or something else to control cortisol and to lose weight? Nothing happened with exercise and healthy meals for about three years and three months now. I have consulted many doctors and I have done many tests but there is no solution to my problem. Can you please help me? Any ideas or suggestions of what I may have. My diabetes test in also negative. There are two issues here. . High cortisol and weight gain could be due to Yasmin intake. As you are saying that weight gain is happening even after stopping Yasmin for six months, we need to consider other causes of weight gain. What I need to know is whether your cortisol was tested while you were on yasmin or not. If it was done while you were on Yasmin then I recommend you to repeat the cortisol levels after two months of stopping Yasmin. Or get a test called free cortisol which is not affected by Yasmin intake. If the cortisol test was already done while not on Yasmin then I recommend further test. Since your ACTH is normal we need to evaluate adrenal cause of elevated cortisol. In that regard, I recommend and revert back with report. Do not be in urgency to get started on medication to bring down cortisol. We should first know what is the cause of elevated cortisol as certain tumors can also cause elevated cortisol. Revert back with the scan report to an --> https://www.icliniq.com/ask-a-doctor-online/internal-medicine-physician My MRI nerves, adrenal, brain and pituitary were normal. Also my kidneys are normal in ultrasound. I have done free cortisol test in urine for 24 hours one month back with the same tablet and it was 60 mg/24 hours, hv = 1230 mL and cortisol in blood was 21.04 mg/dL. The problem is not only increasing weight, I also have anxiety and headache every day. Periods problem and acne trouble too. I feel tired the whole day. The normal range for urinary free cortisol is 3.5 - 45 ug/24 hour while you have 60. This could be taken as suggestive of Cushing's but a normal Dexamethasone suppression test goes against Cushing's. So, there is a dilemma here. That too a normal MRI brain, pituitary and adrenal scans supports the diagnosis as not Cushing's. There are two options for you. One wait for 6-8 weeks and that is urinary free cortisol and Dexamethasone suppression test or get started on treatment with . One thing you need to understand is if started on treatment with Ketoconazole or Metyrapone may cause reduced efficacy of Yasmin. Among the two option I recommend the first one. Revert back with the investigation report to an --> https://www.icliniq.com/ask-a-doctor-online/internal-medicine-physician I have read that only 50% of pituitary tumors only seen in MRI. I have reduced the efficacy of Yasmin. My periods is irregular now. With these pills, will I lose weight, anxiety, headaches and tiredness? Yes, not all tumors will be seen in MRI. But, next time when you go for scan ask for pituitary scan and not just MRI brain. Also get it in a MRI of 3 Tesla strength. After the start of medication, your weight gain will slow down. But I do not think you will loss weight. For weight loss you need to continue diet and exercise. Your headache, anxiety and feeling of tiredness will reduce. You may have irregular periods due to reduced effectiveness of Yasmin. For further information consult an --> https://www.icliniq.com/ask-a-doctor-online/internal-medicine-physician I have done three separate MRIs for brain, pituitary and adrenal gland. Well, If I continue exercising and eat healthy along with prescribed medicine, will I lose weight? Yes, you will lose weight. Please follow my advice for better outcome. You should including chicken. Eat more of fruits and vegetables. Whatever exercise you do, make sure that you increase the intensity or duration or both every two weeks. You can try herbal supplements like which improves metabolism and helps in weight loss. Ask an alternative for Yasmin with your gynecologist. For further information consult an --> https://www.icliniq.com/ask-a-doctor-online/internal-medicine-physician I read that Metyrapone is 75% effective and Mifepristone 60%. What dosage do you suggest for me? Regarding an alternative of Yasmin, should I go for anything seasonale?  Mifepristone is not approved for long term treatment, hence I recommend you go ahead with Metyrapone only. Regarding alternative for Yasmin you need to discuss it with your gynecologist, ask for non-steroidal medicine seasonale also will not help. Yes, I do suggest you to avoid meat, fish and egg white is fine but chicken and mutton has to be stopped. For further information consult an -->  https://www.icliniq.com/ask-a-doctor-online/internal-medicine-physician I had few tests yesterday. My 24 hour cortisol in urine is 72.1 mcg/g CR; previously it was 60 mcg/g CR. Early morning cortisol is 40.5 mg/dL while previous one was 38 mg/dL.  ACTH is 80.8 pg/ml and last one was 63.4 pg/mL.

To check for previous infection - Antibody Blood Test When should women start thinking about their future fertility? When should women start thinking about their future fertility? Is it ever too early to start thinking about your future fertility? Did you know that women are born with their entire lifetime supply of eggs? At birth, a girl's ovaries contain approximately 2 million eggs; this decreases monthly, and by puberty, only 25% of her egg pool remains (1). In our 20s, thinking about our fertility is probably not uppermost in our minds – we just take it for granted that by the time we want children, we'll be able to have them. But as we approach our early to mid-30s and are wrapped up in careers and just getting on with life, many women start to have nagging doubts about whether they could be leaving it too late to start a family. Let's look at why it's so important to plan ahead and how you can make the right choices now.  Firstly, it's important to understand how fertility works. Female fertility is predominantly measured by the quantity and quality of a woman's eggs, and as mentioned, this supply is continuously declining. Each month one dominant egg is stimulated by hormones; it matures and then travels down to the uterus. This egg has 48 hours to be fertilised; otherwise, it dies, and the cycle begins again.  When to conceive is entirely a woman's choice, but unfortunately, nature also has a say in this decision, with fertility declining steadily after the age of 30. Research shows that in recent years, more women are waiting to start a family (2). This could be for a multitude of reasons, such as pursuing a career or waiting to find the right partner, but regardless it is necessary to consider all the implications. The upside of delaying pregnancy is that you have more life experience and will probably be in a better financial position; however, it also has its risks. Although we all know many women who conceive in their late 30s and even their early 40s, delaying pregnancy into their late 30s can leave some women disappointed. There is no 'correct age' to have a baby, and unfortunately, not all women have a straightforward path to motherhood. It's important to think about when you want to start a family and prepare for all the possible outcomes.  Wouldn't it be great if there was a crystal ball that helped you know whether you could afford to wait to start a family or whether you should be getting on with it now? Unfortunately, there is no single test that will predict your fertility, and even if there were, there are so many other factors that may affect a couple's ability to conceive a child. However, our new measures three separate hormones, which together can provide some insights into whether you are heading towards menopause, and whether your egg supply (ovarian reserve) is normal for your age. The test is performed at the start of your menstrual flow. It measures follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), oestradiol, and anti-mullerian hormone (AMH), which can determine whether your ovarian reserve is declining and if any age-related changes have begun.  Let's take a look at each of these hormones in turn: A follicle is a small sac inside the ovary, within which an egg will mature. Follicle-stimulating Hormone (FSH) is a hormone made in the pituitary gland which controls the menstrual cycle and egg production. As the number of viable eggs decline over a woman’s lifetime, so the number of eggs which respond to FSH decreases. The amount of oestradiol produced by them also falls, which signals to the pituitary gland to make more FSH to try to stimulate egg production. Therefore, high levels of FSH may suggest that your body is struggling to make eggs and is trying to compensate. High FSH is typically seen in menopausal women, but it is worth noting that FSH levels can vary extensively during the perimenopause (the years preceding menopause), being normal one month, and high the next as the menopause nears. Oestradiol is a steroid hormone that is produced in the ovaries. It is responsible for maturing and releasing an egg for fertilisation and preparing the uterus for implantation. Oestradiol levels decline as you get older so that by the time you reach menopause, your oestradiol levels will be a fraction of their peak levels. Low oestradiol, together with elevated FSH, can indicate that you may be becoming menopausal. During perimenopause oestradiol, like FSH, can fluctuate hugely. A single low oestradiol or high FSH result may not be significant, and also may not mean that you can't conceive. However, it may be a sign that your body is starting to transition into menopause. AMH is a hormone created by follicles within your ovary, which helps to predict egg yield. The more eggs/follicles you have, the higher the anti-mullerian hormone level is likely to be (6). Measuring AMH can help to diagnose premature ovarian failure and is used by fertility clinics to assess the likelihood of a successful egg retrieval. High AMH levels can also be caused by polycystic ovaries, and there is ongoing research into how this could be used to diagnose polycystic ovary syndrome. For women interested in their future fertility, it can help guide them in family planning. Anti-mullerian hormone is not a precise measure of how many viable eggs a woman has and should only ever be used as a guide. We suggest that a low AMH result should be followed up with an antral follicle count scan where a doctor counts the number of activated follicles in the ovaries.  Our can help to assess the number of viable eggs remaining in the ovaries. It is not a predictor of fertility, as so many factors can affect conception. However, understanding whether your hormones and egg quantity are normal for your age can help you in family planning. You may decide that you don't have time on your side and may even consider egg freezing if your ovarian reserve is lower than you hoped. Or you may decide that you can afford to wait while you get on with your life. No woman has unlimited time to have children; our Future Fertility test can help you in the choices you make today. __________________________________________________________________________________  1.

Is Stopping Birth Control for a Little While a Good Idea?  For the past 15 or so years, I’ve been part of the oral-contraceptive club. For almost as long as I can remember, I’ve woken up, walked haphazardly to the bathroom, popped my daily birth control pill, brushed my teeth, and gone on with my day. Last week, as I was finishing up my current pack, I went to tap “refill” on the drugstore app on my phone, and I had a moment of pause. Some background: I’m a single woman in my early 30s, riding out the pandemic on my own in my small New York City apartment. What’s the point for me to be even on the pill? I wondered. As someone who uses the birth control pill primarily for pregnancy prevention (in addition to condoms for protection against ), I clearly won’t be needing that in my current sheltering-in-place circumstances. If you’re in a similar position, you might be wondering: Is now a good time to take a break from birth control? So, hold up, does your body ever need a “break” from birth control? It turns out there is actually no medical reason to give your body a temporary break from the pill, Alyssa Dweck, M.D., a gynecologist in New York City, tells SELF. “For a while there was a myth that women should take a break from birth control and see if everything was still working the ‘right’ way,” says Dr. Dweck. “That’s actually just not necessary.” To explain why, let’s talk about what happens when you’re on the birth control pill. (FYI: This actually extends to all combined hormonal contraceptives that contain both estrogen and progestin—a synthetic form of progesterone—including the pill, the ring, and the patch.) When you’re taking the pill, your body gets a steady dose of estrogen and progestin to prevent pregnancy. Estrogen suppresses by inhibiting the secretion of hormones that are responsible for kickstarting a chain of reproductive events. Meanwhile, the progestin makes it more difficult for sperm to travel through the cervix by thickening cervical mucus and also thins the lining of the uterus so that, in the event that an egg does become fertilized, it has a harder time latching on for nourishment. When you go off of the pill, these effects stop pretty much immediately, says Dr. Dweck, and the hormones are out of your system within a few days. You can read more about what happens to your body when you stop taking the pill, here. But, in general, you don’t need to take a “break” from birth control every once in a while, unless of course you don’t need or want to take it anymore, or if you have a medical reason to stop taking it. When it comes to other birth control methods, the advice ranges a bit. With and , for example, you do need to be mindful of replacing them at the end of their useful life. But you can often remove and replace an IUD on the same day, with Dr. Dweck adding that there is no harm in using them back-to-back. And then there’s the , which is , as it can cause you to lose bone density. It can also take longer for your fertility to return after taking the shot than it would with other birth control methods, so this is one method where you actually should be mindful of when you’re starting and stopping it. If your concern is less about stopping and starting birth control and more about long-term birth control use in general, that’s something to bring up with your doctor. They can help you that makes sense for your situation and your general health, taking into consideration any other risk factors you may have. But remember: The birth control pill does a lot more than just prevent pregnancy. My contemplation of whether or not to stop taking birth control while quarantined really came down to knowing I wouldn’t need it for pregnancy prevention. But there are plenty of other reasons people take birth control, and that’s something to keep in mind before you ditch it. Even if you didn’t initially start taking it for these reasons, you may be unintentionally reaping some benefits that you kind of want to stick around (especially while in a pandemic). On the other hand, you may just be curious about what your body feels like without birth control, which is valid too. For many women, myself included, it’s easy to forget what life was like back when we first started using contraception. Remember hormonal acne and intense cramps? The pill may be the reason you don’t experience those things anymore, and those symptoms could very well return if you decide to ditch it, says Dr. Dweck. In most cases, when you stop taking birth control pills, your period will go back to whatever it was like before you started. But that’s not necessarily the case, especially if you’ve been on birth control for a long time. Factors like age or health conditions (for example, thyroid abnormalities or disordered eating) can play a part in how your cycle shows up month after month. “We consider menstruation and gynecology to be almost like another vital sign,” says Dr. Dweck. “Oftentimes it’s sort of a window into somebody’s health. If your period is off, it really may suggest that there’s another issue.” The pill can also control heavy bleeding and make your periods lighter and—thankfully—more regular. It can also help with symptoms of and . “Women with oftentimes will present with ,” Mary Jane Minkin, M.D., clinical professor in the department of obstetrics gynecology and reproductive services at Yale Medical School, tells SELF. “So when these individuals get a period, it’s often heavy since they’re not ovulating on a regular basis. Birth control can help get that under control.” Many people go birth control to manage these conditions. Because of this, there isn’t much research on the possibility of developing these conditions while you’re on birth control—then not realizing it until you’re off of it. But it is a possibility. If you experience persistent complications upon going off of the pill, including , like painful periods, pain with intercourse, or heavy bleeding, Dr. Dweck recommends touching base with a physician. Birth control can also lower your risk of and , both of which could be super uncomfortable to deal with on top of everything going on. If you’re prone to either of these conditions, certainly take that into consideration before going off birth control. In addition, acne is something that’s often managed by birth control, so you might find your skin a little less agreeable when you say goodbye to it. Here’s what you can expect when stopping birth control. Heads up: When you come off birth control, your period could be irregular for some time, says Dr. Minkin, adding that it could take one to two cycles—or even a few months—for things to level out. If three months go by and nothing returns, certainly reach out to a physician. Dr. Minkin also advises to give your ob-gyn a call if you have any intense pain. “It’s better to be cautious,” she says. If all this ~change~ is something that makes you uncomfortable, then now may not be the time for you to give this a try, she advises. As you’re well aware, it’s harder than normal right now to just pop into your doctor’s office for a visit. So, even though it’s super easy to stop taking your birth control pill (you literally just…stop taking it), it’s a good idea to give your doctor a heads up first (ideally through a tele-health appointment at this time) just to get any advice that might be specific to your situation. “People right now are pretty darn anxious,” Dr. Minkin says. “If you’re somebody who’s very anxious, that anxiety on its own can help give you wacky periods too. So ask yourself, Is this something else I want to be dealing with right now?” That said, if you decide to stop your birth control pill, Dr. Dweck encourages women to stop at the end of their pill pack so that there is less of a chance for irregular bleeding. Also, keep track of your personal cycle and menstrual habits so that you can check in with your doctor if anything seems off. “You may feel nauseous, your breasts could hurt, and your bleeding won’t be regular yet, which can feel frustrating,” says Dr. Dweck. “Whether you’re going off of birth control or getting back on, I’d say give the whole process two to three months so that your system can get used to it.” Aside from unpredictable “funky” periods and the potential for unwanted pregnancy, there isn’t a detriment to stopping and starting birth control over the course of a handful of months, says Dr. Minkin. Dr. Dweck adds that at the end of the day it’s really a personal preference. While some women may love the feeling of being off of their chosen birth control method, others may feel the total opposite. “It’s really based on the individual,” she says. “We all learn over time what’s best for our own bodies.” As for me, I went into reporting this article thinking I was going to ditch the pill and am coming out of it deciding to stay on. Per Dr. Minkin’s point: I’m anxious enough as it is, and I don’t really want to add possible menstrual cycle changes to the mix. In theory, it sounded good. But in practice, I’m finding some comfort in keeping things business as usual in any way possible in the midst of all of this chaos.

759efee7-426f-4b21-930c-eebdfaab54fe,"When Is a Period Not a Period? The Lowdown on Withdrawal Bleeding — If you want to make love without making a baby, there are two main approaches you can take: hormonal birth control and nonhormonal birth control. Nonhormonal birth control includes natural cycling, condoms, pulling out, the copper (IUD), tube tying, and (finally!) male contraception. While nonhormonal birth control works well for many women, some find these methods impractical or undesirable and choose hormonal birth control instead. You have five main options for hormonal contraception: pills, patches, shots, vaginal rings, and hormonal IUDs. If you choose , there are three different types and about 60 different brands to choose from. Hormonal contraceptives work by releasing synthetic hormones (estrogen, progestin, or a ) that stop ovulation. Many (but not all) hormonal birth control methods use a 3-weeks-on, 1-week-off cycle. The week off hormones triggers withdrawal bleeding — vaginal bleeding that appears to be a menstrual cycle but technically isn’t. Back in the 1950s, when hormonal birth control first hit the scene, it was thought that women, husbands, and religious institutions would be more accepting of this new and controversial pill if it closely mimicked a woman’s regular menstrual cycle. That’s why hormonal contraception was designed to induce withdrawal bleeding. Thankfully, we’re a lot more chill these days (about birth control, at least). If you’re not that into the idea of a monthly period, some continuous-release hormonal methods can greatly reduce your periods and even make them disappear altogether. Here’s a quick rundown of your hormonal birth control options and what kind of period punch they bring: The shot (Depo-Provera) and the implant (Nexplanon) are injected birth control methods. Both are usually given in your arm, but the booty’s also an option for Depo-Provera. The shot (Depo) lasts 3 months and needs to be taken right on schedule for best results. Nexplanon is implanted in your arm and lasts up to 3 years. Injections use a continuous-release hormone method and won’t cause withdrawal bleeding when used as prescribed. You may still have some . Hormonal IUDS are progestin-only and last 3 to 5 years. Bleeding with hormonal IUDs can vary wildly. Many women have heavier bleeding and irregular spotting up to 6 months after insertion. After the first year, your periods will probably be much lighter than they were before. About will stop having periods entirely after the first year. Copper IUDs last 10 years and are nonhormonal. You’ll still ovulate and have your normal period, but your periods may be heavier for the first year after insertion. Patches release an estrogen-progestin combo through your skin. Each patch lasts a week, and you wear them for 3 consecutive weeks before taking a break in the fourth week. You’ll have withdrawal bleeding during the break week. Birth control pills are the most high maintenance option since they need to be taken 👏every 👏single 👏day! There are three basic types of pills: a 21-day estrogen-progestin combo pill, a progestin-only pill for continuous use, and a progestin-only “minipill” (ultra-low dose), also for continuous use. The 21-day pill pack usually includes a week of placebo pills to keep you in the daily routine even during your break week. The placebo pills will trigger withdrawal bleeding. You’ll also have withdrawal bleeding if you use extended- or continuous-cycle pills, but the time between your periods will be longer (up to 84 days). The ring is a 21-day estrogen-progestin combo method You insert the ring into your vagina for 3 weeks at a time. You remove it for the fourth week, which will cause withdrawal bleeding Plan B, also called the morning-after pill, is a form of emergency contraception. It’s a mega-dose of hormones that should be taken within 72 hours after you have sex without a condom. The sooner you take it, the more effective it is at preventing unwanted pregnancy. Depending on where you were in your cycle, taking Plan B can disrupt your usual menstruation, causing heavier or irregular bleeding. Your next period should be back to normal. Hormonal birth control has a few tricks up its sleeve to keep you from getting preggers: Most methods stop you from (releasing an egg). They trigger a buildup of extra tissue and a thickening of the mucus on your cervix, making uterine travel very difficult for sperm. If (this is a big IF) the first two steps fail, hormonal birth control also changes the lining of your uterus so that a miraculously fertilized egg would find it difficult to implant. During your break week when you stop taking hormones, the drop in hormone levels signals your uterus to shed the extra uterine material and mucus and cell buildup on your cervix. This shedding is your withdrawal bleeding. Usually women experience fewer with withdrawal bleeding than with a regular period, but you may still have some lovely symptoms like: Withdrawal bleeding is not strictly necessary. Some birth control methods, like IUDs and injections, don’t cause withdrawal bleeding. If you use oral contraceptives, you can reduce withdrawal bleeding to every 2 or 3 months or even less often by taking continuous-use pills. that continuous-use oral contraceptives are a safe option with the same general risks as cyclical oral contraceptives, aside from an increased chance of breakthrough bleeding. But no studies have followed women after the 1-year mark, so it’s unclear whether long-term use leads to any negative effects. Talk to your healthcare provider to come up with the best plan for you. Both types of monthly bleeding are caused by a drop in hormones (either synthetic or natural). But withdrawal bleeding is usually lighter and shorter. During a regular menstrual cycle, a woman’s uterus thickens for the possible arrival of an embryo (fertilized egg). When none shows up, the entire lining and the unfertilized egg will be shed, resulting in a regular menstrual period, which is usually heavier and longer. Many women experience moderate to severe PMS symptoms during this time. Withdrawal bleeding is usually more mild than a true period because your body isn’t shedding the uterine lining and has less stuff to get rid of. Withdrawal bleeding is what happens during the week you aren’t taking hormones. Bleeding at any other time is called breakthrough bleeding. Breakthrough bleeding is pretty common, especially in the first 3 months of using a new contraceptive. you’re on a medication or supplement that messes with your hormonal birth control As long as you’ve been vigilant about using your birth control, it’s all good to enjoy sexy time during your break week. If you’ve had some glitches (like forgetting your pill more than once), you’ll want to use a backup method during this time. Pregnancy and withdrawal bleeding can’t be together Just like your regular period, withdrawal bleeding is a great indication that you’re not pregnant. If you do , you won’t experience withdrawal bleeding. This is because pregnancy triggers the production of progesterone, which overrides the drop in hormones that normally happens when you take your break week. You’ll likely have withdrawal bleeding within 2 to 4 weeks after . Your regular menstrual cycle should come on board the next month and will be heavier and longer. Also: PMS will be back in action. (#joy). It could take a few months for your period to regulate and become predictable. Some underlying medical conditions or other issues, like stress and exercise, can affect the regularity of your periods too. Once you’re no longer taking birth control, you’re open for baby-making again. You’ll definitely want to start using another type of contraception if pregnancy isn’t your goal. If you do want a little bambino, think about waiting until you’ve had at least one regular menstrual period. Waiting gives your body a chance to prep for a healthy pregnancy. It also makes it easier to calculate an accurate due date. It’s generally not recommended to stop your birth control mid-pack if you can avoid it. Stopping mid-pack can cause some hormone confusion, and your body might take longer to return to its natural cycle. When you stop mid-pack, cramping and bleeding can happen after a couple of days. It shouldn’t take more than two or three menstrual cycles for your body to find its natural rhythm again. If you had irregular periods before taking birth control, it’s likely they’ll continue to be irregular. If it’s been longer than 4 months since you stopped your birth control and your period still hasn’t visited, you should talk to your healthcare provider. Withdrawal bleeding is a common side effect of hormonal birth control. Some women welcome its mild manner and the monthly validation that birth control is doing its job. Others, especially those with severe PMS, endometriosis, or an overall aversion to vaginal bleeding, may choose a method of hormonal birth control that eliminates their monthly cycle altogether.

This Is Exactly What Happens During Your Menstrual Cycle This Is Exactly What Happens During Your Menstrual Cycle Your cycle takes your body on a wild ride, all to achieve a single goal. “The menstrual cycle has one purpose and one purpose only: reproduction,” , M.D., an associate professor of clinical obstetrics and gynecology at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, tells SELF. “The entire menstrual cycle is set up to prepare your body for possible pregnancy.” Depending on where you are in life and whether or not you want to have children, this notion can be terrifying or thrilling. Either way, it’s a good idea to know exactly what happens at each point in your menstrual cycle. This knowledge can help you better avoid getting , make it easier to get pregnant, or just give you a glimpse into the pretty incredible process your body goes through each month (with a few exceptions, which we’ll explore, too). Your period begins, and egg-containing follicles start to develop on your ovaries. The first day of your marks the beginning of your cycle, which is the number of days between the start of one period and the start of the next. This will usually be around 28 days, but there’s a lot of room for variation here. A menstrual cycle that lasts anywhere between 21 and 35 days is normal, according to the . So you know the drill on these days: Your period arrives and you're probably in for some bleeding and discomfort for a few days. But what you may not realize is that even as you're shedding the uterine lining that was built up in your previous menstrual cycle, your pituitary gland and ovaries are already getting ready to build that lining back up again. Your period actually kicks off the half of your menstrual cycle known as the . “The goal of the proliferative phase is to start to prime the uterine lining to make a nice, fluffy bed for a potential fertilized egg to rest in,” Dr. Streicher says. When you get your period, your levels of estrogen and progesterone, two key hormones that prime your uterine lining, are low. Estrogen is necessary for building up your uterine lining, and progesterone stabilizes it so it won’t just start to bleed before it should, Dr. Streicher explains. So, while you're cycling through tampons, your ovaries and pituitary gland are starting the domino effect that will ultimately build that uterine lining up again, Mary Jane Minkin, M.D., clinical professor of obstetrics, gynecology, and reproductive sciences at Yale University School of Medicine, tells SELF. The pituitary gland , and as your cycle starts, it begins increasing its output of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH). That triggers fluid-filled sacs on the ovaries called , each of which contains an egg, to start maturing for potential fertilization. Your ovaries also start producing more estrogen to make your uterine lining thicker. So, even though you’re currently dealing with cramps, bleeding, and , your ovarian follicles are over there plotting how to get you pregnant next month. But keep in mind: Hormonal can interrupt part of this process. The estrogen in forms of contraception like the vaginal , the , and of course, the combined hormonal , , so those follicles don’t start to mature. Combined hormonal BC also contains progestin (a synthetic form of progesterone) to thin your uterine lining so it’s not a lush, inviting home for a fertilized egg. Progestin also thickens your cervical mucus so it’s harder for sperm to get through. “It’s like the mucus is saying, ‘Don’t even think about it,’” Dr. Minkin says. These forms of birth control each allot one week a month for you to experience withdrawal bleeding (essentially a period) due to the lack of added hormones. But you can also with some methods—like by inserting a new vaginal ring immediately, applying a fresh patch without waiting for a week to go by, or skipping the placebo pills and starting the next pack of birth control pills. Keep in mind that this doesn’t work with all birth control pills, so you should always ask your doctor before using birth control to skip your period. When you do get your period while taking birth control, it's more likely to be lighter and less painful than it was without birth control, says Dr. Minkin. The continuous stream of BC-provided hormones means you’ll have less uterine lining to expel, which in turn translates into fewer prostaglandins. Then there are progestin-only forms of birth control, like the , the , the , and like Mirena. The progestin in these methods thins the uterine lining and thickens cervical mucus as it does in combined birth control. Ovulation suppression is a bit dicier. Any form of progestin-containing BC that requires it get into your bloodstream to work (so, all of them except the IUDs) have a higher likelihood of suppressing ovulation, Dr. Minkin says. An IUD, on the other hand, works locally on the lining of the uterus instead of getting into your bloodstream, so your pituitary gland may still release FSH, she explains. Your period ends, and all follicles stop maturing but one. Between days 5 and 7, your should be packing up shop. At the same time, only one follicle keeps growing while the others are absorbed back into the ovaries. (That said, if you're taking birth control that suppresses ovulation, this follicle won't be developing at all.) During this time, your estrogen levels crest, which signals your pituitary gland to release a surge of luteinizing hormone (LH). This prepares the follicle to burst soon and free a mature egg so it can potentially meet with a sperm. (Again, taking estrogen-containing birth control .) The three days leading up to ovulation (days 11-13, if you have a 28-day cycle), along with the day the egg is actually released, are when you’re at your most fertile. It’s fitting, then, that your testosterone is also rising in this time. “Testosterone helps to boost libido,” Dr. Streicher says. “Biologically it makes sense that it will increase right before ovulation so women are saying, ‘Oh, I feel like I want to have sex.” Taking birth control that suppresses ovulation will likely make this testosterone surge less significant, which is why combined hormonal BC can sometimes . As your body preps for ovulation (if you're ovulating, that is), you’ll also start to see more cervical mucus in your vaginal discharge. This mucus will look clear and slippery, much like egg whites, and its role is to make it easier for sperm to reach the egg. In what’s known as ovulation, a follicle ruptures to release an egg for fertilization. It’s go time. Ovulation typically occurs on day 14 of your cycle—but that’s not a guarantee for everyone. Things like hormonal issues and stress can influence ovulation, Dr. Streicher explains. “One of the biggest mistakes people make is assuming ovulation is always in middle of their cycle,” she says. In reality, it can be earlier or later than that. After the follicle releases the egg, the follicle shrinks into a mass called the corpus luteum. (Hence why this half of your menstrual cycle is called the luteal or secretory phase.) “It sounds very fancy, but it just means ‘,’” Dr. Minkin says. “This area starts [primarily] making progesterone designed to help support the implantation of the egg, which is going, ‘La-di-da, I’m looking for sperm to get fertilized.’” During ovulation, you might experience a twinge of discomfort known as (this fittingly means “middle pain” in German). This can feel like a dull cramp or a sharp and sudden pain on one side of your lower abdomen, according to the . You may also experience some ovulation-related spotting, which is one example of why understanding your cycle can be so helpful. Sometimes people interpret this mid-cycle spotting as a period and think they’re less likely to get pregnant when it’s actually prime time for fertilization, Dr. Streicher explains. (Also, FYI, though you are less likely to get pregnant during your period, ). Keep in mind that if you're on birth control that suppresses ovulation, this day will just be another day for you and none of this stuff will be happening behind the scenes. Your progesterone continues to rise to support a possible pregnancy. Right after ovulation, your estrogen drops, but you’re producing even more progesterone so the uterine lining is thick enough for potential impending fertilization. The egg doesn’t travel all the way to the uterus in order to find the sperm, though. Instead, the egg hangs out in the fallopian tube after ovulation. During this time, if there's sperm that migrates to your fallopian tube and meets the egg, fertilization can occur. From there, the fertilized egg continues to travel towards the uterus where it might implant in the lush uterine lining that was being built up and begin to receive nutrients. If all that happens—boom, you're pregnant. But, of course, not every month results in a pregnancy. Even if no sperm comes to meet the egg in the fallopian tube, the egg still travels toward the uterus, where it will break down. As you get further from ovulation and are less fertile, you’ll see less cervical mucus at the end of each day, regardless of whether or not you got pregnant. Instead, your discharge will likely become stickier and cloudier. Again, if you're on birth control that suppresses ovulation, your hormones won't fluctuate as dramatically throughout the month, and there won't be an egg to fertilize. If you’re not pregnant, your hormone levels start to drop in the week before your period, which can lead to mood issues like PMS. The unfertilized egg will break apart and your levels of of estrogen and progesterone will drop, since they don’t need to remain elevated to support the pregnancy. If you’re susceptible to premenstrual syndrome (PMS) or its more severe sister (PMDD), during the week or so preceding your period you might start to feel irritable, anxious, and . While the mechanisms here aren’t completely clear and seem to be multifaceted, at the very least this decrease in hormones seems to contribute to the premenstrual mood changes some people experience before their periods. Other : Your uterine lining becomes destabilized, and it also releases prostaglandins, hormone-like chemicals that make your uterus contract. In combination, these result in your uterine lining sloughing off and you getting your period. “If pregnancy has not occurred, the uterine lining says, ‘Bummer,’ and sheds,” Dr. Streicher says. “That’s essentially your body saying, ‘We’re not pregnant, we’re going to try again.” With that, the cycle begins anew. That's the menstrual cycle in a nutshell. Keep in mind, though, that the process may be different if you have certain reproductive health conditions. Various reproductive health conditions can cause (cycles that are 21 days or fewer), (cycles that are 35 days or more), or (missing your period for at least three cycles). They can also create periods that are way too heavy and painful to be normal. Here are a few of the biggest culprits. (Remember that treatment for each is wide-ranging, and what works best for you might be different from what works best for others. If you have one of these conditions, seeing a specialist is your best bet for finding relief.) This is a common cause behind abnormally heavy, painful periods, along with bleeding between periods that can make it feel like your cycle is endless, Dr. Minkin says. Endometriosis is typically thought to happen when cells that are native to the uterus begin to grow on other organs. However, there’s a about whether or not the tissue is similar to endometrial cells, but different because it can produce its own estrogen. However they wind up in the wrong place, these cells are still sensitive to estrogen fluctuation and bleed just like they normally would inside the uterus. This can lead to extreme pain and abnormal bleeding, and if these growths crop up on your fallopian tubes and ovaries, they can affect their function, making your periods even more irregular, Dr. Minkin says. Endometriosis treatments vary. Doctors will typically recommend pain medications like nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) along with hormonal birth control to make periods lighter and less painful, according to the . Beyond that, they can perform , which is minimally invasive and done with thin surgical instruments and tiny cameras, to remove as many of the lesions as possible. In severe cases that don’t respond to more conservative treatments, (removal of the uterus and potentially other reproductive organs like the cervix and ovaries, depending on the type of procedure) is an option, though it’s typically a last resort since it makes it impossible to physically carry a pregnancy. (It may still be possible to have children after a hysterectomy thanks to options like adoption, surrogacy, or using your own eggs with a gestational carrier if you keep your ovaries.) These are benign (non-cancerous) growths in and on the muscle of the uterus, and they can cause heavy, long, painful periods in some women, though many others who have fibroids experience few notable symptoms. In addition to pain medications like NSAIDs, doctors may choose to treat symptomatic fibroids with a myomectomy (surgery to remove the growths), uterine artery embolization to block blood flow to these tumors, and a hysterectomy in severe cases, according to the . is a condition marked by infrequent, irregular, or absent periods, high levels of male hormones known as androgens (this can cause issues like acne and facial hair), and abnormal fluid-filled cysts on the ovaries, according to the . This is why people with PCOS may experience inconsistent (or completely missing periods), which might then be torrentially heavy when they do show up, according to the . Combined hormonal birth control pills are a first-line treatment for PCOS, Dr. Minkin says, since they can regulate periods and reduce androgen-related symptoms like acne and facial hair growth. If irregular or absent ovulation is interfering with your ability to get pregnant, doctors can walk you through various medications designed to promote ovulation, like Clomid, according to the . As with anything else in the human body, your menstrual cycle will be individual to you, and you shouldn’t feel embarrassed to see a doctor if you think something’s wrong. If your menstrual cycle is disrupting your life in any major way, chances are doctors can help. It might feel embarrassing to talk about all of this, but periods—and your body—aren’t dirty, shameful, or a burden you should have to bear on your own. Bringing up any concerns you have with a doctor is the only real way to make your menstrual cycle fade into the background so you can live your life.

58561914-f154-46ae-93fe-4fd5abcee1f0,"All pills alter cervical mucus. That is one of the mechanisms by which they prevent pregnancy -- the progestin thickens the cervical mucus. Can you still have cervical mucus changes while on birth control? You should not expect cyclic cervical mucus changes while on hormonal birth control. Hormonal birth control thickens the cervical mucus. All hormonal birth control thickens the cervical mucus as part if their method of action. Do women on the pill still get fertile looking cervical fluid? One of the ways that the birth control pill works is to thicken the cervical mucus to reduce the ability of sperm to get through. As a result of this change, as well as the reduction/prevention of ovulation, a woman on the birth control pill would not normally experience fertile cervical mucus (spinnbarkeit). What happens to sperm when you are on birth control? Sperm is not affected by hormonal birth control; it does the same thing it does if you're not on birth control, except that there's some decrease in how much sperm can get into the uterus (due to thickening of the cervical mucus). Hormonal birth control affects the egg. http://www.plannedparenthood.org/health-topics/birth-control/fam-cervical-mucus-method-22140.htm One of the ways that hormonal birth control prevents pregnancy is by thickening the cervical mucus, making it more difficult for sperm to get to the egg. Birth control doesn't close the cervix, but it does make it less permeable. The combination birth control pill works by decreasing the risk of ovulation, and by thickening the cervical mucus to make it difficult for the sperm to reach an egg, in the unlikely event ovulation occurs. Are you pregnant when cervical mucus stops a day after ovulation? No, you often get excess cervical mucus when you are pregnant anyway One of the reasons for cervical mucus to be pink is when there is implantation, that's what I know Usually women have egg white cervical mucus when they are ovulating. However, some women have depict that not all can have symptoms of ovulation. Some even recount that they are not having any kind of cervical mucus when they are ovulating. So it is possible not to have cervical mucus and ovulate at the same time. I recently just got off birth control its been about 8 days and I have noticed I have had a lot more discharge than normal Its white yellowish cloudy color and creamy is this normal? Yes, it's very normal. One of the ways hormonal birth control prevents pregnancy is to make the cervical mucus thicker so it's harder for sperm to get through. Once you stop hormonal birth control, you will begin to see a normal cycle of cervical mucus again, which will change throughout your menstrual cycle. If the discharge has no odor and no itching, there is no need for concern. About 14 days after the FIRST day of her period.or 7 days after the LAST day of her period.If a woman is observing her cervical mucus, when the cervical mucus turns like ""egg-white"" - clear and stretchy, that is the MOST fertile time.Best to use birth control than try to time it right... Is it normal to have cervical mucus everyday and not just before your period? Yes. You have cervical mucus everyday and it also changes everyday. Do your cervical mucus dry up at 7 weeks of pregnancy? Cervical mucus should not dry up during pregnancy. Cervical mucus changes vary from not only woman to woman but also pregnancy to pregnancy. A woman can have one pregnancy where she has a ton of extra cervical discharge and then another pregnancy where she has absolutely none. Typically cervical mucus in pregnancy dries up somewhat but it is not uncommon for a woman to have a lotion-like cervical mucus during her pregnancy or somewhere in between the dry and lotion-like consistencies. There is no one cervical mucus that can determine pregnancy. Are you supposed to have a lot of white cervical mucus when your period is late i never noticed this before? No. This CM (cervical mucus) can be indication of pregnancy or Ovulation. No cervical mucus after conceiving is that normal? Yes. Conception changes the consistency of the mucus. How long after having snot like mucus does your period appear? The snot like mucus is called the cervical mucus. If a woman has a 28 day cycle, then her period will normal start 14 days after the cervical mucus appears. After ovulation your cervical mucus will be light and sticky. If you are ovulating, it will look clear, slippery and has a consistency similar that of a raw egg white. Cervical mucus changes are monitored for determining when ovulation occurs through the cervical mucus monitoring test. As your cycle progresses, your cervical mucus increases in volume and changes texture. The changes in the mucus that is secreted from the cervix reflect where you are in your cycle. The consistency of your cervical mucus changes during the cycle due to hormonal fluctuations. You are considered most fertile when the mucus becomes clear, slippery, and stretchy. Many women compare mucus at this stage to raw egg whites. Before collecting a sample, be sure to wash your hands first in order to prevent the transmission of germs. The most common ways of collecting a cervical mucus sample are: * Inserting your finger into your vagina and collecting some mucus. * Using toilet paper and wiping the entrance of your vagina and analyzing the mucus collected that way. * The most accurate way to collect your cervical mucus is to insert your finger into your vagina and circle your finger around your cervix or as close as you can to the cervix. This will allow you to actually collect the cervical mucus instead of just it's wetness. Monitoring the changes in cervical mucus is the only method that will not require looking back to the past few cycles for analysis, and also provide reliable results that you can trust when trying to conceive. You can do this yourself by getting a sample of your cervical secretions and stretch it between 2 of your fingers (the thumb and index finger) to test for the consistency. Examining the changes in your cervical mucus can help you pinpoint your time of ovulation and increase your chances of pregnancy. Women have egg-white cervical mucus due to ovulation. This is a sign that the woman is fertile and it is a better chance to get pregnant. How does the oral contraceptive decrease fertility? The Pill or birth control pills decrease fertility by suppressing (stopping) ovulation, thickening cervical mucus to prevent the sperm from moving through the fallopian tubes and by changing the lining of the uterus. You had chlamydia for a few months and got treated you use to have cervical mucus now you don't should you be worried? No; the mucus may have been from the infection. The fertility problems that chlamydia may cause do not affect cervical mucus. What does cervical mucus look like after conception?

We asked a doc to explain what the results can mean. By Jessica Migala June 13, 2017 After the season finale of on Sunday, the famous sisters had us wondering about fertility testing. In case you missed it, Khloé and Kim visited a reproductive specialist because Khloé was considering acting as a for Kim's third baby, and wanted to make sure that option was a real possibility. But during an ultrasound of her pelvis, the doctor told Khloé she had fewer ovarian follicles—the fluid-filled structures in which eggs develop—than he would expect in a 32-year-old woman, which could affect her chances of having her own baby. In fact, she might think about sooner rather than later, he said. The doc told her to stop taking her , and come back for another exam. That did the trick: When Khloé returned for a follow-up, plenty of follicles showed up on the scan. So, how does the pill affect your follicles, exactly? And should any woman who wants a baby one day consider getting the same test Khloé did? To learn more, we spoke with reproductive endocrinologist Daniel B. Shapiro, MD, the chief clinical officer at Prelude Fertility in Atlanta. RELATED: The test Khloé's doctor used it called a basal antral follicle count, he explains: ""It tells you how many potential egg sacks would respond to fertility medication in a given cycle."" For a woman who isn't undergoing , it can give an indication of her ovarian reserve, or how many eggs she has left. During a typical menstrual cycle (provided you’re not on the pill), a group of eggs begins to mature, and your ovary and pituitary gland (in your brain) then negotiate to pick the best egg, says Dr. Shapiro. “In your teens and 20s, this is a Miss America-style event where 50 or more eggs stand up and say ‘pick me!’” You’ll ovulate one winning egg, and the rest are destroyed. But as you age, the contestant pool shrinks. By your mid-30s, you may have less than 20 eggs per cycle, and in your late 30s, less than 10, Dr. Shapiro explains. The follicle count test can tell you how many contestants you currently have. To get our top stories delivered to your inbox, Understandably, Khloé left her first appointment worried. But the fact that she was on hormonal birth control would have skewed the result of the test, says Dr. Shapiro. “Being on the pill will make your follicle count look a lot lower than it really is,” he says. Hormonal contraception suppresses FSH, or follicle-stimulating hormone. “The longer you’re on the pill, the less FSH stimulation your follicles will see, so they’re essentially not awake,” he says. They’re there, but you can’t see them, even on a scan. Go off the pill and you should start to ovulate normally and get your right away. (If you're over-exercising or don't have enough body fat, it may take up to a year for your period to return, says Dr. Shapiro.) For women who are curious about their egg reserve, a follicle count might not be the best test, however. The results can vary depending on the doctor who performs it, says Dr. Shapiro. Instead, he recommends an , a blood test that measures levels of anti-Müellerian hormone, another marker for ovarian reserve. ""If you’re not sure what your fertility future holds and not sure when you will be ready to start a family, getting an AMH test is not a bad idea,” he says.

Menopause typically occurs between 49 and 52 years of age. Half of women have their last period between the ages of 47 and 55, while 80% have their last period between 44 and 58. The average age of the last period in the United States is 51 years, in the United Kingdom is 52 years, in Ireland is 50 years and in Australia is 51 years. In and the , the median age of natural menopause is considerably earlier, at 44 years. The menopausal transition or perimenopause leading up to menopause usually lasts 7 years (sometimes as long as 14 years). In rare cases, a woman's ovaries stop working at a very early age, ranging anywhere from the age of to age 40. This is known as and affects 1 to 2% of women by age 40. Undiagnosed and untreated is a risk factor for early menopause. Coeliac disease can present with several non-gastrointestinal symptoms, in the absence of gastrointestinal symptoms, and most cases escape timely recognition and go undiagnosed, leading to a risk of long-term complications. A strict reduces the risk. Women with early diagnosis and treatment of coeliac disease present a normal duration of fertile life span. Women who have undergone with ovary conservation go through menopause on average 3.7 years earlier than the expected age. Other factors that can promote an earlier onset of menopause (usually 1 to 3 years early) are smoking cigarettes or being extremely thin. (POF) is when the ovaries stop functioning before the age of 40 years. It is diagnosed or confirmed by high blood levels of (FSH) and (LH) on at least three occasions at least four weeks apart. Known causes of premature ovarian failure include , disease, , , being a carrier of the gene, and . However, in about 50–80% of spontaneous cases of premature ovarian failure, the cause is unknown, i.e., it is generally . Women who have a functional disorder affecting the reproductive system (e.g., , , cancer of the reproductive organs) can go into menopause at a younger age than the normal timeframe. The functional disorders often significantly speed up the menopausal process. An early menopause can be related to smoking, higher , racial and ethnic factors, illnesses, and the , with or without the removal of the uterus. Rates of premature menopause have been found to be significantly higher in fraternal and identical ; approximately 5% of twins reach menopause before the age of 40. The reasons for this are not completely understood. Transplants of ovarian tissue between identical twins have been successful in restoring fertility. Menopause can be surgically induced by bilateral (removal of ovaries), which is often, but not always, done in conjunction with removal of the Fallopian tubes (salpingo-oophorectomy) and uterus (hysterectomy). Cessation of menses as a result of removal of the ovaries is called ""surgical menopause"". Surgical treatments, such as the removal of ovaries, might cause periods to stop altogether. The sudden and complete drop in hormone levels usually produces extreme withdrawal symptoms such as hot flashes, etc. The symptoms of early menopause may be more severe. Removal of the uterus removal of the ovaries does directly cause menopause, although pelvic surgery of this type can often precipitate a somewhat earlier menopause, perhaps because of a compromised blood supply to the ovaries.. The time between surgery and possible early menopause is due to the fact that ovaries are still producing hormones. Bone loss due to menopause occurs due to changes in a woman's hormone levels. The menopausal transition, and postmenopause itself, is a natural change, not usually a disease state or a disorder. The main cause of this transition is the natural depletion and aging of the finite amount of (). This process is sometimes accelerated by other conditions and is known to occur earlier after a wide range of gynecologic procedures such as (with and without ), and . The depletion of the ovarian reserve causes an increase in circulating (FSH) and (LH) levels because there are fewer and follicles responding to these hormones and producing estrogen. The transition has a variable degree of effects. The stages of the menopause transition have been classified according to a woman's reported bleeding pattern, supported by changes in the pituitary (FSH) levels. In younger women, during a normal the ovaries produce , and in a cyclical pattern under the control of FSH and (LH), which are both produced by the . During perimenopause (approaching menopause), levels and patterns of production remain relatively unchanged or may increase compared to young women, but the cycles become frequently shorter or irregular. The often observed increase in estrogen is presumed to be in response to elevated FSH levels that, in turn, is hypothesized to be caused by decreased feedback by . Similarly, decreased inhibin feedback after is hypothesized to contribute to increased ovarian stimulation and earlier menopause. The menopausal transition is characterized by marked, and often dramatic, variations in FSH and estradiol levels. Because of this, measurements of these hormones are considered to be reliable guides to a woman's exact menopausal status. Menopause occurs because of the sharp decrease of estradiol and progesterone production by the ovaries. After menopause, estrogen continues to be produced mostly by in fat tissues and is produced in small amounts in many other tissues such as ovaries, bone, blood vessels, and the brain where it acts locally. The substantial fall in circulating estradiol levels at menopause impacts many tissues, from brain to skin. In contrast to the sudden fall in estradiol during menopause, the levels of total and free testosterone, as well as (DHEAS) and appear to decline more or less steadily with age. An effect of natural menopause on circulating levels has not been observed. Thus specific tissue effects of natural menopause cannot be attributed to loss of androgenic hormone production. Hot flashes and other vasomotor symptoms accompany the menopausal transition. While many sources continue to claim that hot flashes during the menopausal transition are caused by low estrogen levels, this assertion was shown incorrect in 1935, and, in most cases, hot flashes are observed despite elevated estrogen levels. The exact cause of these symptoms is not yet understood, possible factors considered are higher and erratic variation of estradiol level during the cycle, elevated FSH levels which may indicate hypothalamic dysregulation perhaps caused by missing feedback by inhibin. It has been also observed that the vasomotor symptoms differ during early perimenopause and late menopausal transition and it is possible that they are caused by a different mechanism. Long-term effects of menopause may include , as well as changed metabolic profile resulting in cardiac risks. Decreased inhibin feedback after is hypothesized to contribute to increased ovarian stimulation and earlier menopause. Hastened ovarian aging has been observed after . While it is difficult to prove that these surgeries are causative, it has been hypothesized that the may be producing endocrine factors contributing to the endocrine feedback and regulation of the ovarian stimulation. Elimination of these factors contributes to faster depletion of the ovarian reserve. Reduced blood supply to the ovaries that may occur as a consequence of hysterectomy and has been hypothesized to contribute to this effect. Impaired repair mechanisms may contribute to earlier depletion of the ovarian reserve during aging. As women age, double-strand breaks accumulate in the DNA of their primordial follicles. Primordial follicles are immature primary oocytes surrounded by a single layer of granulosa cells. An enzyme system is present in oocytes that ordinarily accurately repairs DNA double-strand breaks. This repair system is called "" repair"", and it is especially effective during meiosis. Meiosis is the general process by which germ cells are formed in all sexual eukaryotes; it appears to be an adaptation for efficiently removing damages in germ line DNA. (See .) Human primary oocytes are present at an intermediate stage of meiosis, termed prophase I (see ). Expression of four key DNA repair genes that are necessary for homologous recombinational repair during meiosis (BRCA1, MRE11, Rad51, and ATM) decline with age in oocytes. This age-related decline in ability to repair DNA double-strand damages can account for the accumulation of these damages, that then likely contributes to the depletion of the ovarian reserve. Ways of assessing the impact on women of some of these menopause effects, include the questionnaire, the and the Menopause rating scale. Premenopause is a term used to mean the years leading up to the last period, when the levels of reproductive hormones are becoming more variable and lower, and the effects of hormone withdrawal are present. Premenopause starts some time before the monthly cycles become noticeably irregular in timing. The term ""perimenopause"", which literally means ""around the menopause"", refers to the menopause transition years before the date of the final episode of flow. According to the , this transition can last for four to eight years. The describes it as a six- to ten-year phase ending 12 months after the last menstrual period. During perimenopause, levels average about 20–30% higher than during premenopause, often with wide fluctuations. These fluctuations cause many of the physical changes during perimenopause as well as menopause, especially during the last 1–2 years of perimenopause (before menopause). Some of these changes are , night sweats, difficulty sleeping, mood swings, or , , , and heart disease. During this period, diminishes but is not considered to reach zero until the official date of menopause. The official date is determined retroactively, once 12 months have passed after the last appearance of menstrual blood. The menopause transition typically begins between 40 and 50 years of age (average 47.5). The duration of perimenopause may be for up to eight years. Women will often, but not always, start these transitions (perimenopause and menopause) about the same time as their mother did. In some women, menopause may bring about a sense of loss related to the end of fertility. In addition, this change often occurs when other stressors may be present in a woman's life: The birth of grandchildren, which places people of ""middle age"" into a new category of ""older people"" (especially in cultures where being older is a state that is looked down on) Some research appears to show that supplementation in perimenopausal women can improve thyroid function and gonadotropin levels, as well as restoring fertility and menstruation and preventing depression associated with menopause. The term ""postmenopausal"" describes women who have not experienced any menstrual flow for a minimum of 12 months, assuming that they have a and are not pregnant or . In women without a uterus, menopause or postmenopause can be identified by a blood test showing a very high FSH level. Thus postmenopause is the time in a woman's life that takes place after her last period or, more accurately, after the point when her ovaries become inactive. The reason for this delay in declaring postmenopause is because periods are usually erratic at this time of life. Therefore, a reasonably long stretch of time is necessary to be sure that the cycling has ceased. At this point a woman is considered infertile; however, the possibility of becoming pregnant has usually been very low (but not quite zero) for a number of years before this point is reached. A woman's reproductive hormone levels continue to drop and fluctuate for some time into post-menopause, so hormone withdrawal effects such as hot flashes may take several years to disappear. A period-like flow during postmenopause, even spotting, may be a sign of . Perimenopause is a natural stage of life. It is not a disease or a disorder. Therefore, it does not automatically require any kind of medical treatment. However, in those cases where the physical, mental, and emotional effects of perimenopause are strong enough that they significantly disrupt the life of the woman experiencing them, palliative medical therapy may sometimes be appropriate. Main article: In the context of the menopause, (HRT) is the use of in women without a uterus and estrogen plus in women who have an intact uterus. HRT may be reasonable for the treatment of menopausal symptoms, such as hot flashes. It is the most effective treatment option, especially when delivered as a skin patch. Its use, however, appears to increase the risk of and . When used for menopausal symptoms some recommend it be used for the shortest time possible and at the lowest dose possible. Evidence to support long-term use, however, is poor. It also appears effective for preventing bone loss and fracture, but it is generally recommended only for women at significant risk for whom other therapies are unsuitable. HRT may be unsuitable for some women, including those at increased risk of cardiovascular disease, increased risk of thromboembolic disease (such as those with obesity or a history of venous thrombosis) or increased risk of some types of cancer. There is some concern that this treatment increases the risk of breast cancer. Adding to hormone therapy has a positive effect on sexual function in postmenopausal women, although it may be accompanied by hair growth, acne and a reduction in high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. These side effects diverge depending on the doses and methods of using testosterone. are a category of drugs, either synthetically produced or derived from a botanical source, that act selectively as agonists or antagonists on the throughout the body. The most commonly prescribed SERMs are and . Raloxifene exhibits oestrogen agonist activity on bone and lipids, and antagonist activity on breast and the endometrium. Tamoxifen is in widespread use for treatment of hormone sensitive breast cancer. Raloxifene prevents vertebral fractures in postmenopausal, osteoporotic women and reduces the risk of invasive breast cancer. Some of the and appear to provide some relief from vasomotor symptoms. Low dose is the only non-hormonal medication that was -approved to treat moderate-to-severe vasomotor symptoms associated with menopause as of 2016. They may, however, be associated with appetite and sleeping problems, constipation and nausea. or may help but do not work as well as hormone therapy. Gabapentin can decrease the amount of hot flashes. Side effects associated with its use include drowsiness and headaches. Clonidine is used to improve vasomotor symptoms and may be associated with constipation, dizziness, nausea and sleeping problems. One review found and decreases the amount women are affected by hot flushes. Another review found not enough evidence to make a conclusion. Exercise has been thought to reduce postmenopausal symptoms through the increase of endorphin levels, which decrease as estrogen production decreases. Additionally, high is a risk factor for vasomotor symptoms in particular. However, there is insufficient evidence to support the benefits of weight loss for symptom management. There are mixed perspectives on the benefits of physical exercise. While one review found that there was a lack of quality evidence supporting a benefit of exercise, another review recommended regular healthy exercise to reduce comorbidities, improve mood and anxiety symptoms, enhance cognition, and decrease the risk of fractures. Yoga may help with postmenopausal symptoms similar to other exercise. There is no evidence of consistent benefit of alternative therapies for menopausal symptoms despite their popularity. The effect of on menopausal symptoms is promising for reduction of hot flashes and vaginal dryness. Evidence does not support a benefit from such as , , or the non-phytoestrogen . As of 2011 there is no support for herbal or dietary supplements in the prevention or treatment of the mental changes that occur around menopause. Hypnosis may reduce the severity of hot flashes. In addition, relaxation training with at-home relaxation audiotapes such as deep breathing, paced respiration, and guided imagery may have positive effects on relaxing muscles and reducing stress. There is no evidence to support the efficacy of acupuncture as a management for menopausal symptoms. A 2016 found not enough evidence to show a difference between Chinese herbal medicine and placebo for the symptoms. Lack of lubrication is a common problem during and after perimenopause. Vaginal moisturizers can help women with overall dryness, and lubricants can help with lubrication difficulties that may be present during intercourse. It is worth pointing out that moisturizers and lubricants are different products for different issues: some women complain that their genitalia are uncomfortably dry all the time, and they may do better with moisturizers. Those who need only lubricants do well using them only during intercourse. Low-dose prescription vaginal estrogen products such as estrogen creams are generally a safe way to use estrogen topically, to help vaginal thinning and dryness problems (see ) while only minimally increasing the levels of estrogen in the bloodstream. In terms of managing hot flashes, lifestyle measures such as drinking cold liquids, staying in cool rooms, using fans, removing excess clothing, and avoiding hot flash triggers such as hot drinks, spicy foods, etc., may partially supplement (or even obviate) the use of medications for some women. Individual counseling or support groups can sometimes be helpful to handle sad, depressed, anxious or confused feelings women may be having as they pass through what can be for some a very challenging transition time. can be minimized by , adequate intake and regular weight-bearing exercise. The bisphosphonate drug alendronate may decrease the risk of a fracture, in women that have both bone loss and a previous fracture and less so for those with just osteoporosis. A surgical procedure where a part of one of the ovaries is removed earlier in life and frozen and then over time thawed and returned to the body has been tried. While at least 11 women have undergone the procedure and paid over £6,000, there is no evidence it is safe or effective. The cultural context within which a woman lives can have a significant impact on the way she experiences the menopausal transition. Menopause has been described as a subjective experience, with social and cultural factors playing a prominent role in the way menopause is experienced and perceived. The word menopause was invented by French doctors at the beginning of the nineteenth century. Some of them noted that peasant women had no complaints about the end of menses, while urban middle-class women had many troubling symptoms. Doctors at this time considered the symptoms to be the result of urban lifestyles of sedentary behaviour, alcohol consumption, too much time indoors, and over-eating, with a lack of fresh fruit and vegetables. Within the United States, social location affects the way women perceive menopause and its related biological effects. Research indicates that whether a woman views menopause as a medical issue or an expected life change is correlated with her socio-economic status. The paradigm within which a woman considers menopause influences the way she views it: Women who understand menopause as a medical condition rate it significantly more negatively than those who view it as a life transition or a symbol of aging. Ethnicity and geography play roles in the experience of menopause. American women of different ethnicities report significantly different types of menopausal effects. One major study found Caucasian women most likely to report what are sometimes described as psychosomatic symptoms, while African-American women were more likely to report vasomotor symptoms. It seems that Japanese women experience menopause effects, or , in a different way from American women. Japanese women report lower rates of hot flashes and night sweats; this can be attributed to a variety of factors, both biological and social. Historically, konenki was associated with wealthy middle-class housewives in Japan, i.e., it was a ""luxury disease"" that women from traditional, inter-generational rural households did not report. Menopause in Japan was viewed as a symptom of the inevitable process of aging, rather than a ""revolutionary transition"", or a ""deficiency disease"" in need of management. In Japanese culture, reporting of vasomotor symptoms has been on the increase, with research conducted by Melissa Melby in 2005 finding that of 140 Japanese participants, hot flashes were prevalent in 22.1%. This was almost double that of 20 years prior. Whilst the exact cause for this is unknown, possible contributing factors include significant dietary changes, increased medicalisation of middle-aged women and increased media attention on the subject. However, reporting of vasomotor symptoms is still significantly lower than North America. Additionally, while most women in the United States apparently have a negative view of menopause as a time of deterioration or decline, some studies seem to indicate that women from some Asian cultures have an understanding of menopause that focuses on a sense of liberation and celebrates the freedom from the risk of pregnancy. Diverging from these conclusions, one study appeared to show that many American women ""experience this time as one of liberation and "". Menopause literally means the ""end of monthly cycles"" (the end of or ), from the Greek word (""pause"") and (""month""). This is a medical ; the Greek word for is actually different. In Ancient Greek, the were described in the plural, , (""the monthlies""), and its modern descendant has been clipped to . The Modern Greek medical term is in or in . The word ""menopause"" was coined specifically for human females, where the end of fertility is traditionally indicated by the permanent stopping of monthly menstruations. However, menopause exists in some other animals, many of which do not have monthly menstruation; in this case, the term means a natural end to fertility that occurs before the end of the natural lifespan. See also: and Few animals have a menopause: humans are joined by just four other species in which females live substantially longer than their ability to reproduce. The others are all : , , and . Various theories have been suggested that attempt to suggest evolutionary benefits to the human species stemming from the cessation of women's reproductive capability before the end of their natural lifespan. Explanations can be categorized as adaptive and non-adaptive: The high cost of female investment in offspring may lead to physiological deteriorations that amplify susceptibility to becoming infertile. This hypothesis suggests the reproductive lifespan in humans has been optimized, but it has proven more difficult in females and thus their reproductive span is shorter. If this hypothesis were true, however, age at menopause should be negatively correlated with reproductive effort, and the available data do not support this. A recent increase in female due to improvements in the standard of living and social care has also been suggested. It is difficult for selection, however, to favor aid to offspring from parents and grandparents. Irrespective of living standards, adaptive responses are limited by physiological mechanisms. In other words, is programmed and regulated by specific genes. While it is fairly common for extant hunter-gatherers to live past age 50 provided that they survive childhood, fossil evidence shows that mortality in adults has decreased over the last 30,000 to 50,000 years and that it was extremely unusual for early to live to age 50. This discovery has led some biologists to argue that there was no selection for or against menopause at the time at which the ancestor of all modern humans lived in Africa, suggesting that menopause is instead a random evolutionary effect of a regarding aging in early . It is also argued that since the population fraction of post-menopausal women in early was so low, menopause had no evolutionary effect on mate selection or social behaviors related to mate selection. This hypothesis suggests that younger mothers and offspring under their care will fare better in a difficult and predatory environment because a younger mother will be stronger and more agile in providing protection and sustenance for herself and a nursing baby. The various biological factors associated with menopause had the effect of male members of the species investing their effort with the most viable of potential female mates. One problem with this hypothesis is that we would expect to see menopause exhibited in the animal kingdom, and another problem is that in the case of extended child development, even a female who was relatively young, still agile, and attractive when producing a child would lose future support from her male partner due to him seeking out fertile mates when she reaches menopause while the child is still not independent. That would be counterproductive to the supposed adaptation of getting male support as a fertile female and ruin survival for children produced over much of the female's fertile and agile life, unless children were raised in ways that did not rely on support from a male partner which would eliminate that type of resource diverting selection anyway. The young female preference hypothesis proposes that changes in male preferences for younger mates allowed late-age acting fertility to accumulate in females without any evolutionary penalty, giving rise to menopause. A computer model was constructed to test this hypothesis, and showed that it was feasible. However, in order for deleterious mutations that affect fertility past roughly age fifty to accumulate, human maximum lifespan had to first be extended to about its present value. As of 2016 it was unclear if there has been sufficient time since that happened for such an evolutionary process to occur. The male-biased theory proposes that male-biased philopatry in social species leads to increased relatedness to the group in relation to female age, making inclusive fitness benefits older females receive from helping the group greater than what they would receive from continued reproduction, which eventually led to the evolution of menopause. In a pattern of male-biased dispersal and local mating, the relatedness of the individuals in the group decreases with female age, leading to a decrease in with female age. This occurs because a female will stay with her father in her natal group throughout life, initially being closely related to the males and females. Females are born and stay in the group, so relatedness to the females stays about the same. However, throughout time, the older male relatives will die and any sons she gives birth to will disperse, so that local relatedness to males, and therefore the whole group, declines. The situation is reversed in species where males are philopatric and either females disperse, or mating is non-local. Under these conditions, a female's reproductive life begins away from her father and paternal relatives because she was either born into a new group from non-local mating or because she dispersed. In the case of female-biased dispersal, the female is initially equally unrelated with every individual in the group, and with non-local mating, the female is closely related to the females of the group, but not the males since her paternal relatives are in another group. As she gives birth, her sons will stay with her, increasing her relatedness to males in the group overtime and thus her relatedness with the overall group. The common feature that connects these two otherwise different behaviors is male-biased philopatry, which leads to an increase in kin selection with female age. While not conclusive, evidence does exist to support the idea that female-biased dispersal existed in pre-modern humans. The closest living relatives to humans, , , and both and , are female-biased dispersers. Analysis of sex specific genetic material, the non-recombining portions of the Y chromosome and mitochondrial DNA, show evidence of a prevalence of female-biased dispersal as well; however, these results could also be affected by the effective breeding numbers of males and females in local populations. Evidence of female-biased dispersion in hunter-gatherers is not definitive, with some studies supporting the idea, and others suggesting there is no strong bias towards either sex. In , both sexes mate non-locally with members of a different pod but return to the pod after copulation. Demographic data shows that a female's mean relatedness to the group does increase over time due to increasing relatedness to males. While less well-studied, there is evidence that , another menopausal species, also display this behavior. However, mating behavior that increases local relatedness with female age is prevalent in non-menopausal species, making it unlikely that it is the only factor that determines if menopause will evolve in a species. The mother hypothesis suggests that menopause was selected for humans because of the extended development period of human offspring and high costs of reproduction so that mothers gain an advantage in reproductive fitness by redirecting their effort from new offspring with a low survival chance to existing children with a higher survival chance. The suggests that menopause was selected for humans because it promotes the survival of grandchildren. According to this hypothesis, post-reproductive women feed and care for children, adult nursing daughters, and grandchildren whose mothers have weaned them. Human babies require large and steady supplies of glucose to feed the growing brain. In infants in the first year of life, the brain consumes 60% of all calories, so both babies and their mothers require a dependable food supply. Some evidence suggests that hunters contribute less than half the total food budget of most hunter-gatherer societies, and often much less than half, so that foraging grandmothers can contribute substantially to the survival of grandchildren at times when mothers and fathers are unable to gather enough food for all of their children. In general, selection operates most powerfully during times of famine or other privation. So although grandmothers might not be necessary during good times, many grandchildren cannot survive without them during times of famine. Post-reproductive female killer whales tend to lead their pods, especially during years of food scarcity. Furthermore, the increased mortality risk of a killer whale individual due to losing a grandmother is stronger in years food scarcity Analysis of historical data found that the length of a female's post-reproductive lifespan was reflected in the reproductive success of her offspring and the survival of her grandchildren. Another study found comparative effects but only in the maternal grandmother—paternal grandmothers had a detrimental effect on infant mortality (probably due to paternity uncertainty). Differing assistance strategies for maternal and paternal grandmothers have also been demonstrated. Maternal grandmothers concentrate on offspring survival, whereas paternal grandmothers increase birth rates. Some believe a problem concerning the grandmother hypothesis is that it requires a history of female , while in the present day the majority of hunter-gatherer societies are . However, there is disagreement split along ideological lines about whether would have existed before modern times. Some believe variations on the mother, or grandmother effect fail to explain longevity with continued spermatogenesis in males (oldest verified paternity is 94 years, 35 years beyond the oldest documented birth attributed to females). Notably, the survival time past menopause is roughly the same as the maturation time for a human child. That a mother's presence could aid in the survival of a developing child, while an unidentified father's absence might not have affected survival, could explain the paternal fertility near the end of the father's lifespan. A man with no certainty of which children are his may merely attempt to father additional children, with support of existing children present but small. Note the existence of partible paternity supporting this. Some argue that the mother and grandmother hypotheses fail to explain the detrimental effects of losing ovarian follicular activity, such as , , and . The theories discussed above assume that evolution directly selected for menopause. Another theory states that menopause is the byproduct of the evolutionary selection for , a factor that causes menopause. Menopause results from having too few ovarian follicles to produce enough estrogen to maintain the ovarian-pituitary-hypothalamic loop, which results in the cessation of menses and the beginning of menopause. Human females are born with approximately a million oocytes, and approximately 400 oocytes are lost to ovulation throughout life. In social , the sharing of resources among the group places limits on how many offspring can be produced and supported by members of the group. This creates a situation in which each female must compete with others of the group to ensure they are the one that reproduces. The reproductive conflict hypothesis proposes that this female reproductive conflict favors the cessation of female reproductive potential in older age to avoid reproductive conflict, increasing the older female's fitness through benefits. Female-biased dispersal or non-local mating leads to an increase in relatedness to the social group with female age. In the human case of female-biased dispersal, when a young female enters a new group, she is not related to any individual and she reproduces to produce an offspring with a of 0.5. An older female could also choose to reproduce, producing an offspring with a relatedness of 0.5, or she could refrain from reproducing and allow another pair to reproduce. Because her relatedness to males in the group is high, there is a fair probability that the offspring will be her grandchild with a relatedness of 0.25. The younger female experiences no cost to her inclusive fitness from using the resources necessary to successfully rear offspring since she is not related to members of the group, but there is a cost for the older female. As a result, the younger female has the advantage in reproductive competition. Although a female killer whale born into a social group is related to some members of the group, the whale case of non-local mating leads to similar outcomes because the younger female relatedness to the group as a whole is less than the relatedness of the older female. This behavior makes more likely the cessation of reproduction late in life to avoid reproductive conflict with younger females. Research using both human and killer whale demographic data has been published that supports the role of reproductive conflict in the evolution of menopause. Analysis of demographic data from pre-industrial Finnish populations found significant reductions in offspring survivorship when mothers-in-laws and daughters-in-laws had overlapping births, supporting the idea that avoiding reproductive conflict is beneficial to offspring survivorship. Humans, more so than other primates, rely on food sharing for survival, so the large survivorship reduction values could be caused by a straining of community resources. Avoiding such straining is a possible explanation for why the reproductive overlap seen in humans is much lower than other primates. Food sharing is also prevalent among another menopausal species, killer whales. Reproductive conflict has also been observed in killer whales, with increased calf mortality seen when reproductive overlap between a younger and older generational female occurred. Menopause in the animal kingdom appears to be uncommon, but the presence of this phenomenon in different species has not been thoroughly researched. show a varying degree of ; rapid senescing organisms (e.g., and ) do not have a post-reproductive life-stage. Gradual senescence is exhibited by all life histories. Menopause has been observed in several species of nonhuman , including and . Some research suggests that wild chimpanzees do not experience menopause, as their fertility declines are associated with declines in overall health. Menopause also has been reported in a variety of other vertebrate species including , , , , , the , the , the , the laboratory and , and the . However, with the exception of the short-finned pilot whale, killer whale, narwhals, and beluga whales, such examples tend to be from captive individuals, and thus they are not necessarily representative of what happens in natural populations in the wild. Dogs do not experience menopause; the simply becomes irregular and infrequent. Although older female dogs are not considered good candidates for breeding, offspring have been produced by older animals. Similar observations have been made in cats. .

Introduction Poor ovarian response (POR) to controlled ovarian hyperstimulation presents one of the greatest challenges in reproductive medicine. These patients face a decline in the number and quality of oocytes, which dramatically lowers their chances to conceive. It is estimated that poor response to ovarian stimulation occurs in 9-24% of women [1]. The proportion of poor responders among the population of patients that seek in vitro fertilization (IVF) to conceive is getting higher, with the postponing of parenthood towards the biological age limits. Despite many studies, a preferred method of ovarian stimulation is still not confirmed for this group of patients. Since the definition of ""poor response"" was very broad [2], the data on efficacy and success rates of different protocols were confusing. Only recently, with the introduction of the Bologna criteria [3], does there seem to be a better basis for studies that compare the efficacies of natural cycle IVF, modified natural cycle IVF, and various stimulation protocols. There are data in the literature that suggest that it is reasonable to use natural cycle as a method of choice for this group to achieve acceptable results [4]. Increasing the dosages of gonadotrophins does not improve the number of mature oocytes obtained, fertilization rate, or clinical pregnancy rates [5]. There is also some evidence that milder ovarian stimulation reduces the incidence of aneuploidy compared with high dosage stimulation [6]. One of the arguments for treating these patients with natural cycle IVF includes the questionable cost benefits of IVF treatment with high dosages of gonadotrophins that yield small numbers of oocytes [7]. The treatment options also depend on the availability of an oocyte donation program and local legislation and reimbursement policies. Nevertheless, the success rates of natural cycle IVF in women with poor ovarian response according to the Bologna criteria are low, with 2.6% live birth rate per cycle [8]. Poor ovarian response is associated with many factors that lower the success rate. The possible causes for the condition include the woman's age and other factors that affect the pool of follicles during its formation in fetal development and later in her life. It can be the result of ovarian surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, chronic smoking, autoimmune disorders, and various genetic risk factors like X chromosome derangements [9] and fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR1) premutation [10]. The result is the decline in number and quality of the oocytes. It has been established that miscarriage rate is higher in poor responders comparing with normal responders [11]. In patients with POR, the incidence of aneuploid blastocysts is higher, with 35.1% of all aneuploid blastocyst cycles reported [12]. The prevalence and etiology of the higher ratio of aneuploid embryos in patients with POR are not entirely clear. Poor ovarian response is obviously associated with age and aneuploidy, mainly because of the premature segregation of sister chromatids as a result of depletion of the cohesion [13]. Nevertheless, it is not only a woman's age that affects the ratio of aneuploidy. Trisomic pregnancy is more frequent in women with a reduced ovarian follicle pool, independent of their age [14]. The data of Sunkara et al. also show that not only age but also other factors that cause the decline of oocyte quality in this group of patients affect the miscarriage rate [15]. It is not only the missegregation of genetic material that comes along with aging oocytes; there are also changes in gene expression through DNA methylation, histone modifications, miRNA expression, and mitochondrial function as reviewed by Ge et al. [16]. All these alterations can affect embryo development. With the time-lapse microscopy, we can observe events in early embryo development in vitro. It is established that cleavage abnormalities are quite frequent [17]. They indicate cell anomalies on different levels and they may also give rise to postzygotic genetic abnormalities, such as mosaicism, which arise during mitotic division. There seem to be many different factors associated with these abnormal cleavage patterns, but there is a lack of data regarding what the causes are for certain types. The correlation between aneuploidy and kinetic markers was studied by Campbell et al. [18]. There are also sperm-derived factors that influence embryo cleavage. The centrosome that organizes cleavages is inherited paternally. In an experiment using the rhesus macaque monkey model, the association between sperm that had been exposed to oxidative stress prior to intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) and the occurrence of cleavage abnormalities was established [19]. The integrity of the spindle in subsequent mitotic events is also very important and its abnormalities contribute to missegregation of the genetic material [20]. The aim of our study was to follow the cleavage patterns and morphokinetics of embryos from natural ICSI cycles in the group of poor responder patients. These patients represent an interesting group for studying the impact of embryo cleavage irregularities on further development and clinical outcome, as every cleaved zygote, regardless of its quality, was transferred into the uterus. 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Study Design. Fifty-three consecutive natural cycles with embryo transfer in the period from February 2012 until April 2014 were included in the study. All forty-six patients were poor responders according to the Bologna criteria [3]. Detailed analyses of the morphokinetic parameters of 53 embryos that were transferred into the uterus were performed. Cycles were retrospectively split into those with normally cleaved embryos and cycles with one or more embryo cleavage irregularities. Transfer outcomes (implantation and live birth rate) were compared between both groups. The study was approved by the Institutional board for Medical Ethics. 2.2. Patients and Interventions. Patients were diagnosed as poor responders according to the Bologna criteria [3]. In short, they fulfilled two of the following criteria: (i) advanced maternal age or any other risk factor for POR; (ii) a previous POR; and (iii) an abnormal ovarian reserve test (antiMullerian hormone [AMH] 0,5-1,1ng/mL; antral follicle count <5-7). The criteria were also fulfilled in case of two episodes of POR after maximal stimulation, in the absence of advanced maternal age or abnormal ovarian reserve tests. Patients of advanced age with an abnormal ovarian reserve were also included, although they had no previous stimulation. Patients were treated with ICSI on single oocyte obtained from natural cycle as described previously [21]. In short, they had no downregulation of the pituitary gland or ovarian stimulation and their natural menstrual cycle was followed with ultrasound scans of follicle growth and estradiol measurements. When the follicle was >15 mm and the estradiol was >0.5 nmol/L, 5,000 IU human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) was administered to trigger ovulation. An ultrasound-guided ovarian puncture with follicle flushing was performed 35 hours later. Embryo transfer was performed on day 3 of cultivation. The luteal phase was supported by administration of 2500 IU of hCG on the day of transfer [22]. Serological pregnancy was tested for 16 days later and was positive if serum [beta]-hCG was more than 10 IU/mL. Clinical pregnancy was defined as a presence of gestational sac with positive fetal heartbeat detected at week 6 of pregnancy by transvaginal ultrasound. Live birth rate was defined as the birth of a child. 2.3. ICSI, Embryo Culture, and Embryo Transfer. Oocytes were fertilized with ICSI. Correct fertilization was confirmed 16-20 hours afterward when confirming presence of two pronuclei. After the ICSI, the oocytes were immediately transferred into a Primo Vision micro well group culture dish (Vitolife, Goteburg, Sweden) with a 60 [micro]L droplet with preequilibrated sequential medium. The media used for cultivation was ISM 1[TM] (Origio, Malov, Denmark). Cultivation was in the standard humidified incubator with 6% CO2 and 5% O2 atmosphere at 37[degrees]C. Embryos were transferred to the uterus three days after fertilization. 2.4. Time-Lapse Microscopy of Early Embryo Development. Embryos were monitored with Primo Vision[TM] time-lapse embryo monitoring system (Cryoinnovation, Vitrolife, Goteburg, Sweden), which is composed of a microscope unit that is inserted into a classic incubator. Photographs were generated every 5 minutes on 7 focal planes; illumination was green led light, duration 20-30 ms. The development of 53 embryos was analyzed. Embryo development was analyzed retrospectively by observation of the sequence of events that were described according to the proposed guidelines [23]. For each embryo, we described the time elapsed from insemination by ICSI to the extrusion of the second polar body (fPB2), the appearance of both pronuclei (fPNa), the disappearance of the pronuclei (fPNf), and the time period in which the pronuclei were visible (VP). Cell stages were described as the time from ICSI to the first frame in which the membranes of the two, three, or four blastomeres were completely separated ([t.sub.2],[t.sub.3],[t.sub.4]). We calculated the duration of the first cell cycle (ECC1 = [t.sub.2] - fPB2), the second embryo cell cycle (ECC2 = [t.sub.4] - [t.sub.2]), the synchronization of the cell divisions between the 2- and 4-cell stages (s2 = [t.sub.4] - [t.sub.2]), and duration of the first cytokinesis (dckl), which is the time from the first frame in which the cleavage furrow is visible to the time point at which cytokinesis is completed. Normal cleavage was defined on the basis of data from time-lapse microscopy as cleavage of the zygote to two blastomeres and subsequent cleavages of each blastomere to two blastomeres. We defined abnormal developmental patterns according to known data from the literature. The pregnancy rates for direct cleavage in more than two blastomeres are described by Athayde Wirka et al. [17], for reverse cleavage by Liu et al. [24]. The occurrence of irregularities in early embryo development is also described elsewhere [25]. Abnormal cleavage was defined as one or a combination of described types of cleavage irregularities (Figure 1). The first type was direct cleavage of one cell in more than two blastomeres, with the predominant type being direct division in three blastomeres of equal size in the first cell cycle. The second was chaotic cleavage with membrane ruffling, multiple cleavage furrows, division into unevenly sized blastomeres, and large proportion of fragments. The third was reverse cleavage described as blastomere fusion or failed cytokinesis. The fourth was arrested embryo development, defined as embryos that had significantly fewer blastomeres than expected and did not approximately double in number of cells every 24 hours. The expected number of blastomeres is 2-4 on day two of cultivation and 6-8 on day three of cultivation. Classic morphology was evaluated only once, at the time of the transfer of the embryo to the uterus. We used Istanbul consensus criteria for the cleavage-stage embryos [26]. Morphologically optimal embryos were those with stage-specific cell size (8-cell stage at 68 [+ or -] 1 hours after insemination), with less than 10% fragments and no multinucleation. The proportion of morphologically optimal embryos was calculated for each group of embryos (Table 2). On the basis of data from the time-lapse microscopy, we compared cycles with normally cleaved embryos and cycles with one or more cleavage irregularities. We compared timings of the events, positive hCG, ongoing pregnancies, and live birth rates between both groups. 2.5. Statistical Analysis. A statistical analysis was performed using Statistica software (StatSoft, Inc., Dell, Tulsa, USA). Proportion parameters were compared by using Fisher's exact test. Mean values of baseline patient characteristics were compared using the Mann-Whitney U test. The timing of the events was compared with Student's t-test. P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. 3. Results 3.1. Patients' Characteristics. In 46 patients, 53 cycles were included in the final analysis of morphokinetic parameters of transferred embryos. The mean age of patients in our study was 39.1 [+ or -] 3.0 years. Mean value for AMH was 0.35 [+ or -] 0.36. Mean body mass index was 22.9 [+ or -] 3,4. Mean number of previous treatment cycles was 2.85 [+ or -] 2.06, ranging from no previous cycle to 9 previous cycles, with both stimulated and natural cycles included. Indication for treatment was female infertility in 47.2% of cycles and combined male and female infertility in 52.8% of cycles. 3.2. Morphokinetic Parameters and Primary Outcomes. When analyzing morphokinetic parameters, a high incidence of abnormal events in embryo development was established. In 50.9% of cycles, the transferred embryos showed single or multiple cleavage irregularities described above. We compared patient characteristics and outcomes for the two groups of cycles, those with normally developing embryos and those where one or more cleavage irregularities occurred. Regarding the baseline characteristics, women were equally distributed between the two groups. Age, AMH values, body mass index, ratio of cycles with combined male infertility, and estradiol values were comparable. There was a statistically significant difference in the number of previous treatment cycles in that the number was higher in the group of cycles with normally developing embryos. In the group of normally developing embryos, the implantation rate was 30.8% and the delivery rate per cycle was 23.1%. None of the embryos in the group with one or multiple cleavage irregularities implanted and the difference was statistically significant. Comparison of the baseline characteristics and primary outcomes for the two groups is summarized in Table 1. The prevalence of abnormal cleavage patterns in embryo development is summarized in Table 2. 50.9% of the embryos had irregularities in early development (27/53). Among all monitored embryos, 30.2% (16/53) had single and 20.8% (11/53) had multiple irregularities detected in early development. In 34.0% of cycles, the classical morphology score at the time of transfer to the uterus was good quality embryo, while in 38.9% it was fair and in 27.1% poor, according to the Istanbul consensus scoring system. All except two of the embryos with a good quality score were from the group of normally developing embryos and all pregnancies derived from these embryos. Only two morphologically good quality embryos with single cleavage irregularity were observed, but they did not result in pregnancies. In the group of embryos with multiple irregularities, there were no good quality embryos. The prevalence of four different types of irregularities among 53 monitored embryos was analyzed, taking into account that several different abnormalities can be observed in one embryo. Altogether, 42 irregularities were observed: developmental arrest 16/53 (30.2%), direct cleavage in more than two blastomeres, predominantly in three blastomeres of equal size 13/53 (24,5%), chaotic cleavage 7/53 (13.2%), and reverse cleavage 6/53 (11.3%). Comparison of the timing of the events in the two groups is summarized in Table 3. No statistically significant differences were found in the time from ICSI to the extrusion of the second polar body, the time from ICSI to the appearance of the pronuclei, the time from ICSI to the fading of the pronuclei, the times from ICSI to the first frames in which 2-and 3-cell stage were observed, and the duration of the first cell cycle. Statistically significant differences were calculated for the time of the duration of the pronuclei, the duration of the first cytokinesis, the duration of the second cell cycle, and the synchronization of the cell division between the 3- and 4-cell stages. Embryos with cleavage irregularities showed statistically significantly longer duration of the pronuclei, longer duration of the first cytokinesis, longer second cell cycle, and less synchronized divisions. 4. Discussion Time-lapse technology in human IVF programs is mainly used as a tool for the selection of the most potent embryo for transfer to the uterus among a cohort of more available embryos in one stimulated cycle. There are many publications focused on finding new morphokinetic parameters with the highest predictive value for implantation [27, 28]. As morphologically optimal embryos are usually selected for transfer among the cohort, implantation and delivery rates are known for them. But it is less known how morphokinetic markers can predict the primary outcomes of a cycle with single embryo where embryo selection is not possible. In the case of poor responder patients, the criteria for what is still a suitable embryo for transfer are not defined yet. Our data show that a classic morphological score can reflect cleavage irregularities, but not in the case of direct cleavage in more than two blastomeres. Implanted embryos in this study cleaved normally and they all had good morphology scores at the time of transfer. Abnormal divisions did not always result in poor embryo morphology. Direct division in three cells, especially, resulted in the development of more blastomeres, and fragmentation is usually rare in this type of irregular division. None of the embryos with multiple cleavage abnormalities had good morphology scores. In 50.9% of all cycles, we transferred embryos with one of the major cleavage abnormalities detected with time-lapse microscopy, mainly in the first cell cycle. Early abnormal cleavage has a greater impact on embryo viability than any other irregularity that occurs later, because it affects a greater part of the embryo. The repairing mechanisms enable embryos to repair certain abnormalities. If an aberrant division occurs later, it can be compensated for, because the blastomeres are still pluripotent [29]. But if abnormalities happen early in development, in the first or second embryo cell cycle, these embryos have very little or no repairing potential [17]. In patients with poor ovarian response the cancellation of embryo transfer due to low quality of available embryos in our center is low, since they have difficulties accepting cancellation and we transfer all embryos, regardless of their quality. The implantation rates thus cannot be directly compared with normal responders, where we have the possibility for selection of the best embryo for embryo transfer. The reduced pregnancy rate in poor responder patients seems to be related to the frequent transfer of embryos with cleavage abnormalities that would normally be deselected if more embryos are available. We analyzed developmental abnormalities detected with the use of time-lapse microscopy in single embryo derived from oocytes obtained from natural cycles. With the conventional method of embryo morphology assessment once per day these abnormalities are usually overlooked. Data about implantation potential of embryos are mainly focused only on the influence of embryo stage and morphological score on the day of embryo transfer on clinical results [30, 31]. In our study, when transferring normally developing embryo, results are relatively good for this group of patients, with 30.8% implantation rate per embryo transferred and 23.1% delivery rate per cycle, regardless of the mean age of women. Moreover, the mean age of pregnant women in our study is 40.4 [+ or -] 1.2 years. The implantation and delivery rate in this group are somehow comparable with the general success rate of cycles with elective embryo transfer. Concerning natural cycle in poor responders, it is possible that stringency of the criteria around what to transfer can also contribute to the diversity of the primary outcome results in the literature. A relatively high incidence of abnormalities in early embryo development was found in this group of patients. The overall prevalence of embryos exhibiting one or more abnormal events was 50.9%. Comparing our data with the data from the literature is difficult since other studies focused on different abnormalities and irregular cleavage patterns than our study and different populations of patients were studied. In the study of Athayde Wirka et al., 54.2% of all embryos derived from stimulated cycles exhibited one or more atypical phenotypes, but theyalso studied other features such as abnormal syngamy and abnormal first cytokinesis [17]. Prevalence of abnormal divisions in embryos derived from immature oocytes in stimulated cycles was 72.1% [25]. It would be very interesting to find out how the quality of oocytes affects its cleavage pattern. There is a possible correlation between the stability and competence of genetic material and subsequent divisions. In early human embryogenesis, in the first few mitotic divisions, chromosome missegregation is very common [32]. Mitotic errors contribute significantly to the ratio of cleavage-stage embryo aneuploidy [33]. There is some evidence in the literature that structurally abnormal chromosomes can be one of the causes for disruption of the mitotic process [34]. But there are conflicting results of different studies about whether kinetic markers of embryo development can predict aneuploidy [35, 36]. The complexity of the matter of how aneuploidy and aberrant division patterns are intertwined is also investigated in the study of Chavez et al. [37], which stresses that embryo fragmentation might be a response to aneuploidy. It is interesting to observe that the same aberrant cleavage types as direct cleavage in three blastomeres of equal size are very frequent in triploid zygotes after conventional IVF. An extra pair of centrioles is not always the explanation for altered cleavage patterns in human tripronuclear embryos [38]. With implementation of time-lapse microscopy in IVF laboratories, along with recent advances in genetic research, we are gaining more and more knowledge and new perspectives on early human embryo development. We hope that future studies will give us more detailed information and it is certainly very important to shed light on the very frequent aberrant development of the early human embryo. Although timings of specific events in early embryo development seem very promising indicators of their potential to form blastocysts, implant, and result in pregnancy, there are many indications that these morphokinetic markers cannot be used universally. They depend on many factors that influence embryo development. Kirkegaard et al. demonstrated that up to 31% of variation in timing of the events in embryo development can be explained by the origin of the embryo, including the patient-related and treatment-related factors [39]. Because of these limitations, as well as the small study size, timing of the events was not the primary study focus, but, rather, the occurrence of the cleavage abnormalities was. Our study showed statistically significant differences in the duration of the pronuclei, the duration of the first cytokinesis, the duration of the second cell cycle, and the synchronization of the cell division between 3- and 4-cell stages for the two study groups compared. Time-lapse microscopy of embryo development in natural cycle in patients with POR gives us more data on embryo quality and implantation potential and consequently helps in counselling these patients about their chances to get pregnant. The population of poor responder patients is very heterogeneous [40]. It is therefore reasonable to expect that there are many different factors that influence their fertility and predicting success rates of the procedure. Knowledge of the factors that have an impact on embryo development and implantation potential is very important for counselling this group of patients. The process of how to present them with their chances for pregnancy and when to advise them to insist with stimulated cycle or switch to nonstimulated cycle or options such as donated oocytes or adoption is a delicate one. It can be hypothesized that morphologically normal embryos with documented good dynamic in development are able to produce pregnancy in fair percentage even in poor responder patients. This fact can be used as additional information for counselling poor responder patients about their expectations. Large studies of abnormalities on embryos from nonstimulated cycles detected by time-lapse microscopy and their prevalence among various group of patients, different protocols, and patients ages would be needed to confirm our observations. 5. Conclusions Abnormalities in early embryo development are frequent and the chances of transferring an embryo with no potential to implant are very high in the group of poor responder patients. Time-lapse microscopy of embryo development in poor responder patients successfully identified the group of embryos that had good potential to implant and those with irregular cleavage patterns that were very unlikely to implant. This data is very important for presenting these patients with their chances of success. http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2016/4286528 Competing Interests The authors declare that there is no conflict of interests regarding the publication of this paper.

In the third embryo cell cycle (ECC3), the 4-cell embryo duplicates all blastomeres and an 8-cell embryo can be observed on day 3 of cultivation.

(c) Chaotic cleavage in ECC1 with no bipolar cleavage furrow observed, membrane ruffling of the zygote, and extensive fragmentation during division in two or more cells. (d) Reverse cleavage: the reduction of the number of blastomeres of an embryo due to blastomere fusion. The process can be observed at any point of development, here presented as reverse cleavage of two blastomeres into one cell. (e) Arrested development: when embryos had fewer blastomeres than expected and did not approximately double the number of cells every 24 hours.

Here’s Exactly How to Find the Best Birth Control Pill for You Here’s Exactly How to Find the Best Birth Control Pill for You Thanks to the at your disposal, choosing the right can feel like you’re blindfolded and trying to pin the tail on the contraceptive donkey. Even if you narrow your focus to just the pill, you have a lot of possible choices out there. But if you do your homework—and are prepared to possibly engage in some trial and error—you can pinpoint the best birth control pill based on your needs. First things first, there are two main kinds of birth control pills: ones with estrogen and ones without. Birth control pills that contain a mixture of estrogen and progestin (combination pills) are the most common type out there. So, how do combination pills work to keep you pregnancy-free? During your typical , there’s a hormonal surge that triggers the release of an egg to potentially be fertilized, , M.D., a family planning expert and assistant professor in the department of family medicine within the department of obstetrics and gynecology at the University of Michigan, tells SELF. ""[Estrogen] overrides that normal hormonal surge, and because of that, there's no egg released,” says Dr. Wu, who is also a board chair member of the . Progestin does its part by thickening your cervical mucus to make it harder for sperm to move and thinning your uterine lining, which makes it less likely for any egg that does get fertilized to attach to it. Different brands of combination pills can differ in many ways, including how much estrogen and progestin they contain within each 28-pill pack and how often (if at all) those levels fluctuate throughout the month. There’s also the fact that many, but not all, combination pills have placebos at the end of the month to allow for a withdrawal bleed that simulates your . We’ll dive into why these distinctions might matter in more detail later, but for right now, just keep in mind that combination pills contain estrogen and progestin and all work in the same way across the board. Then there are , which are known as progestin-only pills (also called the minipill). These come in packs of 28 active pills (no placebos) and deliver a steady dose of progestin to thicken your cervical mucus and thin your uterine lining. If you still have enough uterine lining to shed, you may experience a withdrawal bleed (your period) at some point during the month. (It won’t necessarily come in the last week of the pack the way it would with combination pills, since you take these pills every day.) Research shows that birth control pills are over 99 percent effective at preventing pregnancy—if you use them perfectly. With perfect use (which means taking them consistently and correctly every single time), that the birth control pill has a failure rate of 0.3 percent. This indicates that fewer than one woman out of every 100 will get pregnant in the first year of taking birth control pills perfectly. When you incorporate human error (which researchers refer to as “typical use”), the failure rate for birth control pills is thought to be about 9 percent, according to the , meaning nine out of every 100 women getting pregnant in the first year of taking the pill this way. So, what constitutes typical use versus perfect use? Typical use could include taking a pill late or forgetting it completely. This depends somewhat on the type of pill you’re taking and how late you were on that missed dose. If you’re on a combined birth control pill, the instructions for what to do after a missed dose may vary from pill to pill, so check the prescribing information that came with your pill pack for details. With progestin-only pills, perfect use requires you to take the pill within the same three-hour window to be the most effective, according to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG). For context on where the pill falls on the pregnancy-protection spectrum, it’s more effective than (which carry a 2 and 18 percent failure rate with perfect and typical use, respectively), provides equivalent protection to the and patch when used typically and perfectly, and isn’t quite as excellent as the hormonal or implant (which both have a failure rate of less than 1 percent, even with typical use). The right birth control pill for you will depend on some personal factors, so let’s go over some pros and cons of each type. They're a little harder to mess up than progestin-only pills. Because combination pills use two hormones to prevent pregnancy (and at higher levels than in estrogen-free birth control pills), they're thought to be slightly more effective than the minipill, according to the . Because of this, you don’t have to take combined birth control pills at the exact same time every day for them to be effective, whereas you really need to be mindful of this when you’re taking progestin-only pills. Researchers aren’t sure of the exact disparity between efficacy rates here, but it’s still worth noting if you’re someone who can’t always take a pill within the same three-hour window. Combination birth control pills’ steadying of your normal estrogen fluctuations means you may experience fewer PMS symptoms like bloating and mood swings, according to the . You may experience and less painful cramps. This is thanks to combination pills’ progestin, which keeps your uterine lining thinner so there's less to shed during your period. Your period could even stop altogether. With less uterine lining, you may also produce fewer prostaglandins, which are hormone-like chemicals that make your uterus cramp, leading to period pain. These benefits can be especially useful for people who have conditions that make their periods hellishly painful, like . They can help clear up your skin if you have . By suppressing your ovulation, combination pills tamp down on the testosterone spikes that often accompany ovulation, Dr. Wu explains. Excessive testosterone production is , so curbing your levels can lead to clearer skin. They temporarily prevent you from ovulating, which could be a bonus for some people. Since the estrogen in combination pills suppresses ovulation, they can help if you’re prone to developing uncomfortable . Ovarian cysts can happen for two ovulation-related reasons: because an ovarian follicle that houses an egg keeps growing when it should instead break open to release said egg, or because the follicle collects fluid after ovulation and continues to grow when it shouldn’t, the explains. Sometimes the resulting cyst is completely harmless, but other times it can cause severe pain, particularly if or . The ovulation suppression aspect here can also be helpful if you’re prone to a kind of bizarre, painful phenomenon known as . It’s basically an abdominal aching or cramping sensation that can happen when a follicle containing an egg stretches your ovary as it grows in preparation for ovulation. It can also happen right as the follicle bursts to release the egg. You may be able to manipulate your period with certain formulations of combined birth control pills. It’s theoretically possible to by moving up when you take the placebo week of combination pills. Or you can entirely by skipping the placebo week and immediately starting a new pack of active pills. Using the pill this way means you’re not using it for its prescribed intent, so you should always talk with your doctor to make sure they’re on board with this before you try it. It can also make you more liable to experience . They may help reduce menstrual if used continuously under a doctor’s supervision. During your menstrual cycle, your levels of estrogen fluctuate. This can trigger menstruation-related in some people, the says. “By using the pill continuously and not having the withdrawal bleed, you can suppress those horrible headaches,"" Dr. Wu explains. Combination pills come with a reduced risk of endometrial, ovarian, and colorectal . Researchers are still working to understand the nuances of these connections, but it seems as though combination pills suppress rapid growth in endometrial cells, reduce your exposure to naturally occurring hormones tied with ovulation, and lower the amount of bile acids in your blood, according to the . These mechanisms are tied with lower risks of endometrial, ovarian, and colorectal cancers, respectively. To be clear, that’s not to say taking a combination pill means you have zero risk of getting these cancers, but that enough research has been done to show that the pill is associated with lowered incidences of these specific kinds of cancer. Your fertility should return pretty much immediately after , if that’s of interest to you. The estrogen in combination pills can cause some side effects. This can include things like achy breasts, the explains. Lowered libido is another possible complaint, since ovulation suppression cuts down on natural testosterone increases that might make you feel like having sex. It’s possible that these kinds of side effects will , so talk to your doctor about how likely it is that yours may stick around. You might just need a different formulation of the pill that has different amounts of estrogen. “Sometimes there's a lot of troubleshooting,” Raegan McDonald-Mosley, M.D., chief medical officer at , tells SELF. They don't provide any protection against STIs or HIV. For the record, this goes for all birth control methods except for internal and external . So, if you’re at risk of getting STIs (like if you’re having sex with more than one partner or don’t know your partner’s STI status), you’ll need to rely on something like a condom or dental dam to , whether or not you’re on the pill. You have to remember to take the pill every single day. If you’re aiming for perfect use (which you really should be, since that’s when you’re most protected against pregnancy), you’ll need to remember to take the pill every day. You can’t ""set it and forget it"" with the pill as you can with, say, an IUD. They're not recommended for people who are breastfeeding. If you’re breastfeeding, estrogen may affect your milk supply, according to , which is why combination pills aren’t advised until at least the fifth week post-delivery. They may actually cause or worsen migraines in some people. Kind of confusing, given that they may make migraines better for some lucky folks. For others, though, taking combination birth control pills is what actually brings about this aggressive head pain, the says. Also, there’s some evidence that taking hormonal contraception (especially those with higher amounts of estrogen) if you have migraines with aura (sensory changes that are typically , like seeing flashing lights or zigzags) may increase your risk of stroke. This is a really thorny area that isn’t set in stone, because this contraindication may be based on outdated advice. . Bottom line: If you have migraines (especially with aura), you need to be clear about that when discussing contraceptive options with your doctor. They may increase your risk cardiovascular issues like blood clots and stroke, particularly if you have certain risk factors. This is a complex potential drawback, because it sounds terrifying, but there’s a lot going on beneath the surface. First thing to know: The hormones in birth control pills increase the clotting factors in your blood. (This is , but researchers are still investigating if progestin can also have this effect when combined with certain kinds of estrogen.) If your blood clots up in a vein deep inside your legs, it’s called a . This kind of clot can dissolve on its own, but it can also be life-threatening if it breaks off, travels to your lungs, and blocks your airflow. Blood clots can also lead to . However, Dr. Wu points out: ""The risk [of a blood clot] in a woman who is otherwise healthy is incredibly low.” A 2015 study in that looked at over 50,000 women put the odds of getting a blood clot while not using hormonal birth control at about 0.04 percent, raising it to between 0.06 and 0.18 percent when on the pill, with variations depending on the specific kind of pill in question. That’s why this is mainly only a concern if you have additional blood clot risk factors like . ""It's also something that has to be put into perspective—the risk of a blood clot is higher when you're pregnant [than when you’re on the pill],"" says Dr. Wu. ""Preventing pregnancy in and of itself is lower risk."" You may not be a good candidate for combination pills if you have . This is especially the case if it’s poorly controlled, because the estrogen in them can further . Some evidence shows that the chances of developing breast and cervical cancers are increased in those who take combination pills. Similarly to the lowered risks of getting specific cancers on the pill, this isn’t to say that if you take the pill, you’re absolutely going to wind up with certain cancers—just that the scientific evidence shows the odds of developing and are higher in people who take the pill. This may be because the estrogen and progestin in the pill prompt the growth of some cancers, like those of the breast that respond to those hormones, according to the . When it comes to cervical cancer, the issue may be that birth control pills increase how vulnerable cervical cells are to infection with the strains of that lead to cervical cancer. However, after you stop the pill, any related increased risk of both of these cancers is thought to . They aren't recommended for people who have or have had breast cancer. This is because the hormones in them have the capacity to of cancers that are receptive to hormones. If you’ve decided on combination birth control pills, you’re still only about halfway there, because there are various formulations on the market. There are actually a ton of different birth control pills out there with estrogen and progestin. To help you narrow down your options, here are some questions you should consider: Do you want a monophasic, biphasic, triphasic, or quadriphasic pill? While these sound more like phases of the moon, they're really describing the different ways combination pills deliver their hormonal dosages. Monophasic pills offer the same amount of estrogen and progestin in every active pill. Biphasic pills contain two different, color-coded hormonal dosages throughout the month’s active pills. As you've probably already guessed, triphasic birth control pills contain three different amounts of active hormones in the pill pack. Quadriphasic pills deliver four different hormonal dosages. As a general rule, multiphasic pills are designed in part to mimic the rise and fall of estrogen and progesterone levels during a regular menstrual cycle, thereby potentially reducing birth control side effects. But various research attempts, such as a 2011 review in , haven’t found solid evidence of significant advantages to using multiphasic pills. Many experts recommend that people at the very least start their birth control pill journey with monophasic ones, since they’re simplest. Low-dose pills generally have per active tablet, although the lowest available option contains 10 micrograms of the stuff. Even the highest dose pills today aren’t as chock full of estrogen as they once were. ""A lot of women are asking for 'the low-dose pill,' and in reality, they're all low-dose because they've dropped the dose of estrogen significantly from what used it to be,” Dr. Wu points out. The first birth control pill, Enovid, hit the market in 1960 and contained . As such, it was associated much more closely with serious complications like cardiovascular issues. Even with the reduced doses of estrogen, low-dose pills provide the same pregnancy protection as other combination formulas. But that lower dose can change the side effects you experience. You may not have as much breast tenderness, for instance. And it by delivering a less dramatic drop in hormones during your placebo week. One major drawback, though, is that the lower levels of estrogen can make you more likely to have breakthrough bleeding. Do you want a conventional or extended cycle pill? Conventional pill packs typically come with 21 active and seven inactive pills, allowing for a withdrawal bleed at the end of the month. (Even though , you might like that bloody reassurance that you’re not pregnant.) Extended cycle pills typically come in packs of 84 active pills—taken back-to-back—and 7 inactive pills, the explains. These mega pill packs let you theoretically only have a period four times a year—possibly a major win for anyone who suffers from painful period-related conditions, like and menstrual migraines, or for those who just doesn't want to deal with having their period every month. But, much like low-dose pills, this kind of birth control can make you more liable to breakthrough bleeding. If you experience physical and emotional symptoms like bloating, breast tenderness, and mood swings that are hallmarks of premenstrual syndrome (PMS), combination pills may help ease that time of the month. Same goes if you have (PMDD), which is characterized by extreme moodiness, , , and other severe symptoms. Taking the active birth control pills back-to-back to skip your period (if approved by your doctor) gives you a steady supply of hormones that can reduce PMS and PMDD symptoms, according to the . But there are also oral contraceptives that contain a synthetic version of progesterone called drospirenone that are FDA-approved for the treatment of PMDD (such as and . It seems as though the drospirenone may reduce how susceptible you are to hormone fluctuations that lead to PMDD symptoms, and it also acts as a diuretic, which helps with bloating. Not sure if combination pills are right for you? Here's what you need to know about progestin-only pills (aka, the minipill): You may experience and less painful cramps. Just like with combination pills, the progestin in the minipill keeps your uterine lining thinner so there's less to shed during your period. Your period could even stop altogether. With less uterine lining, you may also produce fewer prostaglandins, which are hormone-like chemicals that make your uterus cramp, leading to period pain. These benefits can be especially useful for people who have conditions that make their periods hellishly painful, like . Unlike estrogen, progestin doesn’t seem to have the potential of messing with your milk supply if you’re breastfeeding, according to . As opposed to estrogen, , so the minipill can be a good option if you have hypertension. Your fertility should return pretty much immediately after you quit , if that's of interest to you. You can take them even if you can't (or don't want) to take estrogen. If for whatever reason the estrogen in combination birth control pills wasn't a good fit for you, the progestin-only pill may be a better choice. You need to take them within the same three-hour window every single day. With only progestin to lean on (and with of it than you’ll find in combination pills), you need to be incredibly consistent about taking the minipill around the same time every day, specifically within the same three-hour window. ""It's less forgiving than combined pills, so adherence is really important,"" Dr. Wu says. You may experience irregular bleeding or spotting. Due to the low level of hormones, you might experience irregular bleeding on the minipill, Dr. Wu says. This is especially true if you don’t take it precisely as you should, within that three-hour timeframe every day. You can’t mess around with the minipill to influence your . Screwing with when you take it in any way can boost your chances of unintended pregnancy, since adhering to the dosage schedule is so important. They don't provide any protection against STIs or HIV. As we mentioned, this goes for all birth control methods except for internal and external . So, if you’re at risk of getting STIs (like if you’re having sex with more than one partner or don’t know your partner’s STI status), you’ll need to rely on something like a condom or dental dam to , whether or not you’re on the pill. Since ovulation suppression isn’t guaranteed with progestin-only pills, you might still release eggs sometimes. If you’re susceptible to mittelschmerz (that ovulation pain) or ovarian cysts, the minipill won’t help the way a combined pill would. You won’t necessarily reap any of combination pills’ benefits that are related to estrogen. Such as clearer skin or reduced risk of certain cancers. Like combination pills, the minipill for people who have or have had breast cancer. This is because the progestin in them hormone-receptive cancers develop. If you do get pregnant while taking the minipill, you have a slightly higher risk of experiencing an ectopic pregnancy. An ectopic pregnancy is a nonviable pregnancy that occurs when the fertilized egg implants somewhere other than the uterus, usually in a fallopian tube, according to the . This risk is higher than with combination pills for a few possible reasons. It seems as though (small hair-like structures) in your fallopian tubes. If you do get pregnant, these cilia are supposed to transport the fertilized egg from your fallopian tube to the uterus, but if that doesn’t happen, it can try to implant in the tube instead. If progestin-only pills reliably suppressed ovulation the way combination pills did, this lowered cilia activity probably wouldn’t matter as much. But since they don’t—and since you don’t have much room for error when taking them—you’re more likely to get pregnant with the minipill, then have the fertilized egg latch on in the wrong place. Still not sure which pill is right for you? Here’s a checklist of important questions you should discuss with your doctor, which might help you narrow down your options. Based on the information above, you might already have an idea of which kind of pill you’re interested in trying. If not, go into your doctor’s appointment prepared with questions that can help you suss it out. Here’s some inspiration: I have [insert any that try to ruin your life here]. Which pill tends to work best for that? I’m interested in getting my period less often and/or controlling when it comes. What kind of pill do you recommend? Is there anything in my health history that indicates the pill (especially one with estrogen) may not be right for me? I’m worried about blood clots and/or stroke. Can we discuss if I have any risk factors that might be red flags? Is there any point in me taking multiphasic pills, or should I stick with monophasic ones? I really want to avoid [breakthrough bleeding/sore boobs/some other common birth control pill side effect here]. Which pill is least likely to cause this? Is there a certain kind of pill that may help my ? Or might the pill just make them worse? I have a family history of [insert a specific kind of cancer here]. What does that mean for my birth control options? Is there any reason low-dose pills might be better or worse for me? If you’re realizing the pill isn’t right for you, no worries—there are plenty of other contraceptive options from which you can choose. They range from that can hang out in your uterus for years to you swap out every three weeks and so much more. Talk with your ob/gyn to explore what’s available to you based on your health history and needs. ""Make sure you're aware of your options and are not limited by what your friends are taking, because you saw an ad, or the fact that you've only been issued a particular pill by your doctor,"" Dr. Wu says. After all, it’s called birth control because the end goal is to command your reproductive future with as much confidence as possible, whatever that looks like for you.

Murugappan, G., Li, S., Alvero, R. J., Eisenberg, M. L. View details for Consenting and ethical considerations in embryo cryopreservation. PURPOSE OF REVIEW: An emerging body of literature has elucidated the growing burden of surplus embryos left in storage without any clear disposition. An out dated consent process is a significant but easily remedied contributor to this problem. We propose a novel approach to consenting for disposition of surplus embryos.RECENT FINDINGS: Decisional conflicts that stem from the moral status of embryos and from evolving personal values contribute to surplus embryos being left in storage. Barriers to donation of embryos to research or to other patients also discourage embryo disposition decisions. A flawed informed consent process compromises the physician--provider relationship and complicates decision-making.SUMMARY: Centralizing the process of donating embryos to research and to patients would lower barriers to these disposition options. The informed consent protocol must be redesigned as a longitudinal, narrative process compatible with the evolving values and fertility outcomes of patients. Counselors should be integrated into all discussions regarding embryo disposition from the onset of fertility treatment through its conclusion to facilitate the decision-making process.

View details for Is intracytoplasmic sperm (ICSI) better than traditional in vitro fertilization (IVF): confirmation of higher blastocyst rates per oocyte using a split insemination design. Sauerbrun-Cutler, M., Huber, W. J., Has, P., Shen, C., Hackett, R., Alvero, R., Wang, S. PURPOSE: To explore the effects of traditional vs. intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) insemination method on the outcome of high-quality blastocyst development in a split sibling oocyte cohort.METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, we analyzed 62 ICSI/IVF split cycles. Sibling oocytes were randomly assigned to ICSI or IVF insemination. Two hundred thirty-four ICSI-only cycles and 152 IVF-only cycles were also analyzed for comparison. Blastocysts were graded by Gardner's embryo grading and were considered a high-quality blastocyst if 3BB or better (Gardner 1999).RESULTS: In the ICSI/IVF split group, (1) ICSI oocytes had a higher fertilization rate per oocyte allocated (73% vs 62%, p < 0.001), (2) more high-quality day 2 embryos (69% vs 55%, p < 0.005), (3) ICSI oocytes had a lower blastulation rate per 2PN (46% vs 54%, p < 0.05), but a higher blastulation rate when calculated per oocyte allocated (40% vs 32%, p < 0.05). The ICSI-only group had a lower fertilization rate (65% vs 70%, p < 0.001) but more high-quality day 2 embryos in comparison to the IVF-only group (68% vs 64%, p < .05). The total high-quality blastulation rate was higher for the IVF-only group per 2PN (49% vs 43%, p < 0.05) and per oocyte retrieved (34% vs 28%, p < 0.05).CONCLUSIONS: This distinctive IVF/ICSI sibling oocyte split design demonstrated a higher-quality blastulation rate in the IVF group compared to the ICSI group when calculated per 2PN, but not per oocyte allocated to each insemination procedure.

A., Santoro, N., Huang, H., Zhang, H., Eisenberg, E., Reproductive Medicine Network OBJECTIVE: To study the development of children conceived from non-IVF infertility treatments consisting of gonadotropins, clomiphene, or letrozole.DESIGN: Prospective cohort study.SETTING: U.S. academic health centers.PATIENT(S): Children of women with polycystic ovary syndrome who conceived with letrozole (LTZ) or clomiphene (CC) in the PPCOS II study or women with unexplained infertility (AMIGOS study) who conceived with LTZ, CC, or gonadotropin (GN).INTERVENTION(S): Longitudinal annual follow-up from birth to age3.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Scores from Ages and Stages Developmental Questionnaire (ASQ), MacArthur-Bates Communicative Development Inventory (MCDI), and annual growth.RESULT(S): One hundred eighty-five children from 160 families participated in at least one follow-up evaluation from the two infertility trials. Most multiple gestations in the follow-up study resulted from GN treatment (n = 14) followed by CC (n = 6) and LTZ (n = 3). There were no significant differences among the three groups at any time point with respect to abnormal scores on the ASQ. On the MCDI Words and Gestures, the LTZ group scored significantly higher than the GN group for most items (phrases, early gestures, later gestures, and total gestures). Children in the CC group scored significantly higher than the GN group for the later gestures and total gestures items.CONCLUSION(S): Differences in growth and cognitive developmental rates among children conceived with first-line infertility therapies, including LTZ, are relatively minor and likely due to differences in multiple pregnancy rates.

View details for Intrauterine insemination performance characteristics and post-processing total motile sperm count in relation to live birth for couples with unexplained infertility in a randomised, multicentre clinical trial. Hansen, K. R., Peck, J. D., Coward, R. M., Wild, R. A., Trussell, J. C., Krawetz, S. A., Diamond, M. P., Legro, R. S., Coutifaris, C., Alvero, R., Robinson, R. D., Casson, P., Christman, G. M., Santoro, N., Zhang, H., Medicine Network, F. T. Are intrauterine insemination (IUI) performance characteristics and post-processing total motile sperm count (TMC) related to live birth rate in couples with unexplained infertility?Patient discomfort with IUI and lower inseminate TMC were associated with a reduced live birth rate, while time from hCG injection to IUI, sperm preparation method and ultrasound guidance for IUI were not associated with live birth success.We previously determined that some baseline characteristics of couples with unexplained infertility, including female age, duration of infertility, history of prior loss and income, were related to live birth rate across a course of ovarian stimulation and IUI treatment. However, the relationship between treatment outcomes and per-cycle characteristics, including ultrasound guidance for IUI, timing of IUI relative to hCG injection, difficult or painful IUI and inseminate TMC, are controversial, and most prior investigations have not evaluated live birth outcome.This was a secondary analyses of 2462cycles from the Assessment of Multiple Intrauterine Gestations from Ovarian Stimulation (AMIGOS) clinical trial. This prospective, randomised, multicentre clinical trial determined live birth rates following IUI after ovarian stimulation with clomiphene citrate, letrozole or gonadotropins in 854 couples with unexplained infertility. It was conducted between 2011 and 2014, and couples could undergo up to four consecutive treatment cycles.AMIGOS was an NIH-sponsored Reproductive Medicine Network trial conducted at 12 clinical sites. Participants were women with unexplained infertility who were between 18 and 40years of age. Cluster-weighted generalised estimating equations (GEE), which account for informative clustering of multiple IUI treatment cycles within the same patient, were used to determine associations between IUI performance characteristics, including inseminate TMC, and live birth rate. Efficiency curves were also generated to examine the relationship between inseminate TMC and live birth rate.After adjustment for treatment group and baseline factors previously associated with live birth across a course of OS-IUI treatment, patient discomfort during the IUI procedure was associated with a reduction in live birth rate (aRR 0.40 (0.16-0.96)). Time from hCG trigger injection to IUI was not significantly associated with outcome. Higher TMC was associated with greater live birth rate (TMC 15.1-20.0 million (14.8%) compared to 5 million (5.5%)) (aRR 2.09 (1.31-3.33)). However, live births did occur with TMC1 million (5.1%).This investigation is a secondary analysis, and AMIGOS was not designed to address the present question. Since timed intercourse was allowed as part of the AMIGOS trial, we cannot rule out the possibility that any given pregnancy resulted from intercourse rather than IUI.Most factors associated with the performance of IUI were not significantly related to obtaining live birth. Our findings suggest that higher TMC inseminated leads to an increase in live birth rate up to TMC ~20 million. However, there may be no reasonable threshold below which live birth is not possible with IUI.Funding was received through grants from the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD): U10 HD077680, U10 HD39005, U10 HD38992, U10 HD27049, U10 HD38998, U10 HD055942, HD055944, U10 HD055936 and U10 HD055925.

Direct Methotrexate Injection into the Gestational Sac for Nontubal Ectopic Pregnancy: A Review of Efficacy and Outcomes from a Single Institution. Gilbert, S. B., Alvero, R. J., Roth, L., Polotsky, A. J. To evaluate the efficacy of nontubal ectopic pregnancy (NTEP) management with direct methotrexate (MTX) injection into the gestational sac.A retrospective chart review.A tertiary academic and teaching hospital.All cases of confirmed NTEP were retrospectively identified from 2012 to 2017.Ultrasound-guided direct injection of MTX into the fetal pole and surrounding gestational sac and a single dose of systemic MTX with or without fetal intracardiac injection of potassium chloride.Treatment failure, complications from treatment, operating time, and days to negative serum human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) after treatment were measured. Fourteen women (age 34 5.2 years) with NTEP underwent direct MTX injection (cesarean scar, n=4; interstitial, n=6; cervical, n=4). The mean estimated gestational age was 49 11, CI (43, 56 days). One patient required laparoscopic intervention with a failure rate of 1 of 14 (a double interstitial, heterotopic pregnancy). There were no other major complications. The time in the operating room was similar for all NTEP types. The average time to negative serum hCG was not different for cesarean scar (84.5 36 days), cervical pregnancies (70.5 19 days), or interstitial pregnancies (45.3 38 days, p=.15).Direct MTX injection into the gestational sac for NTEP treatment is safe and effective. The failure rate of 7% is considerably lower than what was previously reported for a failure of systemic MTX in similar cases (25%). Resolution of serum hCG after treatment can be quite prolonged even in uncomplicated cases. Androgenicity and fertility treatment in women with unexplained infertility. Wang, E. T., Diamond, M.

To determine whether biochemical or clinical markers of androgenic activity predict live birth rate with ovarian stimulation in the unexplained infertility population.Secondary analysis of the Assessment of Multiple Intrauterine Gestations from Ovarian Stimulation (AMIGOS) clinical trial.Multicenter university-based clinical practices.Nine hundred couples with unexplained infertility were included. Women were 18-40 years old with regular menses, a normal uterine cavity, at least one patent fallopian tube, and a male partner with 5 million motile sperm. Women were randomized to receive gonadotropin, clomiphene, or letrozole with IUI for four or fewer four treatment cycles. Women were evaluated for biochemical (total testosterone, DHEAS, and free androgen index) and clinical markers of androgenic activity (sebum, acne, and hirsutism). Multivariable logistic regression models adjusting for treatment group, maternal age, and body mass index were performed.None.The primary outcome was live birth. Secondary outcomes included conception, clinical pregnancy, and pregnancy loss.When comparing 900 women in the AMIGOS trial based on quartiles of serum TT, women were of younger age, higher body mass index, and higher waist circumference with increasing TT. Increasing quartiles of TT also showed increasing DHEAS and free androgen index values. Serum androgens were not associated with outcomes of live birth, conception, clinical pregnancy, or pregnancy loss. Clinical androgen markers were not associated with pregnancy outcomes.In a randomized cohort of women with unexplained infertility, biochemical and clinical measures of androgens did not predict live birth rate after ovarian stimulation treatment.NCT01044862. View details for Short- and long-term impact of gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogue treatment on bone loss and fracture. Gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogues (GnRH-a) are commonly utilized in moderate to severe endometriosis to induce atrophy of endometriotic lesions. Unfortunately, cessation of therapy can lead to recurrence of symptoms. Therefore, long term therapy is sometimes necessary. GnRH analogues cause an immediate decrease in bone mineral density which usually recovers after cessation of its use. However, this recovery in bone mineral density may not always occur after long term use. In order to prevent the deleterious effects on bone, add-back therapy is used frequently. This review will explore the impact of GnRH analogues on both bone loss and fracture risk as well as describe different add-back regimens.

A., Zhang, H., Santoro, N., Reproductive Med Network We sought to determine whether lower fertility related quality of life or depression in men of couples with unexplained infertility is associated with low total testosterone levels, abnormal semen quality or erectile dysfunction.This study is a secondary analysis of a large, multicenter, randomized controlled trial in couples with unexplained infertility. Male partners underwent baseline semen analysis with measurement of fasting total testosterone and gonadotropin. They also completed surveys, including the FertiQOL (Fertility Quality of Life), the PHQ-9 (Patient Health Questionnaire-9) and the IIEF (International Index of Erectile Function). The primary study outcomes were total testosterone with low total testosterone defined as less than 264 ng/dl, semen parameters and the IIEF score. We performed multivariable logistic regression analyses adjusted for patient age, race, body mass index, education, smoking, alcohol use, infertility duration and comorbidity.A total of 708 men with a mean SD age of 34.2 5.6 were included in study. Of the men 59 (8.3%) had a PHQ-9 score of 5 or greater, which was consistent with depression, 99 (14.0%) had low total testosterone and 63 (9.0%) had mild or worse erectile dysfunction. Neither the FertiQOL score nor depression was associated with total testosterone or any semen parameter. The FertiQOL score was inversely associated with erectile dysfunction (for every 5-point score decline AOR 1.30, 95% CI 1.16-1.46). Depressed men were significantly more likely to have erectile dysfunction than nondepressed men (AOR 6.31, 95% CI 3.12-12.77).In men in couples with unexplained infertility lower fertility related quality of life and depression are strongly associated with erectile dysfunction. However, neither is associated with spermatogenesis or testosterone levels. Erectile dysfunction in infertile men merits longitudinal investigation in future studies.

Journal of transcultural nursing : official journal of the Transcultural Nursing Society Carron, R., Kooienga, S., Gilman-Kehrer, E., Alvero, R. Introduction: Knowledge is needed about the cultural experiences, patterns, and practices of American Indian women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), so nurses can provide culturally congruent care. Method: A qualitative, ethnonursing study based on Leininger's theory of culture care diversity and universality. Data were collected from 13 key informants living on a reservation in the Western United States. Data were analyzed with Leininger's four phases of qualitative analysis. Results: Three universal themes were identified: (1) control of PCOS symptoms is important for the cultural well-being of tribal women, (2) culturally congruent PCOS education and health care are important with variations in approaches to treatment, and (3) tribal culture is important with variations in use of tribal practices. Discussion: Tribal culture affects the health care beliefs and practices of American Indian women with PCOS. The findings can be used to improve culturally congruent care for women with this chronic condition. 3-D Ultrasound is Accurate for Follicular Monitoring But Does Not Reduce Time to Perform Sauerbrun, M., Ghidei, L., Huber, W.

Carron, R., Kooienga, S., Gilman-Kehrer, E., Alvero, R., Boyle, D. K. Developing a nursing research project with American Indian tribes and navigating the institutional review board approval process can appear daunting to investigators because of tribal research requirements in addition to academic requirements. Nurse investigators conducted a research project exploring experiences of American Indian women with polycystic ovary syndrome. After successful implementation of the project, a model emerged to guide researchers working with tribal communities through project development and the institutional review board process. The model is based on the American Indian medicine wheel with each quadrant aligned with a season of the year: spring, summer, fall, and winter. The seasonal approach divides project development into sections that can be developed independently or simultaneously. The model emphasizes collaborative relationships between the research team and tribe. Researchers can adapt and customize the model for their projects based on their objectives and targeted populations. The purpose of this article is to describe the medicine wheel model and, as an exemplar, demonstrate application of the model in a project involving American Indian women with polycystic ovary syndrome. Additionally, potential implications of the model for nursing research, education, and practice are presented.

To compare saline infusion sonohysterography (SIS) versus hysterosalpingogram (HSG) for confirmation of tubal patency.Secondary analysis of a randomized controlled trial, Pregnancy in Polycystic Ovary Syndrome II (PPCOS II). Seven hundred fifty infertile women (18-40years old) with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) were randomized to up to 5cycles of letrozole or clomiphene citrate. Prior to enrollment, tubal patency was determined by HSG, the presence of free fluid in the pelvis on SIS, laparoscopy, or recent intrauterine pregnancy. Logistic regression was conducted in patients who ovulated with clinical pregnancy as the outcome and HSG or SIS as the key independent variable.Among women who ovulated, 414 (66.9%) had tubal patency confirmed by SIS and 187 (30.2%) had at least one tube patent on HSG. Multivariable analysis indicated that choice of HSG versus SIS did not have a significant relationship on likelihood of clinical pregnancy, after adjustment for treatment arm, BMI, duration of infertility, smoking, and education (OR 1.14, 95% CI 0.77, 1.67, P=0.52). Ectopic pregnancy occurred more often in women who had tubal patency confirmed by HSG compared to SIS (2.8% versus 0.6%, P=0.02).In this large cohort of women with PCOS, there was no significant difference in clinical pregnancy rate between women who had tubal patency confirmed by HSG versus SIS. SIS is an acceptable imaging modality for assessment of tubal patency in this population. View details for Gestational Weight Gain in Women With Polycystic Ovary Syndrome: A Controlled Study.

S., Reproductive Medicine Network Context: Women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) have increased risk for pregnancy complications, possibly related to pre-existing obesity and excessive gestational weight gain (GWG).Objectives: To assess the contributions of diagnosis and preconception weight on GWG and perinatal outcomes.Research Design and Methods: Prospective cohort study of singleton pregnancies in PCOS (n = 164) and ovulatory controls (n = 176) from infertility treatment.Main Outcome Measures: GWG, birthweight, pregnancy complications.Results: From preconception baseline, normal-weight women with PCOS gained 2.3 pounds more during the first trimester (95% CI, 0.3 to 4.3; P = 0.02), and by the end of the second trimester, 4.2 pounds more than controls (95% CI, 0.7 to 7.7; P = 0.02). Women who were overweight with PCOS gained significantly more weight than did controls by the end of the second trimester (5.2 pounds; 95% CI, 0.2 to 10.2; P = 0.04), whereas women with obesity and PCOS and control women had similar weight gain throughout pregnancy. Within normal-weight, overweight, and obese groups, prevalence of pre-eclampsia and gestational diabetes did not differ between the PCOS and control groups, nor was there a difference in birthweight. Preconception body mass index (BMI) was significantly associated with GWG; for every 1-kg/m2 increase in preconception BMI, GWG decreased by 0.62 pounds (95% CI, -0.85 to -0.40; P < 0.001).Conclusions: Women with PCOS who are of normal weight or are overweight before conception experience more GWG than do ovulatory controls. Within normal-weight, overweight, and obese groups, rates of perinatal complications do not significantly differ between women with PCOS and controls. Preconception BMI is the strongest predictor of GWG. Gestational Weight Gain in Women With Polycystic Ovary Syndrome: A Controlled Study Kent, J., Dodson, W.

Barrett, E. S., Vitek, W., Mbowe, O., Thurston, S. W., Legro, R. S., Alvero, R., Baker, V., Bates, G. W., Casson, P., Coutifaris, C., Eisenberg, E., Hansen, K., Krawetz, S., Robinson, R., Rosen, M., Usadi, R., Zhang, H., Santoro, N., Diamond, M. STUDY QUESTION: Among infertile women undergoing ovarian stimulation, is allostatic load (AL), a measure of chronic physiological stress, associated with subsequent fertility and pregnancy outcomes?SUMMARY ANSWER: AL at baseline was not associated with conception, spontaneous abortion or live birth, however, it was significantly associated with increased odds of pre-eclampsia and preterm birth among women who had a live birth in the study.WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Several studies have linked AL during pregnancy to adverse outcomes including preterm birth and pre-eclampsia, hypothesizing that it may contribute to well-documented disparities in pregnancy and birth outcomes. However, AL biomarkers change over the course of pregnancy, raising questions as to whether gestational AL assessment is a valid measure of cumulative physiologic stress starting long before pregnancy. To better understand how AL may impact reproductive outcomes, AL measurement in the non-pregnant state (i.e. prior to conception) is needed.STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: A secondary data analysis based on data from 836 women who participated in Assessment of Multiple Intrauterine Gestations from Ovarian Stimulation (AMIGOS), a multi-center, randomized clinical trial of ovarian stimulation conducted from 2011 to 2014.PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: Ovulatory women with unexplained infertility (ages 18-40) were enrolled and at baseline, biological and anthropometric measures were collected. AL scores were calculated as a composite of the following baseline variables determined a priori: BMI, waist-to-hip ratio, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, C-reactive protein and HOMA score. Participants received ovarian stimulation for up to four cycles and if they conceived, were followed throughout pregnancy. We fit multi-variable logistic regression models examining AL (one-tailed and two-tailed) in relation to the following reproductive outcomes: conception, spontaneous abortion, live birth, pre-eclampsia, preterm birth and low birthweight.MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: Adjusting for covariates, a unit increase in two-tailed AL score was associated with 62% increased odds of pre-eclampsia (OR: 1.62, 95% CI: 1.14, 2.38) 44% increased odds of preterm birth (OR: 1.44, 95% CI: 1.02, 2.08), and 39% increased odds of low birthweight (OR: 1.39, 95% CI: 0.99, 1.97). The relationship between AL and preterm birth was mediated by pre-eclampsia (P = 0.0003). In one-tailed AL analyses, associations were similar, but slightly attenuated. AL was not associated with fertility outcomes (conception, spontaneous abortion, live birth).LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: Results may not be generalizable to fertile women who conceive naturally or women with other types of infertility. Comparisons to previous, related work are difficult because variables included in AL composite measures vary across studies. AL may be indicative of overall poor health, rather than being specific to chronic physiological stress.WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: Our results suggest that chronic physiological stress may not impact success of ovarian stimulation, however, they confirm and extend previous work suggesting that AL is associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes. Physiological dysregulation due to chronic stress has been proposed as a possible mechanism underlying disparities in birth outcomes, which are currently poorly understood. Assessing biomarkers of physiological dysregulation pre-conception or in early pregnancy, may help to identify women at risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes, particularly pre-eclampsia.STUDY FUNDING/COMPETING INTEREST(S): Support for AMIGOS was provided by: U10 HD39005, U10 HD38992, U10 HD27049, U10 HD38998, U10 HD055942, HD055944, U10 HD055936 and U10HD055925.

View details for Discordant anti-mullerian hormone (AMH) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) among women undergoing in vitro fertilization (IVF): which one is the better predictor for live birth? Wang, S., Zhang, Y., Mensah, V., Huber, W. J., Huang, Y., Alvero, R. This study sought to clarify the roles of Anti-mllerian hormone (AMH) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) in predicting live birth, especially in patients with discordant AMH and FSH. A large IVF data set provided by eIVF, consisting of 13,964cycles with AMH, FSH, age, BMI, and birth outcomes were evaluated. Patients were categorized into four groups: Good prognosis group (AMH 1ng/ml; FSH<10 mIU/ml), Poor prognosis group (AMH <1ng/ml; FSH 10 mIU/ml), Reassuring AMH group (AMH 1ng/ml; FSH 10 mIU/ml), and Reassuring FSH group (AMH <1ng/ml; FSH<10 mIU/ml). The interaction between AMH, FSH, and their impact on live birth rate among these four groups was evaluated using Generalized Additive Mixed Modeling (GAMM).Analysis revealed a nonlinear relationship of AMH and FSH with live birth rate among all ages. Among the four groups, the good prognosis group had the highest live birth rate while the poor prognosis group had the lowest live birth rate (29.3% vs 13.1%, p<0.005). In the discordant groups, the live birth rate of the reassuring AMH group was significantly higher than the reassuring FSH group (22.8% vs 15.6%, p<0.005).Although both FSH and AMH are widely use to assess the ovarian reserve in women undergoing evaluation for infertility, AMH appears to be superior to FSH among all age groups. This is particularly important for patients with discordant AMH and FSH where reassuring AMH is a better clinical predictor of cycle success.

A., NICHD Reproductive Med Network Adequate luteal phase progesterone exposure is necessary to induce endometrial changes required for a successful pregnancy outcome. The relationship between low midluteal progesterone concentration and the outcome of live birth in ovarian stimulation with intrauterine insemination (OS-IUI) treatments is not defined.To determine the level of midluteal progesterone portending a low chance of live birth after OS-IUI in couples with unexplained infertility.Secondary analyses of data from a prospective, randomized, multicenter clinical trial that determined pregnancy outcomes following OS-IUI with clomiphene citrate, letrozole, or gonadotropins for couples with unexplained infertility.Couples (n = 900) underwent 2376 OS-IUI cycles during the Assessment of Multiple Intrauterine Gestations from Ovarian Stimulation clinical trial.Live birth as it relates to midluteal progesterone level and thresholds below which no live births occur by treatment group.Thresholds for non-live birth cycles were similar for clomiphene (14.4 ng/mL) and letrozole (13.1 ng/mL) yet were lower for gonadotropin (4.3 ng/mL) treatments. A midluteal progesterone level >10th percentile specific for each treatment group independently was associated with greater odds for a live birth in all OS-IUI cycles (adjusted OR: 2.17; 95% CI: 1.05, 4.48).During OS-IUI, a low midluteal progesterone level was associated with a low probability of live birth. Thresholds differed by medication, with the lowest threshold for gonadotropin. Several pathophysiologic mechanisms may account for low progesterone levels. Refinement of the predictive range associated with particular ovarian stimulation medications during treatment of unexplained infertility may improve accuracy.

C., Santoro, N., Eisenberg, E., Zhang, H. While female sexual dysfunction is a frequent occurrence, characteristics in infertile women are not well delineated. Furthermore, the impact of infertility etiology on the characteristics in women with differing androgen levels observed in women with polycystic ovary syndrome and unexplained infertility has not been assessed.The objective of the study was to determine the characteristics of sexual dysfunction in women with polycystic ovary syndrome and unexplained infertility.A secondary data analysis was performed on 2 of Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development Cooperative Reproductive Medicine Networks clinical trials: Pregnancy in Polycystic Ovary Syndrome Study II and Assessment of Multiple Intrauterine Gestations From Ovarian Stimulation. Both protocols assessed female sexual function using the Female Sexual Function Inventory and the Female Sexual Distress Scale.Women with polycystic ovary syndrome had higher weight and body mass index than women with unexplained infertility (each P<.001), greater phenotypic (Ferriman-Gallwey hirsutism score, sebum score, and acne score; each P < .001), and hormonal (testosterone, free testosterone, and dehydroepiandrosterone; each P < .001) evidence of androgen excess. Sexual function scores, as assessed by the Female Sexual Function Inventory, were nearly identical. The Female Sexual Distress Scale total score was higher in women with polycystic ovary syndrome. The mean Female Sexual Function Inventory total score increased slightly as the free androgen index increased, mainly as a result of the desire subscore. This association was more pronounced in the women with unexplained infertility.Reproductive-age women with infertility associated with polycystic ovary syndrome and unexplained infertility, despite phenotypic and biochemical differences in androgenic manifestations, do not manifest clinically significant differences in sexual function.

Women with fibroids were older, more likely to be African American, had a greater uterine volume, lower serum antimllerian hormone levels, and fewer antral follicles than women without fibroids. In conception cycles, clinical pregnancy rates were significantly lower in participants with fibroids than in those without uterine fibroids. Pregnancy loss before 12weeks was more likely in African American women with fibroids compared with non-African American women with fibroids. There was no difference in conception and live birth rates in subjects with and without fibroids.No differences were observed in conception and live birth rates in women with non-cavity-distorting fibroids and those without fibroids. These findings provide reassurance that pregnancy success is not impacted in couples with non-cavity-distorting fibroids undergoing OS-IUI for unexplained infertility.NCT01044862.

C., Craig, L. B., Gracia, C., Huang, H., Alvero, R., Casson, P., Christman, G., Coutifaris, C., Diamond, M., Jin, S., Legro, R. S., Robinson, R. D., Schlaff, W. D., Zhang, H., Reprod Med Network Investigators Does fertility-related quality of life (FertiQOL) differ by infertility diagnosis between women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and their partners, compared with couples with unexplained infertility (UI)?Women with PCOS report lower QOL than those with UI, whereas males with UI report lower QOL than males with PCOS partners.The fertility-specific QOL survey, FertiQOL, has been used to examine fertility-related QOL in a number of worldwide cohorts. Few data have addressed fertility-related QOL as a function of infertility diagnosis. Overall, men report better QOL than women with infertility, and there is variation in FertiQOL scores across different samples from different countries.This was a prospective, cohort study derived from two concurrent, randomized clinical trials, and designed to examine QOL in infertile females with PCOS and UI at the time of enrollment compared with each other and their male partners; to compare concordance FertiQOL scores in this study across other worldwide cohorts; and to determine if baseline FertiQOL was associated with pregnancy outcome.Women with PCOS and their partners (n = 733 and n = 641, respectively), and couples with UI (n = 865 women and 849 men) completed a validated fertility-specific QOL survey (FertiQOL) at the time of the study screening visit. PCOS women were randomized to either clomiphene citrate or letrozole treatment; couples with UI were randomized to clomiphene citrate, letrozole or gonadotrophin plus IUI. FertiQOL results were compiled by diagnosis (PCOS or UI) and compared by diagnosis and sex using Wilcoxon Rank-Sum testing. Relationships between baseline FertiQOL and pregnancy outcomes were examined using logistic regression. Multivariable models were performed to assess the association between FertiQOL scores and key participant characteristics.Women with PCOS had lower total FertiQOL scores (72.3 14.8) than those with UI (77.1 12.8; P < 0.001); this was true for each domain (except Relational). These differences were largely explained by variation in BMI, hirsutism, household income and age. Women had lower overall FertiQOL scores than their male partners. Males with PCOS partners had higher scores than males with UI (84.9 10.2 versus 83.3 10.8; P = 0.003). Scores were not consistently associated with conception or pregnancy outcome.The use of multiple tests of association may have resulted in spurious statistically significant findings. Inherent sociodemographic differences between women with PCOS and those with UI largely account for the lower QOL in women with PCOS. Our study was unable to assess if changes in QOL affected pregnancy outcome as FertiQOL data were collected prior to treatment. Finally, the participants for both studies represent their local communities, but are not a population-based sample and thus firm conclusions about how representative these couples are to the general population must be made with caution.Women with PCOS with elevated BMI and hirsutism scores and with lower socioeconomic status may require more, targeted psychosocial support than those with other diagnoses. Possible attribution of infertility to the male partner appears to result in a lower QOL. There appears to be substantial national variation in FertiQOL scores, with US-based cohorts reporting overall higher QOL.This work was supported by National Institutes of Health (NIH)/Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) Grants U10 HD39005 (to M.D.), U10 HD38992 (to R.S.L.), (to C.C.), U10 HD38998 (to R.A.), U10 HD055942 (to R.D.R.), HD055944 (to P.C.), U10 HD055936 (to G.C.), U10HD055925 (to H.Z.); and U10 U54-HD29834 (to the University of Virginia Center for Research in Reproduction Ligand Assay and Analysis Core of the Specialized Cooperative Centers Program in Reproduction and Infertility Research).

Other baseline demographic and lifestyle characteristics including smoking, alcohol use, and serum levels of antimllerian hormone were not significantly associated with pregnancy outcomes.While age and duration of infertility were significant predictors of all pregnancy outcomes, many other baseline characteristics were not. The identification of level of income as a significant predictor of outcomes independent of race and education mayreflect differences in the underlying etiologies of unexplained infertility or could reveal disparities in access to fertility and/or obstetrical care.NCT01044862. View details for View details for Considerations for management of interstitial ectopic pregnancies: two case reports. BACKGROUND: Conventional treatment of interstitial pregnancies includes systemic methotrexate, direct methotrexate injection, wedge resection, or hysterectomy. We present two cases of interstitial pregnancies that were successfully managed by different minimally invasive surgical techniques. We also report the novel use of hysteroscopic urologic stone retrieval forceps in the transvaginal removal of persistent products of conception after systemic methotrexate for an interstitial pregnancy.CASE PRESENTATION: Case 1 was a 28-year-old gravida 1 white woman at 8 weeks gestation; she was diagnosed with a left interstitial pregnancy. After laparoscopic confirmation of the interstitial pregnancy, successful ultrasound-guided suction dilation and curettage was performed. Case 2 was a 33-year-old gravida 3 para 1021 (one term pregnancy, no preterm pregnancies, one ectopic pregnancy and one spontaneous miscarriage, and one living child) Hispanic woman with persistent products of conception after systemic methotrexate for a left interstitial pregnancy. She underwent hysteroscopic-guided removal of the persistent products of conception, which was possible due to novel use of urologic stone retrieval forceps.CONCLUSIONS: Successful minimally invasive treatment of interstitial pregnancies may be possible in certain cases. Collaboration between different specialties continues to be important for improving minimally invasive options. Recruitment strategies in two reproductive medicine network infertility trials Usadi, R. S., Diamond, M. P., Legro, R. S., Schlaff, W. D., Hansen, K. R., Casson, P., Christman, G., Bates, G. W., Baker, V., Seungdamrong, A., Rosen, M. P., Lucidi, S., Thomas, T., Huang, H., Santoro, N., Eisenberg, E., Zhang, H., Alvero, R. Recruitment of individuals into clinical trials is a critical step in completing studies. Reports examining the effectiveness of different recruitment strategies, and specifically in infertile couples, are limited.We investigated recruitment methods used in two NIH sponsored trials, Pregnancy in Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PPCOS II) and Assessment of Multiple Intrauterine Gestations from Ovarian Stimulation (AMIGOS), and examined which strategies yielded the greatest number of participants completing the trials.3683 couples were eligible for screening. 1650 participants were randomized and 1339 completed the trials. 750 women were randomized in PPCOS II; 212 of the participants who completed the trial were referred by physicians. Participants recruited from radio ads (84/750) and the internet (81/750) resulted in similar rates of trial completion in PPCOS II. 900 participants were randomized in AMIGOS. 440 participants who completed the trial were referred to the study by physicians. The next most successful method in AMIGOS was the use of the internet, achieving 78 completed participants. Radio ads proved the most successful strategy in both trials for participants who earned <$50,000 annually. Radio ads were most successful in enrolling white patients in PPCOS II and black patients in AMIGOS.

C., Ohl, D., Jin, Y., Santoro, N., Eisenberg, E., Zhang, H. The standard therapy for women with unexplained infertility is gonadotropin or clomiphene citrate. Ovarian stimulation with letrozole has been proposed to reduce multiple gestations while maintaining live birth rates.We enrolled couples with unexplained infertility in a multicenter, randomized trial. Ovulatory women 18 to 40 years of age with at least one patent fallopian tube were randomly assigned to ovarian stimulation (up to four cycles) with gonadotropin (301 women), clomiphene (300), or letrozole (299). The primary outcome was the rate of multiple gestations among women with clinical pregnancies.After treatment with gonadotropin, clomiphene, or letrozole, clinical pregnancies occurred in 35.5%, 28.3%, and 22.4% of cycles, and live birth in 32.2%, 23.3%, and 18.7%, respectively; pregnancy rates with letrozole were significantly lower than the rates with standard therapy (gonadotropin or clomiphene) (P=0.003) or gonadotropin alone (P<0.001) but not with clomiphene alone (P=0.10). Among ongoing pregnancies with fetal heart activity, the multiple gestation rate with letrozole (9 of 67 pregnancies, 13%) did not differ significantly from the rate with gonadotropin or clomiphene (42 of 192, 22%; P=0.15) or clomiphene alone (8 of 85, 9%; P=0.44) but was lower than the rate with gonadotropin alone (34 of 107, 32%; P=0.006). All multiple gestations in the clomiphene and letrozole groups were twins, whereas gonadotropin treatment resulted in 24 twin and 10 triplet gestations. There were no significant differences among groups in the frequencies of congenital anomalies or major fetal and neonatal complications.In women with unexplained infertility, ovarian stimulation with letrozole resulted in a significantly lower frequency of multiple gestation but also a lower frequency of live birth, as compared with gonadotropin but not as compared with clomiphene.

Identification and replication of prediction models for ovulation, pregnancy and live birth in infertile women with polycystic ovary syndrome. Kuang, H., Jin, S., Hansen, K. R., Diamond, M. P., Coutifaris, C., Casson, P., Christman, G., Alvero, R., Huang, H., Bates, G. W., Usadi, R., Lucidi, S., Baker, V., Santoro, N., Eisenberg, E., Legro, R. S., Zhang, H. Can we build and validate predictive models for ovulation and pregnancy outcomes in infertile women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)?We were able to develop and validate a predictive model for pregnancy outcomes in women with PCOS using simple clinical and biochemical criteria particularly duration of attempting conception, which was the most consistent predictor among all considered factors for pregnancy outcomes.Predictive models for ovulation and pregnancy outcomes in infertile women with polycystic ovary syndrome have been reported, but such models require validation.This is a secondary analysis of the data from the Pregnancy in Polycystic Ovary Syndrome I and II (PPCOS-I and -II) trials. Both trials were double-blind, randomized clinical trials that included 626 and 750 infertile women with PCOS, respectively. PPCOS-I participants were randomized to either clomiphene citrate (CC), metformin, or their combination, and PPCOS-II participants to either letrozole or CC for up to five treatment cycles.Linear logistic regression models were fitted using treatment, BMI, and other published variables as predictors of ovulation, conception, clinical pregnancy, and live birth as the outcome one at a time. We first evaluated previously reported significant predictors, and then constructed new prediction models. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were constructed and the area under the curves (AUCs) was calculated to compare performance using different models and data. Chi-square tests were used to examine the goodness-of-fit and prediction power of logistic regression model.Predictive factors were similar between PPCOS-I and II, but the two participant samples differed statistically significantly but the differences were clinically minor on key baseline characteristics and hormone levels. Women in PPCOS-II had an overall more severe PCOS phenotype than women in PPCOS-I. The clinically minor but statistically significant differences may be due to the large sample sizes. Younger age, lower baseline free androgen index and insulin, shorter duration of attempting conception, and higher baseline sex hormone-binding globulin significantly predicted at least one pregnancy outcome. The ROC curves (with AUCs of 0.66-0.76) and calibration plots and chi-square tests indicated stable predictive power of the identified variables (P-values 0.07 for all goodness-of-fit and validation tests).This is a secondary analysis. Although our primary objective was to confirm previously reported results and identify new predictors of ovulation and pregnancy outcomes among PPCOS-II participants, our approach is exploratory and warrants further replication.We have largely confirmed the predictors that were identified in the PPCOS-I trial. However, we have also revealed new predictors, particularly the role of smoking. While a history of ever smoking was not a significant predictor for live birth, a closer look at current, quit, and never smoking revealed that current smoking was a significant risk factor.The Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) Grants U10 HD27049, U10 HD38992, U10HD055925, U10 HD39005, U10 HD33172, U10 HD38998, U10 HD055936, U10 HD055942, and U10 HD055944; and U54-HD29834.

S., Dunaif, A., Reprod Med Network Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common, highly heritable complex disorder of unknown aetiology characterized by hyperandrogenism, chronic anovulation and defects in glucose homeostasis. Increased luteinizing hormone relative to follicle-stimulating hormone secretion, insulin resistance and developmental exposure to androgens are hypothesized to play a causal role in PCOS. Here we map common genetic susceptibility loci in European ancestry women for the National Institutes of Health PCOS phenotype, which confers the highest risk for metabolic morbidities, as well as reproductive hormone levels. Three loci reach genome-wide significance in the case-control meta-analysis, two novel loci mapping to chr 8p23.1 [Corrected] and chr 11p14.1, and a chr 9q22.32 locus previously found in Chinese PCOS. The same chr 11p14.1 SNP, rs11031006, in the region of the follicle-stimulating hormone B polypeptide (FSHB) gene strongly associates with PCOS diagnosis and luteinizing hormone levels. These findings implicate neuroendocrine changes in disease pathogenesis.

To identify baseline characteristics of women with unexplained infertility to determine whether treatment with an aromatase inhibitor will result in a lower rate of multiple gestations than current standard ovulation induction medications.Randomized, prospective clinical trial.Multicenter university-based clinical practices.A total of 900 couples with unexplained infertility.Collection of baseline demographics, blood samples, and ultrasonographic assessments.Demographic, laboratory, imaging, and survey characteristics.Demographic characteristics of women receiving clomiphene citrate (CC), letrozole, or gonadotropins for ovarian stimulation were very consistent. Their mean age was 32.2 4.4years and infertility duration was 34.7 25.7months, with 59% primary infertility. More than one-third of the women were current or past smokers. The mean body mass index (BMI) was 27 and mean antimllerian hormone level was 2.6; only 11 women (1.3%) had antral follicle counts of <5. Similar observations were identified for hormonal profiles, ultrasound characterization of the ovaries, semen parameters, and quality of life assessments in both male and female partners.The cause of infertility in the couples recruited to this treatment trial is elusive, as the women were regularly ovulating and had evidence of good ovarian reserve both by basal FSH, antimllerian hormone levels, and antral follicle counts; the male partners had normal semen parameters. The three treatment groups have common baseline characteristics, thereby providing comparable patient populations for testing the hypothesis that use of letrozole for ovarian stimulation can reduce the rates of multiples from that observed with gonadotropin and CC treatment.NCT01044862.

Recruitment of individuals into clinical trials is a critical step in completing studies. Reports examining the effectiveness of different recruitment strategies, and specifically in infertile couples, are limited.We investigated recruitment methods used in two NIH sponsored trials, Pregnancy in Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PPCOS II) and Assessment of Multiple Intrauterine Gestations from Ovarian Stimulation (AMIGOS), and examined which strategies yielded the greatest number of participants completing the trials.3683 couples were eligible for screening. 1650 participants were randomized and 1339 completed the trials. 750 women were randomized in PPCOS II; 212 of the participants who completed the trial were referred by physicians. Participants recruited from radio ads (84/750) and the internet (81/750) resulted in similar rates of trial completion in PPCOS II. 900 participants were randomized in AMIGOS. 440 participants who completed the trial were referred to the study by physicians. The next most successful method in AMIGOS was the use of the internet, achieving 78 completed participants. Radio ads proved the most successful strategy in both trials for participants who earned <$50,000 annually. Radio ads were most successful in enrolling white patients in PPCOS II and black patients in AMIGOS. Seven ancillary Clinical Research Scientist Training (CREST) sites enrolled 324 of the participants who completed the trials.Physician referral was the most successful recruitment strategy. Radio ads and the internet were the next most successful strategies, particularly for women of limited income. Ancillary clinical sites were important for overall recruitment. Chlamydia trachomatis immunoglobulin G3 seropositivity is a predictor of reproductive outcomes in infertile women with patent fallopian tubes. Steiner, A. Z., Diamond, M. P., Legro, R.

To determine if Chlamydia trachomatis (C. trachomatis) seropositivity, as detected by the C. trachomatis elementary body (EB)-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay [EB ELISA] predicts pregnancy and pregnancy outcome among infertile women with documented tubal patency.Cohort study.Outpatient clinics.In all, 1,250 infertile women with documented tubal patency enrolled in 1 of 2 randomized controlled trials: Pregnancy in Polycystic Ovary Syndrome II; and the Assessment of Multiple Intrauterine Gestations From Ovarian Stimulation.Sera were analyzed for anti-C. trachomatis immunoglobulin G (IgG)1 and IgG3 antibodies, using a research C. trachomatis EB ELISA. The optical density (OD)405 readings of 0.35 and 0.1 were considered positive for IgG1 and IgG3, respectively.Primary outcomes included pregnancy, live birth, and ectopic pregnancy. Log-linear regression was used to determine the relative risk after adjusting for age, race, treatment medication, smoking status, and current alcohol use.A total of 243 (19%) women were seropositive for anti-C. trachomatis IgG3. They tended to be nonwhite and smokers. Anti-C. trachomatis IgG3 seropositive women were significantly less likely to conceive (risk ratio [RR] 0.65, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.52-0.83) or to have a live birth (RR 0.59, 95% CI 0.43-0.80); these associations were weakened after adjusting for number of hysterosalpingography-documented patent tubes (RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.56-0.97) and (RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.50-1.04), respectively. Anti-C. trachomatis IgG3 seropositive women who conceived had a 2.7 risk (95% CI 1.40-5.34) of ectopic pregnancy.Even in the presence of tubal patency, anti-C. trachomatis IgG3 seropositivity is associated with a lower likelihood of pregnancy. Anti-C. trachomatis IgG3 seropositive women have as high as 3 times the risk of ectopic pregnancy.PPCOSII: NCT00719186 and AMIGOS: NCT01044862.

Intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI), assisted hatching, and increasing number of embryos transferred had significant positive effects on the odds of conception and pregnancy continuation through the first trimester, but did not affect the risk of later loss. Blacks, Asians, and Hispanics had significantly lower odds of clinical pregnancy compared with whites. Also compared with whites, Hispanics and Asians had a significantly greater risk of pregnancy loss in the second and third trimesters, and blacks had a significantly greater risk of pregnancy loss in all trimesters.Certain demographic and ART treatment parameters influenced chance of conception and early pregnancy loss, whereas black race and Hispanic ethnicity were also significantly associated with late pregnancy loss in ART-conceived pregnancies.

D., Nace, C., Armstrong, A. Y. The purpose of this study was to examine the impact of the resident duty-hour restriction on medical student education through a survey of faculty, residents, and interns, with interns providing experience as students relative to implementation of work-hour restrictions.A survey was performed at two (one military and one civilian) obstetrics and gynecology residency programs. Additional surveys were obtained from an Association of Professors of Gynecology and Obstetrics workshop, which included military and nonmilitary attendees.The majority of faculty reported spending 5 to 10 hours per week in medical education before and after implementation of the work-hour restriction. Residents reported less time teaching students after work-hour restrictions were instituted. Nearly all interns, responding about their clinical clerkship experience as students, believed their educational experience would have been improved if residents were more involved in teaching.This pilot study suggests residents are less involved in medical student education following implementation of the duty-hour restrictions. This study was undertaken to assess job satisfaction and quality of life aspects among residents in obstetrics/gynecology before and after the implementation of duty-hour requirements.We administered a survey to residents before and after duty-hour restrictions, addressing satisfaction with residency training, quality of life, and predictions/impressions of the effect of reduced work hours.Satisfaction with overall residency training as a discrete survey item did not change; however, the composite score from all responses to specific items increased. Several specific clinical and academic items garnered higher satisfaction scores in 2004. Residents reported less-than-anticipated increases in healthiness of their lifestyle and a decrease in interest in teaching.This is a prospective assessment of the effect of duty-hour requirements, improvements in residents' perception of their time and ability to study and pursue research and in clinical areas are encouraging. The perception that there is less interest in teaching is of concern. View details for Resident job satisfaction: Will 80 hours make a difference? This study was undertaken to assess job satisfaction and quality of life among obstetrics and gynecology residents before the 80-hour work week.We administered a job satisfaction survey to residents before July 1, 2003, assessing satisfaction with residency training, indicators of current quality of life, and predictions for the effect of reduced work hours.Residents were satisfied with training, with important outliers, including leisure time, ability to pursue educational reading, and surgical experience. We created job satisfaction facets that were generally reliable constructs and valid predictors for overall residency satisfaction. Residents predict more free time and a healthier lifestyle under the new requirements, but do not anticipate using additional time to study or teach.Job satisfaction facets for residents are proposed here and may be refined through further study. Lower scores for surgical experience are of concern in light of decreasing work hours. Educators must monitor self-directed learning efforts under new work hours.

The objective of this study was to examine the true-positive rates by level of training of the operator and to determine whether the accuracy of the procedure differed by the level of education after formalized training.This was a retrospective analysis. The records of patients who underwent surgery for the indication of an abnormal saline sonohysterography were reviewed from January 2001 to April 2003 (n=73 patients). The nature of the saline sonohysterography abnormality, the intraoperative findings, and the level of training of the provider were recorded. Findings at saline sonohysterography were compared with findings at hysteroscopy or surgery. Statistical significance was determined by chi(2) test.The overall true-positive rate was 86.3% (63/73 patients). The true-positive rates for nurse practitioners, second- and fourth-year residents, and fellows were 84%, 80%, 90%, and 89%, respectively. There was no significant difference among providers (P=.96).The true-positive rates for saline hysterography were comparable among different provider levels. View details for Assisted reproductive technologies: Toward improving implantation rates and reducing high-order multiple gestations Despite striking progress in reproductive medicine over the past quarter century, the number of high-order multiple gestations are unacceptably high, largely as a result of the drive to maintain pregnancy rates in a competitive range. Morphologic criteria are currently used to define the reproductive competence of individual embryos but are imperfect predictors of implantation potential. Current and potential strategies to improve the selection of embryos are described. By the use of several of these approaches, it is hoped that the overall number of embryos that are transferred will be reduced, thereby also reducing the multiple gestation rate. View details for View details for The morphology of human pronuclear embryos is positively related to blastocyst development and implantation Human embryos are selected for transfer using morphology at the cleaving and blastocyst stages. Zygote morphology has been related to implantation and pregnancy. The aim of this study was to relate pronuclear morphology to blastocyst development. Zygotes were scored according to distribution and size of nucleoli within each nucleus. Zygotes displaying equality between the nuclei had 49.5% blastocyst formation and those with unequal sizes, numbers or distribution of nucleoli had 28% blastocyst formation. Cleaving embryos that were selected initially by zygote morphology and secondarily by morphology on day 3 had increased implantation (IR) and pregnancy rates (PR; 31 and 57%), compared with those selected by morphology alone (19 and 33% respectively; P: < 0.01). There was a significant difference between zygote-scored and non-scored cycles on day 3 (PR: 57 versus 33%; IR: 31 versus 19%) and on day 5 (PR: 73 versus 58%; IR; 52 versus 39%). Zygote scoring can maintain pregnancy rates for both day 3 and day 5 transfers, increase implantation rates and reduce the numbers of embryos required to achieve a pregnancy. View details for Effects of fasting on neuroendocrine function and follicle development in lean women Alvero, R., Kimzey, L., Sebring, N., Reynolds, J., Loughran, M., Nieman, L., Olson, B. R. A 72-h fast in normal weight women during the follicular phase results in transient alterations in neuroendocrine function, but follicle development and follicular phase length remain unaltered. In this study we evaluated neuroendocrine and ovulatory function in lean women (body fat, < or = 20%) undergoing a similar 72-h fast. Compared to fed controls, fasted lean women experienced significant weight loss, blunting of the diurnal variation of cortisol, suppression of the nocturnal TSH rise, and a decrease in T3 levels after a 72-h fast. In contrast to similarly fasted, normal weight women, lean women have significantly higher evening cortisol levels and do not exhibit a normal nocturnal TSH rise after the fast. Lean fasted women exhibited a 19% decrease in the number of LH pulses over 24 h compared to fed women (12.9 +/- 1.3 vs. 16.0 +/- 1.9; P < 0.05). Fasting did not result in significant differences in mean LH, LH amplitude, LH area under the curve, and mean FSH levels in these lean women. Of the seven fasted cycles, two were anovulatory. In the five women studied in fed and fasted cycles, one had interrupted lead follicle development with anovulation, and four had significant lengthening of the follicular phase compared to those during their fed cycles (14.4 +/- 1.2 vs. 13.2 +/- 1.0 days; P = 0.01). The clinical observations made in this small sample of lean women showing more profound changes in neuroendocrine function, anovulation, and lengthened follicular phase after fasting suggest that lean women may be more vulnerable to fasting stress than normal weight women.

Age is thus a major for women. , the first menstrual period, usually occurs around 12–13, although it may happen earlier or later, depending on each girl. After , female fertility increases and then decreases, with causing an increased risk of . A woman's fertility peaks between the late teens and late-20s, after which it starts to decline slowly. While many sources suggest a more dramatic drop at around 35, this is unclear since studies are still cited from the nineteenth century and earlier. One 2004 study of European women found fertility of the 27–34 and the 35–39 groups had only a four-percent difference. At age 45, a woman starting to try to conceive will have no live birth in 50–80 percent of cases. , or the cessation of , generally occurs in the 40s and 50s and marks the cessation of fertility, although age-related infertility can occur before then. The relationship between age and female fertility is sometimes referred to as a woman's ""biological clock."" Cumulative percentage and average age for women reaching , , and . The average age of a young woman's first period () is 12 to 13 (12.5 years in the , 12.72 in , 12.9 in the ) but, in postmenarchal girls, about 80% of the cycles are in the first year after menarche, 50% in the third and 10% in the sixth year. A woman's fertility peaks in her early and mid-20s after which it starts to decline. However, the exact estimates of the chances of a woman to conceive after a certain age are not clear, and are subject to debate. According to the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) over 80 out of every 100 women aged under 40 who have regular unprotected sexual intercourse will get pregnant within 1 year of trying. In the second year the percentage rises to over 90%. According to a 2004 study by Henri Leridon, PhD, an with the of women trying to get pregnant, without using fertility drugs or in vitro fertilization. At age 30 75% will have a conception ending in a live birth within one year 91% will have a conception ending in a live birth within four years At age 35 66% will have a conception ending in a live birth within one year 84% will have a conception ending in a live birth within four years At age 40 44% will have a conception ending in a live birth within one year 64% will have a conception ending in a live birth within four years According to a study done on a sample of 782 healthy European couples ages 19–39, fertility starts declining after age 27 and drops at a somewhat greater rate after age 35. The women were divided into four age groups: 19–26, 27–29, 30–34 and 35–39. Statistical analysis showed that the women in the 27–29 age group had significantly less chance on average of becoming pregnant than did the 19- to 26-year-olds. Pregnancy rates did not change notably between the 27–29 age group and the 30–34 age group, but dropped significantly for the 35–39 age group. The age of the male partner had a significant impact on female fertility among the women who had reached their mid-30s, but not among the younger women. However, experts said the new study was too small and there were too many variables which were too difficult to sort out, for a clear conclusion to be drawn. Some experts suggested that the main change in fertility in the older women was the fact that it took them to conceive, not necessarily that they were significantly more unlikely to eventually succeed. , a biostatistician at the U.S. National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, said that: ""Although we noted a decline in female fertility in the late 20s, what we found was a decrease in the probability of becoming pregnant per menstrual cycle, not in the probability of eventually achieving a pregnancy."" A French study found no difference between the fertility rate of women under 25 and those ages 26–30, after which fertility started to decrease. Estimating the ""fertility of a woman"" is quite difficult because of the male factor (quality of sperm). This French study looked at 2,193 women who were using because their husbands were . The cumulative success rates after 12 cycles of insemination were 73% for women under age 25, 74% in women ages 26–30, 61% for ages 31–35, and 54% in the over 35 age group. (Note that the study is from 1982; artificial insemination techniques and success rates have evolved greatly since then.) In Hungary, a study by the (Central Statistics Office) estimated that 7–12% of Hungarian women younger than 30 were infertile; 13–22% of women age 35 were infertile; and 24–46% of women age 40 were infertile. The below is a table containing estimates of the percentage of women who, if starting to conceive at a certain age, will fail to obtain a live birth. Note that while for the young ages researchers tend to agree, for older ages there is discrepancy. % who will have no live birth according to Vincent (1950) % who will have no live birth according to Henry (1953), England % who will have no live birth according to Henry (1953), Norway % who will have no live birth according to Pittenger (1973) % who will have no live birth according to Leridon (1977) % who will have no live birth according to Trussell-Wilson (1985) % who will have no live birth according to Menken-Larsen (1986) ""Percentage of ovarian reserve related to increasing age. The curve describes the percentage of ovarian reserve remaining at ages from birth to 55 years, based on the ADC model. 100% is taken to be the maximum ovarian reserve, occurring at 18–22 weeks post-conception. The percentages apply to all women whose ovarian reserve declines in line with a particular model where late and early menopause are associated with high and low peak NGF populations, respectively. It is estimated that for 95% of women by the age of 30 years only 12% of their maximum pre-birth NGF population is present and by the age of 40 years only 3% remains. At birth, women have all their follicles for , and they steadily decline until ."" In terms of , a typical woman has 12% of her reserve at age 30 and has only 3% at age 40. 81% of variation in ovarian reserve is due to age alone, making age the most important factor in female infertility. The most common methods of checking the status of the ovarian reserve is to perform a blood test on day 3 of the menstrual cycle to measure serum FSH level, alternatively a blood test to measure the serum AMH level can give similar information. Transvaginal ultrasound can also be used to “count the number of follicles” and this procedure is called Antral Follicle Count. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends ovarian reserve testing should be performed for women older than 35 years who have not conceived after 6 months of attempting pregnancy and women at higher risk of diminished ovarian reserve, such as those with a history of cancer treated with gonadotoxic therapy, pelvic irradiation, or both; those with medical conditions who were treated with gonadotoxic therapies; or those who had ovarian surgery for endometriomas. It is important to recognize that a poor result from ovarian reserve testing does not signify an absolute inability to conceive and should not be the sole criterion considered to limit or deny access to infertility treatment. A study of a population of French women from 1670 and 1789 shows that those who married at age 20–24 had 7.0 children on average and remained childless. Women who married at age 25–29 years had a mean of 5.7 children and remained childless. Women who married at 30–34 years had a mean of 4.0 children and remained childless. The average age at last birth in populations that have been studied is around 40. In 1957, a study was done on a large population (American ) that never used birth control. The investigators measured the relationship between the age of the female partner and fertility. (Infertility rates today are believed to be higher in the general population than for the population in this study from the 1950s.) The inverse correlation between age and female fertility in later reproductive life is argued to motivate well before having reached 35 years of age. Mapping of a woman's , dynamics and associated can give an individual prognosis about future chances of pregnancy, facilitating an informed choice of when to have children. Notably, a higher level of when tested in women in the general population has been found to have a positive correlation with natural fertility in women aged 30–44 aiming to conceive spontaneously, even after adjusting for age. Thus, AMH measurement is helpful to determine which women may need to conceive at an earlier age, and which women can potentially wait. Most (IVF) centers will attempt IVF using the female partner's until about age 43–45. Michael Fox, M.D., a reproductive endocrinologist in Jacksonville, Florida states that, in regard to assisted reproduction treatment, ""in general our approach to treatment of patients over age 35 is vastly more aggressive than in younger patients.""

Difficulty concentrating, impulsiveness, excessive energy and inability to sit still are some of the most common symptoms of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (). The number of children diagnosed with ADHD continues to increase, but researchers don’t know why. Currently, it’s estimated that 9 percent of American teens and over 4 percent of American adults have ADHD() ADHD has three main subtypes: Hyperactive-Impulsive, Inattentive, and Combined Hyperactive-Impulsive and Inattentive. These subtypes result in symptoms of ADHD that can have devastating effects on both children and adults. While the symptoms often appear around the age of 7, ADHD can appear at any time throughout adolescence and beyond. Left untreated in children, ADHD symptoms cause disruptive behavior at home and school. When directed to sit still and concentrate, it can be nearly impossible for some kids with ADD/ADHD. This can result in learning deficits, falling behind in school, acting out and taking too many risks. () For adults, it’s a challenge, too. It isn’t about discipline, or forcing an individual to focus; rather, effective treatment is about identifying the best ways to lessen the anxiousness and increase concentration and focus while reducing the stress and anxiety that often accompanies it. ADHD is associated with lower cognitive function in attention and memory, particularly when symptoms of depression is also present. () In my judgement, Western medicine focuses on prescription medications that don’t cure ADHD and instead only suppress some of the symptoms. In addition, these medications are linked to delayed growth, sleep problems, decreased appetite and heart problems. To make it worse, the most common drugs prescribed, Ritalin and Adderall, are linked to personality changes, suicidal thoughts and other disturbing side effects. As a central nervous system stimulant, Ritalin can cause nervousness, agitation and anxiety, all of which are already symptoms of ADHD. () The amphetamine, Adderall, is one of the most prescribed medications today and is known to be highly addictive. On top of the ones listed above, other side effects include hallucinations, muscle twitches, high blood pressure and extreme mood swings. () Fortunately, there is a way to mitigate many of the symptoms of ADHD without dangerous prescription stimulants. Natural remedies include supplements, a healthy diet and lifestyle changes that can help to ease the devastating symptoms. No matter which type of ADHD a person has, the severity of symptoms, and the level in which it disrupts lives, varies widely. Nowadays, researchers recognize that diet, environment and other factors contribute to ADHD, for better or worse. () Doesn’t listen, or seems not to process what is being said Prone to losing items, including school work and personal items Low tolerance of people, situations, and surroundings Research also shows that individuals with ADHD are at an increased risk for addiction. () Indeed, the risk of addiction extends beyond the prescription stimulants and into alcohol and illegal drugs. There are many possible causes of ADHD. Studies have shown a range of possible causes and links to both behavior and environment of the mother as well as diet and environment of the child. According to a recent European study published in European Child Adolescent Psychiatry, maternal smoking during pregnancy is associated with the development of ADHD. () In addition, the study also noted that smoking by either parent after birth may be linked to ADHD in children. Exposure early in life to lead and other chemicals like PCBs may also cause ADHD. () Diet continues to show links to ADHD, including chemical food additives, wheat, refined sugar, food allergies and . While researchers may not know why more and more kids are being diagnosed with ADHD, reviewing  gives us some insight. Grain consumption is way up, as is sugar, salt, processed foods and GMOs, while the consumption of fresh fruits, vegetables and healthy meats are down. Furthermore, there is evidence that the environment — such as exposure to lead or arsenic — and diet during early years affects the development of ADHD in later years. In fact, such ADHD symptoms as inattention, impulsivity and poor cognitive function are associated with arsenic, even at levels considered () I’ve discovered that one of the most promising solutions for ADHD is a low-sugar, low-inflammation diet, such as the or other types of healing diets. () Another possible root cause of ADHD is traumatic brain injury. () It seems that the injury can cause various symptoms such as memory and attention deficits, as well as acting out and impulsive behavior. In addition to these outside risk factors, studies show that ADHD has a genetic link in some individuals. If parents or grandparents have ADHD, children are more likely to develop symptoms — although, at this point in the research, it’s not clear whether this is actually a genetic predisposition or a diet and lifestyle similarity that causes ADHD to develop. In some ways, it’s simple: What we eat directly affects our bodies and behaviors. A healthy diet that is void of known ADHD triggers can help, sometimes significantly. In a study to be published in the Academy of Pediatrics, youths that drink sweetened beverages, including energy drinks, are 66 percent more likely to be at risk for hyperactivity and inattention. Researchers recommend limiting the consumption of sweetened beverages and the avoidance of energy drinks in children. () It’s not just adolescents that need to avoid sugary drinks, however, as sugar is also associated with ADHD in some adults. Therefore, both kids and adults are encouraged to avoid concentrated forms of sugar, including fruit juices, carbonated beverages, desserts, candy and other sweets. In some research, gluten is directly linked to Celiac disease and ADHD in both children and adults. A study published in The Primary Care Companion – Journal of Clinical Psychiatry found a significant improvement in behavior and functioning after the initiation of a gluten-free diet. In fact, researchers suggest that Celiac disease should be included in an ADHD symptom checklist. () It’s important to recognize that individuals can be sensitive to gluten but not have Celiac disease even though they suffer many of the same symptoms. For an ADHD diet, be sure to avoid all foods that contain gluten, including breads, pastas, cereals and processed foods. Look for gluten-free and grain-free alternatives. A 10-week study found that when conventional cow’s milk was removed from the diet of hyperactive preschool boys, symptoms of ADD/ADHD improved. () The diet also eliminated artificial colors, flavors, chocolate, MSG and caffeine. If any ADHD symptoms arise after consuming dairy, it’s wise to remove it from the diet. Most conventional cow’s milk contains A1 casein that can trigger a similar reaction as gluten and, therefore, should be eliminated from the diets of both adults and children. Raw cow’s milk may be better for people with ADHD, in part because of its natural immunizing abilities, and goat’s milk doesn’t contain casein, making it a good substitute as well. Consumption of artificial food colors (AFCs) has increased five-fold since 1950, showing average consumption of AFCs at 68 milligrams. Studies that have tested 50 milligrams or more have shown a link between AFCs and behavioral reactions, including hyperactivity in children. () AFCs are found in nearly every processed food, including carbonated sodas, convenience foods, deli meats and cheeses, cereals, chewable vitamins, and toothpaste. As part of an ADHD diet, children and adults should avoid all artificial food colors and dyes. A recent study published in Substance Use and Misuse indicates that caffeine and alcohol consumption is associated with anger and violence in teens. () Adolescents and adults with ADHD should avoid any energy drinks with a high concentration of sugar, caffeine and additional stimulants. () While prescription stimulant medication is used for some individuals with ADHD, it’s imperative on an ADHD diet to remove all forms of caffeine, as it’s known to increase insomnia, anxiety, anxiousness and other ADHD symptoms. () Individuals with ADHD should avoid MSG, hydrolyzed vegetable protein (HVP) and yeast extract. Yeast extract is a form of MSG, and while many people know to look for MSG on labels, many don’t know to avoid yeast extract. Even such natural prepared foods as deli meats, veggie burgers, sauces, gravies, salad dressings, crackers, pastas and spices contain it. There’s a relationship between these additives and decreased dopamine levels. Dopamine is associated with the reward system and pleasure areas of the brain — balanced levels of dopamine keep impulsivity and activity in check. The vast majority of processed foods, canned foods and lunch meats contain nitrites. Nitrites cause restlessness and anxiousness, which in turn can worsen symptoms of ADHD. In addition, nitrates in the diet are linked to an increased risk of type 1 diabetes, cancer and  such as acesulfame K, aspartame, benzene, cyclamates, saccharin and sucralose are associated with a wide array of serious side effects. These include cancer, obesity, increased heart rate, infertility, dizziness, headaches and memory loss. While mentioned above that removing sugar is part of a successful ADHD diet, replacing it with artificial sweeteners is not the solution. Start to retrain taste buds by adding other flavors from herbs, spices and citrus while using other in moderation. One of the most common food allergens in the world, soy can cause many symptoms in allergic individuals, including hives, tingling in the mouth, wheezing, difficulty breathing and abdominal pain. For some, soy allergy can even result in anaphylaxis. In individuals without a known sensitivity, soy disrupts thyroid function and hormone levels in the body. This can cause ADHD or make the symptoms worse. An ADHD diet should exclude top common allergens, including peanuts, tree nuts, shellfish, wheat, conventional dairy and eggs. Personal sensitivities to foods should also be removed from the diet. This may include papaya, avocados, bananas, kiwis, chocolate, fennel, caraway and coriander. According to a study published in Psychiatry Research, there is a direct link between dietary behaviors and ADD/ADHD and learning disabilities in children and adolescents.() In this study, a high intake of sweets, fried foods and salt was associated with more learning, attention and behavioral problems. In contrast, a balanced ADHD diet is shown to have beneficial effects on all of the problems caused by a poor diet. To change to an ADHD diet, avoid the foods mentioned above while eating a diet of unprocessed, whole foods. Modern Western diets seem to be more closely liked to ADHD because of the higher consumption of refined sugars, salt and hydrogenated fats, while being low in omega-3s, fiber, folate and B-Complex. () High-protein meals that include clean sources of protein from grass-fed organic beef, free-range chicken, eggs, wild-caught fish and raw dairy should be the focus of an ADHD diet for both children and adults. Low iron levels are associated with fatigue, poor concentration and mental function, irritability, poor memory, muscle weakness, and leaky gut syndrome. Eating a diet rich in high iron foods is an essential part of a successful diet strategy for ADHD. include the liver and steaks from grass-fed beef, navy and black beans, spinach, Swiss chard, and egg yolks. Vitamin B-6 is essential for brain function, including the production of dopamine and serotonin. In a preliminary study, B-6 was shown to be slightly more effective than Ritalin in improving behavior among hyperactive children. () rich foods are tasty and easy to incorporate into the ADHD diet. Wild tuna and salmon, free-range chicken and turkey breast, grass-fed beef, bananas, cooked spinach, sweet potatoes, and hazelnuts hit the top of the list. In addition, include brewer’s yeast and other green leafy vegetables. The essential amino acid, tryptophan, helps the body synthesize proteins and support healthy serotonin levels. In many individuals suffering from ADD/ADHD, imbalances in serotonin levels is indicated. () Additionally, serotonin is related to impulse control and aggression, two of the symptoms of ADD/ADHD. () Yogurt and kefir from grass-fed cows or goats, sauerkraut, Kimchi, and other high probiotic foods should be a central part of a diet for ADHD. Eggs are a great way to incorporate high-quality protein into the ADHD diet, and they are not just for breakfast anymore. Each egg has 7 grams of protein, but is also packed with essential amino acids and omega-3 fatty acids. Purchase local, organic eggs, preferably from cage-free chickens. Foods rich in  — such as wild-caught salmon and tuna — directly affect cognitive function in both children and adults. A clinical trial identified a link between low levels of omega-3 fatty acids and behavioral and learning problems. () A successful ADHD diet will include two or more servings per week of salmon or tuna. Prominent researchers from the Division of Neurology at Children’s Memorial Hospital and Department of Pediatrics at Northwestern University Medical School reviewed substantial research regarding diet and ADHD. While diets were shown to be difficult to sustain, adding supplementation to diet therapy was an easy step to take and typically more acceptable to kids. () is better than Ritalin for ADHD, according to a study from the University of Adelaide in Australia. The omega-3 fatty acids, including DHA and EPA, within fish oil are critical for brain function and are also strong anti-inflammatories. Children 50 to 80 pounds should be given one teaspoon daily; children 80 to 150 pounds, two teaspoons daily; adults should take one tablespoon daily. Supplementation appears to reduce symptoms of ADHD, improve learning, reduce anxiety and depression, and help prevent some forms of cancer. Another study published in the Journal of American Academy of Pediatrics found that supplements offer a safe treatment option for educational and behavioral problems in children. Significant improvements in reading, spelling and behavior were all noted over the three-month trial.() Children and adults with ADHD should supplement their diets with a high-quality zinc supplement. Low levels of zinc are associated with poor neurological function, poor attention and a variety of motor disorders. The World Health Organization reports that rate is 31 percent. One of the leading symptoms of a zinc deficiency is poor neurological function. In addition to high-quality mineral supplements, it’s important to add mineral rich foods, such as dark greens, beans and wild-caught salmon. One of the genetic links to ADHD is the serotonin transporter gene. Serotonin levels are directly linked to aggression and impulse control. () Children with ADHD typically need more of the B-vitamins to help maintain focus, increase concentration, fight stress, relieve fatigue, balance energy and hormone levels, and produce healthy levels of serotonin. Children and adults should take 50 milligrams daily. Children and adults should take 25 billion to 50 billion units of daily. In addition to taking a high-quality probiotic supplement, aim to eat foods high in probiotics, such as kefir, sauerkraut, raw cheese and yogurt. Some studies show that ADHD may be connected to problems in the digestive tract. Sugar, tap water, grains, certain prescription medications, including antibiotics, and environmental chemicals kill healthy bacteria in the gut and decrease digestive function. GABA is an amino acid vital to healthy central nervous system function. It acts as a calming agent, helping to suppress nervous system activity and block some nerve impulses. Individuals should take 250 milligrams twice per day. Speak to your physician prior to taking GABA if you are on any medications, or if any of the following side effects arise: wheezing, anxiety, flushing, or tingling of the hands and feet.  U.S. National Library of Medicine, “Some clinical research shows that a combination herbal product containing ashwagandha may improve attention and impulse control in children with ADHD. The effect of alone is unclear.” Successful treatment for the symptoms of ADHD requires not only supplements and healthy diet void of known ADHD triggers, it also requires some lifestyle changes. The natural treatments mentioned below can help many ADHD symptoms. Lavender essential oil can be used in various ways to improve mood when anxiousness or nervousness is present. As with other , drops can be added to the bath, sprinkled on stuffed animals, used in diffusers, or even applied directly to the skin or bottoms of feet at bedtime. Dilute with a carrier oil like grape seed oil or coconut oil or apply only one to two drops if using the concentrated oil. Also, consider using peppermint oil, which improves mental focus, boosts energy and helps to release tight muscles. Insomnia and restless sleep are common ADHD symptoms. A recent study found that behavioral sleep intervention improves the severity of ADHD symptoms in children, especially those taking prescription stimulants. The study showed behavior, quality of life and functioning was sustained for six months following the trial. () It’s vital that both children and adults develop good evening routines that allow them to unwind at the end of the day. The goal should be a good eight hours of sleep each night. For some people, and especially those with ADHD, breakfast helps the body properly regulate blood sugar and stabilize hormone fluctuations. Eat a breakfast that contains at least 20 grams of protein. Exercise helps to increase hormone levels that are essential for relieving ADHD symptoms. () Prior to a task that requires concentration, engage in 30 minutes of exercise. According to the American Journal of Occupational Therapy, using balance/stability balls as a seat increased attention levels, decreased hyperactivity and increased time on task. () If your child’s school will not allow a stability ball, be sure to use one at home during homework. In addition, adults can benefit from stability balls at their desks. Neurofeedback may help children and adults learn to focus on tasks. Some initial studies have found that watching brain activity during neurofeedback allows some individuals the opportunity to learn how to more effectively control their brains. Symptoms of ADHD can be reduced with diet, supplements and recommended lifestyle changes — moreover, these changes can help you conquer ADD/ADHD in yourself, or in your child. For many people, removing the trigger foods and replacing them with healthy foods will dramatically help address this common neurological and behavioral disorder.

This protocol describes factors that may contribute to PCOS and how the condition is medically treated. You’ll also learn about the important link between PCOS and insulin resistance, and how a common diabetes drug, metformin, may benefit women with PCOS. Healthy eating habits and losing weight, along with supplements such as inositol and N-acetylcysteine (NAC), may help reduce PCOS symptoms when combined with appropriate medical care. Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a hormonal disorder that affects 5‒10% of women of childbearing age. PCOS can cause troublesome signs and symptoms, including: Irregular menstrual cycles Excess male hormone production, resulting in excess facial and body hair (hirsutism), adult acne, and male pattern baldness (in women) Chronic lack of ovulation Fortunately, integrative interventions like inositol and N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) can help improve symptoms and quality of life for women who suffer with PCOS. Conditions Associated with PCOS Infertility Obesity, especially central Insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes Stroke and cardiovascular disease Causes and Risk Factors for PCOS High levels of insulin or insulin resistance Excess luteinizing hormone Obesity Early age at onset of puberty Conventional Medical Treatments Metformin is therapeutic for both elevated insulin and male hormone excess Hirsutism and menstrual cycle regulation: oral contraceptive pills, metformin, spironolactone Infertility: clomiphene citrate (Clomid), metformin, gonadotropins, surgery to destroy extra ovarian follicles Dietary and Lifestyle Changes Reduce dietary carbohydrates and saturated fat and increase monounsaturated fats and fiber from low-glycemic index foods Daily physical activity and regular exercise to improve insulin sensitivity Integrative Interventions D-chiro inositol, Myo-inositol, D-pinitol: These three inositol compounds have been found to help improve insulin sensitivity, blood pressure, triglyceride and testosterone levels, and ovulatory function. N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC): NAC improves insulin sensitivity and restores fertility when added to the drug clomiphene citrate better than clomiphene citrate alone. Chromium: Chromium picolinate improves glucose tolerance in women with PCOS. Lipoic acid: Women with PCOS who supplemented with lipoic acid showed a sharp improvement in insulin sensitivity and a reduction in triglycerides. Cinnamon: Researchers at Columbia University have found that cinnamon extract reduces the insulin resistance of women with PCOS. 2 Introduction A woman who finds herself with irregular menstrual cycles, excess facial and body hair, adult acne, weight gain, infertility and enlarged ovaries may have polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), an unfortunate condition that afflicts 5‒10% of women of childbearing age and approximately 70‒90% of women with irregular menstrual cycles.1 Among its many symptoms, PCOS causes hormonal imbalances, including elevated testosterone (male hormone) and estrogen (female hormone) levels, as well as increased insulin levels.2,3 Although PCOS is the most common female endocrine disorder in the United States, its cause remains unclear.4 Perhaps this is why “syndrome” is most commonly used in conventional medicine to describe PCOS since the word itself alludes to its varied signs and symptoms but does not indicate a precise cause of the condition. However, research largely overlooked by mainstream medicine reveals a strong association between PCOS, obesity, and insulin resistance, including characteristic features of insulin insensitivity such as dyslipidemia (abnormality of metabolism of fats) and hypertension.5,6 If left untreated, women with PCOS often develop severe clinical manifestations, such as hirsutism (excess facial and body hair), adult acne, infertility, and depression.7,8 Women with PCOS are at significantly higher risk for developing cardiovascular disease9 and endometrial cancer.10 Integrative medicine recognizes the seriousness of PCOS, as well as the need to approach the management of PCOS as a disease of insulin resistance in order to offer hope to the millions of women who suffer from this disease. For example, metformin, an insulin sensitizing agent that also helps to reduce excessive androgen production, promotes weight loss, restores fertility, and enhances glucose metabolism in patients with PCOS, is drastically underutilized by conventional medicine for this disease. However, management strategies commonly used to control individual symptoms of PCOS are known to have a number of undesirable side effects.11 Fortunately, for the millions suffering with PCOS published clinical studies support the use of natural therapeutics, such as inositol and N-acetyl-cysteine (NAC), for controlling the symptoms and side effects. 3 Symptoms of PCOS One of the challenging aspects of diagnosing PCOS is that the signs and symptoms vary from person to person, in both type and severity. Frequently, PCOS symptoms are mistaken for other medical illnesses. However, common symptoms include: Menstrual Abnormality Menstrual abnormality is the most widespread characteristic of PCOS. These include cycles longer than 35 days (fewer than eight menstrual cycles a year); failure to menstruate for four months or longer; and prolonged periods that may be scant or heavy.12 Excess Androgen Production Increased androgen levels are a key feature of PCOS and may result in excess facial and body hair (hirsutism), adult acne, and male-pattern baldness (in women). Worth noting, however, is that the physical signs of androgen excess vary with ethnicity. As an example, the prevalence of hirsutism in PCOS patients is at least 40% in European and American females, yet is even more common in darker skin types, but women of Asian descent may not be affected.13 Polycystic Ovaries Enlarged ovaries containing numerous small cysts can be detected by ultrasound. However, some women with polycystic ovaries may not have PCOS, while some women with the condition have ovaries that appear normal.14 4 Other Conditions Associated with PCOS Infertility PCOS is the most common cause of female infertility. Many women with polycystic ovary syndrome experience infrequent ovulation or lack of ovulation altogether and may have trouble becoming pregnant. PCOS also is associated with spontaneous abortion and preeclampsia.15 Obesity Compared with women of similar age who don't have polycystic ovary syndrome, women with PCOS are significantly more likely to be overweight or obese.3,16 Furthermore, about half of all women with PCOS manifest central obesity, in which there is a greater deposition of visceral fat around internal organs in the abdominal region, as opposed to the fat being located on the thighs and hips. Abdominal fat distribution is associated with increased risk of hypertension, diabetes and lipid abnormalities.17 Insulin Resistance and Type 2 Diabetes Studies have found that women with PCOS have higher incidences of insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes than age and weight-matched controls.3 Moreover, a majority of obese PCOS women and more than half of those of normal weight are insulin resistant,18 and a significant number develop type 2 diabetes mellitus by the age of 40.19 Acanthosis Nigricans Acanthosis nigricans is a dark, poorly defined, velvety hyperpigmentation found on the nape of the neck, armpits, inner thighs, vulva, or under the breasts. This condition is a sign of insulin resistance, which leads to higher circulating insulin levels. Insulin spillover into the skin results in hyperplasia, an abnormal increase in skin growth.20 5 Diagnosis of PCOS There is no specific test to definitively diagnose polycystic ovary syndrome. The diagnosis is one of exclusion, which means the doctor considers all signs and symptoms to rule out other possible disorders.14 A standard diagnostic assessment for PCOS includes a full medical history, at which time a doctor will consider irregular or absent periods, obesity, hirsutism (coarse facial and body hair), and poor breast development. During a physical exam, doctors typically look for physical signs of PCOS like acne, facial hair, male pattern baldness and acanthosis nigricans. A pelvic or transvaginal ultrasound is used to detect ""follicular arrest,"" or the development of small (5–7 mm) follicles that never reach the preovulatory size of 16 mm or more. Though not all women with PCOS have polycystic ovaries (PCO), nor do all women with ovarian cysts have PCOS,21 ultrasonographic scanning has substantially broadened the phenotypic spectrum of PCOS.14 Diagnostic criteria published by the Androgen Excess Society in 2006 require the presence of clinical or biochemical hyperandrogenism, with either menstrual dysfunction or polycystic ovarian morphology (PCOM), which are detected via transvaginal ultrasonography.21 Blood work is used to measure the levels of several hormones and to exclude the many possible causes of menstrual abnormalities or androgen excess that mimic PCOS. Along with tests used to measure elevated androgen levels, doctors may look for high levels of luteinizing hormones (LH) or an elevation in the ratio of LH to follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), prolactin, thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), 17-hydroxyprogesterone, testosterone and DHEA-S. Other associated conditions such as high levels of glucose, insulin, cholesterol and triglycerides, as well as insulin resistance may also be assessed.22 Some doctors now screen for high levels of anti-Müllerian Hormone (AMH) since it is considered a potential diagnostic marker for PCOS.23,24 AMH is a protein released by cells that are involved with the growth of the egg follicle. AMH levels correlate with the number of antral follicles (small follicles that are 2 to 8 mm in size and appear in the beginning of the menstrual cycle) found on the ovary; the higher the antral follicle count, the higher the AMH levels.25 Women with PCOS typically have a high number of antral follicles; they have correspondingly high AMH levels as well.26 6 Causes and Risk Factors for PCOS PCOS was once regarded solely as a reproductive disorder affecting women of childbearing age. Anovulation (a menstrual cycle in which ovulation does not occur) and androgen excess have been considered the hallmark diagnostic criteria of the syndrome.14 However, insulin resistance is now identified as a significant contributor to the pathogenesis of PCOS, the metabolic and cardiovascular consequences of which are widely acknowledged within the scientific community.11 To date, several factors involved in the development of PCOS have been identified. LH Secretion and Androgen Excess Past research has emphasized the role of neuroendocrine abnormalities in the persistent and excessive secretion of luteinizing hormones (LH), one of two glycoprotein hormones that stimulate the final ripening of the follicles and the secretion of progesterone. Excessive LH triggers premature ovulation, disrupting the follicle’s maturation process and leading to an increase in androgen production by ovarian theca cells. Some research points to increased LH as the driving force for PCOS in slender and normal body-weight women.27 Hyperinsulinemia and Androgen Excess Hyperinsulinemia produces hyperandrogenism in women with PCOS via two distinct and independent mechanisms. The first is the stimulation of ovarian androgen production. Studies have shown that insulin acts synergistically with LH to enhance androgen production in ovarian theca cells.28,29 The second is by directly and independently reducing serum sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) levels. Genetics and Androgen Excess An increase in LH, as well as hyperinsulinemia, leads to an increase in androgen production by ovarian theca cells.29 Research indicates that morphological changes in the ovaries, including ovarian cyst development and theca-cell (steroid-producing cells in the ovaries) dysfunction, may be an indication of a genetic basis for PCOS. Researchers suspect there is a genetically determined ovarian defect present in women with PCOS, causing the ovary to overproduce androgen.29-32 Indeed, abnormal theca cell activity seems to be a primary source for excess androgens.33 The following risk factors are also thought to have a strong influence over the progression of PCOS. Obesity Studies have found that obesity not only contributes to the development of PCOS, but arises also as a result.16 The adipose tissue of women with PCOS is characterized by enlarged fat cells (hypertrophic adipocytes) and impairments in the body’s ability to break down fat (lipolysis) and regulate insulin. Whether these abnormalities are primary or secondary to hyperandrogenism or other PCOS-related abnormalities is not yet known.34 Age at Onset Some research suggests that girls who develop pubic hair early (often before the age of eight, a condition known as premature pubarche) have many of the signs and symptoms of PCOS. In one study that followed prepubescent girls throughout puberty, premature pubarche resulted in excess testosterone production and irregular periods consistent with PCOS, leading researchers to conclude that premature pubarche may be an early form of PCOS.35 Other Risk Factors Other risk factors that may play a role in the pathogenesis of PCOS include chronic inflammation36; exposure to endocrine-disrupting chemicals37; autoimmune disorders, especially those involving the ovaries, pancreas, thyroid and adrenal glands38; and the use of medications that increase prolactin production.39 Laying aside etiology, women with PCOS are prone to defects in insulin signaling, which aggravates the synthesis of androgens in the ovaries and adrenal gland.29 Excess androgens encourage insulin resistance, leading to elevated insulin levels, which in turn stimulate further androgen synthesis. This vicious cycle results in a “snowball effect” worsening PCOS symptoms and making sufferers especially susceptible to obesity and diabetes, conditions that significantly compound the syndrome’s progression.11,40 What You Need to Know Polycystic ovary syndrome is a common female endocrine disorder. Though symptoms vary from person to person, it is characterized by multiple ovarian cysts, irregular, heavy or nonexistent periods, excessive facial/body hair, male pattern baldness, decreased sex drive, skin tags, infertility, depression and weight gain. Insulin resistance is one of the most common features of PCOS, and a condition in which the cells of the body become resistant to the effects of insulin. The root cause of PCOS is unknown but genetic predisposition, insulin resistance, excess androgen production, and obesity all play a role. Since the symptoms of PCOS vary in severity and form, many treatments are used. Conventional options include drug treatments for hirsutism and acne; drugs such as clomiphene, tamoxifen and gonadotropins to induce ovulation for infertility; surgery to induce ovulation by reducing androgen levels, and promising insulin-sensitizing drugs such as metformin. The most important aspect of long term care of PCOS is managing cardiovascular risks such as obesity, insulin resistance, diabetes, hypertension and elevated blood cholesterol. Early recognition and intervention are considered to be the cornerstones of PCOS treatment. Emerging evidence suggests that lifestyle choices such as weight reduction and exercise, along with specific nutraceuticals targeted to safely and effectively deal with symptoms, underlying causes and associated risk factors, might help reduce the incidence and severity of PCOS. 7 Conventional Treatment of PCOS Polycystic ovary syndrome treatment generally focuses on management of the individual main concerns, such as infertility, hirsutism, acne or obesity. Hirsutism Oral contraceptive pills, consisting of estrogen-progesterone combinations, are preferably used. Estrogens lower LH levels and androgen production. Progesterone is crucial, as it may increase the liver production of SHBG, reducing free testosterone levels.41 Another medication called spironolactone (Aldactone) is used as a primary medical treatment for hirsutism and female pattern hair loss since the accidental discovery of its antiandrogenic effects. Spironolactone reduces testosterone production and inhibits its action on target tissues. It also is an effective alternative treatment for acne in women. Spironolactone should not be used in pregnancy since it can disturb the growth and development of the embryo and fetus.42 Even more promising are insulin-sensitizers like metformin (see text box below), which also holds promise for managing hirsutism in PCOS patients.41 Infertility Ovulation induction remains a milestone in the treatment of women with anovulatory infertility.43 Clomiphene citrate (CC), an oral antiestrogen medication, is considered the first line treatment for inducing ovulation in women with PCOS.43 Since insulin resistance plays a central role in PCOS, insulin reduction strategies are a possible treatment for infertility in PCOS patients.44 For instance, if CC alone is not effective, metformin can be added to help induce ovulation.45 If the CC and metformin combination fails, gonadotropins—follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) medications that are administered by injection—may be another option.43,46 Aromatase inhibitors, such as anastrozole and letrozole, are a relatively new treatment for ovulation induction.43 Aromatase inhibitors selectively block the peripheral conversion of androgens to estrogens, causing a reaction in the pituitary gland, increasing FSH, and optimizing ovulation. The advantage of aromatase inhibitors is that they avoid the unfavorable side effects seen frequently with antiestrogens.47 If medication does not work, a surgical procedure called laparoscopic ovarian drilling (LOD) may be considered. During LOD, a surgeon makes a small incision in the abdomen and inserts a tube attached to a tiny camera (laparoscope) providing detailed images of the ovaries and neighboring pelvic organs. The surgeon then inserts surgical instruments through other small incisions and uses electrical or laser energy to destroy the extra, androgen producing follicles on the surface of the ovaries. The goal of the operation is to induce ovulation by reducing androgen levels. Regulation of the Menstrual Cycle Metformin improves ovulation and leads to regular menstrual cycles (see sidebar). Birth control pills containing a combination of synthetic estrogen and progesterone decrease androgen production, correct abnormal bleeding, and decrease the risk of endometrial cancer as well. Low-dose birth control pills have been proven effective for regulating the menstrual cycles of those who are not trying to become pregnant.48 To date, there are no known clinical studies on bioidentical hormone replacement therapy (BHRT) and PCOS. Long-term PCOS Management Managing cardiovascular risks such as obesity, elevated cholesterol, high blood pressure and diabetes is considered the most important aspect of PCOS treatment. Since medications such as metformin and thiazolidinedione improve insulin sensitivity, in 2004 Great Britain’s National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence recommended that women with PCOS that have a BMI above 25 be given metformin when other therapies fail to produce results.49 This recommendation proved to be well-founded, as Metformin is known to be an effective treatment for both hyperinsulinemia and hyperandrogenism.50-52 Indeed, metformin may be the most promising conventional medical treatment for PCOS. Metformin: An Underutilized Treatment for PCOS Metformin, a medication currently used to lower blood sugar, is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to manage type 2 diabetes mellitus. Metformin inhibits liver glucose production, though it also decreases intestinal glucose uptake and increases insulin sensitivity in peripheral tissues.53 Metformin improves the likelihood of ovulation in women with PCOS through a variety of actions, including reducing insulin levels and altering the effect of insulin on ovarian androgen synthesis, theca cell proliferation, and endometrial growth.43 To increase metformin tolerance, patients start with 500 mg daily with food. After one week, the dose increases to 1,000 mg for another week and then to 1,500 mg daily. Clinical response is usually seen at the 1,000 mg daily dose.54 Studies have found that PCOS patients who do not respond to metformin at the 1,500 mg dose respond favorably to 2,000 mg.54 For many years, oral hypoglycemic agents were regarded as teratogenic, and their use was contraindicated during pregnancy. However, the latest data supports the safety of metformin throughout pregnancy. Glueck et al reported that metformin was not teratogenic and did not affect the motor or social development of infants age 3 and 6 months.55 Recently, Tang et al concluded that metformin improves ovulation and pregnancy rates, findings they noted while updating the Cochrane Review of insulin-sensitizing drugs (metformin, rosiglitazone, pioglitazone, d-chiro-inositol) for women with PCOS, oligo/amenorrhea and subfertility.56 A recent clinical study of 50 PCOS patients reported that metformin exerts a slight but significant deleterious effect on serum homocysteine levels. Therefore, supplementing with folate is considered useful for lowering homocysteine and increasing the beneficial effect of metformin on the vascular endothelium (the inner lining of the blood vessels).57 Side Effects with Conventional Treatments A pitfall of mainstream approaches to PCOS is that they are often associated with unwanted side effects, for example: For trouble conceiving, a doctor typically prescribes fertility drug Clomid. In some women, Clomid causes no side effects. In others, side effects may include mood swings, hot flashes, breast tenderness, abdominal cramps, and nausea. Roughly 30% of women who take Clomid experience the more serious side effects of hostile fertile mucous (HFM, a condition in which the cervical mucus become too thick to allow sperm to penetrate the cervix) and uterine lining thinning. HFM prevents conception and a thin uterine lining decreases the likelihood of implantation and may lead to early miscarriage, both are undesirable effects of using Clomid. Birth control pills are still the treatment of choice for irregular periods. However, a 2006 study concluded that birth control pills increase insulin resistance, making the symptoms of PCOS more pronounced and increasing the risk of major heath complications.58 In fact, many medications used in the treatment of PCOS do not adequately address the lifestyle and hormonal imbalances that are at the root of PCOS, nor do they hold much promise for managing associated cardiovascular risks and type 2 diabetes. 8 Lifestyle and Dietary Recommendations For women with polycystic ovary syndrome, daily physical activity and participation in a regular exercise regimen are essential for treating or preventing insulin resistance, lowering blood sugar levels and for helping weight-control efforts. Since a majority of PCOS women are obese, and insulin resistance plays a critical role in the development of PCOS, a diet that is high in fiber, vitamins, minerals and disease-fighting phytonutrients, and low in saturated fatty acids may reduce certain risk factors and improve overall well-being. Additional research may determine which specific dietary approach is best for PCOS, but it is clear that losing weight by reducing total caloric intake benefits the overall health of women with polycystic ovary syndrome. Researchers reported that short-term treatment with an ultra-low-calorie (350‒450 kcal per day) decreased androgen signaling and reduced serum insulin in obese women with PCOS.59 A study by Italian researchers concluded that comprehensive dietary change designed to lower insulin resulted in a significant decrease in testosterone, body weight, waist/hip ratio, total cholesterol, fasting blood glucose and insulin.60 Diets high in monounsaturated fats have been shown to increase insulin sensitivity and lower the overall glycemic index. High fiber foods are slowly absorbed, causing less insulin to be released. High fiber diets increase SHBG, which binds to and lowers free testosterone. Fibers also can lower PAI-1 (plasminogen activator inhibitor, a glycosylated protein that plays a significant role in metabolic syndrome) as well as cholesterol and blood lipids.59 A study reported that just a moderate reduction in dietary carbohydrates reduced fasting and post-challenge insulin concentrations among women with PCOS, improving reproductive/endocrine outcomes.61 Echoed a 2005 report, ""On the balance of evidence to date, a diet low in saturated fat and high in fiber from predominantly low-glycemic-index-carbohydrate foods is recommended [in the dietary management of PCOS].""62 9 Integrative Interventions Inositol Inositol is a sugar alcohol that has many possible forms, or isomers. Myo-inositol (MI) is the most common of these isomers, while D-chiro-inositol (DCI) makes up a small percentage. Some MI is converted to DCI in the body.63,64 Inositol is a crucial structural component of cell membrane lipids and is active in cell-to-cell signaling.63 In addition, by transmitting external signals from insulin to the working interior of cells, inositol compounds called inositol phosphoglycans act as second messengers of insulin. Dysregulation of the inositol phosphoglycan second messenger system is associated with insulin resistance and related disorders, including PCOS.65,66 MI and DCI supplements have been shown to positively impact the hormonal and reproductive disturbances associated with PCOS.66 Myo-inositol. A number of controlled trials have demonstrated that MI can improve insulin sensitivity and metabolic markers, normalize reproductive hormone levels, and restore menstrual cycles in women with PCOS.67-70 MI supplementation has been shown to increase quality and maturity of oocytes (ie, cells that may go on to become eggs) retrieved from ovaries of PCOS patients71-73 and may enhance fertility in women affected by this condition.74 In a comparison study, 4 grams of MI plus 400 mcg of folic acid per day was more effective than 1,500 mg per day of metformin (Glucophage) in restoring ovulation in infertile women with PCOS. In addition, the total pregnancy rate was higher in women treated with MI (48.4%) than metformin (36.6%).75 In a randomized controlled trial, 50 overweight PCOS patients were given either 2 grams of MI plus 200 mcg of folic acid or 200 mcg of folic acid daily. After 12 weeks, the women taking MI had decreased insulin, testosterone, and prolactin levels, and increased markers of insulin sensitivity. In addition, menstrual cycles were restored in all of the subjects receiving MI who reported few or no menstrual cycles at the beginning of the trial. No changes occurred in the control group.76 Another controlled clinical trial included 92 participants with PCOS treated with either 4 grams of MI plus 400 mcg of folic acid per day or 400 mcg of folic acid daily. After 14 weeks, the MI-treated women had improvements in ovulation, reduced leptin levels, and significant weight loss versus the control group whose body weight increased.77 A six-month study involving 50 women with PCOS also reported benefits on hormonal parameters and found that MI supplementation reduced hirsutism and acne.78 D-chiro-inositol. Clinical evidence suggests DCI is important for mediating the insulin response and may play a role in the therapeutic effect of blood glucose-lowering drugs such as metformin and pioglitazone (Actos) in women with PCOS.79-81 Insulin resistance is associated with low serum levels and increased urinary loss of DCI, and a high ratio of MI to DCI is considered a marker of insulin resistance.63,64 In women with PCOS, deficiency of DCI has been noted despite normal MI availability.65,82,83 Although DCI does not act directly on the ovaries, its systemic insulin-sensitizing effect appears to benefit women with PCOS.63,84 In a controlled trial, 44 obese women with PCOS were given 1,200 mg of DCI or placebo daily for six to eight weeks. The DCI group had significant reductions in glucose-induced insulin release, blood pressure, and triglyceride and testosterone levels, while none of these parameters changed significantly in the placebo group. Moreover, 86% of subjects receiving DCI ovulated during the study period compared with 27% in the placebo group.85 Similar results were seen in normal weight PCOS patients treated with 600 mg of DCI daily for six to eight weeks.86 DCI supplementation has resulted not only in improvements in metabolic and hormonal parameters, but also resumption of menstrual cycles87,88 and reduced body mass index (BMI) in overweight or obese PCOS patients.89 It is important to note that some evidence suggests high-dose DCI supplementation may have a negative impact on oocyte maturation: one study found oocyte maturity diminished with DCI supplementation of 600 mg per day and higher, but not at 300 mg per day,90 and another found DCI-treated women had more immature oocytes than MI-treated women with PCOS.73 Myo-inositol plus d-chiro-inositol. Because of differences in their effects, it is possible that MI and DCI may have complementary actions.91,92 A randomized controlled trial compared the effects of six months combined treatment with 1,100 mg of MI plus 27.6 mg of DCI plus 400 mcg of folic acid to 400 mcg of folic acid per day in 46 women with PCOS. The 40:1 ratio of MI to DCI used in the treatment protocol was chosen to reflect normal conditions in the blood. MI plus DCI was more effective than folic acid alone in correcting hormonal disturbances and improving insulin sensitivity.93 Treatment with the same ratio of MI to DCI led to improved metabolic profiles and reduced cardiovascular risk in obese subjects with PCOS after six months.94 In another six-month trial, PCOS-affected women were treated with either MI plus DCI or MI alone. Markers of metabolic health improved in both groups, but those who received DCI plus MI had more improvement after three months of treatment.95 In PCOS patients undergoing in vitro fertilization, combination therapy with 1,100 mg MI plus 27.6 mg DCI daily resulted in improved oocyte and embryo quality, higher pregnancy rates, and was superior to 500 mg DCI per day alone.96 D-pinitol. D-Pinitol is 3-O-methyl-D-chiro-inositol that occurs naturally in several different foods, including legumes and citrus fruits.97 D-Pinitol is converted into d-chiro-inositol in the body. Like d-chiro-inositol, pinitol appears to favorably influence the action of insulin.98 In a double-blind study of patients with type 2 diabetes, administration of 600 mg of pinitol twice a day for three months reduced blood glucose concentration by 19.3%, decreased hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) concentration by 12.4% and significantly improved insulin resistance.99 In a shorter-term double-blind study, administration of pinitol at a dose of 20 mg per kg of body weight per day for four weeks decreased mean fasting plasma glucose concentration by 5.3%.100 N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) is a stable derivative of the sulfur-containing amino acid cysteine and an antioxidant that is needed for the production of glutathione, one of the body's most important natural antioxidants and detoxifiers. While cysteine is found in high protein foods, n-acetyl cysteine is not. A large body of evidence supports the use of NAC in women with PCOS. Improving Insulin Sensitivity Women with PCOS frequently have an abnormally high insulin response to sugars and refined starches. A 2002 study evaluated the effect of NAC on insulin secretion and peripheral insulin resistance in women with PCOS.101 The study subjects who had an exaggerated insulin response to a glucose challenge and were treated with NAC showed an improvement in insulin function in their peripheral tissues. The NAC treatment also produced a significant decline in testosterone levels and in free androgen index values. The researchers concluded, ""NAC may be a new treatment for the improvement of circulating insulin levels and insulin sensitivity in hyperinsulinemic patients with polycystic ovary syndrome.""102 Restoring Fertility NAC may also be useful for improving fertility in women with PCOS. In one study, NAC appeared to improve the effects of Clomid, the widely used fertility drug. Clomid plus NAC significantly improved ovulation rates in a study of 573 women with PCOS. According to the researchers, 52% of the study participants who took Clomid plus NAC ovulated, whereas only 18% ovulated in the Clomid alone group. The authors concluded: ""N-Acetyl cysteine is proved effective in inducing or augmenting ovulation in polycystic ovary patients.""103 Similarly, a study of Clomid-resistant women has shown that NAC appears to make Clomid more effective. In the study, 150 Clomid-resistant women with PCOS were divided into two groups: one group took Clomid and NAC. The other group took Clomid and a placebo. In the NAC group, 49.3% ovulated and 1.3% became pregnant. In contrast, in the placebo group, only 21% ovulated and there were no pregnancies.104 Worth noting, the same researchers compared the effects of a NAC-Clomid combination with the metformin-Clomid combination on ovulation induction in anovulatory Clomid-resistant women with PCOS. The efficacy of the metformin-Clomid combination therapy is significantly higher than that of NAC-Clomid for inducing ovulation and achieving pregnancy among Clomid-resistant PCOS patients.45 Tackling Homocysteine Women with PCOS are often given metformin to deal with their insulin problems. But metformin may increase homocysteine levels and many women with PCOS have high homocysteine levels to begin with.105 Elevated homocysteine is associated with coronary artery disease, heart attack, chronic fatigue, fibromyalgia, cognitive impairment, and cervical cancer. A 2009 study showed that people taking NAC for two months had a significant decrease in homocysteine levels.106 Magnesium Many women with PCOS have significantly low serum and total magnesium, contributing to the progression of insulin resistance to type 2 diabetes and heart disease.107 Magnesium insufficiency is common in poorly controlled type 2 diabetes patients. In one study, 128 patients with poorly controlled type 2 diabetes received a placebo or a supplement with either 500 mg or 1,000 mg of magnesium oxide (300 mg or 600 mg elemental magnesium) for 30 days. All patients were treated also with diet or diet plus oral medication to control blood glucose levels. Magnesium levels increased in the group receiving 1,000 mg magnesium oxide daily but did not significantly change in the placebo group or the group receiving 500 mg of magnesium. The author suggested prolonged use of magnesium in doses that are higher than usual is needed in patients with type 2 diabetes to improve control or prevent chronic complications.108 In a related study, 63 diabetics with below normal serum magnesium levels received either 2.5 grams of oral magnesium chloride daily or a placebo. At the end of the 16-week study period, those who received the supplement had higher blood levels of magnesium and improved control of diabetes, as suggested by lower hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels.109 Another study found that oral magnesium supplements helped insulin resistant individuals avoid developing type 2 diabetes.110 Since magnesium improves insulin-mediated glucose uptake and insulin secretion in type 2 diabetes patients, it is considered a critical mineral for women with PCOS. Chromium Research shows a clear link between chromium and glucose metabolism. Indeed, chromium is one of the most widely studied nutritional interventions in the treatment of glucose and insulin-related irregularities. Chromium picolinate specifically is the form that has been used in a number of studies on insulin resistance. Researchers at the University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio found that chromium picolinate (200 mcg/day) improves glucose tolerance when compared with a placebo111 in women with PCOS. Lipoic Acid Overwhelming evidence suggests that lipoic acid may be critical not only for maintaining optimal blood sugar levels (by helping the body use glucose), but also for supporting insulin sensitivity and key aspects of cardiovascular health, such as endothelial function. A review of experimental studies reveals that lipoic acid helps relieve several components of metabolic syndrome—a constellation of risk factors that often precedes full-blown type 2 diabetes. It appears that lipoic acid reduces blood pressure and insulin resistance, improves lipid profile, and reduces weight. Based on the results of key clinical studies, scientists are sanguine about lipoic acid’s potential as a therapeutic agent for individuals with metabolic syndrome.112 Similarly positive effects have been observed in women with PCOS. In a 16-week study, women with PCOS were given 600 mg of lipoic acid twice daily, and, over the course of the study period, exhibited a sharp improvement in insulin sensitivity, and a reduction in triglycerides. Lipoic acid therapy also is associated with an improved LDL-particle pattern (or “bad” cholesterol particles), indicating a reduction in cardiovascular risk.113 Vitamin D In an insightful associative study that highlighted the link between PCOS and vitamin D status, researchers found that women with higher blood levels of vitamin D were much less likely to be insulin resistant.114 A separate study found that vitamin D when administered with metformin was helpful for regulating the menstrual cycles in PCOS women.115 A study conducted by researchers at Columbia University found that Vitamin D combined with calcium supplementation helped normalize menstrual cycles for seven of 13 women with PCOS. Of the seven, two became pregnant and the others maintained normal menstrual cycles. These results suggest that abnormalities in calcium balance may be responsible, in part, for the arrested follicular development in women with PCOS and contribute to its pathogenesis.116 Omega-3 Fatty Acids Evidence suggests that the anti-inflammatory activity of omega-3 fatty acids ameliorates non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, a common condition in women with PCOS. In an Australian study, omega-3 fatty acid supplementation reduced liver fat content and other cardiovascular risk factors in women with PCOS, including triglycerides, and systolic and diastolic blood pressure. In particular, said the researchers, omega-3 fatty acids were helpful in reducing hepatic fat in PCOS women with hepatic steatosis, which is defined as liver fat content greater than 5%.117 Flaxseeds The powerful lignans—plant compounds that have both estrogenic and antiestrogenic properties—in flaxseed may help reduce androgen levels in PCOS women. Flaxseed consumption have been shown to stimulate sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) synthesis.118 Changes in SHBG concentration result in relatively large changes in the amount of free and bound hormones. In a 2007 study, daily flaxseed supplementation reduced androgen levels and hirsutism in PCOS patients, leading researchers to conclude, “The clinically-significant decrease in androgen levels with a concomitant reduction in hirsutism reported in this case study demonstrates a need for further research of flaxseed supplementation on hormonal levels and clinical symptoms of PCOS.”119 Cinnamon Scientists at the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) have been studying the effect of cinnamon on blood glucose for over a decade, leading to several interesting discoveries, including that of unique compounds in cinnamon bark that in laboratory studies produce a 20-fold increase in sugar metabolism.120,121 According to one government expert, “These polyphenolic polymers found in cinnamon may function as antioxidants, potentiate insulin action, and may be beneficial in the control of glucose intolerance and diabetes.”122 In a 2003 study, 60 diabetics taking 1, 3, or 6 grams/day of ground cinnamon for 40 days lowered their fasting serum glucose by 18% to 29%; triglycerides by 23% to 30%; LDL cholesterol by 7% to 27%; and total cholesterol by 12% to 26%.123 A 2007 study by researchers at Columbia University found that cinnamon reduced insulin resistance in fifteen women with PCOS. In the study, the women were divided into two groups: one group took cinnamon extract while the other group took a placebo. After eight weeks, the cinnamon group showed significant reductions in insulin resistance while the placebo group did not. The authors did point out that, ""A larger trial is needed to confirm the findings of this pilot study and to evaluate the effect of cinnamon extract on menstrual cyclicity.""124 Licorice Root A 2004 study by Italian researchers investigated the effect of licorice on androgen metabolism in nine healthy 22- to 26-year-old women in the luteal phase of their menstrual cycle and found that licorice reduces serum testosterone. The authors suggested that licorice could be considered an “adjuvant therapy of hirsutism and polycystic ovary syndrome."" This study was the first to follow up on earlier trials, which found that an herbal formula containing licorice reduced testosterone secretion in women with polycystic ovary syndrome.125-127 Spironolactone (Aldactone), an antagonist of mineralocorticoid and androgen receptors, is used as a primary medical treatment for hirsutism and female pattern hair loss. It is also associated with several side effects related to the diuretic activity of spironolactone. Interestingly, licorice was shown in a study of women with PCOS to counteract the side effects of spironolactone when the two were used in combination.128 Green Tea (Epigallocatechin Gallate) Green tea may be of benefit to women with PCOS. Green tea is known to have positive effects on glucose metabolism.129 In both human and animal studies, green tea has been shown to improve insulin sensitivity.130,131 Animal research suggests that green tea epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) may help prevent the onset of type 2 diabetes and slow its progression.132 A clinical study from Japan found that daily supplementation of green tea extract lowered the hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) level in individuals with borderline diabetes.133 Hemoglobin A1c is a form of hemoglobin that is used to help identify plasma glucose concentration over a period of time. Green tea also is thought to lower tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha.134 TNF-alpha is involved with systemic inflammation. Green tea is a potent antioxidant and, a study in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition showed that just 90 mg of EGCG before each meal increased the body’s 24-hour metabolism rate by 4% and the metabolism of fat by an impressive 40%.135 Spearmint A recent study by British researchers published in the journal Phytotherapy Research found a positive link between spearmint tea consumption and a reduction in hirsutism in PCOS women. In the study, 42 women were divided into two groups: one that took spearmint tea twice a day for a one-month period and the other a placebo herbal tea. The spearmint tea group showed significant decreases in free and total testosterone levels and an increase in LH and FSH, leading the researchers to conclude that “spearmint (tea) has the potential for use as a helpful and natural treatment for hirsutism in PCOS.”136 Saw Palmetto Saw palmetto inhibits the activity of an enzyme, 5-alpha reductase, thereby reducing the conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone, the more androgenic form of male hormone. This may have implications for reducing acne, excess facial and body hair, as well as male pattern hair loss. Oral administered saw palmetto has been studied as part of a formula that slowed hair loss and improved hair density in patients with testosterone related hair loss.137 Disclaimer and Safety Information This information (and any accompanying material) is not intended to replace the attention or advice of a physician or other qualified health care professional.

Some patients have lost or are losing hope by the time they come to see me, but with the right treatments the vast majority of them will succeed. The field of reproductive medicine has advanced so much in recent years that patients have more and better options for treatment. I am proud to be able to offer these exciting new breakthroughs to my patients. I enjoy the problem solving aspect of reproductive medicine. There are so many factors that contribute to a successful pregnancy that it's often like solving a puzzle to arrive at the best and most effective treatment for any given patient or family. I became a physician because I enjoy the close connection between scientific discovery and improving patients' lives. There are so many memorable moments in my career; I particularly love receiving baby announcements and seeing babies and happy families when they come back to visit.

Endocrine practice : official journal of the American College of Endocrinology and the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists Background: Obesity is a well-known risk factor for infertility. However, use of weight loss medications prior to conception is underutilized. The objectives of our study are to describe weight loss, pregnancy rates, and live birth rates after short-term phentermine use in women with obesity and infertility. Methods: This was a retrospective analysis of 55 women (18-45 years old) who were overweight or obese, diagnosed with infertility, and prescribed phentermine for weight loss in an ambulatory endocrinology clinic at a single, tertiary level academic medical center. Main outcome measures were mean percent weight change at 3 months after starting phentermine and pregnancy and live birth rates from start of phentermine to June 30, 2017. Results: Median duration of phentermine use was 70 days (Q1, Q3 [33, 129]). Mean SD percent weight change at 3 months after starting phentermine was -5.3 4.1% (p < 0.001). The pregnancy rate was 60% and live birth rate was 49%. There was no significant difference in pregnancy rates (52% vs. 68%, p = 0.23) or live birth rates (44% vs. 54%, p = 0.50) in women who lost 5% vs. <5% of their baseline weight. Number of metabolic comorbidities was negatively associated with pregnancy rate. Phentermine was generally well tolerated with no serious adverse events. Conclusions: Phentermine can produce clinically significant weight loss in women with obesity during the preconception period. Higher pregnancy or live birth rates were not observed with greater degree of weight loss with phentermine. INCREASED RISK OF SEVERE MATERNAL MORBIDITY AMONG INFERTILE WOMEN: ANALYSIS OF US CLAIMS DATA. Murugappan, G., Li, S., Lathi, R. B., Baker, V. L., Luke, B., Eisenberg, M. L. Severe maternal morbidity continues to be an issue of national and global concern and is increasing in incidence. The incidence of infertility is also on the rise, and infertile women experience a higher risk of incident chronic medical disease and cancer, suggesting that fertility may serve as a window to a woman's overall health.To investigate the risk of severe maternal morbidity by maternal fertility status.Retrospective cohort analysis using Optum's de-identifed Clinformatics Data Mart Database between 2003-2015. Infertile women stratified by infertility diagnosis, testing or treatment were compared to fertile women seeking routine gynecologic care. In both groups, only women who underwent pregnancy and delivery of a singleton during the follow up period were included. Main outcomes were severe maternal morbidity indicators, defined by the CDC, and identified by ICD-10 and CPT codes within 6 weeks of each delivery. Results were adjusted for maternal age, race, education, nulliparity, race, smoking, obesity, delivery mode, preterm birth, number of prenatal visits, and year of delivery.19,658 women comprised the infertile group and 525,695 women comprised the fertile group. The overall incidence of any severe maternal morbidity indicator was 7.0% among women receiving fertility treatment, 6.4% among women receiving a fertility diagnosis, 5.5% among women receiving fertility testing and 4.3% among fertile women.. Overall, infertile women had a significantly higher risk of developing any severe maternal morbidity indicator (AOR 1.22, CI 1.14-1.31, p<0.01) as well as a significantly higher risk of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) (AOR 1.48, CI 1.26 - 1.73, p<0.01), eclampsia (AOR 1.37, CI 1.05 - 1.79, p<0.01), heart failure during procedure or surgery (AOR 1.54, CI 1.21 - 1.97, p<0.01), internal injuries of the thorax, abdomen or pelvis (AOR 1.59, CI 1.12 - 2.26, p<0.01), intracranial injuries (AOR 1.77, CI 1.20- 2.61, p<0.01), pulmonary edema (AOR 2.18, CI 1.54 - 3.10, p<0.01), thrombotic embolism (AOR 1.58, CI 1.14 - 2.17, p<0.01), and blood transfusion (AOR 1.50, CI 1.30 - 1.72, p<0.01) compared to fertile women. Fertile women did not face a significantly higher risk of any maternal morbidity indicator compared to infertile women. In subgroup analysis by maternal race/ethnicity, the likelihood of severe morbidity was significantly higher among fertile Black women compared to fertile Caucasian women. There was no difference between infertile Black and Caucasian women after multivariable adjustment.Using an insurance claims database, we report that women diagnosed with infertility and women receiving fertility treatment experience a significantly higher risk of multiple indicators of severe maternal morbidity compared to fertile women. The increased risk of severe maternal morbidity noted among fertile Black women compared to fertile Caucasian women is attenuated among infertile Black women, who face similar risks as infertile Caucasian women. Association between preconception paternal health and pregnancy loss in the USA: an analysis of US claims data. Kasman, A. M., Zhang, C. A., Li, S., Lu, Y., Lathi, R. B., Stevenson, D. K., Shaw, G. M., Eisenberg, M. L. Is preconception paternal health associated with pregnancy loss?Poor preconception paternal health is associated with a higher risk of pregnancy loss as confirmed in sensitivity analyses accounting for maternal age and health.Preconception paternal health can negatively impact perinatal outcomes.Retrospective cohort study of US insurance claims database from 2009 to 2016 covering 958804 pregnancies.US insurance claims database including women, men and pregnancies within the USA between 2007 and 2016. Paternal preconception health status (e.g. metabolic syndrome diagnoses (MetS), Charlson comorbidity index (CCI) and individual chronic disease diagnoses) was examined in relation to pregnancy loss (e.g. ectopic pregnancy, miscarriage and stillbirth).In all, 958804 pregnancies were analyzed. The average paternal age was 35.3years (SD 5.3) and maternal age was 33.1years (SD 4.4). Twenty-two percent of all pregnancies ended in a loss. After adjusting for maternal factors, the risk of pregnancy loss increased with increasing paternal comorbidity. For example, compared to men with no components of MetS, the risk of pregnancy loss increased for men with one (relative risk (RR) 1.10, 95% CI 1.09-1.12), two (RR 1.15, 95% CI 1.13-1.17) or three or more (RR 1.19, 95% CI 1.14-1.24) components. Specifically, less healthy men had a higher risk of siring a pregnancy ending in spontaneous abortion, stillbirth and ectopic pregnancies. Similar patterns remained with other measures of paternal health (e.g. CCI, chronic diseases, etc.). When stratifying by maternal age as well as maternal health, a similar pattern of increasing pregnancy loss risk for men with 1, 2 or 3+ MetS was observed. A statistically significant but weak association between timing of pregnancy loss and paternal health was found.Retrospective study design covering only employer insured individuals may limit generalizability.Optimization of a father's health may improve pregnancy outcomes.National Institutes of Health National Center for Advancing Translational Science Clinical and Translational Science Award (UL1 TR001085).

To compare chromosome testing of miscarriage specimens between traditional cytogenetic analysis and molecular karyotyping using single nucleotide polymorphism microarrays (SNP) and array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH).Prospective blinded cohort study.University-based practice.Women undergoing dilation and curettage for first-trimester miscarriage between March 2014 and December2015.None.Chromosome analysis from chorionic villi separated equally and submitted for cytogenetics, SNP microarray, and aCGH testing.Sixty samples were analyzed, of which 47 (78%) were chromosomally abnormal. A correct call was defined when a result was concordant with at least one other testing platform. The correct call rate was 85%, 93%, and 85% using cytogenetics, SNP array, and aCGH, respectively. We found a 33% overall discordance rate between results. Discordances were due to maternal cell contamination, balanced chromosome rearrangements, polyploidy, and placental mosaicism. Mosaicism was detected in 18% of all samples. Growth failure occurred in four samples sent to cytogenetics, of which three were chromosomally abnormal by molecular testing.This study demonstrates the many technical limitations of the three testing modalities. Our rates of maternal cell contamination were low, but it is important to note that this is a commonly reported limitation of cytogenetics. Given the similar overall performance of the three testing modalities, providers may choose a method based on individual availability and consideration of limitations as it applies to each clinical scenario. The unexpected high rate of placental mosaicism warrants further investigation.

To analyze the transcriptomic profile of endometrial gene alterations during the window of implantation in infertile obese patients.Multicenter, prospective, case-control study.Three academic medical centers for reproductive medicine.Infertile patients, stratified into body mass index (BMI) categories according to the World Health Organization guidelines, were included in the study.Endometrial samples were obtained from women undergoing standardized estrogen and P replacement cycles after 5days of vaginal P supplementation.To identify endometrial gene expression alterations that occur during the window of implantation in infertile obese patients as compared with infertile normal-weight controls using a microarray analysis.XCL1, XCL2, HMHA1, S100A1, KLRC1, COTL1, COL16A1, KRT7, and MFAP5 are significantly dysregulated during the window of implantation in the receptive endometrium of obese patients. COL16A1, COTL1, HMHA1, KRCL1, XCL1, and XCL2 were down-regulated and KRT7, MFAP5, and S100A1 were up-regulated in the endometrium of obese patients. These genes are mainly involved in chemokine, cytokine, and immune system activity and in the structural extracellular matrix and protein-binding molecular functions.Obesity is associated with significant endometrial transcriptomic differences as compared with non-obese subjects. Altered endometrial gene expression in obese patients may contribute to the lower implantation rates and increased miscarriage rates seen in obese infertile patients.NCT02205866. View details for Intent to treat analysis of in vitro fertilization and preimplantation genetic screening versus expectant management in patients with recurrent pregnancy loss. Murugappan, G., Shahine, L. K., Perfetto, C. O., Hickok, L. R., Lathi, R. B. In an intent to treat analysis, are clinical outcomes improved in recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL) patients undergoing IVF and preimplantation genetic screening (PGS) compared with patients who are expectantly managed (EM)?Among all attempts at PGS or EM among RPL patients, clinical outcomes including pregnancy rate, live birth (LB) rate and clinical miscarriage (CM) rate were similar.The standard of care for management of patients with RPL is EM. Due to the prevalence of aneuploidy in CM, PGS has been proposed as an alternate strategy for reducing CM rates and improving LB rates.Retrospective cohort study of 300 RPL patients treated between 2009 and 2014.Among two academic fertility centers, 112 RPL patients desired PGS and 188 patients chose EM. Main outcomes measured were pregnancy rate and LB per attempt and CM rate per pregnancy. One attempt was defined as an IVF cycle followed by a fresh embryo transfer or a frozen embryo transfer (PGS group) and 6 months trying to conceive (EM group).In the IVF group, 168 retrievals were performed and 38 cycles canceled their planned PGS. Cycles in which PGS was intended but cancelled had a significantly lower LB rate (15 versus 36%, P = 0.01) and higher CM rate (50 versus 14%, P < 0.01) compared with cycles that completed PGS despite similar maternal ages. Of the 130 completed PGS cycles, 74% (n = 96) yielded at least one euploid embryo. Clinical pregnancy rate per euploid embryo transfer was 72% and LB rate per euploid embryo transfer was 57%. Among all attempts at PGS or EM, clinical outcomes were similar. Median time to pregnancy was 6.5 months in the PGS group and 3.0 months in the EM group.The largest limitation is the retrospective study design, in which patients who elected for IVF/PGS may have had different clinical prognoses than patients who elected for expectant management. In addition, the definition of one attempt at conception for PGS and EM groups was different between the groups and can introduce potential confounders. For example, it was not confirmed that patients in the EM group were trying to conceive for each month of the 6-month period.Success rates with PGS are limited by the high incidence of cycles that intend but cancel PGS or cycles that do not reach transfer. Counseling RPL patients on their treatment options should include not only success rates with PGS per euploid embryo transferred, but also LB rate per initiated PGS cycle. Furthermore, patients who express an urgency to conceive should be counseled that PGS may not accelerate time to conception.None.N/A.N/A.N/A.

View details for Pregnancy outcomes in women with chronic endometritis and recurrent pregnancy loss. McQueen, D. B., Perfetto, C. O., Hazard, F. K., Lathi, R. B. To evaluate the prevalence of chronic endometritis (CE) in women with recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL) and compare pregnancy outcomes in women with and without CE.Case-control observational study.Academic fertility practice.Women with two or more pregnancy losses.Hematoxylin and eosin (H & E) staining was performed on all endometrial biopsies and plasma cells were identified by morphology. Immunohistochemical (IHC) staining for CD138 was later applied to all tissue samples. Charts were reviewed to evaluate the outcome of the next clinical intrauterine pregnancy.Miscarriage rate and live birth rate.A total of 107 women met inclusion criteria. The use of CD138 IHC staining resulted in a significantly higher prevalence of CE compared with the use of H & E staining and morphological assessment alone (56% [60/107] vs. 13% [14/107]). The 51 women with untreated CE were compared with the 45 women without CE by CD138 staining. Among those women with a subsequent pregnancy, the live birth rate in the next clinical intrauterine pregnancy after endometrial evaluation was 67.6% (23/34) in women with untreated CE and 87.1% (27/31) in women without CE. Age, body mass index (BMI), results of RPL evaluation, and number of prior losses were not significantly different between the two groups.CD138 IHC staining of endometrial biopsies in women with RPL provides increased sensitivity when screening for CE compared with H & E staining and morphological assessment alone. Untreated CE may contribute to poor pregnancy outcomes and deserves further investigation in a larger cohort.

L. To examine the relationship between the maternal serum bisphenol A (BPA) concentration at the time of the missed menstrual cycle and miscarriage risk.Retrospective cohort of prospectively collected serum samples.Academic fertility center.Women presenting for early pregnancy monitoring with singleton pregnancies.Stored serum samples from 4 to 5weeks' gestation analyzed for conjugated serum BPA concentrations.Live birth, miscarriage, and chromosome content of miscarriage.With the 115 women included in the study, there were 47 live births and 68 clinical miscarriages (46 aneuploid and 22 euploid). Median conjugated BPA concentrations were higher in the women who had miscarriages than in those who had live births (0.101 vs. 0.075ng/mL). Women with the highest quartile of conjugated BPA had an increased relative risk of miscarriage (1.83; 95% CI, 1.14-2.96) compared with the women in the lowest quartile. We found a similar increase risk for both euploid and aneuploid miscarriages.Maternal conjugated BPA was associated with a higher risk of aneuploid and euploid miscarriage in this cohort. The impact of reducing individual exposure on future pregnancy outcomes deserves further study.

PURPOSE: To assess whether preimplantation genetic testing for aneuploidies (PGT-A) at the blastocyst stage improves clinical outcomes compared with transfer of embryos without PGT-A in poor ovarian response (POR) patients.METHODS: Retrospective cohort study of IVF cycles from 2016 to 2019 at a single academic fertility center. IVF cycles with POR and four or fewer oocytes retrieved were stratified into PGT-A (n=241) and non-PGT (n=112) groups. In PGT-A cycles, trophectoderm biopsy, next-generation sequencing with 24-chromosome screening, and single euploid frozen embryo transfer were performed. In non-PGT cycles, fresh or frozen transfer of untested embryos on day 3 or 5 was performed. Main outcomes included live birth rate and miscarriage rate per retrieval.RESULT(S): Patients who underwent PGT-A cycles were significantly less likely to reach embryo transfer compared with those who underwent non-PGT cycles (13.7% vs 70.6%). The live birth rate per retrieval did not differ between the PGT-A and non-PGT groups (6.6% vs 5.4%). Overall, the miscarriage rate was low. The PGT-A group demonstrated a significantly lower miscarriage rate per retrieval (0.4% vs 3.6%) as well as per pregnancy (5.9% vs 40.0%) compared with the non-PGT group. The number needed to treat to avoid one clinical miscarriage was 31 PGT-A cycles.CONCLUSION(S): PGT-A did not improve live birth rate per retrieval in POR patients with four or fewer oocytes retrieved. PGT-A was associated with a lower miscarriage rate; however, a fairly large number of PGT-A cycles were needed to prevent one miscarriage. ENDOMETRIAL BIOPSY TIMING IS A MAJOR INFLUENCING FACTOR IN THE DIAGNOSIS OF CHRONIC ENDOMETRITIS Ryan, E., Tolani, A. T., Folkins, A., Lathi, R. B. View details for The impact of culture conditions on blastocyst formation and aneuploidy rates: a comparison between single-step and sequential media in a large academic practice. Deng, J., Zhao, Q., Cinnioglu, C., Kayali, R., Lathi, R. B., Behr, B. PURPOSE: To compare a single-step medium with a sequential medium on human blastocyst development rates, aneuploidy rates, and clinical outcomes.METHODS: Retrospective cohort study of IVF cycles that used Sage advantage sequential medium (n = 347) and uninterrupted Sage 1-step medium (n = 519) from July 1, 2016, to December 31, 2017, in an academic fertility center. Main outcome measures are blastocyst formation rates per two-pronuclear (2PN) oocyte and aneuploidy rates per biopsy.RESULTS: Of all IVF cycles, single-step medium yielded higher blastocyst formation rate (51.7% vs 43.4%) but higher aneuploidy rate (54.0% vs 45.8%) compared with sequential medium. When stratified by maternal age, women under age 38 had no difference in blastocyst formation (52.2% vs 50.2%) but a higher aneuploidy rate (44.5% vs 36.4%) resulting in a lower number of euploid blastocysts per cycle (2.6 vs 3.3) when using single-step medium compared to sequential medium. In cycles used single-step medium, patients age 38 had higher blastocyst rate (48.0% vs 33.6%), but no difference in aneuploidy rate (68.8% vs 66.0%) or number of euploid embryos (0.8 vs 1.1). For patients reaching euploid embryo transfer, there was no difference in clinical pregnancy rates, miscarriage rates, or live birth rates between two culture media systems.CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates an increase in aneuploidy in young women whose embryos were cultured in a single-step medium compared to sequential medium. This study highlights the importance of culture conditions on embryo ploidy and the need to stratify by patient age when examining the impact of culture conditions on overall cycle potential. Levonorgestrel IUD: is there a long-lasting effect on return to fertility? Intrauterine devices (IUDs) are effective and safe long-acting reversible contraceptive methods for preventing unplanned pregnancies. While extensive studies were conducted to evaluate return to fertility after removal of IUDs, majority of them were focused on multiparous women using copper IUDs. Current trends indicate increased use of levonorgestrel (LNG) IUDs in nulliparous women for very long periods of time, with both nulliparity and long duration of LNG-IUD use being potentially associated with trends towards longer time to conception post removal. Understanding the effects that LNG-IUDs may have on endometrial morphology and gene expression has important implications to further understanding their mechanism of action. Studies examining endometrial gene expression show persistent changes in receptivity markers up to 1 year after removal of an inert IUD, and no similar studies have been performed after removal of LNG-IUDs. Given the current gap in the literature and trends in LNG-IUD use in nulliparous young women, studies are needed that specifically look at the interaction of nulliparity, long-term use of LNG-IUD, and return to normal fertility. Herein, we review the available literature on the mechanism of action of IUDs with a specific focus on the effect on endometrial gene expression profile changes associated with IUDs.

View details for View details for Anti-Mullerian hormone in association with euploid embryo transfer outcomes. RESEARCH QUESTION: To investigate the association between anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH) concentration and maternal age with single euploid cryopreserved embryo transfer.DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study from 2014 to 2018 at an academic medical centre, including 389 cycles of IVF with 24-chromosome Day 5/6 preimplantation genetic testing for aneuploidies (PGT-A). Multivariate logistic regression was used to study AMH and age in relation to IVF outcomes (positive beta human chorionic gonadotrophin [bHCG], ongoing pregnancy and pregnancy loss rates) for patients with at least one euploid embryo for transfer, controlling for patient and cycle confounders.RESULTS: In this cohort the overall unadjusted positive bHCG rate was 69.2% and ongoing pregnancy rate was 52.7% per transfer, while the pregnancy loss rate was 23.4% per cycle with positive bHCG. Multivariate analysis found that compared with the reference group of AMH 1 to <5 ng/ml, AMH <1 and 5+ did not have any significant difference in positive bHCG (odds ratio, OR 0.65 [0.30-1.44] and 1.27 [0.61-2.65] for AMH <1 and AMH 5+, respectively) or ongoing pregnancy (OR 0.80 [0.43-1.50] and 1.41 [0.68-2.90]). However, AMH <1 had statistically significant lower euploid miscarriage rates compared with the reference group with OR 0.32 (0.12-0.85, P=0.022); AMH 5+ did not have any statistical difference in miscarriage rate. Neither age at retrieval nor age at transfer were significantly associated with transfer outcomes.CONCLUSIONS: AMH concentration was not associated with positive bHCG or ongoing pregnancy for euploid embryo transfers after adjustment for potential confounders. Maternal age was not associated with euploid transfer outcomes. Further study is warranted in larger cohorts.

Murugappan, G., Li, S., Lathi, R. B., Baker, V. L., Eisenberg, M. L. STUDY QUESTION: Is female infertility associated with higher risk of cancer?SUMMARY ANSWER: Although absolute risks are low, infertility is associated with higher risk of cancer compared to a group of non-infertile women.WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Infertile women are at higher risk of hormone-sensitive cancers. Information on risk of non-gynecologic cancers is rare and conflicting, and the effect of pregnancy on these risk associations is known for only a minority of cancer types.STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: Retrospective cohort analysis between 2003 and 2016 using an insurance claims database.PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: In all, 64 345 infertile women identified by infertility diagnosis, testing or treatment were compared to 3 128 345 non-infertile patients seeking routine gynecologic care. Women with prior diagnosis of cancer or within 6 months of index event were excluded. Main outcomes were development of any malignancy and individual cancers as identified by ICD-9/ICD-10 codes. Results were adjusted for age at index date, index year, nulliparity, race, smoking, obesity, number of visits per year and highest level of education.MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: Infertile women had an overall higher risk of developing cancer compared to non-infertile women (2.0 versus 1.7%, adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) = 1.18; CI: 1.12-1.24). In addition, the risk of uterine cancer (0.10 versus 0.06%, aHR = 1.78; CI: 1.39-2.28), ovarian cancer (0.14 versus 0.09%, aHR 1.64; CI: 1.33-2.01), lung cancer (0.21 versus 0.21%, aHR = 1.38; CI: 1.01-1.88), thyroid cancer (0.21 versus 0.16%, aHR = 1.29; CI: 1.09-1.53), leukemia (0.10 versus 0.06%, aHR = 1.55; CI: 1.21-1.98) and liver and gallbladder cancer (0.05 versus 0.03%, aHR = 1.59; CI: 1.11-2.30) were higher in infertile women compared to non-infertile women. In a subgroup analysis of women in each cohort who became pregnant and had a delivery during enrollment, the risk of uterine and ovarian cancer were similar between infertile and non-infertile women. In a subgroup analysis excluding women with PCOS and endometriosis from both cohorts, the risk of uterine cancer was similar between infertile and non-infertile women.LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: Absolute risk of cancer was low, average follow up for each individual was limited, and average age at index date was limited. Insurance databases have known limitations.WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: Using claims-based data, we report that infertile women may have a higher risk of certain cancers in the years after infertility evaluation; continued follow up should be considered after reproductive goals are achieved.STUDY FUNDING/COMPETING INTEREST(S): None. Increased Risk of Incident Chronic Medical Conditions in Infertile Women: Analysis of Us Claims Data. Murugapppan, G., Li, S., Lathi, R. B., Baker, V. L., Eisenberg, M. L. BACKGROUND: The risk of common chronic medical conditions among infertile women is not known.OBJECTIVE: To study the association between female infertility and risk of incident chronic disease.STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cohort analysis using the Optum de-identified Clinformatics Datamart from 2003-2016. 64,345 infertile women were identified by infertility diagnosis, testing or treatment and compared to 3,128,345 non-infertile patients seeking routine gynecologic care. Women with prior diagnosis of the relevant chronic disease or cancer or with either diagnosis within six months of index event were excluded. Main outcome was diagnosis of incident chronic disease as identified by ICD-9/ICD-10 codes. Results were adjusted for age, index year, nulliparity, race, smoking, obesity, number of visits per year and highest level of education.RESULTS: Infertile patients were more likely to develop diabetes (aHR 1.44, CI 1.38-1.49), renal disease (aHR 1.22, CI 1.12-1.32), liver disease (aHR 1.25, CI 1.20-1.30), cerebrovascular disease (aHR 1.26, CI 1.15-1.38), ischemic heart disease (aHR 1.16, CI 1.09-1.24), other heart disease (aHR 1.16, CI 1.12-1.20), and drug abuse (aHR 1.24, CI 1.15-1.33) compared to non-infertile patients. Infertile patients were significantly less likely to develop alcohol abuse (aHR 0.86, CI 0.79-0.95) compared to non-infertile patients. Risk associations were similar after excluding women with PCOS and POI. In subgroup analyses of women who underwent pregnancy and childbirth during enrollment, several previously noted risk associations were attenuated compared to the overall cohort.CONCLUSION: While the absolute risk of chronic disease is low, infertility is associated with increased risk of incident chronic disease compared to a group of non-infertile women. Antimullerian hormone is a predictor of live birth in patients with recurrent pregnancy loss. Background: Ovarian reserve testing is not routinely performed in the evaluation of recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL). The objective of this study was to determine if AMH levels are predictive of live birth rate in RPL patients pursuing expectant management (EM).Methods: Retrospective cohort study of RPL patients. Patients tried to conceive spontaneously for 12 calendar months or until they achieved a live birth, whichever occurred first. All patients with the intent to conceive were included regardless of final outcome.Results: One hundred fifty-five RPL patients treated from 2009 to 2017 were included. In a univariate logistic regression, AMH<1ng/mL was associated with decreased likelihood of live birth (OR 0.38; CI 0.16-0.87, p=0.03) and increasing age (OR 0.91; CI 0.83-0.99, p=0.04). Likelihood of live birth was not significantly associated with BMI (OR 1.21; CI 0.83-1.77, p=0.31), three or four or more prior pregnancy losses (OR 0.93; CI 0.40-2.22, p=0.87 and OR 0.52; CI 0.19-1.42, p=0.20, respectively) and prior live births (OR 1.00; CI 0.48-2.08, p=0.99). AMH <1ng/mL was shown to be a stronger predictor of live birth than age using a multivariate model adjusting for age, AMH, and time to conception.Conclusions: AMH<1ng/mL is associated with decreased likelihood of live birth among RPL patients pursuing EM, and may be a stronger predictor of live birth than age in this population. Miscarriage chromosome testing: Indications, benefits and methodologies. Rapid advances in genomics have expanded the use of chromosome testing following miscarriage. In addition to conventional cytogenetics, the availability of single nucleotide polymorphism microarray technology and array comparative geneomic hybridization have provided further options for clinicians. This review will cover the indications for testing and the advantages/disadvantages of the various methodologies available. IS ANTIMULLERIAN HORMONE (AMH) PREDICTIVE OF REPRODUCTIVE POTENTIAL IN PATIENTS WITH RECURRENT PREGNANCY LOSS (RPL)? View details for Are blastocyst aneuploidy rates different between fertile and infertile populations? Kort, J. D., McCoy, R. C., Demko, Z., Lathi, R. B. This study aimed to determine if patients with infertility or recurrent pregnancy loss have higher rates of embryo aneuploidy than fertile controls.This was a retrospective review of all pre-implantation genetic screening (PGS) cases processed by a single reference lab prior to March 2014 after a blastocyst biopsy. Cases were excluded if no indication for PGS was designated or patients were translocation carriers. The fertile control group consisted of patients undergoing IVF with PGS for sex selection only. The comparison cohorts included those with recurrent pregnancy loss, male factor infertility, unexplained infertility, prior failed IVF, or previous aneuploid conceptions. A quasi-binomial regression model was used to assess the relationship between the dependent variable, aneuploidy rate and the independent variables, maternal age and reason for PGS. A quasi-Poisson regression model was used to evaluate the relationship between similar independent variables and the number of blastocyst biopsies per case.The initial study population consisted of 3378 IVF-PGS cycles and 18,387 analyzed trophectoderm samples. Controlling for maternal age, we observed an increased rate of aneuploidy among patients with recurrent pregnancy loss (OR 1.330, p<0.001), prior aneuploid pregnancy (OR 1.439, p<0.001), or previous failed IVF cycles (OR 1.356, p=0.0012) compared to fertile controls. Patients with unexplained and male factor infertility did not have a significantly different aneuploidy rate than controls (p>0.05). The increase in aneuploidy in patients with RPL and prior IVF failure was driven by both an increase in meiotic (OR 1.488 and 1.508, p<0.05) and mitotic errors (1.269 and 1.393, p<0.05) relative to fertile controls, while patients with prior aneuploid pregnancies had only an increased risk of meiotic error aneuploidies (OR 1.650, p<0.05).Patients with recurrent pregnancy loss, previous IVF failures, and prior aneuploid pregnancies have a significantly higher, age-independent, aneuploidy rate compared to patients without infertility.

Crochet, P., Lathi, R. B., Dahan, M. H., Ocampo, J., Nutis, M., Nezhat, C. R. The aim of this study was to examine the surgical findings at repeated surgeries for endometriosis and to compare disease progression in patients after IVF to those without interval fertility treatments.A retrospective case-control study set at the referral center for gynecologic endoscopy at Stanford University. Women who had two surgeries for treatment of symptomatic endometriosis since 1997 were searched in the database. Twenty-one women were identified who underwent IVF treatment between the two procedures (IVF group), and compared to 36 women who did not receive any fertility treatment (controls). The main outcomes were time to recurrence and surgical findings including rASRM score. The presence and size of endometrioma, rectovaginal and para-rectal spaces location of endometriosis were also compared between the two surgical procedures.Demographics in the two groups were similar. The change in rASRM score between surgeries was not significantly different (P=0.80) between the two groups. There was no difference between the two groups in the size and number of pathology proven endometriomas as well as no difference in the presence of rectovaginal and pararectal endometriosis.No significant difference was found in the two groups, suggesting that IVF treatment does not lead to an accelerated progression of endometriosis in patients with recurrence. Environmental exposure to endocrine-disrupting chemicals and miscarriage. Establishment of early pregnancy is the result of complex biochemical interactions between the decidua and blastocyst. Any alteration in this chemical dialogue has the potential to result in adverse pregnancy outcomes including miscarriage. Sporadic miscarriage is the most common complication of pregnancy and can be caused by multiple factors. While the most common cause of miscarriage is genetic abnormalities in the fetus, other contributing factors certainly can play a role in early loss. One such factor is environmental exposure, in particular to endocrine-disrupting chemicals, which has the potential to interfere with endogenous hormone action. These effects can be deleterious, especially in early pregnancy when the hormonal milieu surrounding implantation is in delicate balance. The purpose of this paper is to review the current evidence on the role of environmental toxins in reproduction.

To study pregnancy outcomes between South Asian and Caucasian women undergoing frozen blastocyst transfer cycles.Retrospective cohort study.Not applicable.Caucasian and South Asian patients undergoing frozen blastocyst transfer between January 2011 and December2014.Not applicable.Live birth rate.A total of 196 Caucasian and 117 South Asian women were included in our study. Indians were on average 2.2years younger than Caucasian women (34.9 vs. 37.1years), and were more likely to be nulliparous (59% vs. 43%). All other baseline characteristics were similar. In women undergoing their first frozen ET cycle, implantation rate (49% vs. 47%), clinical pregnancy rate (PR; 54% vs. 49%), and live birth rate (43% vs. 43%) were similar between South Asians and Caucasians, respectively. In patients who underwent a prior fresh blastocyst transfer, the live birth rate was significantly lower in South Asian versus Caucasian women (21% vs. 37%).Our data demonstrate that IVF outcomes are better in frozen versus fresh cycles among South Asian women. The IVF clinics may wish to consider these findings when counseling South Asian patients about the timing of ET.

A., Jungheim, E. S. The purpose of this research was to study whether methotrexate (MTX) as treatment for ectopic pregnancy (EP) impacts the future fertility of women undergoing assisted reproductive technology (ART) METHODS: In a systematic review and multi-center retrospective cohort from four academic and private fertility centers, 214 women underwent an ART cycle before and after receiving MTX as treatment for an EP. Measures of ovarian reserve and responsiveness and rates of clinical pregnancy (CP) and live birth (LB) were compared in the ART cycles prior and subsequent to MTX.Seven studies were identified in the systematic review, and primary data from four institutions was included in the final analysis. Women were significantly older in post-MTX cycles (35.3 vs 34.7years). There were no differences in follicle stimulating hormone, antral follicle count, duration of stimulation, oocytes retrieved, or fertilization rate between pre- and post-MTX cycles. However, post-MTX cycles received a significantly higher total dose of gonadotropins (4206 vs 3961IU). Overall, 42% of women achieved a CP and 35% achieved a LB in the post-MTX ART cycle, which is similar to national statistics. Although no factors were identified that were predictive of LB in young women, the number of oocytes retrieved in the previous ART cycle and current AFC were predictive of LB (AUC 0.76, 0.75) for the older women.MTX does not influence ovarian reserve, response to gonadotropin stimulation, and CP or LB rate after ART. MTX remains a safe and effective treatment option for women with asymptomatic EPs. Patient Experience with Karyotyping After First Trimester Miscarriage: A National Survey. McNally, L., Huynh, D., Keller, J., Dikan, J., Rabinowitz, M., Lathi, R. B. To assess the frequency of chromosome testing after first trimester miscarriage as well as to investigate patient experiences.An anonymous online questionnaire was developed and made available. Inclusion criteria were female, age 18, first trimester miscarriage, occurrence of miscarriage within the past year, miscarriage care provided in the United States, and survey completion.Of the 980 women who started the survey, 448 met inclusion criteria. Of those, 37 participants had chromosome testing on the miscarriage specimen. Of those who did not have testing, 66% said they wished they had done so at the time of miscarriage, and 67% said they would still want testing if it were available today. There was no correlation between patient age and chromosome testing. Chromosome testing increased in frequency with higher number of miscarriages, although the low number of women with chromosome testing limits our ability to draw definitive conclusions. On average, providers needed to spend 15-20 minutes with patients for them to feel like it was ""enough time.""In this national survey we found that chromosome testing is performed in approximately 8% of first trimester miscarriages. Our data indicate that the majority of patients experiencing first trimester miscarriage desire chromosome testing. Increased body mass index negatively impacts blastocyst formation rate in normal responders undergoing in vitro fertilization The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of female BMI and metabolic dysfunction on blastocyst formation rate.This was a retrospective cohort study that was performed in an academic center for reproductive medicine. Patients who were normal weight, overweight with metabolic dysfunction, or obese who had 6 oocytes retrieved in a fresh IVF cycle were included in the study. The blastocyst formation rate was calculated from the number of 5 cell embryos on day 3 observed in culture until day 5 or day 6. Only good quality blastocysts were included in the calculation as defined by a morphologic grade of 3BB or better.The blastocyst formation rate was significantly better in the normal-weight controls versus overweight/obese patients (57.2 versus 43.6%, p<0.007). There was no difference in blastocyst formation between the patients with a BMI 25-29.9kg/m(2) with metabolic dysfunction and those with a BMI 30kg/m(2).The maternal metabolic environment has a significant impact on embryo quality as measured by blastocyst formation. A decreased blastocyst formation rate is likely a significant contributor to poorer reproductive outcomes in overweight and obese women with infertility. View details for Frozen blastocyst embryo transfer using a supplemented natural cycle protocol has a similar live birth rate compared to a programmed cycle protocol Lathi, R. B., Chi, Y., Liu, J., Saravanabavanandhan, B., Hegde, A., Baker, V. L. The purpose of this study is to compare outcomes for a supplemented natural cycle with a programmed cycle protocol for frozen blastocyst transfer.A retrospective analysis was performed of frozen autologous blastocyst transfers, at a single academic fertility center (519 supplemented natural cycles and 106 programmed cycles). Implantation, clinical pregnancy, miscarriage, and live birth and birth weight were compared using Pearson's Chi-squared test, T-test, or Fisher's exact test.There was no significant difference between natural and programmed frozen embryo transfers with respect to implantation (21.9 vs. 18.1%), clinical pregnancy (35.5 vs. 29.2%), and live birth rates (27.7 vs. 23.6%). Mean birth weights were also similar between natural and programmed cycles for singletons (3354 vs. 3340g) and twins (2422 vs. 2294g)Frozen blastocyst embryo transfers using supplemented natural or programmed protocols experience similar success rates. Patient preference should be considered in choosing a protocol. View details for Aneuploidy rates and blastocyst formation after biopsy of morulae and early blastocysts on day 5. Kort, J. D., Lathi, R. B., Brookfield, K., Baker, V. L., Zhao, Q., Behr, B. R. Studies have demonstrated high implantation rates after trophectoderm biopsy of day 5 expanded blastocysts. However, biopsy of cleavage stage embryos may adversely affect embryo development and implantation. No studies have assessed the utility of day 5 morulae and early blastocyst biopsy. This study sought to better understandthese slower embryos' aneuploidy rates and implantation potential.This was a retrospective review of all autologous IVF cycles utilizing PGS at a single academic infertility center.The biopsy of day 5 morulae and early blastocysts provided 22% additional euploid blastocysts available for fresh day 6 transfer compared to day 5 biopsy of only expanded blastocysts. Aneuploidy did correlate with embryo stage on day 5, even after controlling for maternal age, with 16% of morulae and 35% of blastocysts being euploid. The majority (83%) of euploid morulae progressed to the blastocyst stage by day 6. Experience transferring slower developing embryos is limited, but preliminary pregnancy and implantation rates appear similar to euploid embryos biopsied as expanded blastocysts.The biopsy of all non-arrested embryos on day 5 provides genetic information for all blastocysts on day 6, increasing the pool of euploid blastocysts available for fresh transfer and avoiding the need to cryopreserve developmentally competent embryos without genetic information. Expression of interleukin-22 in decidua of patients with early pregnancy and unexplained recurrent pregnancy loss. Perfetto, C. O., Fan, X., Dahl, S., Krieg, S., Westphal, L. M., Lathi, R. B., Nayak, N. R. Researchers have hypothesized that an imbalance of immune cells in the uterine decidua and a dysfunction in cytokines they produce may contribute to recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL). The objective of this study was to determine if IL-22, IL-23 and IL-17 are expressed abnormally in the decidua of patients with RPL compared to those women with a normal pregnancy. We also sought to confirm that uterine natural killer (uNK) cells are lower in the decidua of patients with RPL, as well as identify IL-22 expression by uNK cells.After meeting strict inclusion criteria, maternal decidua of nine patients with unexplained RPL and a confirmed euploid fetal loss, and 11 gestational age-matched patients undergoing elective pregnancy termination were included in our analysis. Quantitative real time-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was performed to quantify RNA expression, Western blot was performed to quantify protein expression and immunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed to identify IL-22 and uNK cells.We found that women with unexplained RPL and a euploid fetal loss had significantly less gene and protein expression of IL-22 in the decidua. Additionally, we found that IL-22 is primarily expressed by uNK cells in the decidua.In conclusion, our results suggest that lower levels of IL-22 in the uterine decidua in patients with unexplained RPL may contribute to a disruption of decidual homeostasis and ultimately lead to early pregnancy loss.

Cost-effectiveness analysis of preimplantation genetic screening and in vitro fertilization versus expectant management in patients with unexplained recurrent pregnancy loss To determine whether invitro fertilization with preimplantation genetic screening (IVF/PGS) is cost effective compared with expectant management in achieving live birth for patients with unexplained recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL).Decision analytic model comparing costs and clinical outcomes.Academic recurrent pregnancy loss programs.Women with unexplained RPL.IVF/PGS with 24-chromosome screening and expectant management.Cost per live birth.The IVF/PGS strategy had a live-birth rate of 53% and a clinical miscarriage rate of 7%. Expectant management had a live-birth rate of 67% and clinical miscarriage rate of 24%. The IVF/PGS strategy was 100-fold more expensive, costing $45,300 per live birth compared with $418 per live birth with expectant management.In this model, IVF/PGS was not a cost-effective strategy for increasing live birth. Furthermore, the live-birth rate with IVF/PGS needs to be 91% to be cost effective compared with expectant management.

LBR for patients reaching ET was 52%. Clinical miscarriage rate was 10%. Despite a mean age of 33.8 years and mean of 7 embryos biopsied, there was a 30% chance for no chromosomally normal embryos. Maternal age >35 years, day 3 biopsy, and having fewer than five embryos available for biopsy increased the risk of no ET.IVF-PGD for translocation and aneuploidy screening had good clinical outcomes. Patients carrying a balanced translocation who are considering IVF-PGD should be aware of the high risk of no ET, particularly in women 35 years old.

Approximately half of patients with RPL will have no explanation for their miscarriages. De novo chromosome abnormalities are common in sporadic and recurrent pregnancy loss. Testing for embryonic abnormalities can provide an explanation for the miscarriage in many cases and prognostic information. Regardless of the cause of RPL, patients should be reassured that the prognosis for live birth with an evidence-based approach is excellent for most patients. The authors review current evidence for the evaluation and treatment of RPL and explore the proposed use of newer technology for patients with RPL. View details for Time to next pregnancy in spontaneous pregnancies versus treatment cycles in fertile patients with recurrent pregnancy loss. BACKGROUND: The current standard of care for management of patients with recurrent pregnancy loss is expectant management. However, the emotional impact of pregnancy losses and the urgency to conceive often leads couples to consider a variety of fertility treatments. The objective of this study is to report the time to next pregnancy and subsequent live birth and miscarriage rates in fertile patients with recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL) who choose to attempt spontaneous conception compared to those that opt to pursue fertility treatment.METHODS: Retrospective cohort study of one hundred and fifty-eight fertile RPL patients treated at a university-based fertility center. Patients were followed for a minimum of 6months. Patients were encouraged to attempt spontaneous conception, but allowed to initiate fertility treatments (ovarian stimulation, insemination, IVF or PGS) according to their preferences. Main outcome measures were time to next pregnancy and pregnancy outcome.RESULTS: For those patients who achieved a spontaneous conception, 88% conceived within 6months, with a median time of 2months and range of 1-10 months. Patients using IUI, IVF and PGS conceived in a median of 3, 4 and 5months, respectively. The live birth rate and clinical miscarriage rate was not improved with any fertility treatment.CONCLUSIONS: In the fertile RPL patient population, there does not appear to be a benefit to proceeding directly with fertility treatment. Patients should be encouraged to attempt spontaneous conception for at least 6months.

However, maternal cell contamination can limit the accuracy. This video demonstrates a technique for separating miscarriage tissue from maternal decidua after MVA to reduce maternal cell contamination prior to sending tissue for analysis. The same technique has been used in our clinic with first-trimester dilation and curettage using mechanical suction.

Journal of obstetrics and gynaecology Canada : JOGC = Journal d'obsttrique et gyncologie du Canada : JOGC Lathi, R. B., Dahan, M. H., Reynolds-May, M. F., Milki, A. A., Behr, B., Westphal, L. M. Hyperandrogenic conditions in women are associated with increased rates of miscarriage. However, the specific role of maternal testosterone in early pregnancy and its association with pregnancy outcome is unknown. The purpose of this study was to compare serum testosterone levels during early pregnancy in women with and without polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) who either had successful pregnancies or miscarried.We collected serum samples from women attending a university-based fertility centre at the time of their first positive serum beta human chorionic gonadotropin pregnancy test. The samples were subsequently assayed for total testosterone level. We used logistical regression modelling to control for PCOS diagnosis, BMI, and age.Total testosterone levels were available for 346 pregnancies, including 286 successful pregnancies and 78 first trimester miscarriages. We found no difference in total testosterone levels between women who subsequently had an ongoing pregnancy (mean concentration 3.6 2.6 nmol/L) and women with a miscarriage (mean 3.6 2.4 nmol/L). Using the Rotterdam criteria to identify women with PCOS, we also found no differences in serum testosterone between women who had ongoing pregnancies or miscarriages, either with PCOS (P = 0.176) or without PCOS (P = 0.561).Our findings show that early pregnancy testosterone levels do not predict pregnancy outcome, and they call into question the role of testosterone in causing miscarriage in populations of women with PCOS. Further research is needed to elucidate the normal progression of testosterone levels during pregnancy and to investigate further the relationship between PCOS and miscarriage. Genomic Imbalance in Products of Conception Single-Nucleotide Polymorphism Chromosomal Microarray Analysis Levy, B., Sigurjonsson, S., Pettersen, B., Maisenbacher, M. K., Hall, M. P., Demko, Z., Lathi, R. B., Tao, R., Aggarwal, V., Rabinowitz, M. To report the full cohort of identifiable anomalies, regardless of known clinical significance, in a large-scale cohort of postmiscarriage products-of-conception samples analyzed using a high-resolution single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-based microarray platform. High-resolution chromosomal microarray analysis allows for the identification of visible and submicroscopic cytogenomic imbalances; the specific use of SNPs permits detection of maternal cell contamination, triploidy, and uniparental disomy.Miscarriage specimens were sent to a single laboratory for cytogenomic analysis. Chromosomal microarray analysis was performed using a SNP-based genotyping microarray platform. Results were evaluated at the cytogenetic and microscopic (greater than 10 Mb) and submicroscopic (less than 10 Mb) levels. Maternal cell contamination was assessed using information derived from fetal and maternal SNPs.Results were obtained on 2,389 of 2,392 specimens (99.9%) that were less than 20 weeks of gestation. Maternal cell contamination was identified in 528 (22.0%) specimens. The remaining 1,861 specimens were considered to be of true fetal origin. Of these, 1,106 (59.4%) showed classical cytogenetic abnormalities: aneuploidy accounted for 945 (85.4%), triploidy for 114 (10.3%), and structural anomalies or tetraploidy for the remaining 47 (4.2%). Of the 755 (40.6%) cases considered normal at the cytogenetic level, SNP chromosomal microarray analysis revealed a clinically significant copy number change or whole-genome uniparental disomy in 12 (1.6%) and three (0.4%) cases, respectively.Chromosomal microarray analysis of products-of-conception specimens yields a high diagnostic return. Using SNPs extends the scope of detectable genomic abnormalities and facilitates reporting ""true"" fetal results. This supports the use of SNP chromosomal microarray analysis for cytogenomic evaluation of miscarriage specimens when clinically indicated.III. View details for Twice-daily dosing of gonadotropins does not improve embryo quality during in vitro fertilization cycles in women with polycystic ovary syndrome, when compared to once-daily dosing: a pilot study To determine whether overexpression of the FSH receptor in polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) results in a relative deficiency of gonadotropins and poor oocyte and embryo quality during in vitro fertilization (IVF) cycles. Whether twice-daily dosing of gonadotropins could therefore result in improved embryo quality, by fixing this hypothesized relative deficiency of gonadotropins.Embryos generated at a university-based fertility center in women with PCOS were compared from twice-daily dosing to once-daily dosing of gonadotropins during IVF cycles. Oocyte and embryo quality was compared. A single patient's embryos were included in the analysis from only one IVF cycle and all embryos from that cycle were included. 254 embryos were compared.Twice-daily vs. once-daily dosing of gonadotropins does not improve embryo or oocyte quality in women with PCOS.The defect in response to gonadotropins in PCOS is most likely due to an inherent defect in the ovary and not a relative deficiency of gonadotropins due to overexpression of the FSH receptors. More studies are needed to confirm this finding.

View details for View details for Embryo selection with preimplantation chromosomal screening in patients with recurrent pregnancy loss. Recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL) is a multifactorial disorder which is often challenging for both patients and providers. Guidelines for the evaluation and treatment of patients with RPL include screening for uterine abnormalities, parental chromosomes, and antiphospholipid antibodies, but approximately half of RPL patients remain unexplained. The current recommendation for patients with unexplained RPL is expectant management which offers most patients a 60 to 80% success rate over time. Genetic imbalances in the embryo, including inherited unbalanced translocations and de novo aneuploidy, are frequent causes of miscarriage. Preimplantation genetic screening (PGS) has been proposed as an effective method for selecting viable embryos for transfer that may result lower risk of miscarriage for patients with unexplained RPL and carriers of balanced translocations. The current evidence examining the use of in vitro fertilization with PGS in patients with RPL reveals variable results, due to differences in technologies used and variable patient populations. Newer approaches, which include blastocyst biopsy and the ability to screen for all 24 chromosomes, show the most promise in reducing miscarriage rates. Studies that identify which patients are most likely to benefit from PGS and include live birth rates per initiated cycles are needed before universally recommending this treatment to couples with RPL.

To examine the rate of maternal contamination in miscarriage specimens.Retrospective review of 1,222 miscarriage specimens submitted for chromosome testing with detection of maternal cell contamination (MCC).Referral centers requesting genetic testing of miscarriage specimens at a single reference laboratory.Women with pregnancy loss who desire complete chromosome analysis of the pregnancy tissue.Analysis of miscarriage specimens using single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) microarray technology with bioinformatics program to detect maternal cell contamination.Chromosome content of miscarriages and incidence of 46,XX results due to MCC.Of the 1,222 samples analyzed, 592 had numeric chromosomal abnormalities, and 630 were normal 46,XX or 46,XY (456 and 187, respectively). In 269 of the 46,XX specimens, MCC with no embryonic component was found. With the exclusion of maternal 46,XX results, the chromosomal abnormality rate increased from 48% to 62%, and the ratio for XX to XY results dropped from 2.6 to 1.0.Over half of the normal 46,XX results in miscarriage specimens were due to MCC. The use of SNPs in MCC testing allows for precise identification of chromosomal abnormalities in miscarriage as well as MCC, improving the accuracy of products of conception testing.

A., Nangia, A. K. An estimated 7 million American couples per year seek infertility care in the United States. A male factor contributes to 50% of cases but it is unclear what proportion of infertile couples undergoes male evaluation.We analyzed data from cycles 5 to 7 of the National Survey of Family Growth performed by the Centers for Disease Control to determine the frequency of a male infertility evaluation, and associated reproductive and demographic factors.A total of 25,846 women and 11,067 men were surveyed. Male evaluation was not completed in 18% of couples when the male partner was asked vs 27% when female partners were asked. This corresponds to approximately 370,000 to 860,000 men in the population who were not evaluated at the time of infertility evaluation. Longer infertility duration and white race were associated with increased odds of male infertility evaluation. The male and female samples showed no change in the receipt of male examination with time.Many men from infertile couples do not undergo male evaluation in the United States. Given the potential implications to reproductive goals and male health, further examination of this pattern is warranted.

B., Massie, J. A., Gilani, M., Milki, A. A., Westphal, L. M., Baker, V. L., Behr, B. Preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) is an increasingly common adjunct to IVF. The information gained from PGD may be used to reduce the incidence of chromosomally abnormal pregnancies and augment the current selection process of embryos. As such, patients may choose to utilize PGD in either fresh or cryopreserved IVF cycles. It is a common practice to cryopreserve excess embryos at the blastocyst stage. In these cases, trophectoderm biopsy is the only technique available for PGD. This articles reports this study centre's experience with trophectoderm biopsies of cryopreserved blastocysts in 12 patients who underwent 13 cycles of PGD. The implantation rate per embryo transferred was 46% and the ongoing pregnancy rate per embryo transfer was 63%. The results from this case series demonstrate that trophectoderm biopsy on cryopreserved blastocysts to perform PGD is logistically feasible. In addition, the rate of implantation and ongoing pregnancy were maintained within a reasonable range to justify the procedure. Preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) is an increasingly common adjunct to IVF and is used to evaluate the genetic makeup of the embryo prior to transfer of the embryo into the uterus. The information gained from PGD may be used to identify single-gene disorders that result in genetic disease, reduce the incidence of chromosomally abnormal pregnancies and/or augment the selection process of embryos to be transferred. In order to perform PGD, a biopsy of the embryo is the performed and cells are removed for testing. PGD may be performed in either fresh or frozen (cryopreserved) IVF cycles. Patients who have cryopreserved embryos remaining in storage from a previous fresh cycle may wish to have these embryos tested with PGD. Many embryos are frozen on day 5 of development, referred to as the blastocyst stage. At this stage of development, embryo biopsy is performed via a technique known as 'trophectoderm biopsy', in which 1-3 of the cells destined to become the placenta are removed from the embryo for chromosomal testing. We report our experience with trophectoderm biopsy of frozen blastocysts in 12 patients who underwent 13 cycles of PGD. The implantation rate per embryo transferred was 46% and the ongoing pregnancy rate per embryo transfer was 63%. The results from this case series demonstrate that trophectoderm biopsy on cryopreserved blastocysts to perform PGD is logistically feasible. In addition, the rate of implantation and ongoing pregnancy were maintained within a reasonable range to justify the procedure. View details for Global alteration in gene expression profiles of deciduas from women with idiopathic recurrent pregnancy loss Krieg, S. A., Fan, X., Hong, Y., Sang, Q., Giaccia, A., Westphal, L. M., Lathi, R. B., Krieg, A. J., Nayak, N. R. Recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL) occurs in 5% of women. However, the etiology is still poorly understood. Defects in decidualization of the endometrium during early pregnancy contribute to several pregnancy complications, such as pre-eclampsia and intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR), and are believed to be important in the pathogenesis of idiopathic RPL. We performed microarray analysis to identify gene expression alterations in the deciduas of idiopathic RPL patients. Control patients had one antecedent term delivery, but were undergoing dilation and curettage for current aneuploid miscarriage. Gene expression differences were evaluated using both pathway and gene ontology (GO) analysis. Selected genes were validated using quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). A total of 155 genes were found to be significantly dysregulated in the deciduas of RPL patients (>2-fold change, P < 0.05), with 22 genes up-regulated and 133 genes down-regulated. GO analysis linked a large percentage of genes to discrete biological functions, including immune response (23%), cell signaling (18%) and cell invasion (17.1%), and pathway analysis revealed consistent changes in both the interleukin 1 (IL-1) and IL-8 pathways. All genes in the IL-8 pathway were up-regulated while genes in the IL-1 pathway were down-regulated. Although both pathways can promote inflammation, IL-1 pathway activity is important for normal implantation. Additionally, genes known to be critical for degradation of the extracellular matrix, including matrix metalloproteinase 26 and serine peptidase inhibitor Kazal-type 1, were also highly up-regulated. In this first microarray approach to decidual gene expression in RPL patients, our data suggest that dysregulation of genes associated with cell invasion and immunity may contribute significantly to idiopathic recurrent miscarriage.

The metaphase karyotype is often used as a diagnostic tool in the setting of early miscarriage; however this technique has several limitations. We evaluate a new technique for karyotyping that uses single nucleotide polymorphism microarrays (SNP). This technique was compared in a blinded, prospective fashion, to the traditional metaphase karyotype.Patients undergoing dilation and curettage for first trimester miscarriage between February and August 2010 were enrolled. Samples of chorionic villi were equally divided and sent for microarray testing in parallel with routine cytogenetic testing.Thirty samples were analyzed, with only four discordant results. Discordant results occurred when the entire genome was duplicated or when a balanced rearrangement was present. Cytogenetic karyotyping took an average of 29 days while microarray-based karytoyping took an average of 12 days.Molecular karyotyping of POC after missed abortion using SNP microarray analysis allows for the ability to detect maternal cell contamination and provides rapid results with good concordance to standard cytogenetic analysis.

The mean T level among spontaneous conceptions was 74.90 ng/dL (SD48.35 ng/dL); 103 ng/mL was the 90th percentile. Mean EP T was increased among patients who underwent ovarian stimulation compared with nonstimulated control subjects. In patients undergoing IVF, T levels in EP were linearly correlated with the number of oocytes retrieved. When pregnancy outcomes in women with normal T were compared with women with elevated T (>90th percentile), we did not see an increased risk for preterm delivery, hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, LBW infants, or cesarean delivery (odds ratio ratios 1.43, 0.38, 1.39, and 0.85, respectively).Elevations in EP T are associated with ovarian stimulation but do not appear to be associated with adverse pregnancy outcome.

To compare short-term morbidity and quality of life after laparoscopic hysterectomy (LH) and laparoscopic myomectomy (LM) for the treatment of symptomatic uterine leiomyomas.We performed a prospective, observational study of women who were eligible for both surgical procedures. After informed consent was obtained, each participant was asked to complete the SF-12v2 Health Survey before surgery and to repeat it seven days and 28 days after surgery. Data on short-term morbidities, such as operative time, blood loss, length of hospital stay, and surgical complications, were collected by an obstetrician-gynaecologist. Women who underwent LH were compared by non-parametric statistical analyses with those who underwent LM.Sixty-one women were recruited between January 1 and December 31, 2008, including 40 who underwent LM and 21 LH. Women who underwent LH were older, had higher parity, and were less likely to have infertility than those who chose LM. Median LH operative time of 223 minutes (IQR 214 to 241) was slightly longer than for LM (188 minutes, IQR 154 to 239; P = 0.02). However, we found no difference between the two groups in terms of SF-12v2 fluctuation, blood loss, hospital stay, and short-term complications.Laparoscopic myomectomy is a viable alternative to laparoscopic hysterectomy for women with symptomatic leiomyomas who want conservative surgery. The procedures have similar morbidity and impact on quality of life. Lathi, R. B., Hazard, F. K., Heerema-McKenney, A., Taylor, J., Chueh, J. T. Miscarriage is a relatively common occurrence for otherwise healthy women. Despite its frequency, evaluation for cause is rare. The most common cause of miscarriage is sporadic chromosome errors. Chromosomal analysis of the miscarriage offers an explanation in at least 50% of cases. Conventional cytogenetic evaluation can only be done on fresh tissue, so it is critical that the treating physician consider genetic testing at the time of the miscarriage. Ultrasound can estimate the gestational age at the time of miscarriage and identify major abnormalities in some embryos. A careful pathological examination can add to the evaluation by ruling out rare disorders with the highest recurrence risk. A multidisciplinary approach to miscarriage evaluation is essential to understanding the cause and risk of recurrence. A thorough evaluation of a miscarriage, in combination with emotional support, can often provide the necessary reassurance and confidence as the patient prepares for her next pregnancy.

Air bubble location was categorized as <10 mm, 10-20 mm, and >20 mm from the fundus.Clinical pregnancy rate.After controlling for age, parity, FSH and frozen transfers, and accounting for repeated cycles per patient, the PRs for both the >20-mm (38.3%) and the 10-20-mm (42.0%) from the fundus group were significantly reduced compared with the group in which the bubble was <10 mm from the fundus (62.5%).This study is the first to suggest that BT closer to the fundus is associated with higher PR. Although no ectopic pregnancies occurred in the <10-mm group, this outcome should be monitored closely in larger studies.

Friedman, B. E., Davis, L. B., Lathi, R. B., Westphal, L. M., Baker, V. L., Milki, A. A. Background. Although the optimal outcome of assisted reproductive technology (ART) is a healthy singleton pregnancy, the rate of twin gestation from ART in women over the age of 35 is persistently high. Methods/Findings. We compared clinical pregnancy rates (PRs), ongoing pregnancy/live birth rates, and multiple gestation rates (MGRs) in 108 women who chose elective single blastocyst transfer (eSBT) to 415 women who chose elective double blastocyst transfer (eDBT) at a hospital-based IVF center. There was no significant difference in PR between eSBT and eDBT (57.4% versus 50.2%, P = 0.47) nor between eSBT and eDBT within each age group: <35, 35-37, 38-40, and >40. The risk of multiple gestations, however, was greatly increased between eSBT and eDBT (1.6 versus 32.4%, P < 0.00005), and this difference did not vary across age groups. Conclusion(s). Women undergoing eDBT are at uniformly high risk of multiple gestation regardless of age. eSBT appears to significantly lower the risk of multiple gestation without compromising PR.

Compared with the control group, the patients with infertility had significantly lower scores in the desire and arousal domains and lower frequency of intercourse and masturbation. The patients with infertility retrospectively reported a sex-life satisfaction score that was similar to that of the controls before their diagnosis, whereas their current sex-life satisfaction scores were significantly lower than those of the controls.Women with a diagnosis of infertility were found to be at higher risk for sexual dysfunction on the basis of their Female Sexual Function Index scores compared with women without infertility. The interaction of sexual function and infertility is complex and deserves further study.

A., Lathi, R. B. To determine the rate of embryonic chromosomal abnormalities, thrombophilias, and uterine anomalies in women over the age of 35 years with recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL).Retrospective cohort study.Academic reproductive endocrinology and infertility clinic.Women>or=35 years old with >or=3 first trimester miscarriages.None.Age, number of prior losses, cytogenetic testing of the products of conception (POC), uterine cavity evaluation, parental karyotype, TSH, and antiphospholipd antibody (APA) and thrombophilia testing. Aneuploidy in the POC in women with RPL was compared with sporadic miscarriages (or=35 years.Among 43 RPL patients, there were 50 miscarriages in which cytogenetic analysis was performed. In the RPL group, the incidence of chromosomal abnormalities in the POC was 78% (39 out of 50) compared with a 70% incidence (98 out of 140) in the sporadic losses. Thrombophilia results in the RPL patients were normal in 38 patients, four patients had APA syndrome, and one had protein C deficiency. Forty out of 43 had normal uterine cavities. Both TSH and parental karyotypes were normal in all of the patients tested. When the evaluation of RPL included karyotype of the POC, only 18% remained without explanation. However, without fetal cytogenetics, 80% of miscarriages would have been unexplained.In older patients with RPL, fetal chromosomal abnormalities are responsible for the majority of miscarriages. Other causes were present in only 20% of cases.

K., Jun, S. H., O'leary, K., Lathi, R. B., Westphal, L. M., Wong, W. H., Yao, M. W. Nearly 75% of in vitro fertilization (IVF) treatments do not result in live births and patients are largely guided by a generalized age-based prognostic stratification. We sought to provide personalized and validated prognosis by using available clinical and embryo data from prior, failed treatments to predict live birth probabilities in the subsequent treatment. We generated a boosted tree model, IVFBT, by training it with IVF outcomes data from 1,676 first cycles (C1s) from 2003-2006, followed by external validation with 634 cycles from 2007-2008, respectively. We tested whether this model could predict the probability of having a live birth in the subsequent treatment (C2). By using nondeterministic methods to identify prognostic factors and their relative nonredundant contribution, we generated a prediction model, IVF(BT), that was superior to the age-based control by providing over 1,000-fold improvement to fit new data (p<0.05), and increased discrimination by receiver-operative characteristic analysis (area-under-the-curve, 0.80 vs. 0.68 for C1, 0.68 vs. 0.58 for C2). IVFBT provided predictions that were more accurate for approximately 83% of C1 and approximately 60% of C2 cycles that were out of the range predicted by age. Over half of those patients were reclassified to have higher live birth probabilities. We showed that data from a prior cycle could be used effectively to provide personalized and validated live birth probabilities in a subsequent cycle. Our approach may be replicated and further validated in other IVF clinics. Coexistence of endometriosis in women with symptomatic leiomyomas Huang, J. Q., Lathi, R. B., Lemyre, M., Rodriguez, H. E., Nezhat, C. H., Nezhat, C. To investigate the coexistence of endometriosis in women presenting with symptomatic leiomyomas.Retrospective study.Tertiary university medical center.We reviewed the medical records of 131 patients who underwent laparoscopic myomectomy or hysterectomy. All patients were consented for possible concomitant diagnosis and treatment of endometriosis.All patients underwent laparoscopic myomectomy or hysterectomy.The main outcome measure of the study was the presence or absence of endometriosis.Of the 131 patients, 113 were diagnosed with endometriosis and fibroids, while 18 were diagnosed with fibroids alone. Patients with fibroids were on average 4.0 years older than those with endometriosis and fibroids (41 vs. 45). Patients with both diagnoses were also more likely to present with pelvic pain and nulliparity than those with fibroids alone.An overwhelming majority of patients with symptomatic fibroids were also diagnosed with endometriosis. Overlooking the concomitant diagnosis of endometriosis in these women may lead to suboptimal treatment of the patients. Further studies are needed to evaluate the impact of surgical treatments on symptom resolution. View details for View details for Karyotype of miscarriages in relation to maternal weight Obesity has been identified as a risk factor for spontaneous miscarriage although the mechanism is unclear. The purpose of this study is to better understand the effect of obesity on early pregnancy success by examining the cytogenetic results of miscarriages in women with normal and elevated body mass index (BMI).We conducted a retrospective case-control study in an academic infertility practice. Medical records of women ages <40 years with first trimester missed abortion (n = 204), who underwent dilatation and curettage between 1999 and 2008, were reviewed for demographics, BMI, diagnosis of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and karyotype analysis. chi(2) and Student's t-test analysis were used for statistical analysis, with P < 0.05 considered significant.A total of 204 miscarriages were included, from women with a mean age of 34.5 years. The overall rate of aneuploidy was 59%. Women with BMI > or = 25 kg/m(2) had a significant increase in euploid miscarriages compared with women with lower BMI (P = 0.04), despite a similar mean age (34.4 years for both).We found a significant increase in normal embryonic karyotypes in the miscarriages of overweight and obese women (BMI > or = 25). These results suggest that the excess risk of miscarriages in the overweight and obese population is independent of embryonic aneuploidy. Further studies are needed to assess the impact of lifestyle modification, insulin resistance and PCOS on pregnancy outcomes in the overweight and obese population.

Y., Westphal, L. M. To estimate the effect of ethnicity on in vitro fertilization (IVF) outcomes after blastocyst transfer.We conducted a review of fresh blastocyst transfer IVF cycles from January 1, 2005, to December 31, 2006. Data collection included demographic information, infertility history, treatment protocol details, and treatment outcomes. Statistics were performed using the Student t test and chi2 test. To establish the independent contribution of Asian ethnicity, a multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed.We reviewed 180 blastocyst transfer cycles among white (62%) and Asian (38%) women. The groups were similar in most baseline characteristics. Asian women, however, had a lower body mass index (22.6 compared with 24.2, P=.02), were more likely to be nulligravid (53% compared with 35%, P=.03), and were more likely to have had at least one prior IVF cycle (37% compared with 20%, P=.02) The groups were similar in treatment characteristics, number of oocytes retrieved, fertilization rate, and number of blastocysts transferred. However, Asian women had a thicker endometrial lining (10.9 compared with 10.2, P=.02). Despite these similarities, Asian women had a lower implantation rate (28% compared with 45%, P=.01), clinical pregnancy rate (43% compared with 59%, P=.03), and live birthrate (31% compared with 48%, P=.02). In multivariable analysis, the decreased live birthrate among Asian women persisted (adjusted odds ratio 0.48, 95% confidence interval 0.24-0.96, P=.04).When compared with white women, Asian women have lower clinical pregnancy and live birthrates after blastocyst transfer. Differential Gene Expression in the Decidua of Recurrent Pregnancy Loss Patients. 57th Annual Meeting of the Society-for-Gynecologic-Investigation Krieg, S. A., Krieg, A.

View details for Poor Prognosis with In Vitro Fertilization in Indian Women Compared to Caucasian Women Despite Similar Embryo Quality Shahine, L. K., Lamb, J. D., Lathi, R. B., Milki, A. A., Langen, E., Westphal, L. M. Disease prevalence and response to medical therapy may differ among patients of diverse ethnicities. Poor outcomes with in vitro fertilization (IVF) treatment have been previously shown in Indian women compared to Caucasian women, and some evidence suggests that poor embryo quality may be a cause for the discrepancy. In our center, only patients with the highest quality cleavage stage embryos are considered eligible for extending embryo culture to the blastocyst stage. We compared live birth rates (LBR) between Indian and Caucasian women after blastocyst transfer to investigate whether differences in IVF outcomes between these ethnicities would persist in patients who transferred similar quality embryos.In this retrospective cohort analysis, we compared IVF outcome between 145 Caucasians and 80 Indians who had a blastocyst transfer between January 1, 2005 and June 31, 2007 in our university center. Indians were younger than Caucasians by 2.7 years (34.03 vs. 36.71, P = 0.03), were more likely to have an agonist down regulation protocol (68% vs. 43%, P<0.01), and were more likely to have polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS), although not significant, (24% vs. 14%, P = 0.06). Sixty eight percent of Indian patients had the highest quality embryos (4AB blastocyst or better) transferred compared to 71% of the Caucasians (P = 0.2). LBR was significantly lower in the Indians compared to the Caucasians (24% vs. 41%, P<0.01) with an odds ratio of 0.63, (95%CI 0.46-0.86). Controlling for age, stimulation protocol and PCOS showed persistently lower LBR with an adjusted odds ratio of 0.56, (95%CI 0.40-0.79) in the multivariate analysis.Despite younger age and similar embryo quality, Indians had a significantly lower LBR than Caucasians. In this preliminary study, poor prognosis after IVF for Indian ethnicity persisted despite limiting analysis to patients with high quality embryos transferred. Further investigation into explanations for ethnic differences in reproduction is needed. Effect of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors on in vitro fertilization outcome 56th Annual Meeting of the Pacific-Coast-Reproductive-Society Friedman, B. E., Rogers, J. L., Shahine, L.

To evaluate the pregnancy rate, ovarian responsiveness, and endometrial thickness in infertility patients with a history of methotrexate exposure who subsequently underwent controlled ovarian stimulation.Retrospective cohort study.University reproductive endocrinology and infertility program.Forty-eight women with infertility undergoing ovarian stimulation after receiving methotrexate treatment for ectopic gestation.Methotrexate administration and controlled ovarian stimulation.Pregnancy rate, cycle day 3 FSH levels, number of oocytes retrieved, and endometrial thickness.The cumulative intrauterine pregnancy rate achieved with controlled ovarian stimulation at 2 years after methotrexate exposure was 43%, with a mean time to conceive of 181 days. Thirty-five patients with similar fertility treatments pre- and post-methotrexate were identified. Within this group, when an IVF cycle occurred within 180 days of methotrexate exposure, a significant decline in oocytes retrieved was observed. Cycles performed later than 180 days after methotrexate exposure did not exhibit a decrease in oocyte production. Endometrial development was similar at all time points examined.These findings suggest a time-limited and reversible impact of methotrexate on oocyte yield. If confirmed by larger clinical series and/or animal data, these results may impact the management of ectopic gestation in the patient with a history of infertility or the timing of subsequent treatments.

To evaluate the cost effectiveness of laparoscopy for unexplained infertility.We performed a cost-effectiveness analysis using a computer-generated decision analysis tree. Data used to construct the mathematical model were extracted from the literature or obtained from our practice. We compared outcomes following four treatment strategies: [1] no treatment, [2] standard infertility treatment algorithm (SITA), [3] laparoscopy with expectant management (LSC/EM), and [4] laparoscopy with infertility therapy (LSC/IT). The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was calculated, and one-way sensitivity analyses assessed the impact of varying base-case estimates.Academic in vitro fertilization practice.Computer-simulated patients assigned to one of four treatments.Fertility treatment or laparoscopy.Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios.Using base-case assumptions, LSC/EM was preferred (ICER =$128,400 per live-birth in U.S. dollars). Changing the following did not alter results: rates and costs of multiple gestations, penalty for high-order multiples, infertility treatment costs, and endometriosis prevalence. Outcomes were most affected by patient dropout from infertility treatments-SITA was preferred when dropout was less than 9% per cycle. Less important factors included surgical costs, acceptability of twins, and the effects of untreated endometriosis on fecundity.Laparoscopy is cost effective in the initial management of young women with infertility, particularly when infertility treatment dropout rates exceed 9% per cycle.

M., Lathi, R. B. To investigate the hypothesis that surgical treatment of endometriosis in infertile patients may improve pregnancy rates by improving embryo quality.We conducted a retrospective evaluation of 30 infertile patients treated with in vitro fertilization (IVF) before and after surgery for endometriosis. Patients served as their own controls and only cycles with similar stimulation protocols were compared.Using standard visual evaluation, embryo quality on day 3 was similar before and after surgical treatment of endometriosis. Fifty seven percent of patients had stage I-II endometriosis and 43% had stage III-IV disease. No patients had a live birth after the first IVF cycle and 43% of patients had a live birth with the IVF cycle after surgery.Surgical treatment of endometriosis does not alter embryo quality in patients with infertility treated with IVF. Basal follicle-stimulating hormone as a predictor of fetal aneuploidy Massie, J. A., Burney, R. O., Milki, A. A., Westphal, L. M., Lathi, R. B. To determine whether an elevated basal FSH concentration is an independent predictor of fetal aneuploidy, as measured in spontaneous abortions (SAB).Retrospective study.Academic reproductive endocrinology and infertility center.All women with karyotypes of chorionic villi isolated from first trimester spontaneous miscarriages at the time of dilation and curettage from 1999 to 2006. The highest basal serum FSH level in the year preceding dilation and curettage was recorded.Monitoring of early pregnancy.Fetal karyotype.A total of 177 spontaneous miscarriages with karyotypes (70 euploid and 107 aneuploid) were identified, of which 53% were conceived by IVF. The aneuploid cohort consisted of trisomic (87%), teraploid (9.3%), and monosomic (3.7%) gestations. Using logistic regression analysis, basal FSH was not found to be independently predictive of an aneuploid gestation in our data set.Our data do not support the hypothesis that an elevated basal FSH concentration is associated with an increase in fetal aneuploidy. Our findings suggest that the association between diminished ovarian reserve and SAB may result from nonkaryotypic factors.

Effective temporization measures for the initial management of this hemorrhage have not previously been reported in the literature.A 43-year-old woman, gravida 0, underwent in vitro fertilization and embryo transfer. She subsequently presented to the office with sudden onset of vaginal hemorrhage due to a cervical pregnancy. Cervical artery sutures were placed, and a cervical vasoconstricting agent was injected, at which point the patient's bleeding stopped. She then underwent successful treatment with dilation and curettage.Conservative measures to manage hemorrhage due to cervical pregnancy can be initiated, with possible rapid establishment of hemostasis until definitive treatment can be achieved.

To evaluate positive predictive value (PPV) of visual diagnosis at laparoscopy compared with biopsy findings according to severity of endometriosis.Retrospective study (Canadian Task Force classification II-2).Academic referral center.Women who underwent laparoscopic biopsies for suspected endometriosis.A total of 238 biopsy specimens (73 endometriomas and 165 peritoneal implants) were taken from 104 patients undergoing laparoscopy for evaluation of chronic pelvic pain thought to be caused by endometriosis.Accuracy of laparoscopic findings compared with histology-proved endometriosis by severity of disease and location of endometriotic lesions. Overall PPV per patient was 86.5%, which was 75.8% for stage I disease compared with 89.7%, 100%, and 90.6%, respectively, for disease stages II to IV (p = .037). The PPV per biopsy specimen of stages I to IV endometriosis was 66.1%, 78.0%, 92.0%, and 81.1%, respectively (.049). When endometriomas and peritoneal biopsy specimens were analyzed separately, no difference in PPV existed (79% vs 77%; p = .67).High overall PPV existed in our study, especially in patients with advanced disease. The PPV per patient was higher than the PPV per biopsy specimen indicating that ability to diagnose endometriosis may be improved by performing multiple biopsies. This is particularly true in stage I where failure to confirm may be greatest.

The average age of the patients was 37 +/- 4.5 years. Using a limited five-probe panel, 54 of the 177 (31%) abnormal karyotypes would have been detected. In contrast, an extended PGD panel (using 9, 10, or 12 chromosome probes) would have detected 127, 131, and 140 of 177 abnormalities, 72%, 74%, and 79% respectively. The difference between the limited (5-probe) and extended (9-, 10-, and 12-probe) panels was statistically significant. There was not a statistically significant difference among the extended panels.Most of the abnormalities seen in miscarriages are detectable by PGD with extended panels. A significantly higher percentage of these abnormalities could be detected by screening for 9, 10, or 12 chromosomes compared with only 5.

The objective of this study is to determine the rate of abnormalities detected by cytogenetic testing of first trimester miscarriages, in patients with and without an embryonic pole seen on ultrasound.A retrospective study of 272 D&Cs for missed abortions in an academic infertility practice from 1999 to 2006. Karyotype results were compared with transvaginal ultrasound findings. Chi-squared analysis was used with a P < 0.05 for significance.There was a high rate of abnormal karyotypes in all miscarriages (65%). Rates of abnormal karyotypes were 58% and 68% in cases with anembryonic gestations and those with a fetal pole seen, respectively (P > 0.05).The high rate of abnormalities detected in both groups suggests that useful results can be obtained from chromosomal testing of the POC regardless of ultrasound findings. Further studies on the prognostic value and cost effectiveness of chromosomal testing are needed. Preoperative vaginal preparation with baby shampoo compared with povidone-iodine before gynecologic procedures Lewis, L. A., Lathi, R. B., Crochet, P., Nezhat, C. The objective of this study was to compare the postoperative infection rates between patients receiving either povidone-iodine (PI) or baby shampoo vaginal preparations before gynecologic surgery.Cohort study (Canadian Task Force classification II-2).University referral center for gynecologic endoscopy.All patients underwent minimally invasive gynecologic surgery including hysteroscopy or laparoscopy.The agents used for vaginal preparation were either baby shampoo in a 1:1 dilution with sterile normal saline solution or PI 7.5% scrub solution.Charts were reviewed for evidence of infection within 30 days of surgery (symptoms of urinary tract infection, abdominal or vaginal wound infections, temperature > 100.4 degrees F, and fungal or bacterial vaginitis). A total of 249 cases were collected; 96 subjects underwent surgery before the change to baby shampoo and 153 subjects after. Both groups were well matched for the types of surgery performed, age, risk factors for postoperative infections, and the postoperative diagnosis. The infection rates were 14/96 (14.6%) with PI preparation versus 18/153 (11.8%) with baby shampoo (p = .52).Baby shampoo should be studied as an alternative to PI because it is a nonirritating, inexpensive mild detergent. This preliminary study suggests that baby shampoo is as effective as PI in preventing postoperative infection.

Among individuals who failed to conceive with less than three cycles of CC and whose medications were changed because of thin uterine lining or intolerable side effects, average PR per cycle for letrozole and gonadotropin treatments were equivalent. All patients conceived within three stimulation cycles with either gonadotropins or letrozole.In patients who failed to conceive with CC, gonadotropins have higher PR for ovulation induction than letrozole. However, PR were high enough with letrozole to justify its use in this population of patients. Letrozole and gonadotropins should not be used for more than three cycles without a conception. View details for The effect of infertility medication on thyroid function in hypothyroid women who conceive To determine whether infertility medications alter thyroid status in patients with treated hypothyroidism, and whether resulting pregnancies require additional thyroid supplementation compared with those conceived spontaneously.Prospective observational study of 18 infertility patients with treated hypothyroidism who conceived between July 2005 and July 2006 with or without infertility medications. Thyroid studies were performed prior to conception, at the time of pregnancy diagnosis, and approximately 6 weeks after an increase in thyroid replacement dose.Orally medicated conceptions were similar to spontaneous conceptions on all thyroid related variables, and therefore the two groups were combined for analysis. Although there was a nonsignificant difference in thyrotropin (TSH) levels postconception (3.8 mIU/L vs. 2.2 mIU/L, p = 0.30), there was no difference in TSH levels after increase in thyroid replacement dose (1.7 mIU/L vs. 1.1 mIU/L, p = 0.30) between patients who conceived after gonadotropin stimulation compared with those who conceived spontaneously or with oral medications. The mean percent dose increases for the nongonadotropin and gonadotropin pregnancy groups were 30.6% and 32.4%, respectively.Hypothyroid patients who conceive after gonadotropin stimulation or with oral medications for ovulation induction do not need additional thyroid supplementation compared with those who conceive spontaneously. View details for Rupture of ectopic pregnancy with minimally detectable beta-human chorionic gonadotropin levels: A report of 2 cases Several studies have demonstrated that 25-77% of ectopic pregnancies spontaneously resolve with expectant management. However, expectant management is controversial and should be considered only for patients with small, unruptured gestational sacs, low beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (beta-hCG) levels and absence of symptoms. There is no consensus on how long to follow such patients.Two patients with beta-hCG levels < 10 mIU/mL presented with ruptured ectopic pregnancy and hemoperitoneum.While expectant management of a suspected ectopic pregnancy may allow spontaneous resolution of such an ectopic pregnancy, rupture may occur at any time and even with extremely low beta-hCG levels. Patients need to be counseled about the risks of rupture and symptoms, immediate action should be taken if symptoms develop, and serum beta-hCG levels should be followed to zero.

This rate of 2.3% for BT was significantly lower than the rate of 5.6% (11/197) reported at our institution for BT before March 2002.Our study suggests that the risk of MZT with BT is significantly lower in the more recent time period and is in the range of what is seen with cleavage stage transfer. It is likely that improvements in culture systems as experience is gained with BT played a role.

We compared the effects of two standard oxygen concentrations, physiological (5% O(2), 5% CO(2), and 90% N(2)) and atmospheric (5% CO(2) with the balance as air), on fertilization, embryo development, and pregnancy rate in 106 patients undergoing IVF, excluding donor oocyte cycles and preimplantation genetic diagnosis cycles. The differences in oxygen concentration did not significantly affect fertilization rate, blastocyst formation, or pregnancy rate, but there was a significant difference in mean embryo score between physiological and atmospheric groups on day 3.

View details for Night sweats and elevated follicle-stimulating hormone levels while taking selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are commonly prescribed to women with depression and anxiety disorders. Although night sweats are a reported adverse effect, some women have relief of vasomotor symptoms during perimenopausal period while taking them. The relationships between SSRIs, thermoregulation, gonadotropins, and estrogen and their connection to fertility remain unclear.A reproductive-aged woman, seeking treatment for infertility, experienced night sweats and elevated follicle-stimulating hormone levels while taking SSRIs for treatment of depression.Many women of reproductive age are taking SSRIs, but the affect of SSRIs on normal reproductive function is unknown and further research in this area is needed.

We evaluated the role of MRI as a preoperative diagnostic tool for leiomyoma and adenomyosis.This is a retrospective chart review at a university-based hospital. The study included 1517 women who underwent hysterectomy or myomectomy over a 5-year period, and 153 women with a preoperative pelvic MRI were included. Comparisons were made between the results of the MRI and postoperative pathology reports.The MRI and pathology report were the same for 136 of 144 women with leiomyoma and 12 of 31 women with adenomyosis. The MRI had 94% sensitivity and 33% specificity for leiomyoma and 38% sensitivity and 91% specificity for adenomyosis. Positive and negative predictive values of MRI for leiomyoma were 95% and 27% with 90% accuracy. Positive and negative predictive values of MRI for adenomyosis were 52% and 85%, respectively, with 80% accuracy.MRI has a high sensitivity and a low specificity for diagnosing leiomyoma and a high specificity and a low sensitivity for diagnosing adenomyosis. Due to the high cost and technical variations, we suggest using MRI only as an adjunctive diagnostic tool when ultrasound is not conclusive and differentiation between the 2 pathologies ultimately affects patient management.

B., Hess, A. P., Tulac, S., Nayak, N. R., Conti, M., Giudice, L. C. IGF binding protein-1 (IGFBP-1) is a major product of decidualized human endometrial stromal cells and decidua, and as a modulator of IGF action and/or by independent mechanisms, it regulates cell growth and differentiation and embryonic implantation in these tissues. IGFBP-1 secretion is primarily stimulated by progesterone and cAMP and is inhibited by insulin and IGFs. The signaling pathways mediating the latter are not well defined, and the current study was conducted to determine which pathways mediate the effects of insulin on IGFBP-1 mRNA and protein expression by human endometrial stromal cells decidualized in vitro by progesterone. Cells were cultured and treated with different combinations of insulin; wortmannin, an inhibitor of the phosphatidylinositide-3-kinase (PI3-kinase) pathway; and PD98059, an inhibitor of the MAPK pathway. IGFBP-1 mRNA was determined by real-time PCR, and protein secretion in the conditioned medium was measured by ELISA. Activation of the PI3-kinase and the MAPK pathways was assessed by the detection of phosphorylated AKT and ERK in Western blots, respectively. Insulin inhibited IGFBP-1 mRNA and protein secretion in a dose-dependent fashion, with an ED(50) for the latter 0.127 ng/ml (21.6 pm). Inhibitor studies revealed that at low doses, insulin acts through the PI3-kinase pathway, whereas at higher levels it also activates the MAPK pathway in the inhibition of IGFBP-1. The data demonstrate that human endometrium is a target for insulin action in the regulation of IGFBP-1. At physiological levels insulin likely plays a homeostatic role for energy metabolism in the endometrium, and in hyperinsulinemic states, insulin action on the endometrium may activate cellular mitosis via the MAPK pathway and perhaps predispose this tissue to hyperplasia and/or cancer.

The patients with ICSI were more likely to have aneuploidy identified in their POC than conventional IVF, 76% vs. 41%. The average ages in these groups were similar: 37.1 vs. 37.8 years. There was a trend toward decreased aneuploidy with day 5 compared to day 3 embryo transfers; 38% vs. 63%.We found a significantly higher aneuploidy rate in the abortuses of patients who conceived with ICSI. It is possible that this increased incidence is due to abnormalities in the sperm of patients with ICSI, but could also be partially related to the technique itself. View details for Interferon-related and other immune genes are downregulated in peripheral blood leukocytes in the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle Dosiou, C., Lathi, R. B., Tulac, S., Huang, S. T., Giudice, L. C. Interaction between the endocrine and the immune systems has been suggested by observations of sexual dimorphism of the immune response, differential susceptibility to autoimmunity between the sexes, changes in autoimmune disease activity during the menstrual cycle and in pregnancy and in vitro studies of hormonal influence on cytokine production.We hypothesized that if there is hormonal regulation of the immune response, this would be manifest in peripheral blood leukocytes (PBLs) at different phases of the menstrual cycle. In this study, we describe gene profiling of PBLs from the follicular and luteal phases of the menstrual cycle. We observe important differences in immune gene expression, with significant down-regulation of the Th1 immune response in the luteal phase. A significant number of interferon (IFN)-related genes are amongst the downregulated genes. These results support significant hormonal regulation of the immune system and may have therapeutic implications in diseases of autoimmunity in women. View details for Tissue sampling technique affects accuracy of karyotype from missed abortions To determine if careful specimen selection and washing of tissue from first trimester missed abortion products of conception specimens increases the sensitivity of routine cytogenetics in detecting aneuploidy.Retrospective review of cytogenetics results from tissue from dilation and curettage for missed abortion in a university fertility practice between 1998 and 2001. A technique of careful selection and washing of the specimen was implemented in July 1999. Results from before (n = 15) and after (n = 41) this change were compared. Cytogenetics reports from other physicians using the same laboratory were used for comparison (n = 59).The percentage of 46XX results was significantly decreased in the test group when compared to historical and community controls: 29% vs. 73% and 56% respectively. The percentage of aneuploid results was significantly higher in the test group at 61% vs. 7% and 36% in the historical and community controls respectively.Thorough separation and cleaning of villi prior to sending missed abortion specimens significantly increases sensitivity of conventional cytogenetics for detecting aneuploidy by decreasing maternal contamination.

The genes for the alpha and beta subunits of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), and human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) have been characterized and cloned. Recombinant FSH (rFSH) has been shown to be safe and effective in the treatment of fertility disorders. In comparison with the urinary gonadotropin products, human menopausal gonadotropins (HMG), and urinary follitropins (uFSH), rFSH is more potent and better tolerated by patients. Recombinant HCG appears to be as efficacious as urinary HCG with the benefit of improved local tolerance. Recombinant LH (rLH) is likely to be recommended as a supplement to rFSH for ovulation induction in hypogonadotropic women.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: An emerging body of literature has elucidated the growing burden of surplus embryos left in storage without any clear disposition. An out dated consent process is a significant but easily remedied contributor to this problem. We propose a novel approach to consenting for disposition of surplus embryos.RECENT FINDINGS: Decisional conflicts that stem from the moral status of embryos and from evolving personal values contribute to surplus embryos being left in storage. Barriers to donation of embryos to research or to other patients also discourage embryo disposition decisions. A flawed informed consent process compromises the physician--provider relationship and complicates decision-making.SUMMARY: Centralizing the process of donating embryos to research and to patients would lower barriers to these disposition options. The informed consent protocol must be redesigned as a longitudinal, narrative process compatible with the evolving values and fertility outcomes of patients. Counselors should be integrated into all discussions regarding embryo disposition from the onset of fertility treatment through its conclusion to facilitate the decision-making process.

View details for Is intracytoplasmic sperm (ICSI) better than traditional in vitro fertilization (IVF): confirmation of higher blastocyst rates per oocyte using a split insemination design. Sauerbrun-Cutler, M., Huber, W. J., Has, P., Shen, C., Hackett, R., Alvero, R., Wang, S. PURPOSE: To explore the effects of traditional vs. intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) insemination method on the outcome of high-quality blastocyst development in a split sibling oocyte cohort.METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, we analyzed 62 ICSI/IVF split cycles. Sibling oocytes were randomly assigned to ICSI or IVF insemination. Two hundred thirty-four ICSI-only cycles and 152 IVF-only cycles were also analyzed for comparison. Blastocysts were graded by Gardner's embryo grading and were considered a high-quality blastocyst if 3BB or better (Gardner 1999).RESULTS: In the ICSI/IVF split group, (1) ICSI oocytes had a higher fertilization rate per oocyte allocated (73% vs 62%, p < 0.001), (2) more high-quality day 2 embryos (69% vs 55%, p < 0.005), (3) ICSI oocytes had a lower blastulation rate per 2PN (46% vs 54%, p < 0.05), but a higher blastulation rate when calculated per oocyte allocated (40% vs 32%, p < 0.05). The ICSI-only group had a lower fertilization rate (65% vs 70%, p < 0.001) but more high-quality day 2 embryos in comparison to the IVF-only group (68% vs 64%, p < .05). The total high-quality blastulation rate was higher for the IVF-only group per 2PN (49% vs 43%, p < 0.05) and per oocyte retrieved (34% vs 28%, p < 0.05).CONCLUSIONS: This distinctive IVF/ICSI sibling oocyte split design demonstrated a higher-quality blastulation rate in the IVF group compared to the ICSI group when calculated per 2PN, but not per oocyte allocated to each insemination procedure.

Most multiple gestations in the follow-up study resulted from GN treatment (n = 14) followed by CC (n = 6) and LTZ (n = 3). There were no significant differences among the three groups at any time point with respect to abnormal scores on the ASQ. On the MCDI Words and Gestures, the LTZ group scored significantly higher than the GN group for most items (phrases, early gestures, later gestures, and total gestures). Children in the CC group scored significantly higher than the GN group for the later gestures and total gestures items.CONCLUSION(S): Differences in growth and cognitive developmental rates among children conceived with first-line infertility therapies, including LTZ, are relatively minor and likely due to differences in multiple pregnancy rates.

View details for Intrauterine insemination performance characteristics and post-processing total motile sperm count in relation to live birth for couples with unexplained infertility in a randomised, multicentre clinical trial. Hansen, K. R., Peck, J. D., Coward, R. M., Wild, R. A., Trussell, J. C., Krawetz, S. A., Diamond, M. P., Legro, R. S., Coutifaris, C., Alvero, R., Robinson, R. D., Casson, P., Christman, G. M., Santoro, N., Zhang, H., Medicine Network, F. T. Are intrauterine insemination (IUI) performance characteristics and post-processing total motile sperm count (TMC) related to live birth rate in couples with unexplained infertility?Patient discomfort with IUI and lower inseminate TMC were associated with a reduced live birth rate, while time from hCG injection to IUI, sperm preparation method and ultrasound guidance for IUI were not associated with live birth success.We previously determined that some baseline characteristics of couples with unexplained infertility, including female age, duration of infertility, history of prior loss and income, were related to live birth rate across a course of ovarian stimulation and IUI treatment. However, the relationship between treatment outcomes and per-cycle characteristics, including ultrasound guidance for IUI, timing of IUI relative to hCG injection, difficult or painful IUI and inseminate TMC, are controversial, and most prior investigations have not evaluated live birth outcome.This was a secondary analyses of 2462cycles from the Assessment of Multiple Intrauterine Gestations from Ovarian Stimulation (AMIGOS) clinical trial. This prospective, randomised, multicentre clinical trial determined live birth rates following IUI after ovarian stimulation with clomiphene citrate, letrozole or gonadotropins in 854 couples with unexplained infertility. It was conducted between 2011 and 2014, and couples could undergo up to four consecutive treatment cycles.AMIGOS was an NIH-sponsored Reproductive Medicine Network trial conducted at 12 clinical sites. Participants were women with unexplained infertility who were between 18 and 40years of age. Cluster-weighted generalised estimating equations (GEE), which account for informative clustering of multiple IUI treatment cycles within the same patient, were used to determine associations between IUI performance characteristics, including inseminate TMC, and live birth rate. Efficiency curves were also generated to examine the relationship between inseminate TMC and live birth rate.After adjustment for treatment group and baseline factors previously associated with live birth across a course of OS-IUI treatment, patient discomfort during the IUI procedure was associated with a reduction in live birth rate (aRR 0.40 (0.16-0.96)). Time from hCG trigger injection to IUI was not significantly associated with outcome. Higher TMC was associated with greater live birth rate (TMC 15.1-20.0 million (14.8%) compared to 5 million (5.5%)) (aRR 2.09 (1.31-3.33)). However, live births did occur with TMC1 million (5.1%).This investigation is a secondary analysis, and AMIGOS was not designed to address the present question. Since timed intercourse was allowed as part of the AMIGOS trial, we cannot rule out the possibility that any given pregnancy resulted from intercourse rather than IUI.Most factors associated with the performance of IUI were not significantly related to obtaining live birth. Our findings suggest that higher TMC inseminated leads to an increase in live birth rate up to TMC ~20 million. However, there may be no reasonable threshold below which live birth is not possible with IUI.Funding was received through grants from the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD): U10 HD077680, U10 HD39005, U10 HD38992, U10 HD27049, U10 HD38998, U10 HD055942, HD055944, U10 HD055936 and U10 HD055925.

J., Roth, L., Polotsky, A. J. To evaluate the efficacy of nontubal ectopic pregnancy (NTEP) management with direct methotrexate (MTX) injection into the gestational sac.A retrospective chart review.A tertiary academic and teaching hospital.All cases of confirmed NTEP were retrospectively identified from 2012 to 2017.Ultrasound-guided direct injection of MTX into the fetal pole and surrounding gestational sac and a single dose of systemic MTX with or without fetal intracardiac injection of potassium chloride.Treatment failure, complications from treatment, operating time, and days to negative serum human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) after treatment were measured. Fourteen women (age 34 5.2 years) with NTEP underwent direct MTX injection (cesarean scar, n=4; interstitial, n=6; cervical, n=4). The mean estimated gestational age was 49 11, CI (43, 56 days). One patient required laparoscopic intervention with a failure rate of 1 of 14 (a double interstitial, heterotopic pregnancy). There were no other major complications. The time in the operating room was similar for all NTEP types. The average time to negative serum hCG was not different for cesarean scar (84.5 36 days), cervical pregnancies (70.5 19 days), or interstitial pregnancies (45.3 38 days, p=.15).Direct MTX injection into the gestational sac for NTEP treatment is safe and effective. The failure rate of 7% is considerably lower than what was previously reported for a failure of systemic MTX in similar cases (25%). Resolution of serum hCG after treatment can be quite prolonged even in uncomplicated cases. Androgenicity and fertility treatment in women with unexplained infertility. Wang, E. T., Diamond, M.

To determine whether biochemical or clinical markers of androgenic activity predict live birth rate with ovarian stimulation in the unexplained infertility population.Secondary analysis of the Assessment of Multiple Intrauterine Gestations from Ovarian Stimulation (AMIGOS) clinical trial.Multicenter university-based clinical practices.Nine hundred couples with unexplained infertility were included. Women were 18-40 years old with regular menses, a normal uterine cavity, at least one patent fallopian tube, and a male partner with 5 million motile sperm. Women were randomized to receive gonadotropin, clomiphene, or letrozole with IUI for four or fewer four treatment cycles. Women were evaluated for biochemical (total testosterone, DHEAS, and free androgen index) and clinical markers of androgenic activity (sebum, acne, and hirsutism). Multivariable logistic regression models adjusting for treatment group, maternal age, and body mass index were performed.None.The primary outcome was live birth. Secondary outcomes included conception, clinical pregnancy, and pregnancy loss.When comparing 900 women in the AMIGOS trial based on quartiles of serum TT, women were of younger age, higher body mass index, and higher waist circumference with increasing TT. Increasing quartiles of TT also showed increasing DHEAS and free androgen index values. Serum androgens were not associated with outcomes of live birth, conception, clinical pregnancy, or pregnancy loss. Clinical androgen markers were not associated with pregnancy outcomes.In a randomized cohort of women with unexplained infertility, biochemical and clinical measures of androgens did not predict live birth rate after ovarian stimulation treatment.NCT01044862. View details for Short- and long-term impact of gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogue treatment on bone loss and fracture. Gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogues (GnRH-a) are commonly utilized in moderate to severe endometriosis to induce atrophy of endometriotic lesions. Unfortunately, cessation of therapy can lead to recurrence of symptoms. Therefore, long term therapy is sometimes necessary. GnRH analogues cause an immediate decrease in bone mineral density which usually recovers after cessation of its use. However, this recovery in bone mineral density may not always occur after long term use. In order to prevent the deleterious effects on bone, add-back therapy is used frequently. This review will explore the impact of GnRH analogues on both bone loss and fracture risk as well as describe different add-back regimens.

A., Zhang, H., Santoro, N., Reproductive Med Network We sought to determine whether lower fertility related quality of life or depression in men of couples with unexplained infertility is associated with low total testosterone levels, abnormal semen quality or erectile dysfunction.This study is a secondary analysis of a large, multicenter, randomized controlled trial in couples with unexplained infertility. Male partners underwent baseline semen analysis with measurement of fasting total testosterone and gonadotropin. They also completed surveys, including the FertiQOL (Fertility Quality of Life), the PHQ-9 (Patient Health Questionnaire-9) and the IIEF (International Index of Erectile Function). The primary study outcomes were total testosterone with low total testosterone defined as less than 264 ng/dl, semen parameters and the IIEF score. We performed multivariable logistic regression analyses adjusted for patient age, race, body mass index, education, smoking, alcohol use, infertility duration and comorbidity.A total of 708 men with a mean SD age of 34.2 5.6 were included in study. Of the men 59 (8.3%) had a PHQ-9 score of 5 or greater, which was consistent with depression, 99 (14.0%) had low total testosterone and 63 (9.0%) had mild or worse erectile dysfunction. Neither the FertiQOL score nor depression was associated with total testosterone or any semen parameter. The FertiQOL score was inversely associated with erectile dysfunction (for every 5-point score decline AOR 1.30, 95% CI 1.16-1.46). Depressed men were significantly more likely to have erectile dysfunction than nondepressed men (AOR 6.31, 95% CI 3.12-12.77).In men in couples with unexplained infertility lower fertility related quality of life and depression are strongly associated with erectile dysfunction. However, neither is associated with spermatogenesis or testosterone levels. Erectile dysfunction in infertile men merits longitudinal investigation in future studies.

Method: A qualitative, ethnonursing study based on Leininger's theory of culture care diversity and universality. Data were collected from 13 key informants living on a reservation in the Western United States. Data were analyzed with Leininger's four phases of qualitative analysis. Results: Three universal themes were identified: (1) control of PCOS symptoms is important for the cultural well-being of tribal women, (2) culturally congruent PCOS education and health care are important with variations in approaches to treatment, and (3) tribal culture is important with variations in use of tribal practices. Discussion: Tribal culture affects the health care beliefs and practices of American Indian women with PCOS. The findings can be used to improve culturally congruent care for women with this chronic condition. 3-D Ultrasound is Accurate for Follicular Monitoring But Does Not Reduce Time to Perform Sauerbrun, M., Ghidei, L., Huber, W.

Carron, R., Kooienga, S., Gilman-Kehrer, E., Alvero, R., Boyle, D. K. Developing a nursing research project with American Indian tribes and navigating the institutional review board approval process can appear daunting to investigators because of tribal research requirements in addition to academic requirements. Nurse investigators conducted a research project exploring experiences of American Indian women with polycystic ovary syndrome. After successful implementation of the project, a model emerged to guide researchers working with tribal communities through project development and the institutional review board process. The model is based on the American Indian medicine wheel with each quadrant aligned with a season of the year: spring, summer, fall, and winter. The seasonal approach divides project development into sections that can be developed independently or simultaneously. The model emphasizes collaborative relationships between the research team and tribe. Researchers can adapt and customize the model for their projects based on their objectives and targeted populations. The purpose of this article is to describe the medicine wheel model and, as an exemplar, demonstrate application of the model in a project involving American Indian women with polycystic ovary syndrome. Additionally, potential implications of the model for nursing research, education, and practice are presented.

To compare saline infusion sonohysterography (SIS) versus hysterosalpingogram (HSG) for confirmation of tubal patency.Secondary analysis of a randomized controlled trial, Pregnancy in Polycystic Ovary Syndrome II (PPCOS II). Seven hundred fifty infertile women (18-40years old) with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) were randomized to up to 5cycles of letrozole or clomiphene citrate. Prior to enrollment, tubal patency was determined by HSG, the presence of free fluid in the pelvis on SIS, laparoscopy, or recent intrauterine pregnancy. Logistic regression was conducted in patients who ovulated with clinical pregnancy as the outcome and HSG or SIS as the key independent variable.Among women who ovulated, 414 (66.9%) had tubal patency confirmed by SIS and 187 (30.2%) had at least one tube patent on HSG. Multivariable analysis indicated that choice of HSG versus SIS did not have a significant relationship on likelihood of clinical pregnancy, after adjustment for treatment arm, BMI, duration of infertility, smoking, and education (OR 1.14, 95% CI 0.77, 1.67, P=0.52). Ectopic pregnancy occurred more often in women who had tubal patency confirmed by HSG compared to SIS (2.8% versus 0.6%, P=0.02).In this large cohort of women with PCOS, there was no significant difference in clinical pregnancy rate between women who had tubal patency confirmed by HSG versus SIS. SIS is an acceptable imaging modality for assessment of tubal patency in this population. View details for Gestational Weight Gain in Women With Polycystic Ovary Syndrome: A Controlled Study.

S., Reproductive Medicine Network Context: Women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) have increased risk for pregnancy complications, possibly related to pre-existing obesity and excessive gestational weight gain (GWG).Objectives: To assess the contributions of diagnosis and preconception weight on GWG and perinatal outcomes.Research Design and Methods: Prospective cohort study of singleton pregnancies in PCOS (n = 164) and ovulatory controls (n = 176) from infertility treatment.Main Outcome Measures: GWG, birthweight, pregnancy complications.Results: From preconception baseline, normal-weight women with PCOS gained 2.3 pounds more during the first trimester (95% CI, 0.3 to 4.3; P = 0.02), and by the end of the second trimester, 4.2 pounds more than controls (95% CI, 0.7 to 7.7; P = 0.02). Women who were overweight with PCOS gained significantly more weight than did controls by the end of the second trimester (5.2 pounds; 95% CI, 0.2 to 10.2; P = 0.04), whereas women with obesity and PCOS and control women had similar weight gain throughout pregnancy. Within normal-weight, overweight, and obese groups, prevalence of pre-eclampsia and gestational diabetes did not differ between the PCOS and control groups, nor was there a difference in birthweight. Preconception body mass index (BMI) was significantly associated with GWG; for every 1-kg/m2 increase in preconception BMI, GWG decreased by 0.62 pounds (95% CI, -0.85 to -0.40; P < 0.001).Conclusions: Women with PCOS who are of normal weight or are overweight before conception experience more GWG than do ovulatory controls. Within normal-weight, overweight, and obese groups, rates of perinatal complications do not significantly differ between women with PCOS and controls. Preconception BMI is the strongest predictor of GWG. Gestational Weight Gain in Women With Polycystic Ovary Syndrome: A Controlled Study Kent, J., Dodson, W.

Barrett, E. S., Vitek, W., Mbowe, O., Thurston, S. W., Legro, R. S., Alvero, R., Baker, V., Bates, G. W., Casson, P., Coutifaris, C., Eisenberg, E., Hansen, K., Krawetz, S., Robinson, R., Rosen, M., Usadi, R., Zhang, H., Santoro, N., Diamond, M. STUDY QUESTION: Among infertile women undergoing ovarian stimulation, is allostatic load (AL), a measure of chronic physiological stress, associated with subsequent fertility and pregnancy outcomes?SUMMARY ANSWER: AL at baseline was not associated with conception, spontaneous abortion or live birth, however, it was significantly associated with increased odds of pre-eclampsia and preterm birth among women who had a live birth in the study.WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Several studies have linked AL during pregnancy to adverse outcomes including preterm birth and pre-eclampsia, hypothesizing that it may contribute to well-documented disparities in pregnancy and birth outcomes. However, AL biomarkers change over the course of pregnancy, raising questions as to whether gestational AL assessment is a valid measure of cumulative physiologic stress starting long before pregnancy. To better understand how AL may impact reproductive outcomes, AL measurement in the non-pregnant state (i.e. prior to conception) is needed.STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: A secondary data analysis based on data from 836 women who participated in Assessment of Multiple Intrauterine Gestations from Ovarian Stimulation (AMIGOS), a multi-center, randomized clinical trial of ovarian stimulation conducted from 2011 to 2014.PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: Ovulatory women with unexplained infertility (ages 18-40) were enrolled and at baseline, biological and anthropometric measures were collected. AL scores were calculated as a composite of the following baseline variables determined a priori: BMI, waist-to-hip ratio, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, C-reactive protein and HOMA score. Participants received ovarian stimulation for up to four cycles and if they conceived, were followed throughout pregnancy. We fit multi-variable logistic regression models examining AL (one-tailed and two-tailed) in relation to the following reproductive outcomes: conception, spontaneous abortion, live birth, pre-eclampsia, preterm birth and low birthweight.MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: Adjusting for covariates, a unit increase in two-tailed AL score was associated with 62% increased odds of pre-eclampsia (OR: 1.62, 95% CI: 1.14, 2.38) 44% increased odds of preterm birth (OR: 1.44, 95% CI: 1.02, 2.08), and 39% increased odds of low birthweight (OR: 1.39, 95% CI: 0.99, 1.97). The relationship between AL and preterm birth was mediated by pre-eclampsia (P = 0.0003). In one-tailed AL analyses, associations were similar, but slightly attenuated. AL was not associated with fertility outcomes (conception, spontaneous abortion, live birth).LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: Results may not be generalizable to fertile women who conceive naturally or women with other types of infertility. Comparisons to previous, related work are difficult because variables included in AL composite measures vary across studies. AL may be indicative of overall poor health, rather than being specific to chronic physiological stress.WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: Our results suggest that chronic physiological stress may not impact success of ovarian stimulation, however, they confirm and extend previous work suggesting that AL is associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes. Physiological dysregulation due to chronic stress has been proposed as a possible mechanism underlying disparities in birth outcomes, which are currently poorly understood. Assessing biomarkers of physiological dysregulation pre-conception or in early pregnancy, may help to identify women at risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes, particularly pre-eclampsia.STUDY FUNDING/COMPETING INTEREST(S): Support for AMIGOS was provided by: U10 HD39005, U10 HD38992, U10 HD27049, U10 HD38998, U10 HD055942, HD055944, U10 HD055936 and U10HD055925.

View details for Discordant anti-mullerian hormone (AMH) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) among women undergoing in vitro fertilization (IVF): which one is the better predictor for live birth? Wang, S., Zhang, Y., Mensah, V., Huber, W. J., Huang, Y., Alvero, R. This study sought to clarify the roles of Anti-mllerian hormone (AMH) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) in predicting live birth, especially in patients with discordant AMH and FSH. A large IVF data set provided by eIVF, consisting of 13,964cycles with AMH, FSH, age, BMI, and birth outcomes were evaluated. Patients were categorized into four groups: Good prognosis group (AMH 1ng/ml; FSH<10 mIU/ml), Poor prognosis group (AMH <1ng/ml; FSH 10 mIU/ml), Reassuring AMH group (AMH 1ng/ml; FSH 10 mIU/ml), and Reassuring FSH group (AMH <1ng/ml; FSH<10 mIU/ml). The interaction between AMH, FSH, and their impact on live birth rate among these four groups was evaluated using Generalized Additive Mixed Modeling (GAMM).Analysis revealed a nonlinear relationship of AMH and FSH with live birth rate among all ages. Among the four groups, the good prognosis group had the highest live birth rate while the poor prognosis group had the lowest live birth rate (29.3% vs 13.1%, p<0.005). In the discordant groups, the live birth rate of the reassuring AMH group was significantly higher than the reassuring FSH group (22.8% vs 15.6%, p<0.005).Although both FSH and AMH are widely use to assess the ovarian reserve in women undergoing evaluation for infertility, AMH appears to be superior to FSH among all age groups. This is particularly important for patients with discordant AMH and FSH where reassuring AMH is a better clinical predictor of cycle success.

A., NICHD Reproductive Med Network Adequate luteal phase progesterone exposure is necessary to induce endometrial changes required for a successful pregnancy outcome. The relationship between low midluteal progesterone concentration and the outcome of live birth in ovarian stimulation with intrauterine insemination (OS-IUI) treatments is not defined.To determine the level of midluteal progesterone portending a low chance of live birth after OS-IUI in couples with unexplained infertility.Secondary analyses of data from a prospective, randomized, multicenter clinical trial that determined pregnancy outcomes following OS-IUI with clomiphene citrate, letrozole, or gonadotropins for couples with unexplained infertility.Couples (n = 900) underwent 2376 OS-IUI cycles during the Assessment of Multiple Intrauterine Gestations from Ovarian Stimulation clinical trial.Live birth as it relates to midluteal progesterone level and thresholds below which no live births occur by treatment group.Thresholds for non-live birth cycles were similar for clomiphene (14.4 ng/mL) and letrozole (13.1 ng/mL) yet were lower for gonadotropin (4.3 ng/mL) treatments. A midluteal progesterone level >10th percentile specific for each treatment group independently was associated with greater odds for a live birth in all OS-IUI cycles (adjusted OR: 2.17; 95% CI: 1.05, 4.48).During OS-IUI, a low midluteal progesterone level was associated with a low probability of live birth. Thresholds differed by medication, with the lowest threshold for gonadotropin. Several pathophysiologic mechanisms may account for low progesterone levels. Refinement of the predictive range associated with particular ovarian stimulation medications during treatment of unexplained infertility may improve accuracy.

Furthermore, the impact of infertility etiology on the characteristics in women with differing androgen levels observed in women with polycystic ovary syndrome and unexplained infertility has not been assessed.The objective of the study was to determine the characteristics of sexual dysfunction in women with polycystic ovary syndrome and unexplained infertility.A secondary data analysis was performed on 2 of Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development Cooperative Reproductive Medicine Networks clinical trials: Pregnancy in Polycystic Ovary Syndrome Study II and Assessment of Multiple Intrauterine Gestations From Ovarian Stimulation. Both protocols assessed female sexual function using the Female Sexual Function Inventory and the Female Sexual Distress Scale.Women with polycystic ovary syndrome had higher weight and body mass index than women with unexplained infertility (each P<.001), greater phenotypic (Ferriman-Gallwey hirsutism score, sebum score, and acne score; each P < .001), and hormonal (testosterone, free testosterone, and dehydroepiandrosterone; each P < .001) evidence of androgen excess. Sexual function scores, as assessed by the Female Sexual Function Inventory, were nearly identical. The Female Sexual Distress Scale total score was higher in women with polycystic ovary syndrome. The mean Female Sexual Function Inventory total score increased slightly as the free androgen index increased, mainly as a result of the desire subscore. This association was more pronounced in the women with unexplained infertility.Reproductive-age women with infertility associated with polycystic ovary syndrome and unexplained infertility, despite phenotypic and biochemical differences in androgenic manifestations, do not manifest clinically significant differences in sexual function.

Women with fibroids were older, more likely to be African American, had a greater uterine volume, lower serum antimllerian hormone levels, and fewer antral follicles than women without fibroids. In conception cycles, clinical pregnancy rates were significantly lower in participants with fibroids than in those without uterine fibroids. Pregnancy loss before 12weeks was more likely in African American women with fibroids compared with non-African American women with fibroids. There was no difference in conception and live birth rates in subjects with and without fibroids.No differences were observed in conception and live birth rates in women with non-cavity-distorting fibroids and those without fibroids. These findings provide reassurance that pregnancy success is not impacted in couples with non-cavity-distorting fibroids undergoing OS-IUI for unexplained infertility.NCT01044862.

C., Craig, L. B., Gracia, C., Huang, H., Alvero, R., Casson, P., Christman, G., Coutifaris, C., Diamond, M., Jin, S., Legro, R. S., Robinson, R. D., Schlaff, W. D., Zhang, H., Reprod Med Network Investigators Does fertility-related quality of life (FertiQOL) differ by infertility diagnosis between women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and their partners, compared with couples with unexplained infertility (UI)?Women with PCOS report lower QOL than those with UI, whereas males with UI report lower QOL than males with PCOS partners.The fertility-specific QOL survey, FertiQOL, has been used to examine fertility-related QOL in a number of worldwide cohorts. Few data have addressed fertility-related QOL as a function of infertility diagnosis. Overall, men report better QOL than women with infertility, and there is variation in FertiQOL scores across different samples from different countries.This was a prospective, cohort study derived from two concurrent, randomized clinical trials, and designed to examine QOL in infertile females with PCOS and UI at the time of enrollment compared with each other and their male partners; to compare concordance FertiQOL scores in this study across other worldwide cohorts; and to determine if baseline FertiQOL was associated with pregnancy outcome.Women with PCOS and their partners (n = 733 and n = 641, respectively), and couples with UI (n = 865 women and 849 men) completed a validated fertility-specific QOL survey (FertiQOL) at the time of the study screening visit. PCOS women were randomized to either clomiphene citrate or letrozole treatment; couples with UI were randomized to clomiphene citrate, letrozole or gonadotrophin plus IUI. FertiQOL results were compiled by diagnosis (PCOS or UI) and compared by diagnosis and sex using Wilcoxon Rank-Sum testing. Relationships between baseline FertiQOL and pregnancy outcomes were examined using logistic regression. Multivariable models were performed to assess the association between FertiQOL scores and key participant characteristics.Women with PCOS had lower total FertiQOL scores (72.3 14.8) than those with UI (77.1 12.8; P < 0.001); this was true for each domain (except Relational). These differences were largely explained by variation in BMI, hirsutism, household income and age. Women had lower overall FertiQOL scores than their male partners. Males with PCOS partners had higher scores than males with UI (84.9 10.2 versus 83.3 10.8; P = 0.003). Scores were not consistently associated with conception or pregnancy outcome.The use of multiple tests of association may have resulted in spurious statistically significant findings. Inherent sociodemographic differences between women with PCOS and those with UI largely account for the lower QOL in women with PCOS. Our study was unable to assess if changes in QOL affected pregnancy outcome as FertiQOL data were collected prior to treatment. Finally, the participants for both studies represent their local communities, but are not a population-based sample and thus firm conclusions about how representative these couples are to the general population must be made with caution.Women with PCOS with elevated BMI and hirsutism scores and with lower socioeconomic status may require more, targeted psychosocial support than those with other diagnoses. Possible attribution of infertility to the male partner appears to result in a lower QOL. There appears to be substantial national variation in FertiQOL scores, with US-based cohorts reporting overall higher QOL.This work was supported by National Institutes of Health (NIH)/Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) Grants U10 HD39005 (to M.D.), U10 HD38992 (to R.S.L.), (to C.C.), U10 HD38998 (to R.A.), U10 HD055942 (to R.D.R.), HD055944 (to P.C.), U10 HD055936 (to G.C.), U10HD055925 (to H.Z.); and U10 U54-HD29834 (to the University of Virginia Center for Research in Reproduction Ligand Assay and Analysis Core of the Specialized Cooperative Centers Program in Reproduction and Infertility Research).

Other baseline demographic and lifestyle characteristics including smoking, alcohol use, and serum levels of antimllerian hormone were not significantly associated with pregnancy outcomes.While age and duration of infertility were significant predictors of all pregnancy outcomes, many other baseline characteristics were not. The identification of level of income as a significant predictor of outcomes independent of race and education mayreflect differences in the underlying etiologies of unexplained infertility or could reveal disparities in access to fertility and/or obstetrical care.NCT01044862. View details for View details for Considerations for management of interstitial ectopic pregnancies: two case reports. BACKGROUND: Conventional treatment of interstitial pregnancies includes systemic methotrexate, direct methotrexate injection, wedge resection, or hysterectomy. We present two cases of interstitial pregnancies that were successfully managed by different minimally invasive surgical techniques. We also report the novel use of hysteroscopic urologic stone retrieval forceps in the transvaginal removal of persistent products of conception after systemic methotrexate for an interstitial pregnancy.CASE PRESENTATION: Case 1 was a 28-year-old gravida 1 white woman at 8 weeks gestation; she was diagnosed with a left interstitial pregnancy. After laparoscopic confirmation of the interstitial pregnancy, successful ultrasound-guided suction dilation and curettage was performed. Case 2 was a 33-year-old gravida 3 para 1021 (one term pregnancy, no preterm pregnancies, one ectopic pregnancy and one spontaneous miscarriage, and one living child) Hispanic woman with persistent products of conception after systemic methotrexate for a left interstitial pregnancy. She underwent hysteroscopic-guided removal of the persistent products of conception, which was possible due to novel use of urologic stone retrieval forceps.CONCLUSIONS: Successful minimally invasive treatment of interstitial pregnancies may be possible in certain cases. Collaboration between different specialties continues to be important for improving minimally invasive options. Recruitment strategies in two reproductive medicine network infertility trials Usadi, R. S., Diamond, M. P., Legro, R. S., Schlaff, W. D., Hansen, K. R., Casson, P., Christman, G., Bates, G. W., Baker, V., Seungdamrong, A., Rosen, M. P., Lucidi, S., Thomas, T., Huang, H., Santoro, N., Eisenberg, E., Zhang, H., Alvero, R. Recruitment of individuals into clinical trials is a critical step in completing studies. Reports examining the effectiveness of different recruitment strategies, and specifically in infertile couples, are limited.We investigated recruitment methods used in two NIH sponsored trials, Pregnancy in Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PPCOS II) and Assessment of Multiple Intrauterine Gestations from Ovarian Stimulation (AMIGOS), and examined which strategies yielded the greatest number of participants completing the trials.3683 couples were eligible for screening. 1650 participants were randomized and 1339 completed the trials. 750 women were randomized in PPCOS II; 212 of the participants who completed the trial were referred by physicians. Participants recruited from radio ads (84/750) and the internet (81/750) resulted in similar rates of trial completion in PPCOS II. 900 participants were randomized in AMIGOS. 440 participants who completed the trial were referred to the study by physicians. The next most successful method in AMIGOS was the use of the internet, achieving 78 completed participants. Radio ads proved the most successful strategy in both trials for participants who earned <$50,000 annually. Radio ads were most successful in enrolling white patients in PPCOS II and black patients in AMIGOS. Seven ancillary Clinical Research Scientist Training (CREST) sites enrolled 324 of the participants who completed the trials.Physician referral was the most successful recruitment strategy. Radio ads and the internet were the next most successful strategies, particularly for women of limited income. Ancillary clinical sites were important for overall recruitment.

C., Ohl, D., Jin, Y., Santoro, N., Eisenberg, E., Zhang, H. The standard therapy for women with unexplained infertility is gonadotropin or clomiphene citrate. Ovarian stimulation with letrozole has been proposed to reduce multiple gestations while maintaining live birth rates.We enrolled couples with unexplained infertility in a multicenter, randomized trial. Ovulatory women 18 to 40 years of age with at least one patent fallopian tube were randomly assigned to ovarian stimulation (up to four cycles) with gonadotropin (301 women), clomiphene (300), or letrozole (299). The primary outcome was the rate of multiple gestations among women with clinical pregnancies.After treatment with gonadotropin, clomiphene, or letrozole, clinical pregnancies occurred in 35.5%, 28.3%, and 22.4% of cycles, and live birth in 32.2%, 23.3%, and 18.7%, respectively; pregnancy rates with letrozole were significantly lower than the rates with standard therapy (gonadotropin or clomiphene) (P=0.003) or gonadotropin alone (P<0.001) but not with clomiphene alone (P=0.10). Among ongoing pregnancies with fetal heart activity, the multiple gestation rate with letrozole (9 of 67 pregnancies, 13%) did not differ significantly from the rate with gonadotropin or clomiphene (42 of 192, 22%; P=0.15) or clomiphene alone (8 of 85, 9%; P=0.44) but was lower than the rate with gonadotropin alone (34 of 107, 32%; P=0.006). All multiple gestations in the clomiphene and letrozole groups were twins, whereas gonadotropin treatment resulted in 24 twin and 10 triplet gestations. There were no significant differences among groups in the frequencies of congenital anomalies or major fetal and neonatal complications.In women with unexplained infertility, ovarian stimulation with letrozole resulted in a significantly lower frequency of multiple gestation but also a lower frequency of live birth, as compared with gonadotropin but not as compared with clomiphene.

Identification and replication of prediction models for ovulation, pregnancy and live birth in infertile women with polycystic ovary syndrome. Kuang, H., Jin, S., Hansen, K. R., Diamond, M. P., Coutifaris, C., Casson, P., Christman, G., Alvero, R., Huang, H., Bates, G. W., Usadi, R., Lucidi, S., Baker, V., Santoro, N., Eisenberg, E., Legro, R. S., Zhang, H. Can we build and validate predictive models for ovulation and pregnancy outcomes in infertile women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)?We were able to develop and validate a predictive model for pregnancy outcomes in women with PCOS using simple clinical and biochemical criteria particularly duration of attempting conception, which was the most consistent predictor among all considered factors for pregnancy outcomes.Predictive models for ovulation and pregnancy outcomes in infertile women with polycystic ovary syndrome have been reported, but such models require validation.This is a secondary analysis of the data from the Pregnancy in Polycystic Ovary Syndrome I and II (PPCOS-I and -II) trials. Both trials were double-blind, randomized clinical trials that included 626 and 750 infertile women with PCOS, respectively. PPCOS-I participants were randomized to either clomiphene citrate (CC), metformin, or their combination, and PPCOS-II participants to either letrozole or CC for up to five treatment cycles.Linear logistic regression models were fitted using treatment, BMI, and other published variables as predictors of ovulation, conception, clinical pregnancy, and live birth as the outcome one at a time. We first evaluated previously reported significant predictors, and then constructed new prediction models. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were constructed and the area under the curves (AUCs) was calculated to compare performance using different models and data. Chi-square tests were used to examine the goodness-of-fit and prediction power of logistic regression model.Predictive factors were similar between PPCOS-I and II, but the two participant samples differed statistically significantly but the differences were clinically minor on key baseline characteristics and hormone levels. Women in PPCOS-II had an overall more severe PCOS phenotype than women in PPCOS-I. The clinically minor but statistically significant differences may be due to the large sample sizes. Younger age, lower baseline free androgen index and insulin, shorter duration of attempting conception, and higher baseline sex hormone-binding globulin significantly predicted at least one pregnancy outcome. The ROC curves (with AUCs of 0.66-0.76) and calibration plots and chi-square tests indicated stable predictive power of the identified variables (P-values 0.07 for all goodness-of-fit and validation tests).This is a secondary analysis. Although our primary objective was to confirm previously reported results and identify new predictors of ovulation and pregnancy outcomes among PPCOS-II participants, our approach is exploratory and warrants further replication.We have largely confirmed the predictors that were identified in the PPCOS-I trial. However, we have also revealed new predictors, particularly the role of smoking. While a history of ever smoking was not a significant predictor for live birth, a closer look at current, quit, and never smoking revealed that current smoking was a significant risk factor.The Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) Grants U10 HD27049, U10 HD38992, U10HD055925, U10 HD39005, U10 HD33172, U10 HD38998, U10 HD055936, U10 HD055942, and U10 HD055944; and U54-HD29834.

S., Dunaif, A., Reprod Med Network Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common, highly heritable complex disorder of unknown aetiology characterized by hyperandrogenism, chronic anovulation and defects in glucose homeostasis. Increased luteinizing hormone relative to follicle-stimulating hormone secretion, insulin resistance and developmental exposure to androgens are hypothesized to play a causal role in PCOS. Here we map common genetic susceptibility loci in European ancestry women for the National Institutes of Health PCOS phenotype, which confers the highest risk for metabolic morbidities, as well as reproductive hormone levels. Three loci reach genome-wide significance in the case-control meta-analysis, two novel loci mapping to chr 8p23.1 [Corrected] and chr 11p14.1, and a chr 9q22.32 locus previously found in Chinese PCOS. The same chr 11p14.1 SNP, rs11031006, in the region of the follicle-stimulating hormone B polypeptide (FSHB) gene strongly associates with PCOS diagnosis and luteinizing hormone levels. These findings implicate neuroendocrine changes in disease pathogenesis.

To identify baseline characteristics of women with unexplained infertility to determine whether treatment with an aromatase inhibitor will result in a lower rate of multiple gestations than current standard ovulation induction medications.Randomized, prospective clinical trial.Multicenter university-based clinical practices.A total of 900 couples with unexplained infertility.Collection of baseline demographics, blood samples, and ultrasonographic assessments.Demographic, laboratory, imaging, and survey characteristics.Demographic characteristics of women receiving clomiphene citrate (CC), letrozole, or gonadotropins for ovarian stimulation were very consistent. Their mean age was 32.2 4.4years and infertility duration was 34.7 25.7months, with 59% primary infertility. More than one-third of the women were current or past smokers. The mean body mass index (BMI) was 27 and mean antimllerian hormone level was 2.6; only 11 women (1.3%) had antral follicle counts of <5. Similar observations were identified for hormonal profiles, ultrasound characterization of the ovaries, semen parameters, and quality of life assessments in both male and female partners.The cause of infertility in the couples recruited to this treatment trial is elusive, as the women were regularly ovulating and had evidence of good ovarian reserve both by basal FSH, antimllerian hormone levels, and antral follicle counts; the male partners had normal semen parameters. The three treatment groups have common baseline characteristics, thereby providing comparable patient populations for testing the hypothesis that use of letrozole for ovarian stimulation can reduce the rates of multiples from that observed with gonadotropin and CC treatment.NCT01044862.

Recruitment of individuals into clinical trials is a critical step in completing studies. Reports examining the effectiveness of different recruitment strategies, and specifically in infertile couples, are limited.We investigated recruitment methods used in two NIH sponsored trials, Pregnancy in Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PPCOS II) and Assessment of Multiple Intrauterine Gestations from Ovarian Stimulation (AMIGOS), and examined which strategies yielded the greatest number of participants completing the trials.3683 couples were eligible for screening. 1650 participants were randomized and 1339 completed the trials. 750 women were randomized in PPCOS II; 212 of the participants who completed the trial were referred by physicians. Participants recruited from radio ads (84/750) and the internet (81/750) resulted in similar rates of trial completion in PPCOS II. 900 participants were randomized in AMIGOS. 440 participants who completed the trial were referred to the study by physicians. The next most successful method in AMIGOS was the use of the internet, achieving 78 completed participants. Radio ads proved the most successful strategy in both trials for participants who earned <$50,000 annually. Radio ads were most successful in enrolling white patients in PPCOS II and black patients in AMIGOS. Seven ancillary Clinical Research Scientist Training (CREST) sites enrolled 324 of the participants who completed the trials.Physician referral was the most successful recruitment strategy. Radio ads and the internet were the next most successful strategies, particularly for women of limited income. Ancillary clinical sites were important for overall recruitment. Chlamydia trachomatis immunoglobulin G3 seropositivity is a predictor of reproductive outcomes in infertile women with patent fallopian tubes. Steiner, A. Z., Diamond, M. P., Legro, R.

To determine if Chlamydia trachomatis (C. trachomatis) seropositivity, as detected by the C. trachomatis elementary body (EB)-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay [EB ELISA] predicts pregnancy and pregnancy outcome among infertile women with documented tubal patency.Cohort study.Outpatient clinics.In all, 1,250 infertile women with documented tubal patency enrolled in 1 of 2 randomized controlled trials: Pregnancy in Polycystic Ovary Syndrome II; and the Assessment of Multiple Intrauterine Gestations From Ovarian Stimulation.Sera were analyzed for anti-C. trachomatis immunoglobulin G (IgG)1 and IgG3 antibodies, using a research C. trachomatis EB ELISA. The optical density (OD)405 readings of 0.35 and 0.1 were considered positive for IgG1 and IgG3, respectively.Primary outcomes included pregnancy, live birth, and ectopic pregnancy. Log-linear regression was used to determine the relative risk after adjusting for age, race, treatment medication, smoking status, and current alcohol use.A total of 243 (19%) women were seropositive for anti-C. trachomatis IgG3. They tended to be nonwhite and smokers. Anti-C. trachomatis IgG3 seropositive women were significantly less likely to conceive (risk ratio [RR] 0.65, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.52-0.83) or to have a live birth (RR 0.59, 95% CI 0.43-0.80); these associations were weakened after adjusting for number of hysterosalpingography-documented patent tubes (RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.56-0.97) and (RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.50-1.04), respectively. Anti-C. trachomatis IgG3 seropositive women who conceived had a 2.7 risk (95% CI 1.40-5.34) of ectopic pregnancy.Even in the presence of tubal patency, anti-C. trachomatis IgG3 seropositivity is associated with a lower likelihood of pregnancy. Anti-C. trachomatis IgG3 seropositive women have as high as 3 times the risk of ectopic pregnancy.PPCOSII: NCT00719186 and AMIGOS: NCT01044862.

Intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI), assisted hatching, and increasing number of embryos transferred had significant positive effects on the odds of conception and pregnancy continuation through the first trimester, but did not affect the risk of later loss. Blacks, Asians, and Hispanics had significantly lower odds of clinical pregnancy compared with whites. Also compared with whites, Hispanics and Asians had a significantly greater risk of pregnancy loss in the second and third trimesters, and blacks had a significantly greater risk of pregnancy loss in all trimesters.Certain demographic and ART treatment parameters influenced chance of conception and early pregnancy loss, whereas black race and Hispanic ethnicity were also significantly associated with late pregnancy loss in ART-conceived pregnancies.

D., Nace, C., Armstrong, A. Y. The purpose of this study was to examine the impact of the resident duty-hour restriction on medical student education through a survey of faculty, residents, and interns, with interns providing experience as students relative to implementation of work-hour restrictions.A survey was performed at two (one military and one civilian) obstetrics and gynecology residency programs. Additional surveys were obtained from an Association of Professors of Gynecology and Obstetrics workshop, which included military and nonmilitary attendees.The majority of faculty reported spending 5 to 10 hours per week in medical education before and after implementation of the work-hour restriction. Residents reported less time teaching students after work-hour restrictions were instituted. Nearly all interns, responding about their clinical clerkship experience as students, believed their educational experience would have been improved if residents were more involved in teaching.This pilot study suggests residents are less involved in medical student education following implementation of the duty-hour restrictions. This study was undertaken to assess job satisfaction and quality of life aspects among residents in obstetrics/gynecology before and after the implementation of duty-hour requirements.We administered a survey to residents before and after duty-hour restrictions, addressing satisfaction with residency training, quality of life, and predictions/impressions of the effect of reduced work hours.Satisfaction with overall residency training as a discrete survey item did not change; however, the composite score from all responses to specific items increased. Several specific clinical and academic items garnered higher satisfaction scores in 2004. Residents reported less-than-anticipated increases in healthiness of their lifestyle and a decrease in interest in teaching.This is a prospective assessment of the effect of duty-hour requirements, improvements in residents' perception of their time and ability to study and pursue research and in clinical areas are encouraging. The perception that there is less interest in teaching is of concern. View details for Resident job satisfaction: Will 80 hours make a difference? This study was undertaken to assess job satisfaction and quality of life among obstetrics and gynecology residents before the 80-hour work week.We administered a job satisfaction survey to residents before July 1, 2003, assessing satisfaction with residency training, indicators of current quality of life, and predictions for the effect of reduced work hours.Residents were satisfied with training, with important outliers, including leisure time, ability to pursue educational reading, and surgical experience. We created job satisfaction facets that were generally reliable constructs and valid predictors for overall residency satisfaction. Residents predict more free time and a healthier lifestyle under the new requirements, but do not anticipate using additional time to study or teach.Job satisfaction facets for residents are proposed here and may be refined through further study. Lower scores for surgical experience are of concern in light of decreasing work hours. Educators must monitor self-directed learning efforts under new work hours.

The objective of this study was to examine the true-positive rates by level of training of the operator and to determine whether the accuracy of the procedure differed by the level of education after formalized training.This was a retrospective analysis. The records of patients who underwent surgery for the indication of an abnormal saline sonohysterography were reviewed from January 2001 to April 2003 (n=73 patients). The nature of the saline sonohysterography abnormality, the intraoperative findings, and the level of training of the provider were recorded. Findings at saline sonohysterography were compared with findings at hysteroscopy or surgery. Statistical significance was determined by chi(2) test.The overall true-positive rate was 86.3% (63/73 patients). The true-positive rates for nurse practitioners, second- and fourth-year residents, and fellows were 84%, 80%, 90%, and 89%, respectively. There was no significant difference among providers (P=.96).The true-positive rates for saline hysterography were comparable among different provider levels. View details for Assisted reproductive technologies: Toward improving implantation rates and reducing high-order multiple gestations Despite striking progress in reproductive medicine over the past quarter century, the number of high-order multiple gestations are unacceptably high, largely as a result of the drive to maintain pregnancy rates in a competitive range. Morphologic criteria are currently used to define the reproductive competence of individual embryos but are imperfect predictors of implantation potential. Current and potential strategies to improve the selection of embryos are described. By the use of several of these approaches, it is hoped that the overall number of embryos that are transferred will be reduced, thereby also reducing the multiple gestation rate. View details for View details for The morphology of human pronuclear embryos is positively related to blastocyst development and implantation Human embryos are selected for transfer using morphology at the cleaving and blastocyst stages. Zygote morphology has been related to implantation and pregnancy. The aim of this study was to relate pronuclear morphology to blastocyst development. Zygotes were scored according to distribution and size of nucleoli within each nucleus. Zygotes displaying equality between the nuclei had 49.5% blastocyst formation and those with unequal sizes, numbers or distribution of nucleoli had 28% blastocyst formation. Cleaving embryos that were selected initially by zygote morphology and secondarily by morphology on day 3 had increased implantation (IR) and pregnancy rates (PR; 31 and 57%), compared with those selected by morphology alone (19 and 33% respectively; P: < 0.01). There was a significant difference between zygote-scored and non-scored cycles on day 3 (PR: 57 versus 33%; IR: 31 versus 19%) and on day 5 (PR: 73 versus 58%; IR; 52 versus 39%). Zygote scoring can maintain pregnancy rates for both day 3 and day 5 transfers, increase implantation rates and reduce the numbers of embryos required to achieve a pregnancy. View details for Effects of fasting on neuroendocrine function and follicle development in lean women Alvero, R., Kimzey, L., Sebring, N., Reynolds, J., Loughran, M., Nieman, L., Olson, B. R. A 72-h fast in normal weight women during the follicular phase results in transient alterations in neuroendocrine function, but follicle development and follicular phase length remain unaltered. In this study we evaluated neuroendocrine and ovulatory function in lean women (body fat, < or = 20%) undergoing a similar 72-h fast. Compared to fed controls, fasted lean women experienced significant weight loss, blunting of the diurnal variation of cortisol, suppression of the nocturnal TSH rise, and a decrease in T3 levels after a 72-h fast. In contrast to similarly fasted, normal weight women, lean women have significantly higher evening cortisol levels and do not exhibit a normal nocturnal TSH rise after the fast. Lean fasted women exhibited a 19% decrease in the number of LH pulses over 24 h compared to fed women (12.9 +/- 1.3 vs. 16.0 +/- 1.9; P < 0.05). Fasting did not result in significant differences in mean LH, LH amplitude, LH area under the curve, and mean FSH levels in these lean women. Of the seven fasted cycles, two were anovulatory. In the five women studied in fed and fasted cycles, one had interrupted lead follicle development with anovulation, and four had significant lengthening of the follicular phase compared to those during their fed cycles (14.4 +/- 1.2 vs. 13.2 +/- 1.0 days; P = 0.01). The clinical observations made in this small sample of lean women showing more profound changes in neuroendocrine function, anovulation, and lengthened follicular phase after fasting suggest that lean women may be more vulnerable to fasting stress than normal weight women.

a50a622e-e3cd-456d-8993-23b2ab2054e0,"For women diagnosed with an ovarian cyst, remember that most types do not directly affect your chance at having a child. For a woman getting a routine checkup from her , the news that she has an ovarian cyst could be quite troubling. However, she shouldn't necessarily be worried. An ovarian cyst is a fluid-filled sac that forms on or inside a woman's ovary, the two organs responsible for producing eggs and certain hormones in women [source: ]. Most ovarian cysts aren't dangerous to a woman's health, which is good considering they most often occur between and -- during a woman's child-bearing years. Most cysts are benign, meaning they are not cancerous [source: ]. For women planning on having children, the issue of a cyst can raise plenty of questions. In this article, we'll look at how ovarian cysts affect a woman's body, in particular her fertility. Infertility is not just a fluke; it's a serious medical condition that affects both women and men. In fact, it impacts about 7.3 million women in the U.S., roughly 12 percent of those living through their child-bearing years [source: ]. Ovarian cysts can interfere with a woman's ability to , the process where ovaries release a mature egg through the fallopian tubes and into the uterus [source: ]. Irregularities with ovulation account for a quarter of infertility cases in women [source: ]. But not all cysts act in this way, and we'll also look at the different types of ovarian cysts and whether they affect fertility. There is hope for women facing infertility. A majority of cases, 85 to 90 percent, are resolved through procedures involving surgery or medicine [source: ]. It should go without saying, evidence that an ovarian cyst is causing can only be diagnosed by a medical professional. Always seek a doctor's opinion if you have any concerns. Now let's look at the types of ovarian cysts that do and do not affect a woman's ability to conceive. There are different kinds of ovarian cysts, but only certain types affect a woman's fertility. As we have discussed, most ovarian cysts are not considered dangerous. These typically fall under the category of functional ovarian cysts, those that form during a woman's normal menstrual cycle [source: ]. Functional cysts form in two different ways: as a cyst or as a cyst [source: ]. During a woman's , a tiny follicle forms on one of her two ovaries. This follicle is where a woman's egg develops into a fully mature one ready for conception. If the sac of the follicle doesn't open to release the egg, it can continue growing and fill with fluid. This is known as a follicle cyst, a harmless formation that is often shed within one to three months [source: ]. Even if the follicle does break open to release the egg, there are instances where the sac closes back up instead of dissolving. In this case, fluid builds up in what's called a corpus luteum cyst. Though they can grow and become painful, most go away within a couple of weeks [source: ]. Two other types of cysts, and , also do not impede fertility [source: ]. Though serious and often requiring treatment, cystadenomas are fluid- or mucus-filled growths that can become large and cause pain. Dermoids are cysts formed of various cellular matter, sometimes including hair, skin or even teeth, but are otherwise mostly harmless [source: ]. So what about the types of ovarian cysts that do cause infertility? There are two: endometriomas and cysts formed by polycystic ovary syndrome [source: ]. Endometriosis is a sometimes painful condition where uterine tissue called endometrium grows outside the uterus, causing a number of complications [source: ]. One of them is infertility. If endometrium forms on the ovaries it can cause endometriomas that prevent a woman from producing fertile eggs [source: ]. Another condition, , occurs when a woman's reproductive hormonal balance is off. In women who have this, the ovaries don't produce the needed hormones that cause follicles to release mature eggs. These follicles that don't break open become cysts. The condition is often marked by infrequent menstrual periods [source: ]. In fact, polycystic ovary syndrome, or PCOS, is the leading cause of infertility in women [source: ]. So what is a woman to do if ovarian cysts are preventing fertility? There's one more important topic to cover. As mentioned, the ovaries produce follicles that serve as little chambers in which a woman's eggs mature. Every woman is born with all the eggs she will ever produce. During each menstrual cycle, she sheds the mature egg that isn't fertilized. By menopause, she will have shed all of her eggs [source: ]. However, the number of eggs a woman has remaining pre-menopause is called her ovarian reserve. But what does this have to do with ovarian cysts? For women who have a potential fertility problem linked to ovarian cysts, this could be welcome news. Many women who have been diagnosed with infertility have found success with medical procedures, a major one being in vitro fertilization. With IVF, a woman's egg is removed from her ovaries and placed with the male partner's sperm. If the sperm successfully fertilizes the egg, it is then placed back in the woman's uterus to continue the conception process [source: ]. For those who attempt , it is not a guaranteed success. But a doctor can help assess a woman's chance at conceiving through IVF by performing an antral follicle count. Antral follicles are those that the woman's body has yet to use, also called resting follicles. By counting these follicles through the use of an ultrasound, a doctor can better guess a woman's potential ovarian reserve, or her number of remaining eggs [source: ]. So there is hope for women battling infertility. And for those diagnosed with an ovarian cyst, remember that most types do not directly affect your chance at having a child. If diagnosed, talk with your health care professional about your treatment options. Thanks to the techniques of modern medicine, the follicles produced by the ovaries can serve as a good way to determine a woman's potential fertility count as she ages.

Precocious puberty (PP) is defined as the development of secondary sexual characteristics in girls younger than 8 years of age and boys younger than 9 years of age. It is estimated that the incidence of PP is 10- to 20-fold higher in girls than in boys. It is associated with accelerated growth, advanced bone age, and early closure of epiphysis. For both boys and girls, rapid growth, appearance of pubic and underarm hairs, and the presence of acne at an early age are the presenting symptoms of PP. In addition, girls may present with breast budding or menstruation, whereas boys may present with increased testicles and penis size and deepening voices. PP can be classified into gonadotropin dependent (central/true PP) or gonadotropin independent (peripheral/pseudo PP). Central precocious puberty (CPP) is caused by abnormality in the hypothalamus-pituitary-gonadal axis. Most cases of CPP are idiopathic, and, in rare situations, central nervous system (CNS) tumors, such as hypothalamic hamartoma, astrocytoma, optical glioma, ependymoma, or craniopharyngioma, may be the cause of CPP. Other CNS lesions that may cause CPP include abscess, encephalitis, hydrocephalus, arachnoid cysts, or trauma. Peripheral precocious puberty (PPP) is much less common than CPP and is caused by early secretion of sex steroids independent of pituitary gonadotropins. The sources of the sex steroids could be either endogenous, such as adrenal hyperplasia, adrenal, or gonadal tumors, or exposure to exogenous sex steroids. PPP can be subcategorized into congenital and acquired. Congenital PPP includes congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH), McCune-Albright syndrome (MAS), and familial male-limited precocious puberty (FMPP). CAH is a common congenital disorder transmitted in an autosomal recessive fashion. It is caused by 21-hydroxylase deficiency (in 90% of the cases) due to mutations in the CYP21A2 gene, which results in impairment of cortisol biosynthesis and accumulation of 17-hydroxyprogesterone (17-OHP), progesterone, and androstenedione (see chapter on Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia). MAS is characterized by a triad of fibrous dysplasia of bone, café au lait skin pigmentation, and PP. The syndrome is commonly diagnosed in girls presenting with PP between 2 to 6 years of age. It usually presents with sudden onset of painless vaginal bleeding accompanied by subtle breast enlargement. The etiology of the disorder is caused by a somatic mutation in GNAS gene, which encodes for the stimulatory subunit Gsα. The activating mutation of GNAS results in constitutive activation of G-protein signaling. This results in the development of estrogen-producing ovarian cysts. Resolution of the cysts causes a fall in estrogen followed by withdraw-bleeding. MAS is extremely rare in boys. FMPP is caused by activating mutation in luteinizing hormone (LH) receptor gene, resulting in increased secretion of testosterone by Leydig cells at early age. The increase in testosterone is gonadotropin independent. Although it is transmitted in an autosomal dominant fashion, FMPP only occurs in boys and heterozygous girls are completely asymptomatic. This male restriction has been contributed to the requirement of both LH and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) for ovarian steroidogenesis. Affected boys usually undergo rapid growth, bone age maturation, and progressive virilization as early as 2-4 years of age. Testosterone level is in the pubertal range, and gonadotropin level is markedly decreased or undetectable. A total of 15 mutations have currently been identified. Acquired PPP usually results from exposure of either endogenous or exogenous sex hormones. The endogenous sex hormones could be produced by tumors, such as ovarian granulosa cell tumors, testicular Leydig cell tumors, adrenocortical tumors, or hCG producing germ cell tumors. In girls, one of the most common etiologies of PPP is ovarian follicular cysts. Finally, in patients with chronic primary hypothyroidism, significant increase of TSH may cause an increase in FSH and result in appearance of pubertal signs in children. What Tests Should I Request to Confirm My Clinical Dx? In addition, what follow-up tests might be useful? Gonadotropins (FSH and LH) and related sex steroids (testosterone or estradiol) should be measured first. LH is the dominant gonadotropin in CPP patients. If the LH and FSH are at prepubertal levels, a Leuprolide (GnRH) stimulation test is necessary to determine if LH levels rise 30 minutes after administration of leuprolide. Pubertal levels of basal or stimulated LH are consistent with the diagnosis of CPP. Suppressed levels of FSH and LH are suggestive of PPP. In boys, the testosterone level is increased both in CPP and in PPP, but the testosterone level is much higher in PPP than in CPP patients. As mentioned, sex steroids increase with suppressed pituitary gonadotropins is diagnostic of PPP. In patients with CAH, cortisols (glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoids) are decreased with elevation of 17-OHP, testosterone, and DHEA-S levels. Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) is usually elevated because of loss of negative feedback from cortisols. An ACTH stimulation test is necessary for borderline cases of CAH. Are There Any Factors That Might Affect the Lab Results? In particular, does your patient take any medications – OTC drugs or Herbals – that might affect the lab results? The practical procedure for GnRH stimulation test varies among different institutions. The agent used, route of administration (intravenous or subcutaneous), and dosing vary in different studies, making it difficult to set consistent cut-off values. Results should always be interpreted in the context of clinical situation and specific cut-offs determined. The diagnosis of central precocious puberty is confirmed by a pubertal level of LH at baseline or in response to GnRH stimulation in a girl younger than 8 years of age and a boy younger than 9 years of age. For congenital peripheral precocious puberty, detection of specific mutations is absolutely confirmatory. Detection of CYP21A2 gene mutation is confirmatory of CAH. Finding known activating mutation of LH receptor genes in a boy is confirmatory for FMPP. What Tests Should I Request to Confirm My Clinical Dx? In addition, what follow-up tests might be useful? The diagnosis of central PP should not be solely based on hormonal data, and it must be correlated with clinical history. For patients suspicious for both CPP and PPP, a bone scan should be performed to determine the bone age. Some studies use pelvic ultrasonography to determine the maturation of ovaries and uterine structure. Increased ovarian and uterine volumes are important signs for CPP patients. Since a minority of CPP is due to CNS lesions, imaging study, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), may be performed to exclude space occupying lesions in brain, adrenals, and ovaries. Are There Any Factors That Might Affect the Lab Results? In particular, does your patient take any medications – OTC drugs or Herbals – that might affect the lab results? Measurement of 17-OHP is important in the diagnosis of CAH due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency. Normal newborns have high concentration of Δ-steroids conjugated as sulfates, which have a markedly prolonged half-life and potentially interfere with the 17-OHP assay. The interference becomes minimal by 2-4 months of age; however, a propanol/heptane serum extraction is recommended to avoid interference when analyzing 17-OHP in a pediatric population. The placenta secretes large amounts of progesterone and 17-OHP. These steroids cross the placenta to the fetus, resulting in higher concentrations in newborns. Measurement of these hormones in newborns younger than 3 days of age may not represent the infant’s own secretion of steroids. Androgens can arise from the fetus with CAH or from the mother. Assay of samples in the first 6 months of life may result in spurious data. Copyright © 2017, 2013 Decision Support in Medicine, LLC. All rights reserved.

What Does It Mean to Have a Diminished Ovarian Reserve? is one of those weird things that’s incredibly easy for some people and frustratingly difficult for others. If you fall into the latter camp, at some point you may decide to undergo medical testing in an attempt to figure out where you and your partner stand fertility-wise. Reproductive science has evolved to the point where there’s a wide range of exams to test fertility, some of which can gauge the status of your ovaries. If, after testing, your doctor reaches out with the news that you have a diminished ovarian reserve, you might feel confused and worried about how it could change your odds of conceiving. Here’s what you need to know. Your ovarian reserve is essentially the number and quality of your eggs at any given time. You’re born with a set number of eggs in your ovaries, according to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG). This is your ovarian reserve. If a doctor says your ovarian reserve is low or diminished, this means that your eggs are lower in number or quality than expected for your age, Deidre Gunn, M.D., a reproductive endocrinologist at University of Alabama at Birmingham, tells SELF. (This is different from premature ovarian failure, which is a loss of the normal function of your ovaries before you turn 40, the says. With this phenomenon, your eggs don’t produce normal amounts of the hormone estrogen or release eggs regularly, making it tough to get pregnant without reproductive assistance.) To give you some background, if you have ovaries, your prime reproductive years are typically between your late teens and late 20s, according to . As you move past that window, the number of eggs you have in your reserve naturally goes down. So does their quality since the eggs you have left are more likely to have abnormal chromosomes that make conception harder, explains. As a result, your ability to get pregnant will start to decrease steadily after age 30, declining more by the time you reach your mid-30s. (This is a steady decline, not a fertility “cliff” that suddenly changes your chances of conceiving drastically at any one point, Dr. Gunn says. But it does happen.) By age 45, it’s unlikely that most women will get pregnant without some form of medical intervention like . Putting all of this into context, having a diminished ovarian reserve can mean that at age 30, the quality and quantity of your eggs is more typical of someone who’s 45, for instance. This can happen due to factors such as , radiation, ovarian surgery (for an ovarian cyst or , for instance), mutations in genes that are related to ovarian function, and endometriomas, or cysts that form due to the health condition . Some experts believe pelvic inflammatory disease, when bacteria from an untreated sexually transmitted infection spread to the reproductive organs, can cause a diminished ovarian reserve. But sometimes doctors can't pinpoint the cause of someone's diminished ovarian reserve at all. If you have a diminished ovarian reserve or are hoping to get pregnant but are concerned about your age, those last few paragraphs might have been really hard to get through. None of this means that you’re destined for as you get older or that you can’t get pregnant if you don’t have the normal amount or quality of eggs for your age. But it’s important to know these facts so you can make the most informed choices when it comes to your fertility and any medical care you decide to pursue. The amount of time you should wait to see a doctor when trying to conceive rests largely on your age. If you’re not yet 35, the recommendation is usually to try to get pregnant for at least a year before you see a doctor with concerns about fertility, according to the . If you’re between 35 and 40, that goes down to six months. And if you’re over 40 and hoping to get pregnant, bring that up to your doctor ASAP in case they want to start testing immediately. (To be clear, you should always no matter your age, but if you’re under 40, the recommendation is generally to wait a certain time before going back if conceiving seems to be taking too long.) It can also be smart to ask about testing if you’re under 40 with a history of certain health issues, like irregular or painful , repeated miscarriages, or endometriosis, the says. And you can see a doctor at any time, no matter your age, if you just need some reassurance that things are OK with your fertility or other aspects of your health. That’s what they’re there for. There are a few tests your doctor can perform to figure out if you have a diminished ovarian reserve. If your doctor shares concerns about your fertility, they’ll decide to test aspects of it based on factors like your age, time spent trying to conceive, and past medical history. If they’re going to look into your ovarian reserve, they might perform a transvaginal ultrasound, which involves your doctor or an ultrasound technician inserting a device into your vagina to get a better look at your ovaries (and other reproductive organs). This sounds dreadful but actually shouldn’t be too uncomfortable physically, at the very least. Learning all about what to expect before, during, and after a transvaginal ultrasound may cut down on emotional discomfort, too. A transvaginal ultrasound can help a doctor examine your , which tells them how many follicles you have on each ovary, Alan B. Copperman, M.D., director of the Division of Reproductive Endocrinology at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, tells SELF. At the beginning of your , these follicles, each of which contains an egg, begin to mature in preparation for ovulation. “[The ovarian antral follicle count] can add information about ovarian reserve and can even help predict how many eggs a woman will produce if she undergoes or IVF,” Dr. Copperman says. Your doctor can also order two different blood tests to look into your ovarian reserve, Dr. Gunn says. One checks the level of (FSH) in your blood. At the start of your , the pituitary gland in your brain produces this hormone to make your ovaries to create those egg-containing follicles for ovulation. This test is usually done by day four of your menstrual cycle, Tarun Jain, M.D., a reproductive endocrinology and infertility specialist at Northwestern Medicine, tells SELF. The other blood test looks for (AMH), a protein made by the cells that surround each egg, and can be done at any point in your cycle. There are standard AMH levels for different age groups, and like your number of eggs, your amount of this protein will also decline as you age. That makes it a pretty good indicator of fertility when considered along with the other tests, Dr. Gunn says. “The important thing is there is no one single test that perfectly measures your ovarian reserve,” she says. If you have a diminished ovarian reserve, there’s only so much your doctor can do to help—but that doesn’t mean you can’t get pregnant. “There is presently no known method to reduce the rate of egg loss,” Dr. Jain says. Similarly, there’s no magic pill you can take to create new eggs. That said, your doctor will likely recommend that you meet with a fertility specialist who can suggest next steps depending on the severity of your situation. In many cases, they’ll have you take a fertility medication like , which stimulates ovulation, Dr. Gunn says, adding that the medication can be used together with (IUI), where sperm is placed inside your uterus to try to increase the odds that you’ll get pregnant in a particular cycle. If that doesn’t work, or if your ovarian reserve is low enough that IUI doesn’t have a good chance of succeeding, your doctor may recommend going straight to , which involves implanting already fertilized eggs in your uterus. It might be possible to make IVF work with your own eggs. If not, your doctor may recommend that you consider using donor eggs. “The uterus, fortunately, does not age,” Dr. Jain says. “These donor eggs can be fertilized with the partner's sperm, and the resulting embryo can be placed in the woman's uterus, with a very high chance of a successful pregnancy.” Again, it’s completely possible to have a diminished ovarian reserve and still conceive—even without reproductive assistance. “Achieving a pregnancy is still possible,” Dr. Copperman says. “The key is to not delay getting a formal evaluation from a specialist and taking action.” Michelle Obama Conceived Sasha and Malia Using IVF After a Previous Miscarriage Jana Kramer Got Pregnant After a Failed Round of IVF—Twice Tia Mowry Was ‘in Denial’ About Being Pregnant Again After Years of Dealing With Endometriosis Korin is a former New Yorker who now lives at the beach.

Medical Editor: What About Ovarian Cysts Diagnosed During Pregnancy? What Is the Prognosis for a Female with Ovarian Cyst(s)? Ovarian cysts are usually asymptomatic, but the pain in the abdomen or pelvis is common. Ovarian cysts are fairly common, fluid-filled sacs that form in or on a woman’s ovaries. Go immediately to a hospital's emergency department if have any of these symptoms: weakness, , or feeling faint, especially from standing; ; persistent ; severe lower abdominal or ; high or unrelated to medications; excessive thirst or urination; unexplained shoulder pain combined with ; persistent and . Ovarian cysts do not always require specific treatment, particularly if they are not causing symptoms. Treatment may involve other tests to determine the likelihood that is present. Some cysts may require surgery. Symptoms of ovarian cysts depend to a large extent on the size of the . Many ovarian cysts produce no symptoms. Large or ruptured ovarian cysts can cause symptoms including pain, pelvic pressure, or discomfort. Vaginal (pelvic) can be used to reveal the presence of ovarian cysts. Ovarian cysts can vary in size. Many are very small, while cysts associated with ovarian tumors may be 12 inches or more in diameter. In some cases ovarian cysts can cause problems with menstrual periods such as abnormal or irregular . Spotting (light bleeding) from the vagina can also occur due to some ovarian cysts. Very rarely, cysts on the ovaries are part of ovarian cancers. functional ovarian cysts do not cause , and the vast majority of ovarian cysts are benign. Some types of ovarian cysts ( and cysts related to ) may make it more difficult for a woman to get . Simple ovarian cysts (functional cysts) can sometimes be seen during . Dermoid cysts and other types of cysts can also occur in pregnant women. The sudden onset of severe pain is the characteristic symptom of a ruptured (burst) . Treatment of ruptured ovarian cysts involves medications for pain control. Ruptured dermoid cysts may require surgery due to irritation of the internal organs from the contents of the cyst. Larger cysts may require surgery to remove the cyst or a biopsy to rule out . An ovary containing small cysts on endovaginal ultrasound (looks similar to a chocolate chip cookie). Ovarian cysts are small fluid-filled sacs that develop in a woman's ovaries. Most cysts are harmless, but some may cause problems such as rupture, bleeding, or pain. Moreover, surgery may be required in certain situations to remove the cyst(s). It is important to understand the function of the ovaries and how these cysts develop. Women normally have two ovaries that store and release eggs. Each ovary is about the size of a walnut, and one ovary is located on each side of the uterus. One ovary releases an egg each month, and this process is called . Ovulation occurs in roughly the middle of a woman's monthly . An egg grows inside the ovary while estrogen (a hormone released by the ovary) prepares the uterus for a developing pregnancy. Estrogen causes the lining of the uterus to grow and thicken so as to prepare for implantation of the fertilized egg resulting in a pregnancy. This cycle occurs each month. If the egg is not fertilized, the contents of the uterus are then expelled resulting in the onset of a . The first day of bleeding is considered the first day of the ensuing menstrual cycle. Ovarian cysts are common and affect women of all ages. The vast majority of ovarian cysts are functional (i.e. they are a by-product of hormonal fluctuations that occur during a menstrual cycle). Although they may become problematic, they do not indicate a specific disease process. Most ovarian cysts are not cancerous (benign), and many disappear on their own without treatment over the course of several weeks. While cysts may be found in conjunction with , ovarian cysts are typically not cancerous. Ovarian cysts most commonly occur during a woman's childbearing years. Usually ovarian cysts do not produce symptoms, and are found during a routine physical exam. They also may be seen as an incidental finding on an ultrasound performed for other reasons. However, symptoms can be present, especially with large cysts or ruptured cysts. These are variable and may include: Pain with sexual intercourse, especially with deep penetration Lower abdominal or pelvic pain. This may be intermittent, or can be severe, sudden, and sharp. A feeling of lower abdominal or pelvic pressure or fullness Chronic pelvic pain or throughout the menstrual cycle Pelvic pain following or vigorous activity A ruptured ovarian cyst typically causes severe pain that comes on suddenly. This most commonly occurs in the mid-menstrual cycle and often happens following sexual intercourse or . An ultrasound image of a functional ovarian cyst. The round, dark, bubble-like structure is a cyst present on the ovary. On an ultrasound image, ovarian cysts may resemble bubbles. The cyst usually contains only fluid, and it is surrounded by a very thin wall. This appearance on ultrasound identifies what is called a simple cyst. If a follicle fails to rupture and release an egg, the fluid remains and can form a cyst in the ovary. This usually affects one of the ovaries. Small cysts (smaller than one-half inch) may be present in a normal ovary while follicles are being formed. The size of ovarian cysts is variable, ranging from less than one inch up to 4 inches. Uncommonly, ovarian cysts can form extremely large masses that measure 12 inches or more in diameter. Premenstrual Syndrome (PMS): Track and Prevent Symptoms The most common type of ovarian cyst is called a functional cyst. A follicular cyst is a simple cyst that can form when ovulation does not occur or when a mature follicle involutes (collapses on itself). A follicular cyst usually forms at the time of ovulation, and can grow to about 2 to 3 inches in diameter. The rupture of this type of cyst can create sharp severe pain on the side of the involved ovary. This sharp pain (sometimes called mittelschmerz) occurs in the middle of the menstrual cycle, during ovulation. About one-fourth of women with this type of cyst experience pain. Usually, these cysts produce no symptoms and disappear by themselves within a few weeks or months. A corpus luteum cyst is a functional ovarian cyst that occurs after an egg has been released from a follicle. Following ovulation, the follicle becomes what is known as a corpus luteum. If a pregnancy doesn't occur, the corpus luteum usually breaks down and disappears. It may, however, fill with fluid or blood and persist on the ovary. Usually, this cyst is found on only one side and produces no symptoms. A hemorrhagic cyst is a functional cyst that occurs when bleeding occurs within a cyst. Symptoms of this type of cyst is on one side of the body. A dermoid cyst is a benign sometimes referred to as mature cystic teratoma. It is an abnormal cyst that usually affects younger women and may grow to 6 inches in diameter. A dermoid cyst can contain other types of body tissues such as fat and occasionally bone, hair, and cartilage. The ultrasound appearance of this type of cyst can vary because of the spectrum of its contents, but a and () can show the presence of fat and/or dense calcifications. These cysts can become inflamed. They can also cause the ovary to twist on a stalk (a condition known as ovarian torsion), compromising the blood supply and causing severe abdominal pain. Endometriomas or endometrioid cysts are a manifestation of the condition known as ; this type of cyst is formed when endometrial tissue (the lining tissue of the uterus) is present on the ovaries. It affects women during the reproductive years and may cause chronic pelvic pain both associated with, and remote from, . is the presence of endometrial glands and tissue outside the uterus. Women with endometriosis may have problems . Endometrioid cysts -- often filled with dark, reddish-brown blood -- may range in size from 0.75 to 8 inches. Due to the color of the old blood frequently found within the cysts, they have been referred to as "" cysts."" A polycystic ovary is diagnosed based on its enlarged size -- usually twice that of normal -- with many small cysts underlying the surface of the ovary. This condition can be found in healthy women and in women with hormonal (endocrine) disorders. An ultrasound may be helpful in diagnosing this condition. Polycystic ovary is different from the (), which includes other symptoms and physiological abnormalities in addition to the presence of ovarian cysts. Polycystic ovarian syndrome involves metabolic and cardiovascular risks linked to . These risks include impaired glucose tolerance, , and (). Polycystic ovarian syndrome is associated with , abnormal bleeding, increased incidences of , and pregnancy-related complications. Polycystic ovarian syndrome is extremely common and is thought to occur in 4% to 7% of reproductive age women. PCOS also is associated with an increased risk for . Other tests other than ultrasound are required to diagnose polycystic ovarian syndrome. A cystadenoma is a type of benign tumor that develops from ovarian tissue. They may be filled with a mucous-type fluid material. Cystadenomas can become very large and may measure 12 inches or more in diameter. Most ovarian cysts are benign (noncancerous); however, rarely, ovarian cysts may be related to ovarian cancers. What About Ovarian Cysts Diagnosed During Pregnancy? Sometimes, ultrasound evaluations of the fetus during pregnancy reveal an ovarian cyst. In most cases, these have been found to be noncancerous, simple cysts that are small in size (less than 2 inches or 5 cm in diameter). Ovarian cysts during pregnancy are usually functional ovarian cysts as described previously. Most of these ovarian cysts that are detected in the spontaneously resolve by the early part of the . The corpus luteum that develops in the ovary to sustain a normal early pregnancy may persist as a corpus luteum cyst later in the pregnancy. Larger cysts in pregnant women are often dermoid cysts. Ovarian cancers are a very rare cause of large ovarian cysts in pregnancy. The following are risk factors for developing ovarian cysts: with gonadotropin medications Oral / pill usage decreases the risk of developing ovarian cysts, because they prevent ovulation. Contact a health care professional if the following symptoms occur: Abnormal pain or tenderness in the abdominal or pelvic area Abdominal swelling or unusual increased abdominal girth Abdominal pain in patients taking blood thinners such as () Go immediately to a hospital's emergency department if the following symptoms occur: Weakness, dizziness, or feeling faint, especially from standing High or unrelated to medications Unexplained shoulder pain combined with abdominal pain A health care professional may perform the following tests to determine if a woman has an ovarian cyst or to help characterize the type of cyst that is present: Vaginal (pelvic) ultrasound is a type of imaging, and is a special form of ultrasound developed to examine the pelvic organs. is the best test for diagnosing an ovarian cyst. A cyst can be diagnosed based on its appearance on the ultrasound. An is a painless procedure that resembles a pelvic exam. A thin, covered wand or probe is placed into the vagina, and the examiner directs the probe toward the uterus and ovaries. This type of ultrasound produces a better image than a scan through the abdominal wall because the probe can be positioned closer to the ovaries. While performing an endovaginal ultrasound, the internal cystic structure may be categorized as simple (just fluid filled), complex (with areas of fluid mixed with solid material), or completely solid (with no obvious fluid). Under special circumstances, CT or MRI scanning may be necessary. With this procedure the surgeon makes small incisions through which a thin scope (laparoscope) can be passed into the abdomen. The surgeon identifies the cyst through the scope and may remove the cyst or take a biopsy of it. This blood test checks for a substance called CA-125, which is associated with the most common type of (the CA stands for cancer antigen). This test is used in the assessment of epithelial and may help determine if an ovarian mass is harmless or cancerous. However, sometimes noncancerous conditions such as endometriosis or may result in the elevated levels of CA-125 in the blood. Thus, the test is diagnostic of ovarian cancer. A blood test to check , FSH, estradiol, and testosterone levels may indicate problems concerning these hormone levels. These tests are especially helpful in establishing the diagnosis of polycystic ovarian syndrome. The treatment of ovarian cysts may be different for a pregnant woman. When considering the diagnosis of an ovarian cyst, a should be performed to rule out an . Many of the signs and symptoms of an ovarian cyst are also seen with an ectopic pregnancy. This test involves taking a fluid sample from the pelvis with a needle inserted through the vaginal wall behind the uterine cervix. This may occasionally be necessary to rule out active bleeding into the abdominal cavity. A gynecologist is the type of doctor who specializes in conditions affecting the female genital organs, including ovarian cysts. In some cases, primary care providers including family medicine specialists or internists may treat mild cases of ovarian cysts. Ovarian cysts do not always require specific treatment, particularly if they are not causing symptoms. Often a pelvic ultrasound will be repeated after a period of months to see if the cyst has resolved. In premenopausal women, ovarian cysts often resolve on their own within one to two months, without treatment. In postmenopausal women, ovarian cysts are less likely to resolve. Treatment may involve other tests (as described previously) to determine the likelihood that cancer is present. Larger cysts may require surgery to remove the cyst or to take a tissue sample (biopsy) to rule out cancer. A ruptured ovarian cyst is typically treated with and does not require surgery. Ruptured dermoid cysts may require surgery because the contents of these cysts are very irritating to the internal organs. Moreover, surgery may be necessary for ruptures of cysts that cause or are suspicious for cancer. : suppresses ovulation and ovarian hormone production. The uterine lining grows and is shed in direct response to the hormonal content in the pills. Without ovulation and ovarian hormone production, functional cysts are rarely seen. : Anti-inflammatory medication such as (for example, ) may help reduce pelvic pain. pain medications by prescription may relieve severe pain caused by ovarian cysts. However, these medications do nothing to speed the resolution of the cyst. Ovarian cyst surgery may be needed to remove very large cysts or to take a tissue sampling (biopsy) of a cyst to be sure that the cyst is not cancerous. The surgeon makes small incisions through which a thin scope (laparoscope) can pass into the abdomen. The surgeon identifies the cyst through the scope and may remove the cyst or take a sample from it. This is a more invasive surgery in which a large incision is made through the abdominal wall in order to remove a cyst. An ovarian cyst may twist and cause severe abdominal pain, as well as nausea and vomiting. As the blood supply to the ovary on the involved side is compromised, emergency surgery is necessary for this complication. Little medical information is available on the prevention of ovarian cysts. Some risk factors for the development of ovarian cysts have been identified (see Causes section). Taking oral contraceptives (birth control pills) prevents ovulation and therefore reduces the chance of developing functional ovarian cysts. What Is the Prognosis for a Female with Ovarian Cyst(s)? The outlook for a woman with an ovarian cyst depends on the type and size of cyst, as well as her age. Noncancerous (benign) masses or cysts greatly outnumber cancerous (malignant) ones. The development of a functional ovarian cyst depends on hormonal stimulation of the ovary. A woman is more likely to develop a cyst if she is still menstruating and her body is producing the hormone estrogen. Postmenopausal women have a lower risk for developing ovarian cysts as they no longer ovulate or produce significant amounts of ovarian hormones. For this reason, many doctors recommend removal or biopsy of ovarian cysts in postmenopausal women, particularly if the cysts are larger than 1 to 2 inches in diameter. The size of the ovarian cyst relates directly to the rate at which they shrink. As a rule, functional cysts are 2 inches in diameter or smaller and usually have one fluid-filled area or bubble. The cyst wall is usually thin, and the inner side of the wall is smooth. An endovaginal ultrasound can reveal these features. Most cysts smaller than 2 inches in diameter are functional cysts. Surgery will likely be necessary to remove cysts larger than 4 inches. Helm, W., et al. ""Ovarian Cysts."" Medscape.

Abstract Abstract Persons whose experienced or expressed gender differs from their sex assigned at birth may identify as transgender. Transgender and gender-diverse persons may have gender dysphoria (i.e., distress related to this incongruence) and often face substantial health care disparities and barriers to care. Gender identity is distinct from sexual orientation, sex development, and external gender expression. Each construct is culturally variable and exists along continuums rather than as dichotomous entities. Training staff in culturally sensitive terminology and transgender topics (e.g., use of chosen name and pronouns), creating welcoming and affirming clinical environments, and assessing personal biases may facilitate improved patient interactions. Depending on their comfort level and the availability of local subspecialty support, primary care clinicians may evaluate gender dysphoria and manage applicable hormone therapy, or monitor well-being and provide primary care and referrals. The history and physical examination should be sensitive and tailored to the reason for each visit. Clinicians should identify and treat mental health conditions but avoid the assumption that such conditions are related to gender identity. Preventive services should be based on the patient's current anatomy, medication use, and behaviors. Gender-affirming hormone therapy, which involves the use of an estrogen and antiandrogen, or of testosterone, is generally safe but partially irreversible. Specialized referral-based surgical services may improve outcomes in select patients. Adolescents experiencing puberty should be evaluated for reversible puberty suppression, which may make future affirmation easier and safer. Aspects of affirming care should not be delayed until gender stability is ensured. Multidisciplinary care may be optimal but is not universally available. In the United States, approximately 150,000 youth and 1.4 million adults identify as transgender. As sociocultural acceptance patterns evolve, clinicians will likely care for an increasing number of transgender persons. However, data from a large observational study suggests that 24% of transgender persons report unequal treatment in health care environments, 19% report refusal of care altogether, and 33% do not seek preventive services. Approximately one-half report that they have taught basic tenets of transgender care to their health care professional.  Enlarge     Print Training clinicians and staff in culturally sensitive terminology and transgender topics, as well as cultural humility and assessment of personal internal biases, may facilitate improved patient interactions. Clinicians should consider routine screening for depression, anxiety, posttraumatic stress disorder, eating disorders, substance use, intimate partner violence, self-injury, bullying, truancy, homelessness, high-risk sexual behaviors, and suicidality. However, it is important to avoid assumptions that any concerns are secondary to being transgender. Efforts to convert a person's gender identity to align with their sex assigned at birth are unethical and incompatible with current guidelines and evidence. Not all transgender or gender-diverse persons require or seek hormone therapy. However, those who receive treatment generally report improved quality of life, self-esteem, and anxiety. Clinicians should consider initiation of or timely referral for a gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogue to suppress puberty when the patient has reached stage 2 or 3 of sexual maturity.

Transgender describes persons whose experienced or expressed gender differs from their sex assigned at birth. Gender dysphoria describes distress or problems functioning that may be experienced by transgender and gender-diverse persons; this term should be used to describe distressing symptoms rather than to pathologize. Gender incongruence, a diagnosis in the , 11th revision (ICD-11), describes the discrepancy between a person's experienced gender and assigned sex but does not imply dysphoria or a preference for treatment. The terms transgender and gender incongruence generally are not used to describe sexual orientation, sex development, or external gender expression, which are related but distinct phenomena. It may be helpful to consider the above constructs as culturally variable, nonbinary, and existing along continuums rather than as dichotomous entities. For clarity, the term transgender will be used as an umbrella term in this article to indicate gender incongruence, dysphoria, or diversity.  Enlarge     Print When one's gender identity is validated by others as authentic Person who identifies as genderless or outside the gender continuum Not transgender; a person whose gender identity and/or expression aligns with their sex assigned at birth Wearing of clothes typically associated with another gender; the term transvestite can be considered pejorative and should not be used Concept of not projecting one's own personal experiences and preconceptions of identity onto the experiences and identities of others Congenital conditions characterized by nuanced chromosomal, gonadal, or anatomic sex development (e.g., congenital adrenal hyperplasia, androgen insensitivity syndrome, Turner syndrome); not a universally accepted term; also called disorders of sex development or intersex Umbrella term for a broad range of identities along or outside the gender continuum; also called gender nonbinary General term describing gender behaviors, expressions, or identities that are not congruent with those culturally assigned at birth; may include transgender, nonbinary, genderqueer, gender fluid, or non-cisgender identitites and may be more dynamic and less stigmatizing than prior terminology (e.g., gender nonconforming); this term is not used as a clinical diagnosis Distress or impairment resulting from incongruence between one's experienced or expressed gender and sex assigned at birth; DSM-5 criteria for adults include at least six months of distress or problems functioning due to at least two of the following: Marked incongruence between one's experienced or expressed gender and primary and/or secondary sex characteristics Strong desire to be rid of one's primary and/or secondary sex characteristics Strong desire for the primary and/or secondary sex characteristics of the other gender Strong conviction that one has the typical feelings and reactions of the other gender External display of gender identity through appearance (e.g., clothing, hairstyle), behavior, voice, or interests Internalized sense of self as being male, female, or elsewhere along or outside the gender continuum; some persons have complex identities and may identify as agender, gender nonbinary, genderqueer, or gender fluid Diagnosis related to gender dysphoria or gender incongruence in earlier versions of the DSM and ICD General term describing a difference between gender identity and/or expression and designated sex; an ICD-11 diagnosis that does not require a mental health diagnosis Maleness or femaleness as it relates to sex chromosomes, gonads, genitalia, secondary sex characteristics, and relative levels of sex hormones; these biologic determinants may not necessarily be consistent; sex assigned at birth is typically based on genital anatomy Term describing an enduring physical and emotional attraction to another group; sexual orientation is distinct from gender identity and is defined by the individual Neutral pronouns preferred by some transgender persons General term used to describe persons whose gender identity or expression differs from their sex assigned at birthA transgender person designated as male at birthA transgender person designated as female at birth Nonbinary term used to describe a feminine spectrum of gender identity Nonbinary term used to describe a masculine spectrum of gender identity Prejudicial attitudes about persons who are not cisgender Historical term for transgender persons seeking medical or surgial therapy to affirm their gender DSM = Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders; ICD = . *—The terms gender diverse, gender incongruence, and transgender do not necessarily imply gender dysphoria.

Abstract It is important for clinicians to establish a safe and welcoming environment for transgender patients, with an emphasis on establishing and maintaining rapport . Clinicians can tell patients, “Although I have limited experience caring for gender-diverse persons, it is important to me that you feel safe in my practice, and I will work hard to give you the best care possible.” Waiting areas may be more welcoming if transgender-friendly materials and displayed graphics show diversity. Intake forms can be updated to include gender-neutral language and to use the two-step method (two questions to identify chosen gender identity and sex assigned at birth) to help identify transgender patients. Training clinicians and staff in culturally sensitive terminology and transgender topics, as well as cultural humility and assessment of personal internal biases, may facilitate improved patient interactions. Clinicians may also consider advocating for transgender patients in their community.  Enlarge     Print Foster sources of social support, including the patient's family and/or community, if allowed by the patient If you are unable to provide care for transgender patients, refer them to clinicians who are comfortable doing so Provide patients with information on transgender-friendly community resources Approach the patient with sensitivity and awareness Avoid imposing a binary view of gender identity, sexual orientation, sex development, or gender expression Be aware that interventions to change gender identity are unethical Build rapport and trust by providing nonjudgmental care Examine how aspects of one's identity (e.g., gender, sexual orientation, race, ethnicity, class, disability, spirituality) intersect in creating one's experience, and how coping strategies are influenced by marginalization experiences Treat all patients with empathy, respect, and dignity Create a transgender-friendly clinical environment Ask staff to perform a personal assessment of internal biases Consider including the two-step method (two questions to identify chosen gender identity and sex assigned at birth) to collect gender identity data Ensure that intake forms and records use gender-neutral or inclusive language (e.g., partnered instead of married) Provide care that affirms the patient's gender identity Provide inclusive physical spaces (e.g., display brochures with photos of same-sex couples, designate at least one gender-neutral restroom, display LGBT-friendly flags) Use gender-inclusive language, such as: “Are you currently in a romantic or sexual relationship?” “What have you done sexually with your partner(s)?” Maintain open communication with the promise of confidentiality Do not assume patients are ready to disclose their gender identity to family members Establish openness to discuss sexual and reproductive health concerns Inquire about unfamiliar terminology to prevent miscommunication Minimize threats to confidentiality (e.g., at the pharmacy, through billing practices) Be aware of state-specific minor consent and confidentiality laws Ensure timely referral for puberty suppression and mental health services Obtain an age-appropriate and confidential psychosocial history Information from references through .

Abstract When assessing transgender patients for gender-affirming care, the clinician should evaluate the magnitude, duration, and stability of any gender dysphoria or incongruence. Treatment should be optimized for conditions that may confound the clinical picture (e.g., psychosis) or make gender-affirming care more difficult (e.g., uncontrolled depression, significant substance use). The support and safety of the patient's social environment also warrants evaluation as it pertains to gender affirmation. This is ideally accomplished with multidisciplinary care and may require several visits to fully evaluate. Depending on their comfort level and the availability of local subspecialty support, primary care clinicians may elect to take an active role in the patient's gender-related care by evaluating gender dysphoria and managing hormone therapy, or an adjunctive role by monitoring well-being and providing primary care and referrals .       Considerations in the care of transgender and gender-diverse persons in primary care.

Clinicians should not consider themselves gatekeepers of hormone therapy; rather, they should assist patients in making reasonable and educated decisions about their health care using an informed consent model with parental consent as indicated. Based on expert opinion, the Endocrine Society recommends that clinicians who diagnose gender dysphoria or incongruence and who manage gender-affirming hormone therapy receive training in the proper use of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th ed., and the ICD; have the ability to determine capacity for consent and to resolve psychosocial barriers to gender affirmation; be comfortable and knowledgeable in prescribing and monitoring hormone therapies; attend relevant professional meetings; and, if applicable, be familiar with lifespan development of transgender youth. Transgender patients may experience discomfort during the physical examination because of ongoing dysphoria or negative past experiences. Examinations should be based on the patient's current anatomy and specific needs for the visit, and should be explained, chaperoned, and stopped as indicated by the patient's comfort level. Differences of sex development are typically diagnosed much earlier than gender dysphoria or gender incongruence. However, in the absence of gender-affirming hormone therapy, an initial examination may be warranted to assess for sex characteristics that are incongruent with sex assigned at birth. Such findings may warrant referral to an endocrinologist or other subspecialist. Abstract Transgender patients typically have high rates of mental health diagnoses. However, it is important not to assume that a patient's mental health concerns are secondary to being transgender. Primary care clinicians should consider routine screening for depression, anxiety, posttraumatic stress disorder, eating disorders, substance use, intimate partner violence, self-injury, bullying, truancy, homelessness, high-risk sexual behaviors, and suicidality. Clinicians should be equipped to handle the basic mental health needs of transgender persons (e.g., first-line treatments for depression or anxiety) and refer patients to subspecialists when warranted. Because of the higher prevalence of traumatic life experiences in transgender persons, care should be trauma-informed (i.e., focused on safety, empowerment, and trustworthiness) and guided by the patient's life experiences as they relate to their care and resilience. Efforts to convert a person's gender identity to align with their sex assigned at birth—so-called gender conversion therapy—are unethical and incompatible with current guidelines and evidence, including policy from the American Academy of Family Physicians. Abstract Preventive services are similar for transgender and cisgender (i.e., not transgender) persons. Nuanced recommendations are based on the patient's current anatomy, medication use, and behaviors. Screening recommendations for hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus, tobacco use, hypertension, and obesity are available from the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF). Clinicians should be vigilant for signs and symptoms of venous thromboembolism (VTE) and metabolic disease because hormone therapy may increase the risk of these conditions. Screening for osteoporosis is based on hormone use. Cancer screening recommendations are determined by the patient's current anatomy. Transgender females with breast tissue and transgender males who have not undergone complete mastectomy should receive screening mammography based on guidelines for cisgender persons. Screening for cervical and prostate cancers should be based on current guidelines and the presence of relevant anatomy. Recommendations for immunizations (e.g., human papillomavirus) and screening and treatment for sexually transmitted infections (including human immunodeficiency virus) are provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and USPSTF based on sexual practices. Pre- and postexposure prophylaxis for human immunodeficiency virus infection should be considered for patients who meet treatment criteria. Abstract Feminizing and masculinizing hormone therapies are partially irreversible treatments to facilitate development of secondary sex characteristics of the experienced gender. Not all gender-diverse persons require or seek hormone treatment; however, those who receive treatment generally report improved quality of life, self-esteem, and anxiety. Patients must consent to therapy after being informed of the potentially irreversible changes in physical appearance, fertility potential, and social circumstances, as well as other potential benefits and risks. Feminizing hormone therapy includes estrogen and antiandrogens to decrease the serum testosterone level below 50 ng per dL (1.7 nmol per L) while maintaining the serum estradiol level below 200 pg per mL (734 pmol per L). Therapy may reduce muscle mass, libido, and terminal hair growth, and increase breast development and fat redistribution; voice change is not expected. The risk of VTE can be mitigated by avoiding formulations containing ethinyl estradiol, supraphysiologic doses, and tobacco use. Additional risks include breast cancer, prolactinoma, cardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease, cholelithiasis, and hypertriglyceridemia; however, these risks are rare (yet clinically significant), indolent, or incompletely studied. Spironolactone use requires monitoring for hypotension, hyperkalemia, and changes in renal function. Masculinizing hormone therapy includes testosterone to increase serum levels to 320 to 1,000 ng per dL (11.1 to 34.7 nmol per L). Anticipated changes include acne, scalp hair loss, voice deepening, vaginal atrophy, clitoromegaly, weight gain, facial and body hair growth, and increased muscle mass. Patients receiving masculinizing hormone therapy are at risk of erythrocytosis, as determined by male-range reference values (e.g., hematocrit greater than 50%). Data on patient-oriented outcomes (e.g., death, thromboembolic disease, stroke, osteoporosis, liver toxicity, myocardial infarction) are sparse. Despite possible metabolic effects, few serious events have been identified in meta-analyses. Active hormone-sensitive malignancy is an absolute contraindication to gender-affirming hormone treatment. Patients who are older, use tobacco, or have severe chronic disease, current or previous VTE, or a history of hormone-sensitive malignancy may benefit from individualized dosing regimens and subspecialty consultation. The benefits and risks of treatment should be weighed against the risks of inaction, such as suicidality. The use of low-dose transdermal estradiol-17 β (Climara) may reduce the risk of VTE. Some patients without coexisting conditions may prefer a lower dose or individualized regimen.

Olson J, Forbes C, Belzer M. Management of the transgender adolescent. Arch Pediatr Adolesc Med. . Abstract Gender-affirming surgical treatments may not be required to minimize gender dysphoria, and care should be individualized. Mastectomy (i.e., chest reconstruction surgery) may be performed for transmasculine persons before 18 years of age, depending on consent, duration of applicable hormone treatment, and health status. Breast augmentation for transfeminine persons may be timed to maximal breast development from hormone therapy. Mastectomy or breast augmentation generally costs less than $10,000, and insurance coverage varies. Patients may also request referral for facial and laryngeal surgery, voice therapy, or hair removal. The Endocrine Society recommends that persons who seek fertility-limiting surgeries reach the legal age of majority, optimize treatment for coexisting conditions, and undergo social affirmation and hormone treatment (if applicable) continuously for 12 months. Adherence to hormone therapy after gonadectomy is paramount for maintaining bone mineral density. Despite associated costs, varying insurance coverage, potential complications, and the potential for prolonged recovery, gender-affirming surgeries generally have high satisfaction rates. Abstract Most, but not all, transgender adults report stability of their gender identity since childhood. However, some gender-diverse prepubertal children subsequently identify as gay, lesbian, or bisexual adolescents, or have other identities instead of transgender, as opposed to those in early adolescence, when gender identity may become clearer. There is no universally accepted treatment protocol for prepubertal gender-diverse children. Clinicians may preferentially focus on assisting the child and family members in an affirmative care strategy that individualizes healthy exploration of gender identity (as opposed to a supportive, “wait-and-see” approach); this may warrant referral to a mental health clinician comfortable with the lifespan development of transgender youth. Transgender adolescents should have access to psychological therapy for support and a safe means to explore their gender identity, adjust to socioemotional aspects of gender incongruence, and discuss realistic expectations for potential therapy. The clinician should advocate for supportive family and social environments, which have been shown to confer resilience. Unsupportive environments in which patients are bullied or victimized can have adverse effects on psychosocial functioning and well-being. Transgender adolescents may experience distress at the onset of secondary sex characteristics. Clinicians should consider initiation of or timely referral for a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) to suppress puberty when the patient has reached stage 2 or 3 of sexual maturity. This treatment is fully reversible, may make future affirmation easier and safer, and allows time to ensure stability of gender identity. No hormonal intervention is warranted before the onset of puberty. Consent for treatment with GnRH analogues should include information about benefits and risks  . Before therapy is initiated, patients should be offered referral to discuss fertility preservation, which may require progression through endogenous puberty. Some persons prefer to align their appearance (e.g., clothing, hairstyle) or behaviors with their gender identity. The risks and benefits of social affirmation should be weighed. Transmasculine postmenarcheal youth may undergo menstrual suppression, which typically provides an additional contraceptive benefit (testosterone alone is insufficient). Breast binding may be used to conceal breast tissue but may cause pain, skin irritation, or skin infections. Multiple studies report improved psychosocial outcomes after puberty suppression and subsequent gender-affirming hormone therapy. Delayed treatment may potentiate psychiatric stress and gender-related abuse; therefore, withholding gender-affirming treatment in a wait-and-see approach is not without risk.  Additional resources for transgender persons, family members, and clinicians are presented in .  Enlarge     Print Selected Resources for Care of Transgender and Gender-Diverse Persons Guidelines for the Primary and Gender-Affirming Care of Transgender and Gender Nonbinary People, 2nd ed.

Eosinophilic gastritis: histopathological characterization and quantification of the normal gastric eosinophil content Eosinophilic gastritis: histopathological characterization and quantification of the normal gastric eosinophil content , –() There is limited information about normal eosinophil counts in the gastric mucosa. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the histopathology of 60 patients whose biopsies showed increased eosinophils in the gastric mucosa. We also investigated the eosinophil content in gastric biopsies from normal controls (matched for age, sex, and zip code), from patients with gastritis, and patients with Crohn's disease. Eosinophils were counted in five random high-power fields (HPFs) and reported in eosinophils/mm. Involvement of the muscularis mucosae or submucosa, sheets of eosinophils, and infiltration of the gastric epithelium were also evaluated. The median eosinophil count in the study patients was 539 eosinophils/mm; mean±SD=653±418 eosinophils/mm; range 127–2108. Sheets of eosinophils were seen in 38 patients, 27 showed involvement of the muscularis mucosae or submucosa. There were 7 patients without epithelial infiltration by eosinophils, whereas 34 were tallied as rare and 19 were scored as abundant. No study patient had no evidence of . The mean eosinophil count for the 135 normal controls was 15.5±16.8 SD eosinophils/mm (range 0–110); in the 93 controls with gastritis the mean eosinophil count was 25±32.6 SD eosinophils/mm (range 0–219); and for the 53 controls with Crohn's disease it was 31.4±44.4 SD eosinophils/mm (range 0–203). There were no significant differences between the counts in biopsies from the antrum and corpus, and no significant variations by age, geographic location, or season. This study confirms that, in the United States population, the normal gastric eosinophilic counts are usually <38 eosinophils/mm. We recommend ‘histological eosinophilic gastritis’ for the diagnosis of gastric biopsies that show an average density ≥127 eosinophils/mm (or ≥30 eosinophils per HPF) in at least five HPFs in the absence of known associated causes of eosinophilia. When confronted with a biopsy showing ‘greater than normal’ numbers of eosinophils in the gastric mucosa, a pathologist has limited available resources that can help decide whether or how to report this finding: non-standardized descriptions found in case reports, or brief sections in textbooks. Surprisingly, the normal eosinophilic content in the lamina propria of the gastric mucosa has rarely been investigated. No consensus exists on specific limits for normality and, consequently, there are no guidelines as to what constitutes an excessive number of eosinophils in gastric mucosal biopsies. Although acknowledging this uncertainty, the updated Sydney system specifically stated that intraepithelial eosinophils must always be viewed as abnormal. Increased numbers of eosinophils in the lamina propria have been reported after eradication therapy for , in reactive gastropathy caused by certain drugs, and in focal responses to tissue-invading parasites, particularly Anisakis spp. larvae. Increased gastric eosinophils can also be identified in patients with the rare eosinophil-associated gastrointestinal disorders. In these situations, it has been suggested that the term ‘mucosal eosinophilia’ be used when the increase in eosinophils is limited to the lamina propria, reserving the designation of ‘eosinophilic gastritis’ for cases in which eosinophils infiltrate the surface or foveolar epithelium, the muscularis mucosae or the submucosa, or other mucosal damage (such as foveolar hyperplasia, architectural distortion, significant chronic, or active inflammation) is present. The purpose of this study was to characterize the histopathology of gastric biopsies with increased eosinophils. We then aimed to synthesize these findings into a diagnosis of ‘histological eosinophilic gastritis.’ In addition, we sought to determine the normal range of gastric mucosal eosinophils in a geographically varied North American population. This study was conducted at Caris Life Sciences, a specialized gastrointestinal laboratory receiving specimens from gastroenterologists operating in private outpatient endoscopy centers across the United States. The study was approved by the Caris Institutional Review Board. Because all data in this study were collected entirely by reviewing existing de-identified records, no direct contact with either patients or providers was involved, and no individual information is revealed in any form, this study was considered exempt from the need for informed consent from participants. We analyzed electronic data from the Caris database, which includes demographic and clinical information for each patient, a summary of the endoscopic findings or the entire endoscopic report, the site of origin of each specimen, and the histopathology report for each biopsy. To identify the records for eligible patients, we extracted data for all patients who had at least one gastric biopsy submitted to Caris between 1 January 2008 and 31 December 2009. By electronically analyzing the histopathology reports and using additional search terms and Boolean logic in Visual Basic for Applications, we collected all gastric biopsies in which either the diagnostic line of the pathology report or the comment mentioned ‘eosinophils.’ For the Boolean search we used all variations of the root ‘eosinoph,’ and reviewed manually reports that appeared to be of interest. To identify the normal gastric mucosal eosinophil content, we selected two to three normal control subjects for each study patient; to account for potential reported variations, normal controls were matched for age (±1 year for children and ±2 years for adults), sex, and zip code, and had histologically unremarkable gastric biopsies. In addition, we counted gastric mucosal eosinophils in a set of 93 sex- and age-matched patients with infection confirmed by immunohistochemical staining, and in 53 sex- and age-matched patients with chronic active ileitis or colitis and a clinical history or suspicion of Crohn's disease. Patients with focally enhanced gastritis were excluded. Hematoxylin and eosin stained gastric biopsy slides from all study patients and controls were reviewed. Eosinophils in the lamina propria were counted in five random high-power fields (HPFs) per biopsy specimen using an Olympus BX41 microscope with a UPlan FLN 40X/0.75 lens and an FN 22 eyepiece; this ‘HPF’ includes an area on the slide of 0.237 mm. The density of eosinophils was then reported in eosinophil/mm. Involvement of the muscularis mucosae or submucosa, and sheets of eosinophils were noted as present or absent. Infiltration of the gastric epithelium was scored on a scale of 0–2 (absent, mild or rare, and marked or abundant). All specimens were also stained with the immunohistochemical stain for (Cell Marque, Rocklin, CA, USA). A total of 248 307 unique patients had gastric biopsy specimens diagnosed in our laboratory during the 2 years of the study. Increased gastric mucosal eosinophils were mentioned in the histopathology reports of 71 patients. After reviewing the slides, 11 of these patients were found to have patchy or minimal eosinophils in the lamina propria with no epithelial involvement, and were not considered diagnostically appropriate for inclusion. Thus, there remained 60 study patients, for which 135 appropriately matched controls were selected. Demographic information on the study patients is found in . There were 10 children (2 girls and 8 boys, aged 4 to 14) and 50 adults (32 women; 64.0%). The median age of all patients was 50 (range 4–83). The clinical indications leading to esophagogastroduodenoscopy and gastroscopic findings in study patients are detailed in . Epigastric pain was the most common presenting manifestation in both adults and children, followed by reflux disease and dysphagia. Endoscopically, the most common findings were a normal stomach or erythema and gastritis, with or without erosions. The clinical and histopathological findings in each of the 60 study patients are depicted in . Histopathological Features of Eosinophilic Gastritis The histological findings in gastric biopsies of study patients are summarized in . The median eosinophil density was 539/mm; mean±SD=653±418/mm; range 127–2108. shows an antral biopsy with markedly increased eosinophils. All patients had eosinophilic clusters scattered in the lamina propria. Sheets of eosinophils () were seen in the biopsies from 38 (63.3%) patients. The gastric epithelium was infiltrated by eosinophils in 53 (88.3%) patients (); the epithelial involvement was scored as abundant in 19 cases and rare in 34. In contrast to neutrophilic processes (eg, as in infection), eosinophils tended to surround the foveolae and infiltrate their epithelium, but virtually never spilled into the lumen to form eosinophilic ‘pit abscesses’ (). Muscularis mucosae or submucosal tissue involvement was noted in 27 patients (). Intestinal metaplasia was seen in the biopsies of two patients. organisms were not detected by immunohistochemistry in any of the patients. illustrate the eosinophilic content typically found in the antrum and corpus of control subjects. The mean eosinophil count for the 135 control patients (84 women, or 62.2%; median age 50 years, range 4–81) was 15.5±16.8 SD eosinophils/mm (range 0–110). Only one of the controls (a 56-year-old woman of Japanese origin) had a mean count of 110 eosinophils/mm. All other controls averaged fewer than 55 eosinophils/mm. There were no significant differences between the counts in biopsies from the antrum and corpus, and no significant variation by either age or geographic location (data not shown). The median density of eosinophils in age- and sex-matched patients with infection or Crohn's disease was lower than in normal controls (15.8 and 9.5 eosinophils/mm, respectively, 25 eosinophils/mm in subjects with a normal stomach). However, both mean density and standard deviation were higher, reflecting the presence of a few patients with elevated counts (up to 203–219 eosinophils/mm) in each of these two groups. Histopathological Findings in other Parts of the Gastrointestinal Tract Of 23 patients with esophageal biopsies, 14 met the histological criteria for eosinophilic esophagitis; of 18 patients with concurrent duodenal biopsies two had increased eosinophils. None of the three patients with colonic biopsies had mucosal eosinophilia. An increased eosinophil count in gastric mucosal biopsies represents a rare and often baffling finding. One of the aims of our study was to identify a set of histological features that could serve as a foundation for the development of diagnostic criteria for eosinophilic gastritis. As the normal content of eosinophils in the stomach has not been thoroughly investigated, we first determined the normal eosinophil counts in the antrum and corpus of subjects with a normal stomach. In the Kalixanda study, Talley found a mean peak eosinophil count of 12/5 HPF in biopsies from the cardia, body, and antrum of asymptomatic adult volunteers from northern Sweden. In 19 children from Ohio, whose gastric biopsies had been previously reported as histologically normal, DeBrosse found peak eosinophil counts of 8 per HPF in antral and 11 per HPF in oxyntic mucosal biopsies. These studies did not report the area of the HPF used for the counts. Several years ago, a small multicenter study suggested that there exist significant variations in colonic mucosa eosinophil counts in different United States cities, eg, between residents of Boston and New Orleans. To account for as many of these variables as possible, we counted the tissue eosinophils in two to three controls matched for age, sex, and ZIP code, who had gastric biopsies diagnosed as unremarkable. Our results are in agreement with those of Tally and DeBrosse. The mean (±SD) eosinophilic count in 135 subjects with normal gastric mucosa was 15.5±16.8 eosinophils/mm, and the peak density was around 50 eosinophils/mm. Only a single normal control subject had counts that exceeded this value. Also, we found no significant differences related to sex, age, or area of residence, and the eosinophil counts were similar in antral and corpus biopsies. As gastritis and Crohn's disease have been associated with increased gastric eosinophils, we studied two control groups of patients with these conditions. The majority of patients with chronic active gastritis and Crohn's disease had mucosal eosinophilic counts similar to our normal controls, but in each of these two groups there were a few patients with high counts (up to 203–219 eosinophils/mm, respectively). Eosinophilic gastritis would be an unlikely consideration in patients with infection. However, in patients with moderately high eosinophil counts in their gastric mucosa, the possibility of Crohn's disease should be entertained and the relevant clinical history should be obtained. The next step was to determine a sensible threshold above which eosinophilic gastritis could be considered. The mean count (±SD) in our study patients was 653±418 eosinophils/mm. Only two children (aged 4 and 8 years) with increased gastric eosinophils had <190 eosinophils/mm (127 and 168, respectively). All other patients had counts of 190 eosinophils/mm or higher, with a median of 539 eosinophils/mm and a mode of 463 eosinophils/mm. One could argue that a likely reason why no study patient had fewer than 127 eosinophils/mm (or 30 per HPF) was because pathologists tend not to report tissue eosinophilia below such threshold. However, the fact that only one of 135 controls whose biopsies had been diagnosed as normal had more that 54 eosinophils/mm supports the contention that elevated gastric eosinophilic counts in the general population are indeed extremely rare. During the 2 years covered in this study, 2525 unique patients with both esophageal and gastric biopsies examined in our laboratory, and had a histological diagnosis consistent with eosinophilic esophagitis (ie, >15 eosinophils per HPF in the esophageal squamous mucosa, eosinophil degranulation, microabscesses, and other compatible epithelial features). However, the prevalence of gastric involvement in these patients was <0.6%. Only 14 of these patients (all reported in this series) had also significant eosinophilic infiltrates in the stomach. None of the control patients’ esophageal biopsies demonstrated increased eosinophils. This low prevalence suggests that these two conditions are likely not related. Two study patients also had an eosinophilic infiltrate in the duodenum; such cases could be classified as eosinophilic gastroenteritis. Furthermore, our data are in agreement with a recent article reporting on the rarity of eosinophilic gastroenteritis. The term secondary eosinophilic gastritis, rarely used outside the context of classifications, implies that the reasons for the eosinophilic infiltrates in the gastric mucosa are known. These may include infection with Anisakis spp., , , infections, after treatment, drugs, connective tissue diseases, hematopoietic disorders, and food allergy. It must be emphasized, however, that with the exception of tissue eosinophilia associated with nematode larvae, connective tissue diseases, and hematopoietic disorders, all other associations are putative, based solely on individual case reports or small series. In our series, we could not document a specific etiology for the gastric eosinophilia in any of the patients. In one case, the referring clinician emphasized the use of meloxicam by patient as a cause for erosive gastritis, and the reporting pathologist indicated that as a possible cause for eosinophilia. However, there are only rare reports eosinophilic infiltrates associated with this drug, all limited to the lungs. Primary eosinophilic gastritis may be found in association with a generalized infiltration of eosinophils in other segments of the digestive tract; it is also referred to as idiopathic or allergic gastroenteritis and is typically considered a pediatric condition. However, our data suggest that isolated histological eosinophilic gastritis exists in both children and adults. The clinical information available to us was somewhat limited and we had no access to relevant laboratory data, such as peripheral eosinophil counts and serum IgE immunoglobulin levels. This limitation, in addition to the wide variety of nonspecific presenting signs and symptoms reported by our patients and the lack of distinctive endoscopic characteristics, makes it premature to propose integrated clinicopathological criteria to define eosinophilic gastritis as a new entity. However, on the basis of impressive histopathological findings demonstrated in this series, we recommend that the term ‘histological eosinophilic gastritis’ be used for the diagnosis in patients who: (1) have gastric biopsies that show an average density ≥127 eosinophils/mm (or ≥30 eosinophils per HPF on microscopes equipped with wide-lens oculars) in at least five separate HPFs; and (2) have no known associated causes of eosinophilia (eg, infection, Crohn's disease, parasitic infections, and hematological or lymphoid disorders). If regularly reported, it may become possible to analyze clinicopathological information from a sufficient number of patients and detect common features, which in turn will help generate testable etiological hypotheses.

Endocrine practice : official journal of the American College of Endocrinology and the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists Background: Obesity is a well-known risk factor for infertility. However, use of weight loss medications prior to conception is underutilized. The objectives of our study are to describe weight loss, pregnancy rates, and live birth rates after short-term phentermine use in women with obesity and infertility. Methods: This was a retrospective analysis of 55 women (18-45 years old) who were overweight or obese, diagnosed with infertility, and prescribed phentermine for weight loss in an ambulatory endocrinology clinic at a single, tertiary level academic medical center. Main outcome measures were mean percent weight change at 3 months after starting phentermine and pregnancy and live birth rates from start of phentermine to June 30, 2017. Results: Median duration of phentermine use was 70 days (Q1, Q3 [33, 129]). Mean SD percent weight change at 3 months after starting phentermine was -5.3 4.1% (p < 0.001). The pregnancy rate was 60% and live birth rate was 49%. There was no significant difference in pregnancy rates (52% vs. 68%, p = 0.23) or live birth rates (44% vs. 54%, p = 0.50) in women who lost 5% vs. <5% of their baseline weight. Number of metabolic comorbidities was negatively associated with pregnancy rate. Phentermine was generally well tolerated with no serious adverse events. Conclusions: Phentermine can produce clinically significant weight loss in women with obesity during the preconception period. Higher pregnancy or live birth rates were not observed with greater degree of weight loss with phentermine. INCREASED RISK OF SEVERE MATERNAL MORBIDITY AMONG INFERTILE WOMEN: ANALYSIS OF US CLAIMS DATA. Murugappan, G., Li, S., Lathi, R. B., Baker, V. L., Luke, B., Eisenberg, M. L. Severe maternal morbidity continues to be an issue of national and global concern and is increasing in incidence. The incidence of infertility is also on the rise, and infertile women experience a higher risk of incident chronic medical disease and cancer, suggesting that fertility may serve as a window to a woman's overall health.To investigate the risk of severe maternal morbidity by maternal fertility status.Retrospective cohort analysis using Optum's de-identifed Clinformatics Data Mart Database between 2003-2015. Infertile women stratified by infertility diagnosis, testing or treatment were compared to fertile women seeking routine gynecologic care. In both groups, only women who underwent pregnancy and delivery of a singleton during the follow up period were included. Main outcomes were severe maternal morbidity indicators, defined by the CDC, and identified by ICD-10 and CPT codes within 6 weeks of each delivery. Results were adjusted for maternal age, race, education, nulliparity, race, smoking, obesity, delivery mode, preterm birth, number of prenatal visits, and year of delivery.19,658 women comprised the infertile group and 525,695 women comprised the fertile group. The overall incidence of any severe maternal morbidity indicator was 7.0% among women receiving fertility treatment, 6.4% among women receiving a fertility diagnosis, 5.5% among women receiving fertility testing and 4.3% among fertile women.. Overall, infertile women had a significantly higher risk of developing any severe maternal morbidity indicator (AOR 1.22, CI 1.14-1.31, p<0.01) as well as a significantly higher risk of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) (AOR 1.48, CI 1.26 - 1.73, p<0.01), eclampsia (AOR 1.37, CI 1.05 - 1.79, p<0.01), heart failure during procedure or surgery (AOR 1.54, CI 1.21 - 1.97, p<0.01), internal injuries of the thorax, abdomen or pelvis (AOR 1.59, CI 1.12 - 2.26, p<0.01), intracranial injuries (AOR 1.77, CI 1.20- 2.61, p<0.01), pulmonary edema (AOR 2.18, CI 1.54 - 3.10, p<0.01), thrombotic embolism (AOR 1.58, CI 1.14 - 2.17, p<0.01), and blood transfusion (AOR 1.50, CI 1.30 - 1.72, p<0.01) compared to fertile women. Fertile women did not face a significantly higher risk of any maternal morbidity indicator compared to infertile women. In subgroup analysis by maternal race/ethnicity, the likelihood of severe morbidity was significantly higher among fertile Black women compared to fertile Caucasian women. There was no difference between infertile Black and Caucasian women after multivariable adjustment.Using an insurance claims database, we report that women diagnosed with infertility and women receiving fertility treatment experience a significantly higher risk of multiple indicators of severe maternal morbidity compared to fertile women. The increased risk of severe maternal morbidity noted among fertile Black women compared to fertile Caucasian women is attenuated among infertile Black women, who face similar risks as infertile Caucasian women. Association between preconception paternal health and pregnancy loss in the USA: an analysis of US claims data. Kasman, A. M., Zhang, C. A., Li, S., Lu, Y., Lathi, R. B., Stevenson, D. K., Shaw, G. M., Eisenberg, M. L. Is preconception paternal health associated with pregnancy loss?Poor preconception paternal health is associated with a higher risk of pregnancy loss as confirmed in sensitivity analyses accounting for maternal age and health.Preconception paternal health can negatively impact perinatal outcomes.Retrospective cohort study of US insurance claims database from 2009 to 2016 covering 958804 pregnancies.US insurance claims database including women, men and pregnancies within the USA between 2007 and 2016. Paternal preconception health status (e.g. metabolic syndrome diagnoses (MetS), Charlson comorbidity index (CCI) and individual chronic disease diagnoses) was examined in relation to pregnancy loss (e.g. ectopic pregnancy, miscarriage and stillbirth).In all, 958804 pregnancies were analyzed. The average paternal age was 35.3years (SD 5.3) and maternal age was 33.1years (SD 4.4). Twenty-two percent of all pregnancies ended in a loss. After adjusting for maternal factors, the risk of pregnancy loss increased with increasing paternal comorbidity. For example, compared to men with no components of MetS, the risk of pregnancy loss increased for men with one (relative risk (RR) 1.10, 95% CI 1.09-1.12), two (RR 1.15, 95% CI 1.13-1.17) or three or more (RR 1.19, 95% CI 1.14-1.24) components. Specifically, less healthy men had a higher risk of siring a pregnancy ending in spontaneous abortion, stillbirth and ectopic pregnancies. Similar patterns remained with other measures of paternal health (e.g. CCI, chronic diseases, etc.). When stratifying by maternal age as well as maternal health, a similar pattern of increasing pregnancy loss risk for men with 1, 2 or 3+ MetS was observed. A statistically significant but weak association between timing of pregnancy loss and paternal health was found.Retrospective study design covering only employer insured individuals may limit generalizability.Optimization of a father's health may improve pregnancy outcomes.National Institutes of Health National Center for Advancing Translational Science Clinical and Translational Science Award (UL1 TR001085).

A correct call was defined when a result was concordant with at least one other testing platform. The correct call rate was 85%, 93%, and 85% using cytogenetics, SNP array, and aCGH, respectively. We found a 33% overall discordance rate between results. Discordances were due to maternal cell contamination, balanced chromosome rearrangements, polyploidy, and placental mosaicism. Mosaicism was detected in 18% of all samples. Growth failure occurred in four samples sent to cytogenetics, of which three were chromosomally abnormal by molecular testing.This study demonstrates the many technical limitations of the three testing modalities. Our rates of maternal cell contamination were low, but it is important to note that this is a commonly reported limitation of cytogenetics. Given the similar overall performance of the three testing modalities, providers may choose a method based on individual availability and consideration of limitations as it applies to each clinical scenario. The unexpected high rate of placental mosaicism warrants further investigation.

COL16A1, COTL1, HMHA1, KRCL1, XCL1, and XCL2 were down-regulated and KRT7, MFAP5, and S100A1 were up-regulated in the endometrium of obese patients. These genes are mainly involved in chemokine, cytokine, and immune system activity and in the structural extracellular matrix and protein-binding molecular functions.Obesity is associated with significant endometrial transcriptomic differences as compared with non-obese subjects. Altered endometrial gene expression in obese patients may contribute to the lower implantation rates and increased miscarriage rates seen in obese infertile patients.NCT02205866. View details for Intent to treat analysis of in vitro fertilization and preimplantation genetic screening versus expectant management in patients with recurrent pregnancy loss. Murugappan, G., Shahine, L. K., Perfetto, C. O., Hickok, L. R., Lathi, R. B. In an intent to treat analysis, are clinical outcomes improved in recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL) patients undergoing IVF and preimplantation genetic screening (PGS) compared with patients who are expectantly managed (EM)?Among all attempts at PGS or EM among RPL patients, clinical outcomes including pregnancy rate, live birth (LB) rate and clinical miscarriage (CM) rate were similar.The standard of care for management of patients with RPL is EM. Due to the prevalence of aneuploidy in CM, PGS has been proposed as an alternate strategy for reducing CM rates and improving LB rates.Retrospective cohort study of 300 RPL patients treated between 2009 and 2014.Among two academic fertility centers, 112 RPL patients desired PGS and 188 patients chose EM. Main outcomes measured were pregnancy rate and LB per attempt and CM rate per pregnancy. One attempt was defined as an IVF cycle followed by a fresh embryo transfer or a frozen embryo transfer (PGS group) and 6 months trying to conceive (EM group).In the IVF group, 168 retrievals were performed and 38 cycles canceled their planned PGS. Cycles in which PGS was intended but cancelled had a significantly lower LB rate (15 versus 36%, P = 0.01) and higher CM rate (50 versus 14%, P < 0.01) compared with cycles that completed PGS despite similar maternal ages. Of the 130 completed PGS cycles, 74% (n = 96) yielded at least one euploid embryo. Clinical pregnancy rate per euploid embryo transfer was 72% and LB rate per euploid embryo transfer was 57%. Among all attempts at PGS or EM, clinical outcomes were similar. Median time to pregnancy was 6.5 months in the PGS group and 3.0 months in the EM group.The largest limitation is the retrospective study design, in which patients who elected for IVF/PGS may have had different clinical prognoses than patients who elected for expectant management. In addition, the definition of one attempt at conception for PGS and EM groups was different between the groups and can introduce potential confounders. For example, it was not confirmed that patients in the EM group were trying to conceive for each month of the 6-month period.Success rates with PGS are limited by the high incidence of cycles that intend but cancel PGS or cycles that do not reach transfer. Counseling RPL patients on their treatment options should include not only success rates with PGS per euploid embryo transferred, but also LB rate per initiated PGS cycle. Furthermore, patients who express an urgency to conceive should be counseled that PGS may not accelerate time to conception.None.N/A.N/A.N/A.

Immunohistochemical (IHC) staining for CD138 was later applied to all tissue samples. Charts were reviewed to evaluate the outcome of the next clinical intrauterine pregnancy.Miscarriage rate and live birth rate.A total of 107 women met inclusion criteria. The use of CD138 IHC staining resulted in a significantly higher prevalence of CE compared with the use of H & E staining and morphological assessment alone (56% [60/107] vs. 13% [14/107]). The 51 women with untreated CE were compared with the 45 women without CE by CD138 staining. Among those women with a subsequent pregnancy, the live birth rate in the next clinical intrauterine pregnancy after endometrial evaluation was 67.6% (23/34) in women with untreated CE and 87.1% (27/31) in women without CE. Age, body mass index (BMI), results of RPL evaluation, and number of prior losses were not significantly different between the two groups.CD138 IHC staining of endometrial biopsies in women with RPL provides increased sensitivity when screening for CE compared with H & E staining and morphological assessment alone. Untreated CE may contribute to poor pregnancy outcomes and deserves further investigation in a larger cohort.

Median conjugated BPA concentrations were higher in the women who had miscarriages than in those who had live births (0.101 vs. 0.075ng/mL). Women with the highest quartile of conjugated BPA had an increased relative risk of miscarriage (1.83; 95% CI, 1.14-2.96) compared with the women in the lowest quartile. We found a similar increase risk for both euploid and aneuploid miscarriages.Maternal conjugated BPA was associated with a higher risk of aneuploid and euploid miscarriage in this cohort. The impact of reducing individual exposure on future pregnancy outcomes deserves further study.

Y., Zhao, Q., Nadgauda, A., Ashrafian, S., Behr, B., Lathi, R. B. PURPOSE: To assess whether preimplantation genetic testing for aneuploidies (PGT-A) at the blastocyst stage improves clinical outcomes compared with transfer of embryos without PGT-A in poor ovarian response (POR) patients.METHODS: Retrospective cohort study of IVF cycles from 2016 to 2019 at a single academic fertility center. IVF cycles with POR and four or fewer oocytes retrieved were stratified into PGT-A (n=241) and non-PGT (n=112) groups. In PGT-A cycles, trophectoderm biopsy, next-generation sequencing with 24-chromosome screening, and single euploid frozen embryo transfer were performed. In non-PGT cycles, fresh or frozen transfer of untested embryos on day 3 or 5 was performed. Main outcomes included live birth rate and miscarriage rate per retrieval.RESULT(S): Patients who underwent PGT-A cycles were significantly less likely to reach embryo transfer compared with those who underwent non-PGT cycles (13.7% vs 70.6%). The live birth rate per retrieval did not differ between the PGT-A and non-PGT groups (6.6% vs 5.4%). Overall, the miscarriage rate was low. The PGT-A group demonstrated a significantly lower miscarriage rate per retrieval (0.4% vs 3.6%) as well as per pregnancy (5.9% vs 40.0%) compared with the non-PGT group. The number needed to treat to avoid one clinical miscarriage was 31 PGT-A cycles.CONCLUSION(S): PGT-A did not improve live birth rate per retrieval in POR patients with four or fewer oocytes retrieved. PGT-A was associated with a lower miscarriage rate; however, a fairly large number of PGT-A cycles were needed to prevent one miscarriage.

Deng, J., Zhao, Q., Cinnioglu, C., Kayali, R., Lathi, R. B., Behr, B. PURPOSE: To compare a single-step medium with a sequential medium on human blastocyst development rates, aneuploidy rates, and clinical outcomes.METHODS: Retrospective cohort study of IVF cycles that used Sage advantage sequential medium (n = 347) and uninterrupted Sage 1-step medium (n = 519) from July 1, 2016, to December 31, 2017, in an academic fertility center. Main outcome measures are blastocyst formation rates per two-pronuclear (2PN) oocyte and aneuploidy rates per biopsy.RESULTS: Of all IVF cycles, single-step medium yielded higher blastocyst formation rate (51.7% vs 43.4%) but higher aneuploidy rate (54.0% vs 45.8%) compared with sequential medium. When stratified by maternal age, women under age 38 had no difference in blastocyst formation (52.2% vs 50.2%) but a higher aneuploidy rate (44.5% vs 36.4%) resulting in a lower number of euploid blastocysts per cycle (2.6 vs 3.3) when using single-step medium compared to sequential medium. In cycles used single-step medium, patients age 38 had higher blastocyst rate (48.0% vs 33.6%), but no difference in aneuploidy rate (68.8% vs 66.0%) or number of euploid embryos (0.8 vs 1.1). For patients reaching euploid embryo transfer, there was no difference in clinical pregnancy rates, miscarriage rates, or live birth rates between two culture media systems.CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates an increase in aneuploidy in young women whose embryos were cultured in a single-step medium compared to sequential medium. This study highlights the importance of culture conditions on embryo ploidy and the need to stratify by patient age when examining the impact of culture conditions on overall cycle potential. Levonorgestrel IUD: is there a long-lasting effect on return to fertility? Intrauterine devices (IUDs) are effective and safe long-acting reversible contraceptive methods for preventing unplanned pregnancies. While extensive studies were conducted to evaluate return to fertility after removal of IUDs, majority of them were focused on multiparous women using copper IUDs. Current trends indicate increased use of levonorgestrel (LNG) IUDs in nulliparous women for very long periods of time, with both nulliparity and long duration of LNG-IUD use being potentially associated with trends towards longer time to conception post removal. Understanding the effects that LNG-IUDs may have on endometrial morphology and gene expression has important implications to further understanding their mechanism of action. Studies examining endometrial gene expression show persistent changes in receptivity markers up to 1 year after removal of an inert IUD, and no similar studies have been performed after removal of LNG-IUDs. Given the current gap in the literature and trends in LNG-IUD use in nulliparous young women, studies are needed that specifically look at the interaction of nulliparity, long-term use of LNG-IUD, and return to normal fertility. Herein, we review the available literature on the mechanism of action of IUDs with a specific focus on the effect on endometrial gene expression profile changes associated with IUDs.

RESEARCH QUESTION: To investigate the association between anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH) concentration and maternal age with single euploid cryopreserved embryo transfer.DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study from 2014 to 2018 at an academic medical centre, including 389 cycles of IVF with 24-chromosome Day 5/6 preimplantation genetic testing for aneuploidies (PGT-A). Multivariate logistic regression was used to study AMH and age in relation to IVF outcomes (positive beta human chorionic gonadotrophin [bHCG], ongoing pregnancy and pregnancy loss rates) for patients with at least one euploid embryo for transfer, controlling for patient and cycle confounders.RESULTS: In this cohort the overall unadjusted positive bHCG rate was 69.2% and ongoing pregnancy rate was 52.7% per transfer, while the pregnancy loss rate was 23.4% per cycle with positive bHCG. Multivariate analysis found that compared with the reference group of AMH 1 to <5 ng/ml, AMH <1 and 5+ did not have any significant difference in positive bHCG (odds ratio, OR 0.65 [0.30-1.44] and 1.27 [0.61-2.65] for AMH <1 and AMH 5+, respectively) or ongoing pregnancy (OR 0.80 [0.43-1.50] and 1.41 [0.68-2.90]). However, AMH <1 had statistically significant lower euploid miscarriage rates compared with the reference group with OR 0.32 (0.12-0.85, P=0.022); AMH 5+ did not have any statistical difference in miscarriage rate. Neither age at retrieval nor age at transfer were significantly associated with transfer outcomes.CONCLUSIONS: AMH concentration was not associated with positive bHCG or ongoing pregnancy for euploid embryo transfers after adjustment for potential confounders. Maternal age was not associated with euploid transfer outcomes. Further study is warranted in larger cohorts.

Murugappan, G., Li, S., Lathi, R. B., Baker, V. L., Eisenberg, M. L. STUDY QUESTION: Is female infertility associated with higher risk of cancer?SUMMARY ANSWER: Although absolute risks are low, infertility is associated with higher risk of cancer compared to a group of non-infertile women.WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Infertile women are at higher risk of hormone-sensitive cancers. Information on risk of non-gynecologic cancers is rare and conflicting, and the effect of pregnancy on these risk associations is known for only a minority of cancer types.STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: Retrospective cohort analysis between 2003 and 2016 using an insurance claims database.PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: In all, 64 345 infertile women identified by infertility diagnosis, testing or treatment were compared to 3 128 345 non-infertile patients seeking routine gynecologic care. Women with prior diagnosis of cancer or within 6 months of index event were excluded. Main outcomes were development of any malignancy and individual cancers as identified by ICD-9/ICD-10 codes. Results were adjusted for age at index date, index year, nulliparity, race, smoking, obesity, number of visits per year and highest level of education.MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: Infertile women had an overall higher risk of developing cancer compared to non-infertile women (2.0 versus 1.7%, adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) = 1.18; CI: 1.12-1.24). In addition, the risk of uterine cancer (0.10 versus 0.06%, aHR = 1.78; CI: 1.39-2.28), ovarian cancer (0.14 versus 0.09%, aHR 1.64; CI: 1.33-2.01), lung cancer (0.21 versus 0.21%, aHR = 1.38; CI: 1.01-1.88), thyroid cancer (0.21 versus 0.16%, aHR = 1.29; CI: 1.09-1.53), leukemia (0.10 versus 0.06%, aHR = 1.55; CI: 1.21-1.98) and liver and gallbladder cancer (0.05 versus 0.03%, aHR = 1.59; CI: 1.11-2.30) were higher in infertile women compared to non-infertile women. In a subgroup analysis of women in each cohort who became pregnant and had a delivery during enrollment, the risk of uterine and ovarian cancer were similar between infertile and non-infertile women. In a subgroup analysis excluding women with PCOS and endometriosis from both cohorts, the risk of uterine cancer was similar between infertile and non-infertile women.LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: Absolute risk of cancer was low, average follow up for each individual was limited, and average age at index date was limited. Insurance databases have known limitations.WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: Using claims-based data, we report that infertile women may have a higher risk of certain cancers in the years after infertility evaluation; continued follow up should be considered after reproductive goals are achieved.STUDY FUNDING/COMPETING INTEREST(S): None. Increased Risk of Incident Chronic Medical Conditions in Infertile Women: Analysis of Us Claims Data. Murugapppan, G., Li, S., Lathi, R. B., Baker, V. L., Eisenberg, M. L. BACKGROUND: The risk of common chronic medical conditions among infertile women is not known.OBJECTIVE: To study the association between female infertility and risk of incident chronic disease.STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cohort analysis using the Optum de-identified Clinformatics Datamart from 2003-2016. 64,345 infertile women were identified by infertility diagnosis, testing or treatment and compared to 3,128,345 non-infertile patients seeking routine gynecologic care. Women with prior diagnosis of the relevant chronic disease or cancer or with either diagnosis within six months of index event were excluded. Main outcome was diagnosis of incident chronic disease as identified by ICD-9/ICD-10 codes. Results were adjusted for age, index year, nulliparity, race, smoking, obesity, number of visits per year and highest level of education.RESULTS: Infertile patients were more likely to develop diabetes (aHR 1.44, CI 1.38-1.49), renal disease (aHR 1.22, CI 1.12-1.32), liver disease (aHR 1.25, CI 1.20-1.30), cerebrovascular disease (aHR 1.26, CI 1.15-1.38), ischemic heart disease (aHR 1.16, CI 1.09-1.24), other heart disease (aHR 1.16, CI 1.12-1.20), and drug abuse (aHR 1.24, CI 1.15-1.33) compared to non-infertile patients. Infertile patients were significantly less likely to develop alcohol abuse (aHR 0.86, CI 0.79-0.95) compared to non-infertile patients. Risk associations were similar after excluding women with PCOS and POI. In subgroup analyses of women who underwent pregnancy and childbirth during enrollment, several previously noted risk associations were attenuated compared to the overall cohort.CONCLUSION: While the absolute risk of chronic disease is low, infertility is associated with increased risk of incident chronic disease compared to a group of non-infertile women. Antimullerian hormone is a predictor of live birth in patients with recurrent pregnancy loss. Background: Ovarian reserve testing is not routinely performed in the evaluation of recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL). The objective of this study was to determine if AMH levels are predictive of live birth rate in RPL patients pursuing expectant management (EM).Methods: Retrospective cohort study of RPL patients. Patients tried to conceive spontaneously for 12 calendar months or until they achieved a live birth, whichever occurred first. All patients with the intent to conceive were included regardless of final outcome.Results: One hundred fifty-five RPL patients treated from 2009 to 2017 were included. In a univariate logistic regression, AMH<1ng/mL was associated with decreased likelihood of live birth (OR 0.38; CI 0.16-0.87, p=0.03) and increasing age (OR 0.91; CI 0.83-0.99, p=0.04). Likelihood of live birth was not significantly associated with BMI (OR 1.21; CI 0.83-1.77, p=0.31), three or four or more prior pregnancy losses (OR 0.93; CI 0.40-2.22, p=0.87 and OR 0.52; CI 0.19-1.42, p=0.20, respectively) and prior live births (OR 1.00; CI 0.48-2.08, p=0.99). AMH <1ng/mL was shown to be a stronger predictor of live birth than age using a multivariate model adjusting for age, AMH, and time to conception.Conclusions: AMH<1ng/mL is associated with decreased likelihood of live birth among RPL patients pursuing EM, and may be a stronger predictor of live birth than age in this population. Miscarriage chromosome testing: Indications, benefits and methodologies. Rapid advances in genomics have expanded the use of chromosome testing following miscarriage. In addition to conventional cytogenetics, the availability of single nucleotide polymorphism microarray technology and array comparative geneomic hybridization have provided further options for clinicians. This review will cover the indications for testing and the advantages/disadvantages of the various methodologies available. IS ANTIMULLERIAN HORMONE (AMH) PREDICTIVE OF REPRODUCTIVE POTENTIAL IN PATIENTS WITH RECURRENT PREGNANCY LOSS (RPL)? View details for Are blastocyst aneuploidy rates different between fertile and infertile populations? Kort, J. D., McCoy, R. C., Demko, Z., Lathi, R. B. This study aimed to determine if patients with infertility or recurrent pregnancy loss have higher rates of embryo aneuploidy than fertile controls.This was a retrospective review of all pre-implantation genetic screening (PGS) cases processed by a single reference lab prior to March 2014 after a blastocyst biopsy. Cases were excluded if no indication for PGS was designated or patients were translocation carriers. The fertile control group consisted of patients undergoing IVF with PGS for sex selection only. The comparison cohorts included those with recurrent pregnancy loss, male factor infertility, unexplained infertility, prior failed IVF, or previous aneuploid conceptions. A quasi-binomial regression model was used to assess the relationship between the dependent variable, aneuploidy rate and the independent variables, maternal age and reason for PGS. A quasi-Poisson regression model was used to evaluate the relationship between similar independent variables and the number of blastocyst biopsies per case.The initial study population consisted of 3378 IVF-PGS cycles and 18,387 analyzed trophectoderm samples. Controlling for maternal age, we observed an increased rate of aneuploidy among patients with recurrent pregnancy loss (OR 1.330, p<0.001), prior aneuploid pregnancy (OR 1.439, p<0.001), or previous failed IVF cycles (OR 1.356, p=0.0012) compared to fertile controls. Patients with unexplained and male factor infertility did not have a significantly different aneuploidy rate than controls (p>0.05). The increase in aneuploidy in patients with RPL and prior IVF failure was driven by both an increase in meiotic (OR 1.488 and 1.508, p<0.05) and mitotic errors (1.269 and 1.393, p<0.05) relative to fertile controls, while patients with prior aneuploid pregnancies had only an increased risk of meiotic error aneuploidies (OR 1.650, p<0.05).Patients with recurrent pregnancy loss, previous IVF failures, and prior aneuploid pregnancies have a significantly higher, age-independent, aneuploidy rate compared to patients without infertility.

Crochet, P., Lathi, R. B., Dahan, M. H., Ocampo, J., Nutis, M., Nezhat, C. R. The aim of this study was to examine the surgical findings at repeated surgeries for endometriosis and to compare disease progression in patients after IVF to those without interval fertility treatments.A retrospective case-control study set at the referral center for gynecologic endoscopy at Stanford University. Women who had two surgeries for treatment of symptomatic endometriosis since 1997 were searched in the database. Twenty-one women were identified who underwent IVF treatment between the two procedures (IVF group), and compared to 36 women who did not receive any fertility treatment (controls). The main outcomes were time to recurrence and surgical findings including rASRM score. The presence and size of endometrioma, rectovaginal and para-rectal spaces location of endometriosis were also compared between the two surgical procedures.Demographics in the two groups were similar. The change in rASRM score between surgeries was not significantly different (P=0.80) between the two groups. There was no difference between the two groups in the size and number of pathology proven endometriomas as well as no difference in the presence of rectovaginal and pararectal endometriosis.No significant difference was found in the two groups, suggesting that IVF treatment does not lead to an accelerated progression of endometriosis in patients with recurrence. Environmental exposure to endocrine-disrupting chemicals and miscarriage. Establishment of early pregnancy is the result of complex biochemical interactions between the decidua and blastocyst. Any alteration in this chemical dialogue has the potential to result in adverse pregnancy outcomes including miscarriage. Sporadic miscarriage is the most common complication of pregnancy and can be caused by multiple factors. While the most common cause of miscarriage is genetic abnormalities in the fetus, other contributing factors certainly can play a role in early loss. One such factor is environmental exposure, in particular to endocrine-disrupting chemicals, which has the potential to interfere with endogenous hormone action. These effects can be deleterious, especially in early pregnancy when the hormonal milieu surrounding implantation is in delicate balance. The purpose of this paper is to review the current evidence on the role of environmental toxins in reproduction.

L., Westphal, L. M., Milki, A. A. To study pregnancy outcomes between South Asian and Caucasian women undergoing frozen blastocyst transfer cycles.Retrospective cohort study.Not applicable.Caucasian and South Asian patients undergoing frozen blastocyst transfer between January 2011 and December2014.Not applicable.Live birth rate.A total of 196 Caucasian and 117 South Asian women were included in our study. Indians were on average 2.2years younger than Caucasian women (34.9 vs. 37.1years), and were more likely to be nulliparous (59% vs. 43%). All other baseline characteristics were similar. In women undergoing their first frozen ET cycle, implantation rate (49% vs. 47%), clinical pregnancy rate (PR; 54% vs. 49%), and live birth rate (43% vs. 43%) were similar between South Asians and Caucasians, respectively. In patients who underwent a prior fresh blastocyst transfer, the live birth rate was significantly lower in South Asian versus Caucasian women (21% vs. 37%).Our data demonstrate that IVF outcomes are better in frozen versus fresh cycles among South Asian women. The IVF clinics may wish to consider these findings when counseling South Asian patients about the timing of ET.

A., Jungheim, E. S. The purpose of this research was to study whether methotrexate (MTX) as treatment for ectopic pregnancy (EP) impacts the future fertility of women undergoing assisted reproductive technology (ART) METHODS: In a systematic review and multi-center retrospective cohort from four academic and private fertility centers, 214 women underwent an ART cycle before and after receiving MTX as treatment for an EP. Measures of ovarian reserve and responsiveness and rates of clinical pregnancy (CP) and live birth (LB) were compared in the ART cycles prior and subsequent to MTX.Seven studies were identified in the systematic review, and primary data from four institutions was included in the final analysis. Women were significantly older in post-MTX cycles (35.3 vs 34.7years). There were no differences in follicle stimulating hormone, antral follicle count, duration of stimulation, oocytes retrieved, or fertilization rate between pre- and post-MTX cycles. However, post-MTX cycles received a significantly higher total dose of gonadotropins (4206 vs 3961IU). Overall, 42% of women achieved a CP and 35% achieved a LB in the post-MTX ART cycle, which is similar to national statistics. Although no factors were identified that were predictive of LB in young women, the number of oocytes retrieved in the previous ART cycle and current AFC were predictive of LB (AUC 0.76, 0.75) for the older women.MTX does not influence ovarian reserve, response to gonadotropin stimulation, and CP or LB rate after ART. MTX remains a safe and effective treatment option for women with asymptomatic EPs. Patient Experience with Karyotyping After First Trimester Miscarriage: A National Survey. McNally, L., Huynh, D., Keller, J., Dikan, J., Rabinowitz, M., Lathi, R. B. To assess the frequency of chromosome testing after first trimester miscarriage as well as to investigate patient experiences.An anonymous online questionnaire was developed and made available. Inclusion criteria were female, age 18, first trimester miscarriage, occurrence of miscarriage within the past year, miscarriage care provided in the United States, and survey completion.Of the 980 women who started the survey, 448 met inclusion criteria. Of those, 37 participants had chromosome testing on the miscarriage specimen. Of those who did not have testing, 66% said they wished they had done so at the time of miscarriage, and 67% said they would still want testing if it were available today. There was no correlation between patient age and chromosome testing. Chromosome testing increased in frequency with higher number of miscarriages, although the low number of women with chromosome testing limits our ability to draw definitive conclusions. On average, providers needed to spend 15-20 minutes with patients for them to feel like it was ""enough time.""In this national survey we found that chromosome testing is performed in approximately 8% of first trimester miscarriages. Our data indicate that the majority of patients experiencing first trimester miscarriage desire chromosome testing. Increased body mass index negatively impacts blastocyst formation rate in normal responders undergoing in vitro fertilization The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of female BMI and metabolic dysfunction on blastocyst formation rate.This was a retrospective cohort study that was performed in an academic center for reproductive medicine. Patients who were normal weight, overweight with metabolic dysfunction, or obese who had 6 oocytes retrieved in a fresh IVF cycle were included in the study. The blastocyst formation rate was calculated from the number of 5 cell embryos on day 3 observed in culture until day 5 or day 6. Only good quality blastocysts were included in the calculation as defined by a morphologic grade of 3BB or better.The blastocyst formation rate was significantly better in the normal-weight controls versus overweight/obese patients (57.2 versus 43.6%, p<0.007). There was no difference in blastocyst formation between the patients with a BMI 25-29.9kg/m(2) with metabolic dysfunction and those with a BMI 30kg/m(2).The maternal metabolic environment has a significant impact on embryo quality as measured by blastocyst formation. A decreased blastocyst formation rate is likely a significant contributor to poorer reproductive outcomes in overweight and obese women with infertility. View details for Frozen blastocyst embryo transfer using a supplemented natural cycle protocol has a similar live birth rate compared to a programmed cycle protocol Lathi, R. B., Chi, Y., Liu, J., Saravanabavanandhan, B., Hegde, A., Baker, V. L. The purpose of this study is to compare outcomes for a supplemented natural cycle with a programmed cycle protocol for frozen blastocyst transfer.A retrospective analysis was performed of frozen autologous blastocyst transfers, at a single academic fertility center (519 supplemented natural cycles and 106 programmed cycles). Implantation, clinical pregnancy, miscarriage, and live birth and birth weight were compared using Pearson's Chi-squared test, T-test, or Fisher's exact test.There was no significant difference between natural and programmed frozen embryo transfers with respect to implantation (21.9 vs. 18.1%), clinical pregnancy (35.5 vs. 29.2%), and live birth rates (27.7 vs. 23.6%). Mean birth weights were also similar between natural and programmed cycles for singletons (3354 vs. 3340g) and twins (2422 vs. 2294g)Frozen blastocyst embryo transfers using supplemented natural or programmed protocols experience similar success rates. Patient preference should be considered in choosing a protocol. View details for Aneuploidy rates and blastocyst formation after biopsy of morulae and early blastocysts on day 5. Kort, J. D., Lathi, R. B., Brookfield, K., Baker, V. L., Zhao, Q., Behr, B. R. Studies have demonstrated high implantation rates after trophectoderm biopsy of day 5 expanded blastocysts. However, biopsy of cleavage stage embryos may adversely affect embryo development and implantation. No studies have assessed the utility of day 5 morulae and early blastocyst biopsy. This study sought to better understandthese slower embryos' aneuploidy rates and implantation potential.This was a retrospective review of all autologous IVF cycles utilizing PGS at a single academic infertility center.The biopsy of day 5 morulae and early blastocysts provided 22% additional euploid blastocysts available for fresh day 6 transfer compared to day 5 biopsy of only expanded blastocysts. Aneuploidy did correlate with embryo stage on day 5, even after controlling for maternal age, with 16% of morulae and 35% of blastocysts being euploid. The majority (83%) of euploid morulae progressed to the blastocyst stage by day 6. Experience transferring slower developing embryos is limited, but preliminary pregnancy and implantation rates appear similar to euploid embryos biopsied as expanded blastocysts.The biopsy of all non-arrested embryos on day 5 provides genetic information for all blastocysts on day 6, increasing the pool of euploid blastocysts available for fresh transfer and avoiding the need to cryopreserve developmentally competent embryos without genetic information. Expression of interleukin-22 in decidua of patients with early pregnancy and unexplained recurrent pregnancy loss. Perfetto, C. O., Fan, X., Dahl, S., Krieg, S., Westphal, L. M., Lathi, R. B., Nayak, N. R. Researchers have hypothesized that an imbalance of immune cells in the uterine decidua and a dysfunction in cytokines they produce may contribute to recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL). The objective of this study was to determine if IL-22, IL-23 and IL-17 are expressed abnormally in the decidua of patients with RPL compared to those women with a normal pregnancy. We also sought to confirm that uterine natural killer (uNK) cells are lower in the decidua of patients with RPL, as well as identify IL-22 expression by uNK cells.After meeting strict inclusion criteria, maternal decidua of nine patients with unexplained RPL and a confirmed euploid fetal loss, and 11 gestational age-matched patients undergoing elective pregnancy termination were included in our analysis. Quantitative real time-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was performed to quantify RNA expression, Western blot was performed to quantify protein expression and immunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed to identify IL-22 and uNK cells.We found that women with unexplained RPL and a euploid fetal loss had significantly less gene and protein expression of IL-22 in the decidua. Additionally, we found that IL-22 is primarily expressed by uNK cells in the decidua.In conclusion, our results suggest that lower levels of IL-22 in the uterine decidua in patients with unexplained RPL may contribute to a disruption of decidual homeostasis and ultimately lead to early pregnancy loss.

Cost-effectiveness analysis of preimplantation genetic screening and in vitro fertilization versus expectant management in patients with unexplained recurrent pregnancy loss To determine whether invitro fertilization with preimplantation genetic screening (IVF/PGS) is cost effective compared with expectant management in achieving live birth for patients with unexplained recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL).Decision analytic model comparing costs and clinical outcomes.Academic recurrent pregnancy loss programs.Women with unexplained RPL.IVF/PGS with 24-chromosome screening and expectant management.Cost per live birth.The IVF/PGS strategy had a live-birth rate of 53% and a clinical miscarriage rate of 7%. Expectant management had a live-birth rate of 67% and clinical miscarriage rate of 24%. The IVF/PGS strategy was 100-fold more expensive, costing $45,300 per live birth compared with $418 per live birth with expectant management.In this model, IVF/PGS was not a cost-effective strategy for increasing live birth. Furthermore, the live-birth rate with IVF/PGS needs to be 91% to be cost effective compared with expectant management.

LBR for patients reaching ET was 52%. Clinical miscarriage rate was 10%. Despite a mean age of 33.8 years and mean of 7 embryos biopsied, there was a 30% chance for no chromosomally normal embryos. Maternal age >35 years, day 3 biopsy, and having fewer than five embryos available for biopsy increased the risk of no ET.IVF-PGD for translocation and aneuploidy screening had good clinical outcomes. Patients carrying a balanced translocation who are considering IVF-PGD should be aware of the high risk of no ET, particularly in women 35 years old.

Approximately half of patients with RPL will have no explanation for their miscarriages. De novo chromosome abnormalities are common in sporadic and recurrent pregnancy loss. Testing for embryonic abnormalities can provide an explanation for the miscarriage in many cases and prognostic information. Regardless of the cause of RPL, patients should be reassured that the prognosis for live birth with an evidence-based approach is excellent for most patients. The authors review current evidence for the evaluation and treatment of RPL and explore the proposed use of newer technology for patients with RPL. View details for Time to next pregnancy in spontaneous pregnancies versus treatment cycles in fertile patients with recurrent pregnancy loss. BACKGROUND: The current standard of care for management of patients with recurrent pregnancy loss is expectant management. However, the emotional impact of pregnancy losses and the urgency to conceive often leads couples to consider a variety of fertility treatments. The objective of this study is to report the time to next pregnancy and subsequent live birth and miscarriage rates in fertile patients with recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL) who choose to attempt spontaneous conception compared to those that opt to pursue fertility treatment.METHODS: Retrospective cohort study of one hundred and fifty-eight fertile RPL patients treated at a university-based fertility center. Patients were followed for a minimum of 6months. Patients were encouraged to attempt spontaneous conception, but allowed to initiate fertility treatments (ovarian stimulation, insemination, IVF or PGS) according to their preferences. Main outcome measures were time to next pregnancy and pregnancy outcome.RESULTS: For those patients who achieved a spontaneous conception, 88% conceived within 6months, with a median time of 2months and range of 1-10 months. Patients using IUI, IVF and PGS conceived in a median of 3, 4 and 5months, respectively. The live birth rate and clinical miscarriage rate was not improved with any fertility treatment.CONCLUSIONS: In the fertile RPL patient population, there does not appear to be a benefit to proceeding directly with fertility treatment. Patients should be encouraged to attempt spontaneous conception for at least 6months.

However, maternal cell contamination can limit the accuracy. This video demonstrates a technique for separating miscarriage tissue from maternal decidua after MVA to reduce maternal cell contamination prior to sending tissue for analysis. The same technique has been used in our clinic with first-trimester dilation and curettage using mechanical suction.

Journal of obstetrics and gynaecology Canada : JOGC = Journal d'obsttrique et gyncologie du Canada : JOGC Lathi, R. B., Dahan, M. H., Reynolds-May, M. F., Milki, A. A., Behr, B., Westphal, L. M. Hyperandrogenic conditions in women are associated with increased rates of miscarriage. However, the specific role of maternal testosterone in early pregnancy and its association with pregnancy outcome is unknown. The purpose of this study was to compare serum testosterone levels during early pregnancy in women with and without polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) who either had successful pregnancies or miscarried.We collected serum samples from women attending a university-based fertility centre at the time of their first positive serum beta human chorionic gonadotropin pregnancy test. The samples were subsequently assayed for total testosterone level. We used logistical regression modelling to control for PCOS diagnosis, BMI, and age.Total testosterone levels were available for 346 pregnancies, including 286 successful pregnancies and 78 first trimester miscarriages. We found no difference in total testosterone levels between women who subsequently had an ongoing pregnancy (mean concentration 3.6 2.6 nmol/L) and women with a miscarriage (mean 3.6 2.4 nmol/L). Using the Rotterdam criteria to identify women with PCOS, we also found no differences in serum testosterone between women who had ongoing pregnancies or miscarriages, either with PCOS (P = 0.176) or without PCOS (P = 0.561).Our findings show that early pregnancy testosterone levels do not predict pregnancy outcome, and they call into question the role of testosterone in causing miscarriage in populations of women with PCOS. Further research is needed to elucidate the normal progression of testosterone levels during pregnancy and to investigate further the relationship between PCOS and miscarriage. Genomic Imbalance in Products of Conception Single-Nucleotide Polymorphism Chromosomal Microarray Analysis Levy, B., Sigurjonsson, S., Pettersen, B., Maisenbacher, M. K., Hall, M. P., Demko, Z., Lathi, R. B., Tao, R., Aggarwal, V., Rabinowitz, M. To report the full cohort of identifiable anomalies, regardless of known clinical significance, in a large-scale cohort of postmiscarriage products-of-conception samples analyzed using a high-resolution single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-based microarray platform. High-resolution chromosomal microarray analysis allows for the identification of visible and submicroscopic cytogenomic imbalances; the specific use of SNPs permits detection of maternal cell contamination, triploidy, and uniparental disomy.Miscarriage specimens were sent to a single laboratory for cytogenomic analysis. Chromosomal microarray analysis was performed using a SNP-based genotyping microarray platform. Results were evaluated at the cytogenetic and microscopic (greater than 10 Mb) and submicroscopic (less than 10 Mb) levels. Maternal cell contamination was assessed using information derived from fetal and maternal SNPs.Results were obtained on 2,389 of 2,392 specimens (99.9%) that were less than 20 weeks of gestation. Maternal cell contamination was identified in 528 (22.0%) specimens. The remaining 1,861 specimens were considered to be of true fetal origin. Of these, 1,106 (59.4%) showed classical cytogenetic abnormalities: aneuploidy accounted for 945 (85.4%), triploidy for 114 (10.3%), and structural anomalies or tetraploidy for the remaining 47 (4.2%). Of the 755 (40.6%) cases considered normal at the cytogenetic level, SNP chromosomal microarray analysis revealed a clinically significant copy number change or whole-genome uniparental disomy in 12 (1.6%) and three (0.4%) cases, respectively.Chromosomal microarray analysis of products-of-conception specimens yields a high diagnostic return. Using SNPs extends the scope of detectable genomic abnormalities and facilitates reporting ""true"" fetal results. This supports the use of SNP chromosomal microarray analysis for cytogenomic evaluation of miscarriage specimens when clinically indicated.III. View details for Twice-daily dosing of gonadotropins does not improve embryo quality during in vitro fertilization cycles in women with polycystic ovary syndrome, when compared to once-daily dosing: a pilot study To determine whether overexpression of the FSH receptor in polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) results in a relative deficiency of gonadotropins and poor oocyte and embryo quality during in vitro fertilization (IVF) cycles. Whether twice-daily dosing of gonadotropins could therefore result in improved embryo quality, by fixing this hypothesized relative deficiency of gonadotropins.Embryos generated at a university-based fertility center in women with PCOS were compared from twice-daily dosing to once-daily dosing of gonadotropins during IVF cycles. Oocyte and embryo quality was compared. A single patient's embryos were included in the analysis from only one IVF cycle and all embryos from that cycle were included. 254 embryos were compared.Twice-daily vs. once-daily dosing of gonadotropins does not improve embryo or oocyte quality in women with PCOS.The defect in response to gonadotropins in PCOS is most likely due to an inherent defect in the ovary and not a relative deficiency of gonadotropins due to overexpression of the FSH receptors. More studies are needed to confirm this finding.

View details for View details for Embryo selection with preimplantation chromosomal screening in patients with recurrent pregnancy loss. Recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL) is a multifactorial disorder which is often challenging for both patients and providers. Guidelines for the evaluation and treatment of patients with RPL include screening for uterine abnormalities, parental chromosomes, and antiphospholipid antibodies, but approximately half of RPL patients remain unexplained. The current recommendation for patients with unexplained RPL is expectant management which offers most patients a 60 to 80% success rate over time. Genetic imbalances in the embryo, including inherited unbalanced translocations and de novo aneuploidy, are frequent causes of miscarriage. Preimplantation genetic screening (PGS) has been proposed as an effective method for selecting viable embryos for transfer that may result lower risk of miscarriage for patients with unexplained RPL and carriers of balanced translocations. The current evidence examining the use of in vitro fertilization with PGS in patients with RPL reveals variable results, due to differences in technologies used and variable patient populations. Newer approaches, which include blastocyst biopsy and the ability to screen for all 24 chromosomes, show the most promise in reducing miscarriage rates. Studies that identify which patients are most likely to benefit from PGS and include live birth rates per initiated cycles are needed before universally recommending this treatment to couples with RPL.

In 269 of the 46,XX specimens, MCC with no embryonic component was found. With the exclusion of maternal 46,XX results, the chromosomal abnormality rate increased from 48% to 62%, and the ratio for XX to XY results dropped from 2.6 to 1.0.Over half of the normal 46,XX results in miscarriage specimens were due to MCC. The use of SNPs in MCC testing allows for precise identification of chromosomal abnormalities in miscarriage as well as MCC, improving the accuracy of products of conception testing.

A male factor contributes to 50% of cases but it is unclear what proportion of infertile couples undergoes male evaluation.We analyzed data from cycles 5 to 7 of the National Survey of Family Growth performed by the Centers for Disease Control to determine the frequency of a male infertility evaluation, and associated reproductive and demographic factors.A total of 25,846 women and 11,067 men were surveyed. Male evaluation was not completed in 18% of couples when the male partner was asked vs 27% when female partners were asked. This corresponds to approximately 370,000 to 860,000 men in the population who were not evaluated at the time of infertility evaluation. Longer infertility duration and white race were associated with increased odds of male infertility evaluation. The male and female samples showed no change in the receipt of male examination with time.Many men from infertile couples do not undergo male evaluation in the United States. Given the potential implications to reproductive goals and male health, further examination of this pattern is warranted.

B., Massie, J. A., Gilani, M., Milki, A. A., Westphal, L. M., Baker, V. L., Behr, B. Preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) is an increasingly common adjunct to IVF. The information gained from PGD may be used to reduce the incidence of chromosomally abnormal pregnancies and augment the current selection process of embryos. As such, patients may choose to utilize PGD in either fresh or cryopreserved IVF cycles. It is a common practice to cryopreserve excess embryos at the blastocyst stage. In these cases, trophectoderm biopsy is the only technique available for PGD. This articles reports this study centre's experience with trophectoderm biopsies of cryopreserved blastocysts in 12 patients who underwent 13 cycles of PGD. The implantation rate per embryo transferred was 46% and the ongoing pregnancy rate per embryo transfer was 63%. The results from this case series demonstrate that trophectoderm biopsy on cryopreserved blastocysts to perform PGD is logistically feasible. In addition, the rate of implantation and ongoing pregnancy were maintained within a reasonable range to justify the procedure. Preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) is an increasingly common adjunct to IVF and is used to evaluate the genetic makeup of the embryo prior to transfer of the embryo into the uterus. The information gained from PGD may be used to identify single-gene disorders that result in genetic disease, reduce the incidence of chromosomally abnormal pregnancies and/or augment the selection process of embryos to be transferred. In order to perform PGD, a biopsy of the embryo is the performed and cells are removed for testing. PGD may be performed in either fresh or frozen (cryopreserved) IVF cycles. Patients who have cryopreserved embryos remaining in storage from a previous fresh cycle may wish to have these embryos tested with PGD. Many embryos are frozen on day 5 of development, referred to as the blastocyst stage. At this stage of development, embryo biopsy is performed via a technique known as 'trophectoderm biopsy', in which 1-3 of the cells destined to become the placenta are removed from the embryo for chromosomal testing. We report our experience with trophectoderm biopsy of frozen blastocysts in 12 patients who underwent 13 cycles of PGD. The implantation rate per embryo transferred was 46% and the ongoing pregnancy rate per embryo transfer was 63%. The results from this case series demonstrate that trophectoderm biopsy on cryopreserved blastocysts to perform PGD is logistically feasible. In addition, the rate of implantation and ongoing pregnancy were maintained within a reasonable range to justify the procedure. View details for Global alteration in gene expression profiles of deciduas from women with idiopathic recurrent pregnancy loss Krieg, S. A., Fan, X., Hong, Y., Sang, Q., Giaccia, A., Westphal, L. M., Lathi, R. B., Krieg, A. J., Nayak, N. R. Recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL) occurs in 5% of women. However, the etiology is still poorly understood. Defects in decidualization of the endometrium during early pregnancy contribute to several pregnancy complications, such as pre-eclampsia and intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR), and are believed to be important in the pathogenesis of idiopathic RPL. We performed microarray analysis to identify gene expression alterations in the deciduas of idiopathic RPL patients. Control patients had one antecedent term delivery, but were undergoing dilation and curettage for current aneuploid miscarriage. Gene expression differences were evaluated using both pathway and gene ontology (GO) analysis. Selected genes were validated using quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). A total of 155 genes were found to be significantly dysregulated in the deciduas of RPL patients (>2-fold change, P < 0.05), with 22 genes up-regulated and 133 genes down-regulated. GO analysis linked a large percentage of genes to discrete biological functions, including immune response (23%), cell signaling (18%) and cell invasion (17.1%), and pathway analysis revealed consistent changes in both the interleukin 1 (IL-1) and IL-8 pathways. All genes in the IL-8 pathway were up-regulated while genes in the IL-1 pathway were down-regulated. Although both pathways can promote inflammation, IL-1 pathway activity is important for normal implantation. Additionally, genes known to be critical for degradation of the extracellular matrix, including matrix metalloproteinase 26 and serine peptidase inhibitor Kazal-type 1, were also highly up-regulated. In this first microarray approach to decidual gene expression in RPL patients, our data suggest that dysregulation of genes associated with cell invasion and immunity may contribute significantly to idiopathic recurrent miscarriage.

P., Johnson, D., Sigurjonsson, S., Gemelos, G., Rabinowitz, M. The metaphase karyotype is often used as a diagnostic tool in the setting of early miscarriage; however this technique has several limitations. We evaluate a new technique for karyotyping that uses single nucleotide polymorphism microarrays (SNP). This technique was compared in a blinded, prospective fashion, to the traditional metaphase karyotype.Patients undergoing dilation and curettage for first trimester miscarriage between February and August 2010 were enrolled. Samples of chorionic villi were equally divided and sent for microarray testing in parallel with routine cytogenetic testing.Thirty samples were analyzed, with only four discordant results. Discordant results occurred when the entire genome was duplicated or when a balanced rearrangement was present. Cytogenetic karyotyping took an average of 29 days while microarray-based karytoyping took an average of 12 days.Molecular karyotyping of POC after missed abortion using SNP microarray analysis allows for the ability to detect maternal cell contamination and provides rapid results with good concordance to standard cytogenetic analysis.

To examine early pregnancy (EP) testosterone (T) after ovarian stimulation and its effect on singleton pregnancy outcomes.Prospective cohort study.University-based tertiary care center.Subfertile women who conceived with or without fertility treatment.Ovarian stimulation for assisted reproduction, collection of serum total T levels in early pregnancy, and pregnancy follow-up.Rate of preterm delivery, low birth weight (LBW) (<2,500 g), and hypertensive disorders of pregnancy.EP serum samples were measured from 266 singleton pregnancies. The mean T level among spontaneous conceptions was 74.90 ng/dL (SD48.35 ng/dL); 103 ng/mL was the 90th percentile. Mean EP T was increased among patients who underwent ovarian stimulation compared with nonstimulated control subjects. In patients undergoing IVF, T levels in EP were linearly correlated with the number of oocytes retrieved. When pregnancy outcomes in women with normal T were compared with women with elevated T (>90th percentile), we did not see an increased risk for preterm delivery, hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, LBW infants, or cesarean delivery (odds ratio ratios 1.43, 0.38, 1.39, and 0.85, respectively).Elevations in EP T are associated with ovarian stimulation but do not appear to be associated with adverse pregnancy outcome. Further investigation to determine the etiology of increased maternal and neonatal morbidity among subfertile women is warranted.

Journal of obstetrics and gynaecology Canada : JOGC = Journal d'obsttrique et gyncologie du Canada : JOGC Lemyre, M., Bujold, E., Lathi, R., Bhagan, L., Huang, J. Q., Nezhat, C. To compare short-term morbidity and quality of life after laparoscopic hysterectomy (LH) and laparoscopic myomectomy (LM) for the treatment of symptomatic uterine leiomyomas.We performed a prospective, observational study of women who were eligible for both surgical procedures. After informed consent was obtained, each participant was asked to complete the SF-12v2 Health Survey before surgery and to repeat it seven days and 28 days after surgery. Data on short-term morbidities, such as operative time, blood loss, length of hospital stay, and surgical complications, were collected by an obstetrician-gynaecologist. Women who underwent LH were compared by non-parametric statistical analyses with those who underwent LM.Sixty-one women were recruited between January 1 and December 31, 2008, including 40 who underwent LM and 21 LH. Women who underwent LH were older, had higher parity, and were less likely to have infertility than those who chose LM. Median LH operative time of 223 minutes (IQR 214 to 241) was slightly longer than for LM (188 minutes, IQR 154 to 239; P = 0.02). However, we found no difference between the two groups in terms of SF-12v2 fluctuation, blood loss, hospital stay, and short-term complications.Laparoscopic myomectomy is a viable alternative to laparoscopic hysterectomy for women with symptomatic leiomyomas who want conservative surgery. The procedures have similar morbidity and impact on quality of life. Lathi, R. B., Hazard, F. K., Heerema-McKenney, A., Taylor, J., Chueh, J. T. Miscarriage is a relatively common occurrence for otherwise healthy women. Despite its frequency, evaluation for cause is rare. The most common cause of miscarriage is sporadic chromosome errors. Chromosomal analysis of the miscarriage offers an explanation in at least 50% of cases. Conventional cytogenetic evaluation can only be done on fresh tissue, so it is critical that the treating physician consider genetic testing at the time of the miscarriage. Ultrasound can estimate the gestational age at the time of miscarriage and identify major abnormalities in some embryos. A careful pathological examination can add to the evaluation by ruling out rare disorders with the highest recurrence risk. A multidisciplinary approach to miscarriage evaluation is essential to understanding the cause and risk of recurrence. A thorough evaluation of a miscarriage, in combination with emotional support, can often provide the necessary reassurance and confidence as the patient prepares for her next pregnancy.

To investigate the relationship between air bubble position after blastocyst transfer (BT) and pregnancy rates (PRs).Retrospective cohort study.University-based infertility center.Three hundred fifteen consecutive nondonor BTs by a single provider.Catheters were loaded with 25 L of culture media, 20 L of air, 25 L of media containing the blastocysts, 20 L of air, and a small amount of additional media. The distance from the air bubble to the fundus, as seen on abdominal ultrasound examination, was measured at the time of transfer. Air bubble location was categorized as <10 mm, 10-20 mm, and >20 mm from the fundus.Clinical pregnancy rate.After controlling for age, parity, FSH and frozen transfers, and accounting for repeated cycles per patient, the PRs for both the >20-mm (38.3%) and the 10-20-mm (42.0%) from the fundus group were significantly reduced compared with the group in which the bubble was <10 mm from the fundus (62.5%).This study is the first to suggest that BT closer to the fundus is associated with higher PR. Although no ectopic pregnancies occurred in the <10-mm group, this outcome should be monitored closely in larger studies.

The rate of aneuploidy was 63% in the study group and 70% in the control group. This difference was not statistically significant.The incidence of embryonic aneuploidy was not higher in pregnancies conceived with FSH stimulation compared with spontaneous conceptions in infertility patients. This suggests that exogenous FSH exposure does not increase the risk of aneuploidy. View details for View details for Age-Related Success with Elective Single versus Double Blastocyst Transfer. Friedman, B. E., Davis, L. B., Lathi, R. B., Westphal, L. M., Baker, V. L., Milki, A. A. Background. Although the optimal outcome of assisted reproductive technology (ART) is a healthy singleton pregnancy, the rate of twin gestation from ART in women over the age of 35 is persistently high. Methods/Findings. We compared clinical pregnancy rates (PRs), ongoing pregnancy/live birth rates, and multiple gestation rates (MGRs) in 108 women who chose elective single blastocyst transfer (eSBT) to 415 women who chose elective double blastocyst transfer (eDBT) at a hospital-based IVF center. There was no significant difference in PR between eSBT and eDBT (57.4% versus 50.2%, P = 0.47) nor between eSBT and eDBT within each age group: <35, 35-37, 38-40, and >40. The risk of multiple gestations, however, was greatly increased between eSBT and eDBT (1.6 versus 32.4%, P < 0.00005), and this difference did not vary across age groups. Conclusion(s). Women undergoing eDBT are at uniformly high risk of multiple gestation regardless of age. eSBT appears to significantly lower the risk of multiple gestation without compromising PR.

Compared with the control group, the patients with infertility had significantly lower scores in the desire and arousal domains and lower frequency of intercourse and masturbation. The patients with infertility retrospectively reported a sex-life satisfaction score that was similar to that of the controls before their diagnosis, whereas their current sex-life satisfaction scores were significantly lower than those of the controls.Women with a diagnosis of infertility were found to be at higher risk for sexual dysfunction on the basis of their Female Sexual Function Index scores compared with women without infertility. The interaction of sexual function and infertility is complex and deserves further study.

Aneuploidy in the POC in women with RPL was compared with sporadic miscarriages (or=35 years.Among 43 RPL patients, there were 50 miscarriages in which cytogenetic analysis was performed. In the RPL group, the incidence of chromosomal abnormalities in the POC was 78% (39 out of 50) compared with a 70% incidence (98 out of 140) in the sporadic losses. Thrombophilia results in the RPL patients were normal in 38 patients, four patients had APA syndrome, and one had protein C deficiency. Forty out of 43 had normal uterine cavities. Both TSH and parental karyotypes were normal in all of the patients tested. When the evaluation of RPL included karyotype of the POC, only 18% remained without explanation. However, without fetal cytogenetics, 80% of miscarriages would have been unexplained.In older patients with RPL, fetal chromosomal abnormalities are responsible for the majority of miscarriages. Other causes were present in only 20% of cases.

K., Jun, S. H., O'leary, K., Lathi, R. B., Westphal, L. M., Wong, W. H., Yao, M. W. Nearly 75% of in vitro fertilization (IVF) treatments do not result in live births and patients are largely guided by a generalized age-based prognostic stratification. We sought to provide personalized and validated prognosis by using available clinical and embryo data from prior, failed treatments to predict live birth probabilities in the subsequent treatment. We generated a boosted tree model, IVFBT, by training it with IVF outcomes data from 1,676 first cycles (C1s) from 2003-2006, followed by external validation with 634 cycles from 2007-2008, respectively. We tested whether this model could predict the probability of having a live birth in the subsequent treatment (C2). By using nondeterministic methods to identify prognostic factors and their relative nonredundant contribution, we generated a prediction model, IVF(BT), that was superior to the age-based control by providing over 1,000-fold improvement to fit new data (p<0.05), and increased discrimination by receiver-operative characteristic analysis (area-under-the-curve, 0.80 vs. 0.68 for C1, 0.68 vs. 0.58 for C2). IVFBT provided predictions that were more accurate for approximately 83% of C1 and approximately 60% of C2 cycles that were out of the range predicted by age. Over half of those patients were reclassified to have higher live birth probabilities. We showed that data from a prior cycle could be used effectively to provide personalized and validated live birth probabilities in a subsequent cycle. Our approach may be replicated and further validated in other IVF clinics. Coexistence of endometriosis in women with symptomatic leiomyomas Huang, J. Q., Lathi, R. B., Lemyre, M., Rodriguez, H.

To investigate the coexistence of endometriosis in women presenting with symptomatic leiomyomas.Retrospective study.Tertiary university medical center.We reviewed the medical records of 131 patients who underwent laparoscopic myomectomy or hysterectomy. All patients were consented for possible concomitant diagnosis and treatment of endometriosis.All patients underwent laparoscopic myomectomy or hysterectomy.The main outcome measure of the study was the presence or absence of endometriosis.Of the 131 patients, 113 were diagnosed with endometriosis and fibroids, while 18 were diagnosed with fibroids alone. Patients with fibroids were on average 4.0 years older than those with endometriosis and fibroids (41 vs. 45). Patients with both diagnoses were also more likely to present with pelvic pain and nulliparity than those with fibroids alone.An overwhelming majority of patients with symptomatic fibroids were also diagnosed with endometriosis. Overlooking the concomitant diagnosis of endometriosis in these women may lead to suboptimal treatment of the patients. Further studies are needed to evaluate the impact of surgical treatments on symptom resolution. View details for View details for Karyotype of miscarriages in relation to maternal weight Obesity has been identified as a risk factor for spontaneous miscarriage although the mechanism is unclear. The purpose of this study is to better understand the effect of obesity on early pregnancy success by examining the cytogenetic results of miscarriages in women with normal and elevated body mass index (BMI).We conducted a retrospective case-control study in an academic infertility practice. Medical records of women ages <40 years with first trimester missed abortion (n = 204), who underwent dilatation and curettage between 1999 and 2008, were reviewed for demographics, BMI, diagnosis of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and karyotype analysis. chi(2) and Student's t-test analysis were used for statistical analysis, with P < 0.05 considered significant.A total of 204 miscarriages were included, from women with a mean age of 34.5 years. The overall rate of aneuploidy was 59%. Women with BMI > or = 25 kg/m(2) had a significant increase in euploid miscarriages compared with women with lower BMI (P = 0.04), despite a similar mean age (34.4 years for both).We found a significant increase in normal embryonic karyotypes in the miscarriages of overweight and obese women (BMI > or = 25). These results suggest that the excess risk of miscarriages in the overweight and obese population is independent of embryonic aneuploidy. Further studies are needed to assess the impact of lifestyle modification, insulin resistance and PCOS on pregnancy outcomes in the overweight and obese population.

To estimate the effect of ethnicity on in vitro fertilization (IVF) outcomes after blastocyst transfer.We conducted a review of fresh blastocyst transfer IVF cycles from January 1, 2005, to December 31, 2006. Data collection included demographic information, infertility history, treatment protocol details, and treatment outcomes. Statistics were performed using the Student t test and chi2 test. To establish the independent contribution of Asian ethnicity, a multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed.We reviewed 180 blastocyst transfer cycles among white (62%) and Asian (38%) women. The groups were similar in most baseline characteristics. Asian women, however, had a lower body mass index (22.6 compared with 24.2, P=.02), were more likely to be nulligravid (53% compared with 35%, P=.03), and were more likely to have had at least one prior IVF cycle (37% compared with 20%, P=.02) The groups were similar in treatment characteristics, number of oocytes retrieved, fertilization rate, and number of blastocysts transferred. However, Asian women had a thicker endometrial lining (10.9 compared with 10.2, P=.02). Despite these similarities, Asian women had a lower implantation rate (28% compared with 45%, P=.01), clinical pregnancy rate (43% compared with 59%, P=.03), and live birthrate (31% compared with 48%, P=.02). In multivariable analysis, the decreased live birthrate among Asian women persisted (adjusted odds ratio 0.48, 95% confidence interval 0.24-0.96, P=.04).When compared with white women, Asian women have lower clinical pregnancy and live birthrates after blastocyst transfer.

View details for Poor Prognosis with In Vitro Fertilization in Indian Women Compared to Caucasian Women Despite Similar Embryo Quality Shahine, L. K., Lamb, J. D., Lathi, R. B., Milki, A. A., Langen, E., Westphal, L. M. Disease prevalence and response to medical therapy may differ among patients of diverse ethnicities. Poor outcomes with in vitro fertilization (IVF) treatment have been previously shown in Indian women compared to Caucasian women, and some evidence suggests that poor embryo quality may be a cause for the discrepancy. In our center, only patients with the highest quality cleavage stage embryos are considered eligible for extending embryo culture to the blastocyst stage. We compared live birth rates (LBR) between Indian and Caucasian women after blastocyst transfer to investigate whether differences in IVF outcomes between these ethnicities would persist in patients who transferred similar quality embryos.In this retrospective cohort analysis, we compared IVF outcome between 145 Caucasians and 80 Indians who had a blastocyst transfer between January 1, 2005 and June 31, 2007 in our university center. Indians were younger than Caucasians by 2.7 years (34.03 vs. 36.71, P = 0.03), were more likely to have an agonist down regulation protocol (68% vs. 43%, P<0.01), and were more likely to have polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS), although not significant, (24% vs. 14%, P = 0.06). Sixty eight percent of Indian patients had the highest quality embryos (4AB blastocyst or better) transferred compared to 71% of the Caucasians (P = 0.2). LBR was significantly lower in the Indians compared to the Caucasians (24% vs. 41%, P<0.01) with an odds ratio of 0.63, (95%CI 0.46-0.86). Controlling for age, stimulation protocol and PCOS showed persistently lower LBR with an adjusted odds ratio of 0.56, (95%CI 0.40-0.79) in the multivariate analysis.Despite younger age and similar embryo quality, Indians had a significantly lower LBR than Caucasians. In this preliminary study, poor prognosis after IVF for Indian ethnicity persisted despite limiting analysis to patients with high quality embryos transferred. Further investigation into explanations for ethnic differences in reproduction is needed.

Thirty-five patients with similar fertility treatments pre- and post-methotrexate were identified. Within this group, when an IVF cycle occurred within 180 days of methotrexate exposure, a significant decline in oocytes retrieved was observed. Cycles performed later than 180 days after methotrexate exposure did not exhibit a decrease in oocyte production. Endometrial development was similar at all time points examined.These findings suggest a time-limited and reversible impact of methotrexate on oocyte yield. If confirmed by larger clinical series and/or animal data, these results may impact the management of ectopic gestation in the patient with a history of infertility or the timing of subsequent treatments.

To evaluate the cost effectiveness of laparoscopy for unexplained infertility.We performed a cost-effectiveness analysis using a computer-generated decision analysis tree. Data used to construct the mathematical model were extracted from the literature or obtained from our practice. We compared outcomes following four treatment strategies: [1] no treatment, [2] standard infertility treatment algorithm (SITA), [3] laparoscopy with expectant management (LSC/EM), and [4] laparoscopy with infertility therapy (LSC/IT). The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was calculated, and one-way sensitivity analyses assessed the impact of varying base-case estimates.Academic in vitro fertilization practice.Computer-simulated patients assigned to one of four treatments.Fertility treatment or laparoscopy.Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios.Using base-case assumptions, LSC/EM was preferred (ICER =$128,400 per live-birth in U.S. dollars). Changing the following did not alter results: rates and costs of multiple gestations, penalty for high-order multiples, infertility treatment costs, and endometriosis prevalence. Outcomes were most affected by patient dropout from infertility treatments-SITA was preferred when dropout was less than 9% per cycle. Less important factors included surgical costs, acceptability of twins, and the effects of untreated endometriosis on fecundity.Laparoscopy is cost effective in the initial management of young women with infertility, particularly when infertility treatment dropout rates exceed 9% per cycle.

M., Lathi, R. B. To investigate the hypothesis that surgical treatment of endometriosis in infertile patients may improve pregnancy rates by improving embryo quality.We conducted a retrospective evaluation of 30 infertile patients treated with in vitro fertilization (IVF) before and after surgery for endometriosis. Patients served as their own controls and only cycles with similar stimulation protocols were compared.Using standard visual evaluation, embryo quality on day 3 was similar before and after surgical treatment of endometriosis. Fifty seven percent of patients had stage I-II endometriosis and 43% had stage III-IV disease. No patients had a live birth after the first IVF cycle and 43% of patients had a live birth with the IVF cycle after surgery.Surgical treatment of endometriosis does not alter embryo quality in patients with infertility treated with IVF. Basal follicle-stimulating hormone as a predictor of fetal aneuploidy Massie, J. A., Burney, R. O., Milki, A. A., Westphal, L. M., Lathi, R. B. To determine whether an elevated basal FSH concentration is an independent predictor of fetal aneuploidy, as measured in spontaneous abortions (SAB).Retrospective study.Academic reproductive endocrinology and infertility center.All women with karyotypes of chorionic villi isolated from first trimester spontaneous miscarriages at the time of dilation and curettage from 1999 to 2006. The highest basal serum FSH level in the year preceding dilation and curettage was recorded.Monitoring of early pregnancy.Fetal karyotype.A total of 177 spontaneous miscarriages with karyotypes (70 euploid and 107 aneuploid) were identified, of which 53% were conceived by IVF. The aneuploid cohort consisted of trisomic (87%), teraploid (9.3%), and monosomic (3.7%) gestations. Using logistic regression analysis, basal FSH was not found to be independently predictive of an aneuploid gestation in our data set.Our data do not support the hypothesis that an elevated basal FSH concentration is associated with an increase in fetal aneuploidy. Our findings suggest that the association between diminished ovarian reserve and SAB may result from nonkaryotypic factors.

B., Lathi, R. B., Milki, A. A., Dahan, M. H. Hemorrhage from a cervical pregnancy is a time-sensitive matter. Effective temporization measures for the initial management of this hemorrhage have not previously been reported in the literature.A 43-year-old woman, gravida 0, underwent in vitro fertilization and embryo transfer. She subsequently presented to the office with sudden onset of vaginal hemorrhage due to a cervical pregnancy. Cervical artery sutures were placed, and a cervical vasoconstricting agent was injected, at which point the patient's bleeding stopped. She then underwent successful treatment with dilation and curettage.Conservative measures to manage hemorrhage due to cervical pregnancy can be initiated, with possible rapid establishment of hemostasis until definitive treatment can be achieved.

B., Clopton, P., Nezhat, C. To evaluate positive predictive value (PPV) of visual diagnosis at laparoscopy compared with biopsy findings according to severity of endometriosis.Retrospective study (Canadian Task Force classification II-2).Academic referral center.Women who underwent laparoscopic biopsies for suspected endometriosis.A total of 238 biopsy specimens (73 endometriomas and 165 peritoneal implants) were taken from 104 patients undergoing laparoscopy for evaluation of chronic pelvic pain thought to be caused by endometriosis.Accuracy of laparoscopic findings compared with histology-proved endometriosis by severity of disease and location of endometriotic lesions. Overall PPV per patient was 86.5%, which was 75.8% for stage I disease compared with 89.7%, 100%, and 90.6%, respectively, for disease stages II to IV (p = .037). The PPV per biopsy specimen of stages I to IV endometriosis was 66.1%, 78.0%, 92.0%, and 81.1%, respectively (.049). When endometriomas and peritoneal biopsy specimens were analyzed separately, no difference in PPV existed (79% vs 77%; p = .67).High overall PPV existed in our study, especially in patients with advanced disease. The PPV per patient was higher than the PPV per biopsy specimen indicating that ability to diagnose endometriosis may be improved by performing multiple biopsies. This is particularly true in stage I where failure to confirm may be greatest.

The average age of the patients was 37 +/- 4.5 years. Using a limited five-probe panel, 54 of the 177 (31%) abnormal karyotypes would have been detected. In contrast, an extended PGD panel (using 9, 10, or 12 chromosome probes) would have detected 127, 131, and 140 of 177 abnormalities, 72%, 74%, and 79% respectively. The difference between the limited (5-probe) and extended (9-, 10-, and 12-probe) panels was statistically significant. There was not a statistically significant difference among the extended panels.Most of the abnormalities seen in miscarriages are detectable by PGD with extended panels. A significantly higher percentage of these abnormalities could be detected by screening for 9, 10, or 12 chromosomes compared with only 5.

A retrospective review of all patients older than 35 who underwent elective single blastocyst transfer was performed. Twenty-three of the 45 patients (51.1%) have an ongoing pregnancy or liveborn delivery, with a mean age of 37.3 years, demonstrating a clear role for elective single transfer in this relatively older IVF population. View details for Cytogenetic testing of anembryonic pregnancies compared to embryonic missed abortions Lathi, R. B., Mark, S. D., Westphal, L. M., Milki, A. A. The objective of this study is to determine the rate of abnormalities detected by cytogenetic testing of first trimester miscarriages, in patients with and without an embryonic pole seen on ultrasound.A retrospective study of 272 D&Cs for missed abortions in an academic infertility practice from 1999 to 2006. Karyotype results were compared with transvaginal ultrasound findings. Chi-squared analysis was used with a P < 0.05 for significance.There was a high rate of abnormal karyotypes in all miscarriages (65%). Rates of abnormal karyotypes were 58% and 68% in cases with anembryonic gestations and those with a fetal pole seen, respectively (P > 0.05).The high rate of abnormalities detected in both groups suggests that useful results can be obtained from chromosomal testing of the POC regardless of ultrasound findings. Further studies on the prognostic value and cost effectiveness of chromosomal testing are needed. Preoperative vaginal preparation with baby shampoo compared with povidone-iodine before gynecologic procedures Lewis, L. A., Lathi, R. B., Crochet, P., Nezhat, C. The objective of this study was to compare the postoperative infection rates between patients receiving either povidone-iodine (PI) or baby shampoo vaginal preparations before gynecologic surgery.Cohort study (Canadian Task Force classification II-2).University referral center for gynecologic endoscopy.All patients underwent minimally invasive gynecologic surgery including hysteroscopy or laparoscopy.The agents used for vaginal preparation were either baby shampoo in a 1:1 dilution with sterile normal saline solution or PI 7.5% scrub solution.Charts were reviewed for evidence of infection within 30 days of surgery (symptoms of urinary tract infection, abdominal or vaginal wound infections, temperature > 100.4 degrees F, and fungal or bacterial vaginitis). A total of 249 cases were collected; 96 subjects underwent surgery before the change to baby shampoo and 153 subjects after. Both groups were well matched for the types of surgery performed, age, risk factors for postoperative infections, and the postoperative diagnosis. The infection rates were 14/96 (14.6%) with PI preparation versus 18/153 (11.8%) with baby shampoo (p = .52).Baby shampoo should be studied as an alternative to PI because it is a nonirritating, inexpensive mild detergent. This preliminary study suggests that baby shampoo is as effective as PI in preventing postoperative infection.

To compare pregnancy rates (PR) for letrozole and gonadotropins in individuals who failed to conceive with clomiphene citrate (CC).Retrospective cohort study.University reproductive center.Individuals treated with letrozole or gonadotropins who failed to conceive with CC.Controlled ovarian hyperstimulation (COH), transvaginal ultrasound, ovulation induction, IUI.Pregnancy rates per cycle.Among patients who failed to conceive with at least three cycles of CC, gonadotropins had a higher PR per cycle than letrozole. Among individuals who failed to conceive with less than three cycles of CC and whose medications were changed because of thin uterine lining or intolerable side effects, average PR per cycle for letrozole and gonadotropin treatments were equivalent. All patients conceived within three stimulation cycles with either gonadotropins or letrozole.In patients who failed to conceive with CC, gonadotropins have higher PR for ovulation induction than letrozole. However, PR were high enough with letrozole to justify its use in this population of patients. Letrozole and gonadotropins should not be used for more than three cycles without a conception. View details for The effect of infertility medication on thyroid function in hypothyroid women who conceive To determine whether infertility medications alter thyroid status in patients with treated hypothyroidism, and whether resulting pregnancies require additional thyroid supplementation compared with those conceived spontaneously.Prospective observational study of 18 infertility patients with treated hypothyroidism who conceived between July 2005 and July 2006 with or without infertility medications. Thyroid studies were performed prior to conception, at the time of pregnancy diagnosis, and approximately 6 weeks after an increase in thyroid replacement dose.Orally medicated conceptions were similar to spontaneous conceptions on all thyroid related variables, and therefore the two groups were combined for analysis. Although there was a nonsignificant difference in thyrotropin (TSH) levels postconception (3.8 mIU/L vs. 2.2 mIU/L, p = 0.30), there was no difference in TSH levels after increase in thyroid replacement dose (1.7 mIU/L vs. 1.1 mIU/L, p = 0.30) between patients who conceived after gonadotropin stimulation compared with those who conceived spontaneously or with oral medications. The mean percent dose increases for the nongonadotropin and gonadotropin pregnancy groups were 30.6% and 32.4%, respectively.Hypothyroid patients who conceive after gonadotropin stimulation or with oral medications for ovulation induction do not need additional thyroid supplementation compared with those who conceive spontaneously. View details for Rupture of ectopic pregnancy with minimally detectable beta-human chorionic gonadotropin levels: A report of 2 cases Several studies have demonstrated that 25-77% of ectopic pregnancies spontaneously resolve with expectant management. However, expectant management is controversial and should be considered only for patients with small, unruptured gestational sacs, low beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (beta-hCG) levels and absence of symptoms. There is no consensus on how long to follow such patients.Two patients with beta-hCG levels < 10 mIU/mL presented with ruptured ectopic pregnancy and hemoperitoneum.While expectant management of a suspected ectopic pregnancy may allow spontaneous resolution of such an ectopic pregnancy, rupture may occur at any time and even with extremely low beta-hCG levels. Patients need to be counseled about the risks of rupture and symptoms, immediate action should be taken if symptoms develop, and serum beta-hCG levels should be followed to zero.

The purpose of our study is to compare the occurrence of monozygotic twinning (MZT) from blastocyst transfer (BT) in our program between an earlier and more recent time period.Retrospective.Academic IVF practice.All pregnancies conceived between March 2002 and December 2005 (N = 932) in our program were compared to pregnancies conceived before March 2002 (N = 554), which were the subject of a previous study.None.The incidence of MZT with day 3 embryo transfer and BT were compared between the study and control groups.During the study period, the rate of MZT was not significantly different for BT at 2.3% (9/385) compared to day 3 embryo transfer at 1.8% (10/547). This rate of 2.3% for BT was significantly lower than the rate of 5.6% (11/197) reported at our institution for BT before March 2002.Our study suggests that the risk of MZT with BT is significantly lower in the more recent time period and is in the range of what is seen with cleavage stage transfer. It is likely that improvements in culture systems as experience is gained with BT played a role.

We evaluated the role of MRI as a preoperative diagnostic tool for leiomyoma and adenomyosis.This is a retrospective chart review at a university-based hospital. The study included 1517 women who underwent hysterectomy or myomectomy over a 5-year period, and 153 women with a preoperative pelvic MRI were included. Comparisons were made between the results of the MRI and postoperative pathology reports.The MRI and pathology report were the same for 136 of 144 women with leiomyoma and 12 of 31 women with adenomyosis. The MRI had 94% sensitivity and 33% specificity for leiomyoma and 38% sensitivity and 91% specificity for adenomyosis. Positive and negative predictive values of MRI for leiomyoma were 95% and 27% with 90% accuracy. Positive and negative predictive values of MRI for adenomyosis were 52% and 85%, respectively, with 80% accuracy.MRI has a high sensitivity and a low specificity for diagnosing leiomyoma and a high specificity and a low sensitivity for diagnosing adenomyosis. Due to the high cost and technical variations, we suggest using MRI only as an adjunctive diagnostic tool when ultrasound is not conclusive and differentiation between the 2 pathologies ultimately affects patient management.

B., Hess, A. P., Tulac, S., Nayak, N. R., Conti, M., Giudice, L. C. IGF binding protein-1 (IGFBP-1) is a major product of decidualized human endometrial stromal cells and decidua, and as a modulator of IGF action and/or by independent mechanisms, it regulates cell growth and differentiation and embryonic implantation in these tissues. IGFBP-1 secretion is primarily stimulated by progesterone and cAMP and is inhibited by insulin and IGFs. The signaling pathways mediating the latter are not well defined, and the current study was conducted to determine which pathways mediate the effects of insulin on IGFBP-1 mRNA and protein expression by human endometrial stromal cells decidualized in vitro by progesterone. Cells were cultured and treated with different combinations of insulin; wortmannin, an inhibitor of the phosphatidylinositide-3-kinase (PI3-kinase) pathway; and PD98059, an inhibitor of the MAPK pathway. IGFBP-1 mRNA was determined by real-time PCR, and protein secretion in the conditioned medium was measured by ELISA. Activation of the PI3-kinase and the MAPK pathways was assessed by the detection of phosphorylated AKT and ERK in Western blots, respectively. Insulin inhibited IGFBP-1 mRNA and protein secretion in a dose-dependent fashion, with an ED(50) for the latter 0.127 ng/ml (21.6 pm). Inhibitor studies revealed that at low doses, insulin acts through the PI3-kinase pathway, whereas at higher levels it also activates the MAPK pathway in the inhibition of IGFBP-1. The data demonstrate that human endometrium is a target for insulin action in the regulation of IGFBP-1. At physiological levels insulin likely plays a homeostatic role for energy metabolism in the endometrium, and in hyperinsulinemic states, insulin action on the endometrium may activate cellular mitosis via the MAPK pathway and perhaps predispose this tissue to hyperplasia and/or cancer.

The patients with ICSI were more likely to have aneuploidy identified in their POC than conventional IVF, 76% vs. 41%. The average ages in these groups were similar: 37.1 vs. 37.8 years. There was a trend toward decreased aneuploidy with day 5 compared to day 3 embryo transfers; 38% vs. 63%.We found a significantly higher aneuploidy rate in the abortuses of patients who conceived with ICSI. It is possible that this increased incidence is due to abnormalities in the sperm of patients with ICSI, but could also be partially related to the technique itself. View details for Interferon-related and other immune genes are downregulated in peripheral blood leukocytes in the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle Dosiou, C., Lathi, R. B., Tulac, S., Huang, S. T., Giudice, L. C. Interaction between the endocrine and the immune systems has been suggested by observations of sexual dimorphism of the immune response, differential susceptibility to autoimmunity between the sexes, changes in autoimmune disease activity during the menstrual cycle and in pregnancy and in vitro studies of hormonal influence on cytokine production.We hypothesized that if there is hormonal regulation of the immune response, this would be manifest in peripheral blood leukocytes (PBLs) at different phases of the menstrual cycle. In this study, we describe gene profiling of PBLs from the follicular and luteal phases of the menstrual cycle. We observe important differences in immune gene expression, with significant down-regulation of the Th1 immune response in the luteal phase. A significant number of interferon (IFN)-related genes are amongst the downregulated genes. These results support significant hormonal regulation of the immune system and may have therapeutic implications in diseases of autoimmunity in women.

A technique of careful selection and washing of the specimen was implemented in July 1999. Results from before (n = 15) and after (n = 41) this change were compared. Cytogenetics reports from other physicians using the same laboratory were used for comparison (n = 59).The percentage of 46XX results was significantly decreased in the test group when compared to historical and community controls: 29% vs. 73% and 56% respectively. The percentage of aneuploid results was significantly higher in the test group at 61% vs. 7% and 36% in the historical and community controls respectively.Thorough separation and cleaning of villi prior to sending missed abortion specimens significantly increases sensitivity of conventional cytogenetics for detecting aneuploidy by decreasing maternal contamination.

Recombinant FSH (rFSH) has been shown to be safe and effective in the treatment of fertility disorders. In comparison with the urinary gonadotropin products, human menopausal gonadotropins (HMG), and urinary follitropins (uFSH), rFSH is more potent and better tolerated by patients. Recombinant HCG appears to be as efficacious as urinary HCG with the benefit of improved local tolerance. Recombinant LH (rLH) is likely to be recommended as a supplement to rFSH for ovulation induction in hypogonadotropic women.

e6f0320b-285a-4028-a725-9b73a62c4c50,"https://www.thebody.com/article/smart-study-background-concepts-design Sharon is a 28-year-old African American whose HIV infection was diagnosed 9 months ago. Of three determinations, her average CD4 T cell count has been 489 cells/mm; average viral load, 17,500 copies/mL. Before undertaking a regimen of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), Sharon looks for study results on the long-term clinical benefits and risks of anti-HIV drugs in patients with early and mid-stage disease. She finds none. Now that the federal government has given it final approval, SMART will be the largest, most ambitious clinical trial in the history of the HIV epidemic. In fact, it will be one of the largest trials in the history of any infectious disease. The acronym, which stands for trategies for the anagement of nti-etroviral herapy, suggests that the study is an attempt to answer intelligently important questions about the long-term management of HIV disease. Designed by investigators with the Community Programs for Clinical Research on AIDS (CPCRA), SMART seeks to determine whether one of two sharply contrasting management strategies is superior to the other in delaying AIDS-related morbidity and mortality. Specifically, the study compares a strategy of delayed, episodic anti-HIV therapy against one of immediate, uninterrupted therapy. The National Institutes of Health has called upon the research consortiums it funds, including CPCRA, to design trials that evaluate strategic approaches to the use of anti-HIV drugs. SMART marks the federal government's first attempt to study the long-term clinical effectiveness of different strategies for managing HIV disease. The study calls for following 6000 HIV-infected subjects for as long as 8 years. By protocol, the volunteers must have a baseline CD4 T cell count of at least 350 cells/mm; investigators will randomize them in a 1:1 ratio to one of two strategies. The drug conservation (DC) strategy has participants stop or defer antiretroviral therapy until their CD4 T cell counts fall below 250 cells/mm. Volunteers would then undertake a regimen to return their T cell counts to 350 cells/mm (or higher) for 2 consecutive visits, at which point they would stop treatment again. Assuming each round of treatment is successful in restoring the T cell count to baseline, participants following this strategy could conceivably repeat the cycle until the study ends. While on therapy, the protocol calls for volunteers to take virologically suppressive regimens. In the patient literature, this arm will be known as the . The rationale for the DC strategy is based on the following observations: HIV disease progression is rare among patients with HIV CD4 T cell counts above 250 cells/mm. Among patients on therapy, current CD4 T cell count is a better measure of short-term risk for disease progression than viral load. Since clinical symptoms may precede opportunistic disease in patients with higher CD4 T cell counts, regular patient monitoring further reduces the risk of actual illness. Even when the CD4 T cell count has fallen to a low number, anti-HIV therapy restores immune function. Viral load is durably suppressed with therapy among patients with CD4 T cell counts between 200 and 349 cells/mm just as well as it is among patients with CD4 T cell counts above 350 cells/mm. Half or more of all patients lose control of viral load within a year of starting therapy, and thus risk drug resistance. Long-term use of antiretrovirals is associated with serious side effects. The virologic suppression (VS) strategy has participants immediately undertake therapy following randomization with the goal of virologic suppression, regardless of CD4 T cell count. (This includes patients with high CD4 T cell counts above 500 cells/mm.) Patients naïve to therapy at randomization must begin a virologically suppressive first-line regimen. Those on treatment prior to randomization may continue their regimens, modifying when necessary to suppress viral load. The protocol permits volunteers in this arm to change therapies for toxicity or intolerance, but the participants will stay on regimens aimed at achieving viral suppression for the duration of trial. In the patient literature, this arm will be known as the . The rationale for the VS strategy is based on these observations: Baseline viral load predicts progression to AIDS in untreated patients. Since changes in therapy are more likely to produce viral suppression when made at lower viral loads, HIV RNA and not CD4 T cell count is the better guide to regimen modification. When treatment is interrupted, the CD4 T cell count declines and viral load rises. Durable suppression of viral load is more likely when patients start therapy with CD4 T cell counts of 350 cells/mm or higher. There are enough antiretrovirals on the market for most patients to find a regimen that is tolerable and convenient. Even though HAART does facilitate partial immune reconstitution, the CD4 T cell nadir influences risk of opportunistic disease. The protocol excludes volunteers who are pregnant or enrolled in any other study inconsistent with participation in SMART. Regardless of the arm to which they are assigned, SMART volunteers are free to take agents of their choice while on treatment, including experimental compounds, hydroxyurea, or immunomodulators. The only caveat is that, whenever possible, the regimens suppress HIV RNA below the limits of quantification. Volunteers must have a baseline CD4 T cell count of 350 cells/mm or higher and be willing to start, modify, delay, or stop therapy, depending on the study arm to which they are randomized. Accordingly, the trial is open to volunteers who are both treatment naïve and treatment experienced. This broadly inclusive design is intentional. Investigators want SMART to be acceptable to patients and clinicians, and they want the study's findings to reflect actual clinical practice and be widely generalizable. Investigators had intended the treatment strategy of SMART's VS group to replicate the US standard of care for the management of HIV infection. (Hence, the protocol refers to the VS arm as the control group.) For years, the guidelines promulgated by a panel of the US Department of Health and Human Services set a CD4 T cell count less than 500 cells/mm as the trigger to start therapy, but did not discourage therapy for patients with even higher counts. Accordingly, SMART's VS approach calls for hard-hitting treatment for every patient, including those with CD4 T cell counts above 500 cells/mm. But in February 2001, in a nod to the intractable toxicities of HAART, the guidelines panel released a new blueprint for treatment. Now, the threshold for initiating therapy is 350 CD4 T cells/mm, with a viral load below the limits of quantification still the appropriate aim of treatment. SMART does not question the tactical wisdom of maximally suppressing HIV RNA once a patient undertakes a HAART regimen. But it does ask, given the serious risks associated with anti-HIV drugs, whether the new, lower start-to-treat trigger is still too high. Relying on data that show clinical disease progression occurs infrequently in patients with relatively healthy CD4 T cell counts, SMART will examine the implications of delaying treatment until the T cell count has fallen to 250 cells/mm. Furthermore, by allowing for episodic therapy, SMART's DC arm also questions the assumption that once therapy is undertaken it should never be stopped. Finally, SMART asks which is the better surrogate for guiding treatment decisions: viral load or CD4 T cell count? In short, SMART pits immediate and uninterrupted antiretroviral therapy with a reliance on viral load as the guiding surrogate against deferred and episodic therapy with a reliance on CD4 T cell count as the guide. Since SMART puts the surrogates themselves on trial, it will use clinical events (AIDS and death) as primary endpoints. Follow-up will last until investigators observe 910 clinical events, which is expected to take 6-8 years. The study's authors project that clinical disease progression will account for 70% of these events, with death accounting for the remaining 30%; however, half of these deaths will be unrelated to HIV, e.g. suicide, car accidents, etc. As the protocol notes, ""[t]he ultimate goal of the treatment of HIV disease is to prevent clinical morbidity and mortality. Thus, the primary and secondary endpoints of this study are clinical outcomes rather than surrogate markers."" Ironically, even though it employs sharply contrasting approaches to HIV disease management, SMART does not anticipate a dramatic difference in clinical outcome between the groups. Even a moderate difference in treatment effect -- say 17%, which is what the protocol projects -- would have a significant influence on patient management. Furthermore, the trial itself would provide the missing clinical evidence for treatment guidelines. In addition to the primary endpoint of clinical disease progression or death, SMART has several secondary endpoints, including: Incidence of major cardiovascular and metabolic complications Substudies will examine differences between the groups in quality of life, HIV transmission risk behaviors, health care utilization, etc. (See .) The clinical benefits of antiretroviral therapy are well documented for patients with advanced HIV disease. However, it is not yet known whether therapy increases survival time or decreases opportunistic infections among patients with early or mid-stage disease, and if it does, whether those benefits are outweighed by the toxicities of therapy. Based largely on strong theoretical considerations, experts have recommended the early use of uninterrupted treatment with the aim of maximal viral suppression; however, like HIV infection itself, treatment comes with its own dangers and an undetectable viral load has proven elusive for at least half of all patients on therapy. Furthermore, the prospect of a lifetime of uninterrupted therapy is not only disheartening, it is also impractical. SMART therefore asks whether the same clinical benefits sought by standard of care treatment, as reflected in the VS arm, can be achieved through a kinder, gentler approach, as reflected in the DC arm. The long-term usefulness of HAART itself may hinge on the answer.

During , mature eggs are collected (retrieved) from ovaries and fertilized by sperm in a lab. Then the fertilized egg (embryo) or eggs (embryos) are transferred to a uterus. One full cycle of takes about three weeks. Sometimes these steps are split into different parts and the process can take longer. is the most effective form of assisted reproductive technology. The procedure can be done using your own eggs and your partner's sperm. Or may involve eggs, sperm or embryos from a known or anonymous donor. In some cases, a gestational carrier — a woman who has an embryo implanted in her uterus — might be used. Your chances of having a healthy baby using depend on many factors, such as your age and the cause of infertility. In addition, can be time-consuming, expensive and invasive. If more than one embryo is transferred to your uterus, can result in a pregnancy with more than one fetus (multiple pregnancy). Your doctor can help you understand how works, the potential risks and whether this method of treating infertility is right for you. In vitro fertilization (IVF) is a treatment for infertility or genetic problems. If is performed to treat infertility, you and your partner might be able to try less-invasive treatment options before attempting , including fertility drugs to increase production of eggs or intrauterine insemination — a procedure in which sperm are placed directly in your uterus near the time of ovulation. Sometimes, is offered as a primary treatment for infertility in women over age 40. can also be done if you have certain health conditions. For example, may be an option if you or your partner has: Fallopian tube damage or blockage makes it difficult for an egg to be fertilized or for an embryo to travel to the uterus. If ovulation is infrequent or absent, fewer eggs are available for fertilization. Endometriosis occurs when the uterine tissue implants and grows outside of the uterus — often affecting the function of the ovaries, uterus and fallopian tubes. Fibroids are benign tumors in the wall of the uterus and are common in women in their 30s and 40s. Fibroids can interfere with implantation of the fertilized egg. If you've had tubal ligation — a type of sterilization in which your fallopian tubes are cut or blocked to permanently prevent pregnancy — and want to conceive, may be an alternative to tubal ligation reversal. Below-average sperm concentration, weak movement of sperm (poor mobility), or abnormalities in sperm size and shape can make it difficult for sperm to fertilize an egg. If semen abnormalities are found, your partner might need to see a specialist to determine if there are correctable problems or underlying health concerns. Unexplained infertility means no cause of infertility has been found despite evaluation for common causes. If you or your partner is at risk of passing on a genetic disorder to your child, you may be candidates for preimplantation genetic testing — a procedure that involves . After the eggs are harvested and fertilized, they're screened for certain genetic problems, although not all genetic problems can be found. Embryos that don't contain identified problems can be transferred to the uterus. Fertility preservation for cancer or other health conditions. If you're about to start cancer treatment — such as radiation or chemotherapy — that could harm your fertility, for fertility preservation may be an option. Women can have eggs harvested from their ovaries and frozen in an unfertilized state for later use. Or the eggs can be fertilized and frozen as embryos for future use. Women who don't have a functional uterus or for whom pregnancy poses a serious health risk might choose using another person to carry the pregnancy (gestational carrier). In this case, the woman's eggs are fertilized with sperm, but the resulting embryos are placed in the gestational carrier's uterus. increases the risk of multiple births if more than one embryo is transferred to your uterus. A pregnancy with multiple fetuses carries a higher risk of early labor and low birth weight than pregnancy with a single fetus does. Research suggests that slightly increases the risk that the baby will be born early or with a low birth weight. Use of injectable fertility drugs, such as human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG), to induce ovulation can cause ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome, in which your ovaries become swollen and painful. Symptoms typically last a week and include mild abdominal pain, bloating, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea. If you become pregnant, however, your symptoms might last several weeks. Rarely, it's possible to develop a more severe form of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome that can also cause rapid weight gain and shortness of breath. The rate of miscarriage for women who conceive using with fresh embryos is similar to that of women who conceive naturally — about 15% to 25% — but the rate increases with maternal age. Use of an aspirating needle to collect eggs could possibly cause bleeding, infection or damage to the bowel, bladder or a blood vessel. Risks are also associated with sedation and general anesthesia, if used. About 2% to 5% of women who use will have an ectopic pregnancy — when the fertilized egg implants outside the uterus, usually in a fallopian tube. The fertilized egg can't survive outside the uterus, and there's no way to continue the pregnancy. The age of the mother is the primary risk factor in the development of birth defects, no matter how the child is conceived. More research is needed to determine whether babies conceived using might be at increased risk of certain birth defects. Although some early studies suggested there may be a link between certain medications used to stimulate egg growth and the development of a specific type of ovarian tumor, more-recent studies do not support these findings. There does not appear to be a significantly increased risk of breast, endometrial, cervical or ovarian cancer after . Use of can be financially, physically and emotionally draining. Support from counselors, family and friends can help you and your partner through the ups and downs of infertility treatment. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Society for Assisted Reproductive Technology provide information online about U.S. clinics' individual pregnancy and live birth rates. When choosing an in vitro fertilization (IVF) clinic, keep in mind that a clinic's success rate depends on many factors, such as patients' ages and medical issues, as well as the clinic's treatment population and treatment approaches. Ask for detailed information about the costs associated with each step of the procedure. Before beginning a cycle of using your own eggs and sperm, you and your partner will likely need various screenings, including: To determine the quantity and quality of your eggs, your doctor might test the concentration of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), estradiol (estrogen) and anti-mullerian hormone in your blood during the first few days of your menstrual cycle. Test results, often used together with an ultrasound of your ovaries, can help predict how your ovaries will respond to fertility medication. If not done as part of your initial fertility evaluation, your doctor will conduct a semen analysis shortly before the start of an treatment cycle. You and your partner will both be screened for infectious diseases, including . Your doctor might conduct a mock embryo transfer to determine the depth of your uterine cavity and the technique most likely to successfully place the embryos into your uterus. Your doctor will examine the inside lining of the uterus before you start . This might involve a sonohysterography — in which fluid is injected through the cervix into your uterus — and an ultrasound to create images of your uterine cavity. Or it might include a hysteroscopy — in which a thin, flexible, lighted telescope (hysteroscope) is inserted through your vagina and cervix into your uterus. Before beginning a cycle of , consider important questions, including: The number of embryos transferred is typically based on age and number of eggs retrieved. Since the rate of implantation is lower for older women, more embryos are usually transferred — except for women using donor eggs or genetically tested embryos. Most doctors follow specific guidelines to prevent a higher order multiple pregnancy — triplets or more — and in some countries, legislation limits the number of embryos that can be transferred. Make sure you and your doctor agree on the number of embryos that will be transferred before the transfer procedure. Extra embryos can be frozen and stored for future use for several years. Not all embryos will survive the freezing and thawing process, although most will. Cryopreservation can make future cycles of less expensive and less invasive. Or, you might be able to donate unused frozen embryos to another couple or a research facility. You might also choose to discard unused embryos. If more than one embryo is transferred to your uterus, can result in a multiple pregnancy — which poses health risks for you and your babies. In some cases, fetal reduction can be used to help a woman deliver fewer babies with lower health risks. Pursuing fetal reduction, however, is a major decision with ethical, emotional and psychological consequences. Have you considered the potential complications associated with using donor eggs, sperm or embryos, or a gestational carrier? A trained counselor with expertise in donor issues can help you understand the concerns, such as the legal rights of the donor. You may also need an attorney to file court papers to help you become legal parents of an implanted embryo. involves several steps — ovarian stimulation, egg retrieval, sperm retrieval, fertilization and embryo transfer. One cycle of can take about two to three weeks, and more than one cycle may be required. If you're using your own eggs during , at the start of a cycle you'll begin treatment with synthetic hormones to stimulate your ovaries to produce multiple eggs — rather than the single egg that normally develops each month. Multiple eggs are needed because some eggs won't fertilize or develop normally after fertilization. You may need several different medications, such as: To stimulate your ovaries, you might receive an injectable medication containing a follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), a luteinizing hormone (LH) or a combination of both. These medications stimulate more than one egg to develop at a time. When the follicles are ready for egg retrieval — generally after eight to 14 days — you will take human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) or other medications to help the eggs mature. These medications prevent your body from releasing the developing eggs too soon. On the day of egg retrieval or at the time of embryo transfer, your doctor might recommend that you begin taking progesterone supplements to make the lining of your uterus more receptive to implantation. Your doctor will work with you to determine which medications to use and when to use them. Typically, you'll need one to two weeks of ovarian stimulation before your eggs are ready for retrieval. To determine when the eggs are ready for collection, your doctor will likely perform: an imaging exam of your ovaries to monitor the development of follicles — fluid-filled ovarian sacs where eggs mature to measure your response to ovarian stimulation medications — estrogen levels typically increase as follicles develop, and progesterone levels remain low until after ovulation Sometimes cycles need to be canceled before egg retrieval for one of these reasons: Too many follicles developing, creating a risk of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome If your cycle is canceled, your doctor might recommend changing medications or their doses to promote a better response during future cycles. Or you may be advised that you need an egg donor. Egg retrieval can be done in your doctor's office or a clinic 34 to 36 hours after the final injection and before ovulation. During egg retrieval, you'll be sedated and given pain medication. Transvaginal ultrasound aspiration is the usual retrieval method. An ultrasound probe is inserted into your vagina to identify follicles. Then a thin needle is inserted into an ultrasound guide to go through the vagina and into the follicles to retrieve the eggs. If your ovaries aren't accessible through transvaginal ultrasound, an abdominal ultrasound may be used to guide the needle. The eggs are removed from the follicles through a needle connected to a suction device. Multiple eggs can be removed in about 20 minutes. After egg retrieval, you may experience cramping and feelings of fullness or pressure. Mature eggs are placed in a nutritive liquid (culture medium) and incubated. Eggs that appear healthy and mature will be mixed with sperm to attempt to create embryos. However, not all eggs may be successfully fertilized. If you're using your partner's sperm, he'll provide a semen sample at your doctor's office or a clinic through masturbation the morning of egg retrieval. Other methods, such as testicular aspiration — the use of a needle or surgical procedure to extract sperm directly from the testicle — are sometimes required. Donor sperm also can be used. Sperm are separated from the semen fluid in the lab. Fertilization can be attempted using two common methods: During conventional insemination, healthy sperm and mature eggs are mixed and incubated overnight. In , a single healthy sperm is injected directly into each mature egg. is often used when semen quality or number is a problem or if fertilization attempts during prior cycles failed. In certain situations, your doctor may recommend other procedures before embryo transfer. About five to six days after fertilization, an embryo ""hatches"" from its surrounding membrane (zona pellucida), allowing it to implant into the lining of the uterus. If you're an older woman, or if you have had multiple failed attempts, your doctor might recommend assisted hatching — a technique in which a hole is made in the zona pellucida just before transfer to help the embryo hatch and implant. Assisted hatching is also useful for eggs or embryos that have been previously frozen as the process can harden the zona pellucida. Embryos are allowed to develop in the incubator until they reach a stage where a small sample can be removed and tested for specific genetic diseases or the correct number of chromosomes, typically after five to six days of development. Embryos that don't contain affected genes or chromosomes can be transferred to your uterus. While preimplantation genetic testing can reduce the likelihood that a parent will pass on a genetic problem, it can't eliminate the risk. Prenatal testing may still be recommended. Embryo transfer is done at your doctor's office or a clinic and usually takes place two to five days after egg retrieval. You might be given a mild sedative. The procedure is usually painless, although you might experience mild cramping. The doctor will insert a long, thin, flexible tube called a catheter into your vagina, through your cervix and into your uterus. A syringe containing one or more embryos suspended in a small amount of fluid is attached to the end of the catheter. Using the syringe, the doctor places the embryo or embryos into your uterus. If successful, an embryo will implant in the lining of your uterus about six to 10 days after egg retrieval. After the embryo transfer, you can resume normal daily activities. However, your ovaries may still be enlarged. Consider avoiding vigorous activity, which could cause discomfort. Passing a small amount of clear or bloody fluid shortly after the procedure — due to the swabbing of the cervix before the embryo transfer If you develop moderate or severe pain after the embryo transfer, contact your doctor. He or she will evaluate you for complications such as infection, twisting of an ovary (ovarian torsion) and severe ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome. About 12 days to two weeks after egg retrieval, your doctor will test a sample of your blood to detect whether you're pregnant. your doctor will refer you to an obstetrician or other pregnancy specialist for prenatal care. you'll stop taking progesterone and likely get your period within a week. If you don't get your period or you have unusual bleeding, contact your doctor. If you're interested in attempting another cycle of in vitro fertilization (IVF), your doctor might suggest steps you can take to improve your chances of getting pregnant through . The chances of giving birth to a healthy baby after using depend on various factors, including: The younger you are, the more likely you are to get pregnant and give birth to a healthy baby using your own eggs during . Women age 41 and older are often counseled to consider using donor eggs during to increase the chances of success. Transfer of embryos that are more developed is associated with higher pregnancy rates compared with less-developed embryos (day two or three). However, not all embryos survive the development process. Talk with your doctor or other care provider about your specific situation. Women who've previously given birth are more likely to be able to get pregnant using than are women who've never given birth. Success rates are lower for women who've previously used multiple times but didn't get pregnant. Having a normal supply of eggs increases your chances of being able to get pregnant using . Women who have severe endometriosis are less likely to be able to get pregnant using than are women who have unexplained infertility. Women who smoke typically have fewer eggs retrieved during and may miscarry more often. Smoking can lower a woman's chance of success using by 50%. Obesity can decrease your chances of getting pregnant and having a baby. Use of alcohol, recreational drugs, excessive caffeine and certain medications also can be harmful.

Sperm are separated from the semen fluid in the lab. Fertilization can be attempted using two common methods: During conventional insemination, healthy sperm and mature eggs are mixed and incubated overnight. In , a single healthy sperm is injected directly into each mature egg. is often used when semen quality or number is a problem or if fertilization attempts during prior cycles failed. In certain situations, your doctor may recommend other procedures before embryo transfer. About five to six days after fertilization, an embryo ""hatches"" from its surrounding membrane (zona pellucida), allowing it to implant into the lining of the uterus. If you're an older woman, or if you have had multiple failed attempts, your doctor might recommend assisted hatching — a technique in which a hole is made in the zona pellucida just before transfer to help the embryo hatch and implant. Assisted hatching is also useful for eggs or embryos that have been previously frozen as the process can harden the zona pellucida. Embryos are allowed to develop in the incubator until they reach a stage where a small sample can be removed and tested for specific genetic diseases or the correct number of chromosomes, typically after five to six days of development. Embryos that don't contain affected genes or chromosomes can be transferred to your uterus. While preimplantation genetic testing can reduce the likelihood that a parent will pass on a genetic problem, it can't eliminate the risk. Prenatal testing may still be recommended. Embryo transfer is done at your doctor's office or a clinic and usually takes place two to five days after egg retrieval. You might be given a mild sedative. The procedure is usually painless, although you might experience mild cramping. The doctor will insert a long, thin, flexible tube called a catheter into your vagina, through your cervix and into your uterus. A syringe containing one or more embryos suspended in a small amount of fluid is attached to the end of the catheter. Using the syringe, the doctor places the embryo or embryos into your uterus. If successful, an embryo will implant in the lining of your uterus about six to 10 days after egg retrieval. After the embryo transfer, you can resume normal daily activities. However, your ovaries may still be enlarged. Consider avoiding vigorous activity, which could cause discomfort. Passing a small amount of clear or bloody fluid shortly after the procedure — due to the swabbing of the cervix before the embryo transfer If you develop moderate or severe pain after the embryo transfer, contact your doctor. He or she will evaluate you for complications such as infection, twisting of an ovary (ovarian torsion) and severe ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome. About 12 days to two weeks after egg retrieval, your doctor will test a sample of your blood to detect whether you're pregnant. your doctor will refer you to an obstetrician or other pregnancy specialist for prenatal care. you'll stop taking progesterone and likely get your period within a week. If you don't get your period or you have unusual bleeding, contact your doctor. If you're interested in attempting another cycle of in vitro fertilization (IVF), your doctor might suggest steps you can take to improve your chances of getting pregnant through . The chances of giving birth to a healthy baby after using depend on various factors, including: The younger you are, the more likely you are to get pregnant and give birth to a healthy baby using your own eggs during . Women age 41 and older are often counseled to consider using donor eggs during to increase the chances of success. Transfer of embryos that are more developed is associated with higher pregnancy rates compared with less-developed embryos (day two or three). However, not all embryos survive the development process. Talk with your doctor or other care provider about your specific situation. Women who've previously given birth are more likely to be able to get pregnant using than are women who've never given birth. Success rates are lower for women who've previously used multiple times but didn't get pregnant. Having a normal supply of eggs increases your chances of being able to get pregnant using . Women who have severe endometriosis are less likely to be able to get pregnant using than are women who have unexplained infertility. Women who smoke typically have fewer eggs retrieved during and may miscarry more often. Smoking can lower a woman's chance of success using by 50%. Obesity can decrease your chances of getting pregnant and having a baby. Use of alcohol, recreational drugs, excessive caffeine and certain medications also can be harmful. Talk with your doctor about any factors that apply to you and how they may affect your chances of a successful pregnancy. testing new treatments, interventions and tests as a means to prevent, detect, treat or manage this disease.

Mayo Clinic Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences Mayo Clinic School of Continuous Professional Development During in vitro fertilization, eggs are removed from mature follicles within an ovary (A). An egg is fertilized by injecting a single sperm into the egg or mixing the egg with sperm in a petri dish (B). The fertilized egg (embryo) is transferred into the uterus (C). In vitro fertilization (IVF) is a complex series of procedures used to help with fertility or prevent genetic problems and assist with the conception of a child. During , mature eggs are collected (retrieved) from ovaries and fertilized by sperm in a lab. Then the fertilized egg (embryo) or eggs (embryos) are transferred to a uterus. One full cycle of takes about three weeks. Sometimes these steps are split into different parts and the process can take longer. is the most effective form of assisted reproductive technology. The procedure can be done using your own eggs and your partner's sperm. Or may involve eggs, sperm or embryos from a known or anonymous donor. In some cases, a gestational carrier — a woman who has an embryo implanted in her uterus — might be used. Your chances of having a healthy baby using depend on many factors, such as your age and the cause of infertility. In addition, can be time-consuming, expensive and invasive. If more than one embryo is transferred to your uterus, can result in a pregnancy with more than one fetus (multiple pregnancy). Your doctor can help you understand how works, the potential risks and whether this method of treating infertility is right for you. Book: Mayo Clinic Guide to Fertility and Conception Newsletter: Mayo Clinic Health Letter — Digital Edition In vitro fertilization (IVF) is a treatment for infertility or genetic problems. If is performed to treat infertility, you and your partner might be able to try less-invasive treatment options before attempting , including fertility drugs to increase production of eggs or intrauterine insemination — a procedure in which sperm are placed directly in your uterus near the time of ovulation. Sometimes, is offered as a primary treatment for infertility in women over age 40. can also be done if you have certain health conditions. For example, may be an option if you or your partner has: Fallopian tube damage or blockage makes it difficult for an egg to be fertilized or for an embryo to travel to the uterus. If ovulation is infrequent or absent, fewer eggs are available for fertilization. Endometriosis occurs when the uterine tissue implants and grows outside of the uterus — often affecting the function of the ovaries, uterus and fallopian tubes. Fibroids are benign tumors in the wall of the uterus and are common in women in their 30s and 40s. Fibroids can interfere with implantation of the fertilized egg. If you've had tubal ligation — a type of sterilization in which your fallopian tubes are cut or blocked to permanently prevent pregnancy — and want to conceive, may be an alternative to tubal ligation reversal. Below-average sperm concentration, weak movement of sperm (poor mobility), or abnormalities in sperm size and shape can make it difficult for sperm to fertilize an egg. If semen abnormalities are found, your partner might need to see a specialist to determine if there are correctable problems or underlying health concerns. Unexplained infertility means no cause of infertility has been found despite evaluation for common causes. If you or your partner is at risk of passing on a genetic disorder to your child, you may be candidates for preimplantation genetic testing — a procedure that involves . After the eggs are harvested and fertilized, they're screened for certain genetic problems, although not all genetic problems can be found. Embryos that don't contain identified problems can be transferred to the uterus. Fertility preservation for cancer or other health conditions. If you're about to start cancer treatment — such as radiation or chemotherapy — that could harm your fertility, for fertility preservation may be an option. Women can have eggs harvested from their ovaries and frozen in an unfertilized state for later use. Or the eggs can be fertilized and frozen as embryos for future use. Women who don't have a functional uterus or for whom pregnancy poses a serious health risk might choose using another person to carry the pregnancy (gestational carrier). In this case, the woman's eggs are fertilized with sperm, but the resulting embryos are placed in the gestational carrier's uterus. increases the risk of multiple births if more than one embryo is transferred to your uterus. A pregnancy with multiple fetuses carries a higher risk of early labor and low birth weight than pregnancy with a single fetus does. Research suggests that slightly increases the risk that the baby will be born early or with a low birth weight. Use of injectable fertility drugs, such as human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG), to induce ovulation can cause ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome, in which your ovaries become swollen and painful. Symptoms typically last a week and include mild abdominal pain, bloating, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea. If you become pregnant, however, your symptoms might last several weeks. Rarely, it's possible to develop a more severe form of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome that can also cause rapid weight gain and shortness of breath. The rate of miscarriage for women who conceive using with fresh embryos is similar to that of women who conceive naturally — about 15% to 25% — but the rate increases with maternal age. Use of an aspirating needle to collect eggs could possibly cause bleeding, infection or damage to the bowel, bladder or a blood vessel. Risks are also associated with sedation and general anesthesia, if used. About 2% to 5% of women who use will have an ectopic pregnancy — when the fertilized egg implants outside the uterus, usually in a fallopian tube. The fertilized egg can't survive outside the uterus, and there's no way to continue the pregnancy. The age of the mother is the primary risk factor in the development of birth defects, no matter how the child is conceived. More research is needed to determine whether babies conceived using might be at increased risk of certain birth defects. Although some early studies suggested there may be a link between certain medications used to stimulate egg growth and the development of a specific type of ovarian tumor, more-recent studies do not support these findings. There does not appear to be a significantly increased risk of breast, endometrial, cervical or ovarian cancer after . Use of can be financially, physically and emotionally draining. Support from counselors, family and friends can help you and your partner through the ups and downs of infertility treatment. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Society for Assisted Reproductive Technology provide information online about U.S. clinics' individual pregnancy and live birth rates. When choosing an in vitro fertilization (IVF) clinic, keep in mind that a clinic's success rate depends on many factors, such as patients' ages and medical issues, as well as the clinic's treatment population and treatment approaches. Ask for detailed information about the costs associated with each step of the procedure. Before beginning a cycle of using your own eggs and sperm, you and your partner will likely need various screenings, including: To determine the quantity and quality of your eggs, your doctor might test the concentration of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), estradiol (estrogen) and anti-mullerian hormone in your blood during the first few days of your menstrual cycle. Test results, often used together with an ultrasound of your ovaries, can help predict how your ovaries will respond to fertility medication. If not done as part of your initial fertility evaluation, your doctor will conduct a semen analysis shortly before the start of an treatment cycle. You and your partner will both be screened for infectious diseases, including . Your doctor might conduct a mock embryo transfer to determine the depth of your uterine cavity and the technique most likely to successfully place the embryos into your uterus. Your doctor will examine the inside lining of the uterus before you start . This might involve a sonohysterography — in which fluid is injected through the cervix into your uterus — and an ultrasound to create images of your uterine cavity. Or it might include a hysteroscopy — in which a thin, flexible, lighted telescope (hysteroscope) is inserted through your vagina and cervix into your uterus. Before beginning a cycle of , consider important questions, including: The number of embryos transferred is typically based on age and number of eggs retrieved. Since the rate of implantation is lower for older women, more embryos are usually transferred — except for women using donor eggs or genetically tested embryos. Most doctors follow specific guidelines to prevent a higher order multiple pregnancy — triplets or more — and in some countries, legislation limits the number of embryos that can be transferred. Make sure you and your doctor agree on the number of embryos that will be transferred before the transfer procedure. Extra embryos can be frozen and stored for future use for several years. Not all embryos will survive the freezing and thawing process, although most will. Cryopreservation can make future cycles of less expensive and less invasive. Or, you might be able to donate unused frozen embryos to another couple or a research facility. You might also choose to discard unused embryos. If more than one embryo is transferred to your uterus, can result in a multiple pregnancy — which poses health risks for you and your babies. In some cases, fetal reduction can be used to help a woman deliver fewer babies with lower health risks. Pursuing fetal reduction, however, is a major decision with ethical, emotional and psychological consequences. Have you considered the potential complications associated with using donor eggs, sperm or embryos, or a gestational carrier? A trained counselor with expertise in donor issues can help you understand the concerns, such as the legal rights of the donor. You may also need an attorney to file court papers to help you become legal parents of an implanted embryo. Typically, transvaginal ultrasound aspiration is used to retrieve eggs. During this procedure, an ultrasound probe is inserted into your vagina to identify follicles, and a needle is guided through the vagina and into the follicles. The eggs are removed from the follicles through the needle, which is connected to a suction device. In intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI), a single healthy sperm is injected directly into each mature egg. is often used when semen quality or number is a problem or if fertilization attempts during prior in vitro fertilization cycles failed. Three days after fertilization, a normally developing embryo will contain about six to 10 cells. By the fifth or sixth day, the fertilized egg is known as a blastocyst — a rapidly dividing ball of cells. The inner group of cells will become the embryo. The outer group will become the cells that nourish and protect it. involves several steps — ovarian stimulation, egg retrieval, sperm retrieval, fertilization and embryo transfer. One cycle of can take about two to three weeks, and more than one cycle may be required. If you're using your own eggs during , at the start of a cycle you'll begin treatment with synthetic hormones to stimulate your ovaries to produce multiple eggs — rather than the single egg that normally develops each month. Multiple eggs are needed because some eggs won't fertilize or develop normally after fertilization. You may need several different medications, such as: To stimulate your ovaries, you might receive an injectable medication containing a follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), a luteinizing hormone (LH) or a combination of both. These medications stimulate more than one egg to develop at a time. When the follicles are ready for egg retrieval — generally after eight to 14 days — you will take human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) or other medications to help the eggs mature. These medications prevent your body from releasing the developing eggs too soon. On the day of egg retrieval or at the time of embryo transfer, your doctor might recommend that you begin taking progesterone supplements to make the lining of your uterus more receptive to implantation. Your doctor will work with you to determine which medications to use and when to use them. Typically, you'll need one to two weeks of ovarian stimulation before your eggs are ready for retrieval. To determine when the eggs are ready for collection, your doctor will likely perform: an imaging exam of your ovaries to monitor the development of follicles — fluid-filled ovarian sacs where eggs mature to measure your response to ovarian stimulation medications — estrogen levels typically increase as follicles develop, and progesterone levels remain low until after ovulation Sometimes cycles need to be canceled before egg retrieval for one of these reasons: Too many follicles developing, creating a risk of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome If your cycle is canceled, your doctor might recommend changing medications or their doses to promote a better response during future cycles. Or you may be advised that you need an egg donor. Egg retrieval can be done in your doctor's office or a clinic 34 to 36 hours after the final injection and before ovulation. During egg retrieval, you'll be sedated and given pain medication. Transvaginal ultrasound aspiration is the usual retrieval method. An ultrasound probe is inserted into your vagina to identify follicles. Then a thin needle is inserted into an ultrasound guide to go through the vagina and into the follicles to retrieve the eggs. If your ovaries aren't accessible through transvaginal ultrasound, an abdominal ultrasound may be used to guide the needle. The eggs are removed from the follicles through a needle connected to a suction device. Multiple eggs can be removed in about 20 minutes. After egg retrieval, you may experience cramping and feelings of fullness or pressure. Mature eggs are placed in a nutritive liquid (culture medium) and incubated. Eggs that appear healthy and mature will be mixed with sperm to attempt to create embryos. However, not all eggs may be successfully fertilized. If you're using your partner's sperm, he'll provide a semen sample at your doctor's office or a clinic through masturbation the morning of egg retrieval. Other methods, such as testicular aspiration — the use of a needle or surgical procedure to extract sperm directly from the testicle — are sometimes required. Donor sperm also can be used.

In IVF, mature eggs are retrieved from the ovaries, and these eggs are fertilized by sperms in a lab to form embryos. The embryos are then implanted in the uterus. In vitro fertilization (IVF) is a type of Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART), which is used to treat infertility. In IVF, mature eggs are retrieved from the ovaries, and these eggs are fertilized by sperms in a lab to form embryos. The embryos are then implanted in the uterus. This process roughly takes about two weeks. IVF is the most successful form of ART. It can be done with your and your partner’s eggs and sperms, or by using eggs and sperms from a known or anonymous donor. Sometimes, the embryos are implanted in a surrogate (gestational carrier).The chances of having a healthy baby using IVF depend on your age and the cause of infertility. It is an invasive, expensive, and time-consuming process, with no guarantee of a successful outcome. Sometimes, it might also result in a multiple pregnancy. Talk to your doctor about the possible risks and different methods of You can try less invasive methods like fertility drugs and intrauterine insemination before opting IVF. IVF is the treatment of choice for infertility in women above 40 years of age. It can also be done in the following health conditions: – If your fallopian tubes are blocked or damaged, then it is difficult for the egg to fertilize or for a fertilized egg to move to the uterus. – If you do not ovulate or ovulate less frequently, then only a few eggs will be available to form an embryo. – Endometriosis causes extrauterine growth, which affects the function of the uterus, ovaries, and fallopian tubes. – It is the loss of the normal function of the ovaries before the female reaches 40 years of age. It affects the production of estrogen and ovulation. – Fibroids are benign tumors. can interfere with the implantation of the embryo. – If you have had your fallopian tube removed or blocked to prevent pregnancy previously, but want to conceive now, IVF might be useful. – Sperm abnormalities like low count, reduced mobility, or abnormal shape and size, makes it difficult for the sperm to fertilize the egg. – People who are about to get treatment that might affect their fertility, can have their eggs or sperm harvested and frozen for later use. Before beginning the process, you and your partner need to undergo various screening processes. These tests include ovarian reserve test, semen analysis, screening for infectious diseases, mock embryo transfer, and examination of the uterine cavity. – The number of embryos is usually based on the age and number of eggs collected. As the implantation rate is lower in older patients, more embryos are transferred. So, discuss this with your doctor properly before you start the treatment, as there are changes of a multiple pregnancy. – Extra embryos can be frozen for many years and can be used in future cycles of IVF. This will make the next cycle of IVF less invasive and less expensive. – There are chances that IVF will result in a multiple pregnancy. You should be financially and mentally prepared to manage twins, triplets or higher multiple pregnancy. There are basically five steps involved in IVF, which are Stimulation, Egg retrieval, Fertilization, Embryo culture, Embryo transfer. Trying to Get Pregnant? Infertility Treatments Explained. Pregnancy test had two mildly visible lines, but it is now negative. Please suggest. It is also called superovulation. If you have decided to use your own eggs for the process, then you will be given synthetic hormones to stimulate your ovaries to produce multiple ova (eggs). You will be prescribed various medicines for: – Injectable medication containing follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), or a combination of both. – You will be given human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) to help mature the developing eggs. – You will be prescribed few medicines to prevent your ovaries from releasing the matured egg too soon. – The day when the eggs are collected, the doctor might give progesterone supplements to make the uterus lining more receptive to implantation. During this period, the doctor will perform regular blood tests and ultrasounds to monitor the process of egg maturation and will decide when to retrieve the egg accordingly. It is also called follicular aspiration. It is a surgical procedure that is done under anesthesia, where the doctor with the help of ultrasound, will guide a needle through your vagina into the ovary. This needle will suction eggs and fluid from each egg-containing follicle. Multiple eggs are collected within 20 minutes. The mature eggs are then placed in a culture medium and incubated. It is the process of fertilizing the collected eggs with sperms to form embryos. It can be done using two methods: After receiving the semen sample, the mature eggs and healthy sperm are mixed in a petri dish and incubated overnight. : If insemination fails, then a single healthy sperm is injected into each mature ovum to form an embryo. The fertilized eggs are monitored to ensure development. The embryos might be tested for genetic conditions at this stage. The embryos are transferred back into your uterus after two to six days of egg collection. It usually is a painless procedure and done under mild sedation. The doctor will place the embryo using a catheter.If the process is successful, the embryo or embryos will get implanted in your uterus. This entire process takes about 6 to 10 days. – Multiple pregnancy is considered a high-risk pregnancy, as it carries a higher risk of preterm labor and underweight baby. – The rate of who conceive through IVF is 15 to 25 %. But it increases with maternal age. – When the embryo gets attached outside the uterus, it is called an ectopic pregnancy. The rate of ectopic pregnancy in IVF treated women is 2 to 5 %. ) – Due to the fertility drugs like HCG, the ovaries can become swollen and painful. The symptoms are abdominal pain and bloating, nausea, diarrhea, etc. – During egg retrieval, the needle can cause bleeding, infection, and damage the bowel and bladder. – IVF can be physically, financially, and mentally draining. After the process, you might have the following side effects: Vigorous activities can cause discomfort as the ovaries will be enlarged. You can pass a small amount of clear or bloody fluid. Your breasts might be tender due to high estrogen levels. The success rate of IVF treatment can be either calculated by the number of women who got pregnant, called the pregnancy rate, or the number of women who gave birth to a live baby, called live birth rate. Deciding when and how to undergo IVF treatment again after a failed attempt can be a tough and stressful situation. Talk to your doctor about the various options and the best way for you to conceive.   This is a sponsored Ad. icliniq or icliniq doctors do not endorse the content in the Ad. In vitro fertilization (IVF) is a complex process used to help with fertility. It can also prevent a genetic problem. It aids in the conception of a fetus. The in vitro fertilization process is done in the laboratory by collecting or retrieving mature eggs from ovaries and fertilizing them with sperm. Approximately, more than ten eggs are taken from a female. It should be noted that all the eggs would not be viable for usage in the process of in vitro fertilization. Few reports suggest that two-thirds of the collected eggs have the maturity for the procedure. The in vitro fertilization process consists of five stages: - Stage 1: Medication. A hormonal injection is given to the woman to stimulate and develop healthy eggs. - Stage 2: Harvest the eggs. - Stage 3: Fertilization. - Stage 4: Embryo culture. - Stage 5: Embryo transfer. - Delivery of baby. In several cases, in vitro fertilization injections are not very painful, but the woman can experience a stinging sensation. The needle used in the in vitro fertilization injection is very tiny and does not cause much pain. For mental and emotional stability, you can ask your partner or your friend to stay nearby while the doctor injects the in vitro fertilization drug. Age is an important factor to be considered for the process of in vitro fertilization. Younger couples are known to have high success rates. If a woman trying for in vitro fertilization is below the age of 35, such individuals have a chance of higher fertilization rates. If a woman crosses the age of 40, then the chances gradually decline. Women younger than 35 will get pregnant and have a baby with their first in vitro fertilization egg retrieval and subsequent embryo transfer about half the time. Women who don't get pregnant following the first in vitro fertilization cycle still have excellent chances of getting pregnant on second, third, and even more in vitro fertilization cycles. The process of in vitro fertilization takes about 30 days. In this process, the eggs are retrieved or collected from the women. These eggs are known to be obtained from the female ovaries. Similarly, sperm is collected from the men, and they are fertilized in a laboratory. After successful fertilization, the embryo is transferred to the female uterus. The process is carefully monitored. The preference for this treatment procedure varies with different cultures. According to the CDC reports, nearly one percent of childbirth in the United States of America is known to be achieved by the process of in vitro fertilization. You can help with the process of in vitro fertilization by following a few diets that will enhance the chances of implantation. Having a balanced diet that is rich in fiber content and proteins would help. You should avoid foods that are rich in dietary value. Fishes that have high mercury content should be avoided. Consult a doctor and ask for recommendations regarding the diet plan. What Are the Chances of Getting Pregnant With IVF? The success rate of IVF cycle with women under the age of 35 is 40 percent. However, there is a four percent success rate for women above 42 years of age. Factors to consider the IVF success rate are the woman's pregnancy history and if it was with the same partner. The body type and requirements of each and every individual are different. Your doctor will formulate a treatment plan that is specific to your health condition. But in general, nearly one or two injections are given for one cycle. In some patients, one or two doses are given each day. The various steps involved in the in vitro fertilization process are: - Step 1: Day 1 period. The first official day of the IVF treatment cycle is day 1 of the period. - Step 2: Stimulating the ovaries. - Step 3: Egg retrieval. - Step 4: The sperm collection. - Step 5: Fertilization. - Step 6: Embryo development. - Stage 7: Embryo transfer. - Step 8: The final blood test. In the IVF cycle, mature eggs are retrieved or collected from the ovaries. Retrieved eggs are fertilized with good quality of sperm in a lab. Finally, the fertilized eggs are transferred to the uterus. Nearly three weeks is required to complete one full cycle of in vitro fertilization. Below are the top five tips for preparing your body for your in vitro fertilization cycle: - Stop drinking alcohol, smoking & reduce caffeine usage. - Eat food which enhances fertility. - Look for alternative fertility therapies. - Concentrate on consuming food with high-quality vitamins. - Commit to relaxation techniques. The process of in vitro fertilization will be successful if you adopt a few lifestyle changes three months before the treatment procedure. Few specific changes in dietary patterns and other health tips are necessary to be followed before going for in vitro fertilization. If your health condition is right, then the success rate for in vitro fertilization is higher. The most critical part of in vitro fertilization lies in the initial stages of the treatment procedure. The duration of 24 hours after the embryo has been transformed into the uterus is very crucial. The women require a lot of rest and relaxation during this period. This will help in the successful attachment of the embryo to the wall of the uterus. At first, the women will undergo ovarian reserve testing before starting the procedure of in vitro fertilization. In ovarian reserve testing, it involves collecting the blood samples from the women and testing the FSH (follicle-stimulating hormone). From this test result, the doctor will come to know about the size and the quality of the eggs. Also, the doctor will examine the uterus of women. Comprehensive Medical Second Opinion.

This study aimed to assess the influence of coasting duration on the number and quality of oocytes and fertilization rate in male factor infertile women and those with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). : In this prospective observational follow-up study, 114 patients undergoing coasting (53 women with male factor infertility and 61 women with PCOS) were evaluated at the Royan Institute Research Center, Iran, between 2010 and 2012. The results were analyzed according to the coasting periods of 1–4 days. In normal females, the number of oocytes retrieved was significantly reduced after the second day (0.004). In addition, a statistically significant drop was observed in the number of metaphase II oocytes and fertilization rate after the third day (0.006 and 0.006, respectively). No significant differences were observed in the number and quality of oocytes retrieved and fertilization rate with regard to coasting days in PCOS patients. Coasting with duration of more than three days should be performed with caution in normal females who are at risk of developing ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome. espite major advances in assisted reproductive techniques (ART), there remains a considerable risk of developing life-threatening ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) as a result of supraphysiological stimulation of the ovaries. OHSS has a reported incidence of 1 to 10% of all ART cycles. Several preventive strategies have been introduced to avoid OHSS occurrence or to diminish its severity. Coasting is one of the most popular choices among physicians for the prevention of OHSS. On the other hand, using a gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) antagonist as an alternative method has been suggested as one of the preferred strategies to prevent OHSS in a long protocol. However, there are some restrictions on the use of antagonist, for example in whose have had an inadequate response to the use of antagonists in the past, and the lack of accessibility to the antagonist in some countries. Accordingly, coasting has been advocated as an effective approach to avoid OHSS in polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) patients by several investigators. The principle behind coasting is based on the phenomenon of apoptosis/necrosis. By withholding exogenous gonadotropins, mature follicles will survive for a few days, while the number of smaller follicles will reduce through atresia of granulosa cells during apoptosis. Interestingly, there is insufficient evidence using identical criteria for the application of coasting, and many unknowns also remain regarding management of this treatment. The debate on whether coasting has an effect on ART cycle outcomes, such as the number and quality of oocytes, is still ongoing. However, the literature suggests that coasting does not exert a negative impact on in vitro fertilization (IVF) cycle outcome provided that its duration is not extended. The majority of studies have evaluated the impact of coasting on IVF outcome, but the effect of coasting in patients with different infertility causes has not been previously explored. Therefore, our study was designed to determine the impact of coasting in women at risk of developing OHSS with male factor infertility (normal women) and women with PCOS. In this prospective observational follow-up study, we included 114 patients who showed a predisposition to developing OHSS during controlled ovarian stimulation before IVF/intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) and had undergone coasting at the Royan Institute Research Center, Iran, between June 2010 and December 2012. Approval to conduct this study was obtained from the Institutional Review Board of the Royan Institute Research Center and the Royan Ethics Committee. All patients signed an informed consent authorizing the use of their information. The patients were further subdivided into those with male factor infertility (n = 53) and PCOS (n = 61). The criteria for inclusion in the male infertility group were women with partners who had asthenospermia or who were candidates for percutaneous epididymal sperm aspiration (PESA) and those with 3–4 failed intrauterine insemination (IUI) cycles. Patients using sperm retrieved from testicular sperm aspiration (TESA) procedures and those using frozen sperm were excluded from the study. Women with PCOS who failed to have an adequate response to the antagonist in their previous induction ovulation were included in the study. PCOS was defined by the 2003 Rotterdam consensus criteria. All patients underwent conventional IVF/ICSI treatment with the standard long protocol using a GnRH agonist (Suprefact, Hoechst, Frankfurt, Germany) for pituitary suppression. In addition, a starting dose of 112.5 IU of recombinant human follicle-stimulating hormone (follitropin alfa pen; Gonal-F, Merck Serono S.A., Geneva) was used with or without Menopur (Ferring, Germany) to induce ovulation. Monitoring of cycles was performed by sonography and measurement of estradiol (E2) levels. Coasting started when serum E2 was more than 3000 pg/mL or there were at least 15 follicles with a size of 14–16 mm. During coasting, which was not more than four days, gonadotropin administration was withheld, whereas GnRH agonist was maintained. Furthermore, daily monitoring by sonography and serum E2 measurements was continued until E2 concentrations decreased by 50% of maximum rising. Ovarian puncture was performed 34–36 hours after human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) administration. The coasting duration was determined as the number of days from the last injection of gonadotropin to the hCG-day administration. The fertilization rate was calculated as the number of oocytes with two pronuclei divided by the number of injected oocytes when ICSI was performed and by all intact oocytes retrieved when IVF was performed. The results were analyzed according to the coasting periods for 1–4 days, separately in each group of infertile women with male factor and PCOS. The statistical comparisons were performed using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), Kruskal-Wallis nonparametric analysis of variance and chi-square when appropriate. The results were reported as median (IQR; interquartile range). A -value < 0.050 was considered statistically significant. Data analysis was performed using SPSS Statistics (SPSS Statistics Inc., Chicago, US) version 18.0. In this study, the data of 114 women undergoing coasting were analyzed. Coasting was performed in 53 normal patients and 61 patients with PCOS. The demographic and hormonal levels compared with the duration of coasting by days (1–4) are presented separately in male factor infertile women and women with PCOS [Table 1]. There were no statistically significant differences between different days of coasting with regard to age, body mass index (BMI), and basal hormone levels. When comparing the E2 level at the start of coasting between coasting days, a statistically significant difference was observed in each group of normal women and women with PCOS (0.036 and 0.005, respectively). Comparison of age, BMI, basal hormone levels, and stimulation days of women with male infertility and PCOS according to the number of days coasting. Values given as median (IQR).

PCOS: polycystic ovarian syndrome; BMI: body mass index; FSH: follicle stimulating hormone; LH: luteinizing hormone; TSH: thyroid stimulating hormone; PRL: prolactin; E2: estradiol; hCG: human chorionic gonadotropin. In normal females, the number of oocytes retrieved was significantly reduced after the second day of coasting (0.004). Additionally, a statistically significant drop was observed in the number of metaphase II (MII) oocytes and fertilization rate after the third day (0.006 and 0.006, respectively). On the other hand, in PCOS patients, no statistically significant differences were revealed between different days of coasting regarding the number and quality of oocytes retrieved and fertilization rate [Table 2].

OHSS is a serious complication related to ovulation induction which is sometimes seen in low-risk patients, but it is more likely to occur in high-risk patients. PCOS is a well-known risk factor for OHSS. Despite the widespread use of coasting treatment by physicians, our findings do not provide explicit evidence that coasting is useful in the prevention of OHSS in all patients undergoing controlled ovarian hyperstimulation with any cause of infertility. Many studies have addressed the effect of coasting on controlled ovarian hyperstimulation (COH) cycles. A large body of evidence has advocated coasting as an effective method for preventing OHSS in high-risk groups without compromising pregnancy outcome. In contrast, others have shown a decline in the number of oocytes obtained and oocyte quality in coasted cycles. A recent Cochrane review demonstrated that randomized controlled trials performed for the prevention of OHSS by coasting were not powerful enough to confirm the efficiency of this method. Based on clinician experience, E2 levels for initiation of coasting is varied. A retrospective analysis of 608 patients demonstrated that the initial level of E2 to start coasting might have an impact on oocyte quality. Furthermore, a recent review study emphasized that coasting should be initiated with a serum E2 level greater than 3000 pg/mL. Our study revealed that coasting treatment and success varies with cause of infertility. Accordingly, in normal females, coasting with duration of more than two days is likely to exert an adverse effect on the number of oocytes, and coasting for more than three days negatively affects oocyte quality and fertilization rate. However, in contrast, coasting can be safely applied to infertile PCOS women in light of OHSS potential risks without compromising the outcome. Many investigators have used different criteria to specify the time of starting and ending of coasting and they have reported different results for the effect of coasting period on the prevention of OHSS and reproductive outcomes. Some authors believe that too short a period of coasting may not be effective in preventing OHSS, whereas too long a period may have a less satisfactory outcome in terms of oocyte quality and endometrial receptivity. Despite the debate over the coasting effect, there has almost been an agreement among studies that oocyte quality and pregnancy outcome are adversely affected after four days of coasting. The observed differences between our study and previous studies could be due to our patient selection according to the cause of infertility. In general, physiological mechanisms are probably involved in the adverse effects of coasting on outcome of treatment cycle in normal women compared to women with PCOS. This, in turn, may indicate that PCOS patients show less sensitivity to the manipulation occurring during coasting. This may be explained by the critical role of luteinizing hormone (LH) in the final stages of follicular maturation. The LH receptors of the follicles decrease following the coasting process, and this reduction is expected to be severe with longer coasting periods. Consequently, these follicles with a low number of functional LH receptors have a poor response to exogenous hCG, and so, final maturation will not be obtained. On the other hand, granulosa cells from polycystic ovaries contain higher number of LH receptors compared with normal granulosa cells. Accordingly, despite the loss of receptors following coasting, in women with PCOS there are relatively adequate receptors for supporting final maturation, whereas in normal women these endocrine changes are not tolerable by follicles. As our study showed, in women with male factor infertility, there was a decreasing trend in the number of oocytes obtained, and oocyte quality and fertilization rate with regard to the coasting days (even with periods less than four days). Our results indicate that before making important treatment decisions in infertile patients at risk of developing OHSS, the impact of an infertility diagnosis should be considered. Accordingly, coasting for more than three days should be performed with caution in normal women who are at risk of developing OHSS. In this respect, an attempt to determine a recommended protocol for normal women, coasting for one or two days combined with another preventive method appears to be the most desirable option for avoiding OHSS. Obviously, the lack of research in this area and the potentially sensitive nature of OHSS makes it difficult to draw definite conclusions and further studies with a larger population is suggested. The authors declared no conflicts of interest. No funding was received for this study. The authors wish to express their gratitude to the Royan Institute and its staff.

Illustrated schematic of IVF with single-sperm injection () () is a process of where an is combined with outside the body, (""in glass""). The process involves monitoring and stimulating a woman's , removing an ovum or ova (egg or eggs) from the woman's and letting sperm fertilise them in a liquid in a laboratory. After the fertilised egg () undergoes for 2–6 days, it is implanted in the same or another woman's , with the intention of establishing a successful . IVF is a type of used for treatment and . A fertilised egg may be implanted into a surrogate's uterus, and the resulting child is genetically unrelated to the surrogate. Some countries have banned or otherwise regulate the availability of IVF treatment, giving rise to . Restrictions on the availability of IVF include costs and age, in order for a woman to carry a healthy pregnancy to term. IVF is generally not used until less invasive or expensive options have failed or been determined unlikely to work. In July 1978, was the first child successfully born after her mother received IVF treatment. Brown was born as a result of natural-cycle IVF, where no stimulation was made. The procedure took place at Dr Kershaw's Cottage Hospital (now Dr Kershaw's Hospice) in , Oldham, England. was awarded the in 2010. The physiologist co-developed the treatment together with and embryologist but the latter two were not eligible for consideration as they had died and the Nobel Prize is not awarded posthumously. With and IVF, women who are past their reproductive years, have infertile male partners, have idiopathic female-fertility issues, or have reached can still become pregnant. After the IVF treatment, some couples get pregnant without any fertility treatments. In 2018, it was estimated that eight million children had been born worldwide using IVF and other assisted reproduction techniques. However, a recent study that explores 10 adjuncts with IVF (screening hysteroscopy, DHEA, testosterone, GH, aspirin, heparin, antioxidants in males and females, seminal plasma, and PRP) suggests that until more evidence is done to show that these adjuncts are safe and effective, they should be avoided. The Latin term , meaning ""in glass"", is used because early biological experiments involving cultivation of tissues outside the living organism were carried out in glass containers, such as beakers, test tubes, or Petri dishes. Today, the scientific term ""in vitro"" is used to refer to any biological procedure that is performed outside the organism in which it would normally have occurred, to distinguish it from an procedure (such as ), where the tissue remains inside the living organism in which it is normally found. A colloquial term for babies conceived as the result of IVF, ""test tube babies"", refers to the tube-shaped containers of glass or plastic resin, called , that are commonly used in chemistry and biology labs. However, IVF is usually performed in , which are both wider and shallower and often used to cultivate cultures. In a broader sense, IVF is a form of (ART). IVF may be used to overcome when it is due to problems with the , making in vivo fertilisation difficult. It can also assist in , in those cases where there is a defect in ; in such situations (ICSI) may be used, where a sperm cell is injected directly into the egg cell. This is used when sperm has difficulty penetrating the egg. In these cases the partner's or a donor's sperm may be used. ICSI is also used when sperm numbers are very low. When indicated, the use of ICSI has been found to increase the success rates of IVF. According to UK's guidelines, IVF treatment is appropriate in cases of unexplained infertility for women who have not conceived after 2 years of regular unprotected sexual intercourse. In women with , it may be an alternative after 7–12 attempted cycles of , since the latter is expensive and more easy to control. IVF success rates are the percentage of all IVF procedures that result in a favourable outcome. Depending on the type of calculation used, this outcome may represent the number of confirmed pregnancies, called the , or the number of live births, called the . The success rate depends on variable factors such as maternal age, cause of infertility, embryo status, reproductive history, and lifestyle factors. Maternal age: Younger candidates of IVF are more likely to get pregnant. Women older than 41 are more likely to get pregnant with a donor egg. Reproductive history: Women who have been previously pregnant are in many cases more successful with IVF treatments than those who have never been pregnant. Due to advances in reproductive technology, live birth rates by cycle five of IVF have increased from 76% in 2005 to 80% in 2010 despite a reduction in the number of embryos being transferred (which decreased the multiple birth rate from 25% to 8%). The live birth rate is the percentage of all IVF cycles that lead to a live birth. This rate does not include or ; multiple-order births, such as twins and triplets, are counted as one pregnancy. A 2017 summary compiled by the Society for Assisted Reproductive Technology (SART) which reports the average IVF success rates in the United States per age group using non-donor eggs compiled the following data: In 2006, Canadian clinics reported a live birth rate of 27%. Birth rates in younger patients were slightly higher, with a success rate of 35.3% for those 21 and younger, the youngest group evaluated. Success rates for older patients were also lower and decrease with age, with 37-year-olds at 27.4% and no live births for those older than 48, the oldest group evaluated. Some clinics exceeded these rates, but it is impossible to determine if that is due to superior technique or patient selection, since it is possible to artificially increase success rates by refusing to accept the most difficult patients or by steering them into oocyte donation cycles (which are compiled separately). Further, pregnancy rates can be increased by the placement of several embryos at the risk of increasing the chance for multiples. The live birth rates using donor eggs are also given by the SART and include all age groups using either fresh or thawed eggs: Because not each IVF cycle that is started will lead to oocyte retrieval or embryo transfer, reports of live birth rates need to specify the denominator, namely IVF cycles started, IVF retrievals, or embryo transfers. The SART summarised 2008–9 success rates for US clinics for fresh embryo cycles that did not involve donor eggs and gave live birth rates by the age of the prospective mother, with a peak at 41.3% per cycle started and 47.3% per embryo transfer for patients under 35 years of age. IVF attempts in multiple cycles result in increased cumulative live birth rates. Depending on the demographic group, one study reported 45% to 53% for three attempts, and 51% to 71% to 80% for six attempts. Pregnancy rate may be defined in various ways. In the United States, the pregnancy rate used by the SART and the (and appearing in the table in the Success Rates section above) are based on fetal heart motion observed in ultrasound examinations. The 2017 summary compiled by the SART the following data for the United States: In 2006, Canadian clinics reported an average pregnancy rate of 35%. A French study estimated that 66% of patients starting IVF treatment finally succeed in having a child (40% during the IVF treatment at the centre and 26% after IVF discontinuation). Achievement of having a child after IVF discontinuation was mainly due to (46%) or (42%). According to a study done by the miscarriage rates for IVF are somewhere between 15 and 25%. The main potential factors that influence pregnancy (and live birth) rates in IVF have been suggested to be , duration of infertility or subfertility, and number of oocytes, all reflecting . Optimal woman's age is 23–39 years at time of treatment. A is associated with better IVF outcomes. that affect the pregnancy chances of IVF include: , with higher count giving higher success rates. levels, with higher levels indicating higher chances of pregnancy, as well as of live birth after IVF, even after adjusting for age. Level of as measured, e.g. by , and . Women with ovary-specific genotypes including have significantly decreased pregnancy chances in IVF. elevation on the day of is associated with lower pregnancy rates in IVF cycles in women undergoing ovarian stimulation using GnRH analogues and gonadotrophins. At this time, compared to a progesterone level below 0.8 ng/ml, a level between 0.8 and 1.1 ng/ml confers an of pregnancy of approximately 0.8, and a level between 1.2 and 3.0 ng/ml confers an odds ratio of pregnancy of between 0.6 and 0.7. On the other hand, progesterone elevation does not seem to confer a decreased chance of pregnancy in frozen–thawed cycles and cycles with egg donation. Characteristics of cells from the and the , which are easily aspirated during . These cells are closely associated with the oocyte and share the same microenvironment, and the rate of expression of certain genes in such cells are associated with higher or lower pregnancy rate. An endometrial thickness (EMT) of less than 7 mm decreases the pregnancy rate by an odds ratio of approximately 0.4 compared to an EMT of over 7 mm. However, such low thickness rarely occurs, and any routine use of this parameter is regarded as not justified. As the maternal age increases, the likelihood of conception decreases and the chance of miscarriage increases. With increasing paternal age, especially 50 years and older, the rate of formation decreases. reduces the chances of IVF producing a live birth by 34% and increases the risk of an IVF pregnancy miscarrying by 30%. A (BMI) over 27 causes a 33% decrease in likelihood to have a live birth after the first cycle of IVF, compared to those with a BMI between 20 and 27. Also, pregnant women who are obese have higher rates of , , , and problems during , as well as leading to an increased risk of fetal . Ideal body mass index is 19–30. or tubal occlusion before IVF treatment increases chances for women with . Success with previous pregnancy and/or live birth increases chances Low alcohol/caffeine intake increases success rate The number of embryos transferred in the treatment cycle Some studies also suggest that may also play a role in decreasing IVF success rates by interfering with proper implantation of the embryo after transfer. Aspirin is sometimes prescribed to women for the purpose of increasing the chances of conception by IVF, but as of 2016 there was no evidence to show that it is safe and effective. A 2013 and of of as an in IVF found no overall benefit, and concluded that an apparent benefit detected in a subset of published trials where the control group (those not using acupuncture) experienced a lower than average rate of pregnancy requires further study, due to the possibility of and other factors. A came to the result that endometrial injury performed in the month prior to ovarian induction appeared to increase both the live birth rate and clinical pregnancy rate in IVF compared with no endometrial injury. There was no evidence of a difference between the groups in miscarriage, multiple pregnancy or bleeding rates. Evidence suggested that endometrial injury on the day of oocyte retrieval was associated with a lower live birth or ongoing pregnancy rate. For women, intake of (such as , , , , , , , or ) has not been associated with a significantly increased or clinical in IVF according to . The review found that oral antioxidants given to men in couples with male factor or unexplained subfertility may improve live birth rates, but more evidence is needed. A in 2015 came to the result that there is no evidence identified regarding the effect of preconception lifestyle advice on the chance of a live birth outcome. The major complication of IVF is the risk of . This is directly related to the practice of transferring multiple embryos at embryo transfer. Multiple births are related to increased risk of pregnancy loss, , , and neonatal morbidity with the potential for long term damage. Strict limits on the number of embryos that may be transferred have been enacted in some countries (e.g. Britain, Belgium) to reduce the risk of high-order multiples (triplets or more), but are not universally followed or accepted. Spontaneous splitting of embryos in the womb after transfer can occur, but this is rare and would lead to identical twins. A double blind, randomised study followed IVF pregnancies that resulted in 73 infants (33 boys and 40 girls) and reported that 8.7% of singleton infants and 54.2% of twins had a birth weight of less than 2,500 grams (5.5 lb). Certain kinds of IVF, in particular (first applied in 1991) and (first applied in 1984) have been shown to lead to distortions in the at birth. ICSI leads to slightly more female births (51.3% female) while blastocyst transfer leads to significantly more boys (56.1% male) being born. Standard IVF done at the second or third day leads to a normal sex ratio. Epigenetic modifications caused by extended culture leading to the death of more female embryos has been theorised as the reason why blastocyst transfer leads to a higher male sex ratio, however adding retinoic acid to the culture can bring this ratio back to normal. By , the risk that a chronic disease in the male providing the sperm would infect the female or offspring can be brought to negligible levels. In males with , The Practice Committee of the American Society for Reproductive Medicine advises that sperm washing is not necessary in IVF to prevent transmission, unless the female partner has not been effectively vaccinated. In females with hepatitis B, the risk of during IVF is no different from the risk in spontaneous conception. However, there is not enough evidence to say that procedures are safe in females with hepatitis B in regard to vertical transmission to the offspring. Regarding potential spread of , Japan's government prohibited the use of IVF procedures for couples in which both partners are infected with HIV. Despite the fact that the ethics committees previously allowed the Hospital, located in Tokyo, to use IVF for couples with HIV, the of Japan decided to block the practice. Hideji Hanabusa, the vice president of the Ogikubo Hospital, states that together with his colleagues, he managed to develop a method through which scientists are able to remove HIV from sperm. A risk of ovarian stimulation is the development of , particularly if hCG is used for . This results in swollen, painful ovaries. It occurs in 30% of patients. Mild cases can be treated with over the counter medications and cases can be resolved in the absence of pregnancy. In moderate cases, ovaries swell and fluid accumulated in the abdominal cavities and may have symptoms of heartburn, gas, nausea or loss of appetite. In severe cases patients have sudden excess abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting and will result in hospitalisation. During egg retrieval, there exists a small chance of bleeding, infection, and damage to surrounding structures such as bowel and bladder (transvaginal ultrasound aspiration) as well as difficulty in breathing, chest infection, allergic reactions to medication, or nerve damage (laparoscopy). may also occur if a fertilised egg develops outside the uterus, usually in the fallopian tubes and requires immediate destruction of the fetus. IVF does not seem to be associated with an elevated risk of , nor with or when neutralising the of infertility itself. Nor does it seem to impart any increased risk for . Regardless of pregnancy result, IVF treatment is usually stressful for patients. and the use of coping strategies are associated with a higher degree of distress, while the presence of social support has a relieving effect. A negative pregnancy test after IVF is associated with an increased risk for in women, but not with any increased risk of developing . Pregnancy test results do not seem to be a risk factor for depression or anxiety among men. Studies show that there is an increased risk of or during the first trimester of IVF. When looking at long-term studies comparing women who received or did not receive IVF, there seems to be no correlation with increased risk of cardiac events. There are more ongoing studies to solidify this. has occurred after successful and unsuccessful IVF treatments. Within 2 years of delivering an infant conceived through IVF, subfertile couples had a conception rate of 18%. A review in 2013 came to the result that infants resulting from IVF (with or without ICSI) have a of birth defects of 1.32 (95% 1.24–1.42) compared to naturally conceived infants. In 2008, an analysis of the data of the National Birth Defects Study in the US found that certain birth defects were significantly more common in infants conceived through IVF, notably , with or without , , and ; the mechanism of causality is unclear. However, in a population-wide cohort study of 308,974 births (with 6,163 using assisted reproductive technology and following children from birth to age five) researchers found: ""The increased risk of birth defects associated with IVF was no longer significant after adjustment for parental factors."" Parental factors included known independent risks for birth defects such as maternal age, smoking status, etc. Multivariate correction did not remove the significance of the association of birth defects and ICSI (corrected odds ratio 1.57), although the authors speculate that underlying male infertility factors (which would be associated with the use of ICSI) may contribute to this observation and were not able to correct for these confounders. The authors also found that a history of infertility elevated risk itself in the absence of any treatment (odds ratio 1.29), consistent with a Danish national registry study and ""implicates patient factors in this increased risk."" The authors of the Danish national registry study speculate: ""our results suggest that the reported increased prevalence of congenital malformations seen in singletons born after assisted reproductive technology is partly due to the underlying infertility or its determinants."" Risk in singleton pregnancies resulting from IVF (with or without ) If the underlying infertility is related to abnormalities in , it is plausible, but too early to examine that male offspring are at higher risk for sperm abnormalities. IVF does not seem to confer any risks regarding cognitive development, school performance, social functioning, and behaviour. Also, IVF infants are known to be as securely attached to their parents as those who were naturally conceived, and IVF adolescents are as well-adjusted as those who have been naturally conceived. Limited long-term follow-up data suggest that IVF may be associated with an increased incidence of , , increase in total composition, advancement of , subclinical , early adulthood and in the offspring. It is not known, however, whether these potential associations are caused by the IVF procedure in itself, by adverse obstetric outcomes associated with IVF, by the genetic origin of the children or by yet unknown IVF-associated causes. Increases in embryo manipulation during IVF result in more deviant fetal growth curves, but birth weight does not seem to be a reliable marker of fetal stress. IVF, including , is associated with an increased risk of (including and ), with an of 3.7 (95% 1.4 to 9.7). An IVF-associated incidence of and are believed to be related to the of prematurity and low birthweight. Similarly, an IVF-associated incidence of and are believed to be related to confounders of maternal and obstetric factors. Overall, IVF does not cause an increased risk of . Studies have shown a decrease in the risk of certain cancers and an increased risks of certain others including , and . A depiction of the procedure of in-vitro fertilisation. This section .

(Learn how and when to remove this template message) Theoretically, IVF could be performed by collecting the contents from a woman's fallopian tubes or uterus after natural ovulation, mixing it with , and reinserting the fertilised ova into the uterus. However, without additional techniques, the chances of pregnancy would be extremely small. The additional techniques that are routinely used in IVF include to generate multiple eggs, ultrasound-guided directly from the ovaries, co-incubation of eggs and sperm, as well as culture and selection of resultant embryos before into a uterus. Ovarian hyperstimulation is the stimulation to induce development of multiple follicles of the ovaries. It should start with response prediction by e.g. age, and level of . The resulting prediction of e.g. poor or hyper-response to ovarian hyperstimulation determines the protocol and dosage for ovarian hyperstimulation. Ovarian hyperstimulation also includes suppression of spontaneous ovulation, for which two main methods are available: Using a (usually longer) protocol or a (usually shorter) protocol. In a standard long GnRH agonist protocol the day when hyperstimulation treatment is started and the expected day of later oocyte retrieval can be chosen to conform to personal choice, while in a GnRH antagonist protocol it must be adapted to the spontaneous onset of the previous menstruation. On the other hand, the GnRH antagonist protocol has a lower risk of (OHSS), which is a life-threatening complication. For the ovarian hyperstimulation in itself, injectable (usually analogues) are generally used under close monitoring. Such monitoring frequently checks the level and, by means of , follicular growth. Typically approximately 10 days of injections will be necessary. Main article: There are several methods termed : IVF using no drugs for , while drugs for may still be used. IVF using ovarian hyperstimulation, including gonadotropins, but with a protocol so that the cycle initiates from natural mechanisms. ; IVF using , followed by , followed by in a later, natural, cycle. IVF using no drugs for ovarian hyperstimulation was the method for the conception of . This method can be successfully used when women want to avoid taking ovarian stimulating drugs with its associated side-effects. has estimated the to be approximately 1.3% per IVF cycle using no hyperstimulation drugs for women aged between 40 and 42. Mild IVF is a method where a small dose of ovarian stimulating drugs are used for a short duration during a woman's natural cycle aimed at producing 2–7 eggs and creating healthy embryos. This method appears to be an advance in the field to reduce complications and side-effects for women and it is aimed at quality, and not quantity of eggs and embryos. One study comparing a mild treatment (mild ovarian stimulation with GnRH antagonist co-treatment combined with ) to a standard treatment (stimulation with a long-protocol and transfer of two embryos) came to the result that the proportions of cumulative pregnancies that resulted in term after 1 year were 43.4% with mild treatment and 44.7% with standard treatment. Mild IVF can be cheaper than conventional IVF and with a significantly reduced risk of and . When the ovarian follicles have reached a certain degree of development, is performed, generally by an injection of (hCG). Commonly, this is known as the ""trigger shot."" hCG acts as an analogue of , and ovulation would occur between 38 and 40 hours after a single HCG injection, but the egg retrieval is performed at a time usually between 34 and 36 hours after hCG injection, that is, just prior to when the follicles would rupture. This avails for scheduling the egg retrieval procedure at a time where the eggs are fully mature. HCG injection confers a risk of . Using a instead of hCG eliminates most of the risk of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome, but with a reduced delivery rate if the embryos are transferred fresh. For this reason, many centers will freeze all oocytes or embryos following agonist trigger. Further information: The eggs are retrieved from the patient using a transvaginal technique called , involving an ultrasound-guided needle piercing the vaginal wall to reach the ovaries. Through this needle follicles can be aspirated, and the follicular fluid is passed to an embryologist to identify ova. It is common to remove between ten and thirty eggs. The retrieval procedure usually takes between 20 and 40 minutes, depending on the number of mature follicles, and is usually done under or . In the laboratory, for ICSI treatments, the identified eggs are stripped of surrounding cells (also known as ) and prepared for . An may be performed prior to fertilisation to select eggs that can be fertilized, as it is required they are in metaphase II. There are cases in which if oocytes are in the metaphase I stage, they can be kept being cultured so as to undergo a posterior sperm injection. In the meantime, is prepared for fertilisation by removing inactive cells and seminal fluid in a process called . If semen is being provided by a , it will usually have been prepared for treatment before being frozen and quarantined, and it will be thawed ready for use. The sperm and the egg are incubated together at a ratio of about 75,000:1 in a in order for the actual to take place. A review in 2013 came to the result that a duration of this co-incubation of about 1 to 4 hours results in significantly higher than 16 to 24 hours. In most cases, the egg will be fertilised during co-incubation and will show two . In certain situations, such as low sperm count or motility, a single sperm may be injected directly into the egg using (ICSI). The fertilised egg is passed to a special growth medium and left for about 48 hours until the egg consists of six to eight cells. In , eggs are removed from the woman and placed in one of the fallopian tubes, along with the man's sperm. This allows fertilisation to take place inside the woman's body. Therefore, this variation is actually an in vivo fertilisation, not in vitro. The main durations of embryo culture are until (day two to four after ) or the stage (day five or six after ). Embryo culture until the blastocyst stage confers a significant increase in per , but also confers a decreased number of embryos available for transfer and , so the cumulative clinical pregnancy rates are increased with cleavage stage transfer. Transfer day two instead of day three after fertilisation has no differences in . There are significantly higher odds of ( 1.3) and ( 1.3) among births having from embryos cultured until the blastocyst stage compared with cleavage stage. Laboratories have developed grading methods to judge ovocyte and quality. In order to optimise , there is significant evidence that a morphological scoring system is the best strategy for the selection of embryos. Since 2009 where the first system for IVF was approved for clinical use, morphokinetic scoring systems has shown to improve to further. However, when all different types of devices, with or without morphokinetic scoring systems, are compared against conventional embryo assessment for IVF, there is insufficient evidence of a difference in live-birth, pregnancy, stillbirth or miscarriage to choose between them. Active efforts to develop a more accurate embryo selection analysis based on Artificial Intelligence and Deep Learning are underway. Embryo Ranking Intelligent Classification Assistant (ERICA), is a clear example. This Deep Learning software substitutes manual classifications with a ranking system based on an individual embryo's predicted genetic status in a non-invasive fashion. Studies on this area are still pending and current feasibility studies support its potential. The number to be transferred depends on the number available, the age of the woman and other health and diagnostic factors. In countries such as Canada, the UK, Australia and New Zealand, a maximum of two embryos are transferred except in unusual circumstances. In the UK and according to regulations, a woman over 40 may have up to three embryos transferred, whereas in the US, there is no legal limit on the number of embryos which may be transferred, although medical associations have provided practice guidelines. Most clinics and country regulatory bodies seek to minimise the risk of multiple pregnancy, as it is not uncommon for multiple embryos to implant if multiple embryos are transferred. Embryos are transferred to the patient's uterus through a thin, plastic , which goes through her and cervix. Several embryos may be passed into the uterus to improve chances of and pregnancy. is the administration of medication, generally , , hCG, or , and often accompanied by estradiol, to increase the success rate of and early , thereby complementing and/or supporting the function of the . A Cochrane review found that hCG or progesterone given during the luteal phase may be associated with higher rates of or ongoing pregnancy, but that the evidence is not conclusive. Co-treatment with appears to improve outcomes, by a live birth rate of +16% (95% +10 to +22%). On the other hand, or as adjunctive medication in IVF have no evidence of overall benefit. There are various expansions or additional techniques that can be applied in IVF, which are usually not necessary for the IVF procedure itself, but would be virtually impossible or technically difficult to perform without concomitantly performing methods of IVF. (PGS) or preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) has been suggested to be able to be used in IVF to select an embryo that appears to have the greatest chances for successful pregnancy. However, a systematic review and meta-analysis of existing came to the result that there is no evidence of a beneficial effect of PGS with cleavage-stage biopsy as measured by . On the contrary, for women of , PGS with cleavage-stage biopsy significantly lowers the live birth rate. Technical drawbacks, such as the invasiveness of the biopsy, and non-representative samples because of are the major underlying factors for inefficacy of PGS. Still, as an expansion of IVF, patients who can benefit from PGS/PGD include: Couples who have a family history of inherited disease Couples who want . This can be used to diagnose with . It can potentially be used for , wherein a fetus is aborted if having an undesired sex. Couples who already have a child with an incurable disease and need compatible cells from a second healthy child to cure the first, resulting in a """" that matches the sick child in . PGS screens for numeral chromosomal abnormalities while PGD diagnosis the specific molecular defect of the inherited disease. In both PGS and PGD, individual cells from a pre-embryo, or preferably trophectoderm cells biopsied from a , are analysed during the IVF process. Before the transfer of a pre-embryo back to a woman's uterus, one or two cells are removed from the pre-embryos (8-cell stage), or preferably from a . These cells are then evaluated for normality. Typically within one to two days, following completion of the evaluation, only the normal pre-embryos are transferred back to the woman's uterus. Alternatively, a blastocyst can be cryopreserved via vitrification and transferred at a later date to the uterus. In addition, PGS can significantly reduce the risk of multiple pregnancies because fewer embryos, ideally just one, are needed for implantation. Main articles: and can be performed as before fertilisation, or as after fertilisation. The Rand Consulting Group has estimated there to be 400,000 frozen embryos in the United States in 2006. The advantage is that patients who fail to conceive may become pregnant using such embryos without having to go through a full IVF cycle. Or, if pregnancy occurred, they could return later for another pregnancy. Spare oocytes or embryos resulting from fertility treatments may be used for or to another woman or couple, and embryos may be created, frozen and stored specifically for transfer and donation by using donor eggs and sperm. Also, oocyte cryopreservation can be used for women who are likely to lose their ovarian reserve due to undergoing . By 2017, many centers have adopted embryo cryopreservation as their primary IVF therapy, and perform few or no fresh embryo transfers. The two main reasons for this have been better endometrial receptivity when embryos are transferred in cycles without exposure to ovarian stimulation and also the ability to store the embryos while awaiting the results of pre-implantation genetic testing. The outcome from using cryopreserved embryos has uniformly been positive with no increase in birth defects or development abnormalities. (ICSI) is where a single is injected directly into an . Its main usage as an expansion of IVF is to overcome male infertility problems, although it may also be used where eggs cannot easily be penetrated by sperm, and occasionally in conjunction with . It can be used in , since once the egg is fertilised abnormal sperm morphology does not appear to influence development or blastocyst morphology. Additional methods of . For example, methods are emerging in making comprehensive analyses of up to entire , , and which may be used to score embryos by comparing the patterns with ones that have previously been found among embryos in successful versus unsuccessful pregnancies. (AZH) can be performed shortly before the embryo is transferred to the uterus. A small opening is made in the outer layer surrounding the egg in order to help the embryo hatch out and aid in the implantation process of the growing embryo. In and , the resultant embryo after fertilisation is inserted in another woman than the one providing the eggs. These are resources for women with no eggs due to surgery, chemotherapy, or genetic causes; or with poor egg quality, previously unsuccessful IVF cycles or . In the egg donor process, eggs are retrieved from a donor's ovaries, fertilised in the laboratory with the sperm from the recipient's partner, and the resulting healthy embryos are returned to the recipient's uterus. In , the oocytes with optimal chances of can be chosen. It can also be used as a means of . can be used for twinning to increase the number of available embryos. is where the from a donor egg is injected into an egg with compromised . The resulting egg is then with and in a , usually that of the woman who provided the recipient egg and . Cytoplasmic transfer was created to aid women who experience infertility due to deficient or damaged , contained within an egg's . Further information: and There may be leftover embryos or eggs from IVF procedures if the woman for whom they were originally created has successfully carried one or more pregnancies to term. With the woman's or couple's permission, these may be donated to help other women or couples as a means of . In , these extra embryos are given to other couples or women for with the goal of producing a successful pregnancy. The resulting child is considered the child of the woman who carries it and gives birth, and not the child of the donor, the same as occurs with or . Typically, genetic parents donate the eggs to a or where they are preserved by or until a carrier is found for them. Typically the process of matching the embryo(s) with the prospective parents is conducted by the agency itself, at which time the clinic transfers ownership of the embryos to the prospective parents. In the United States, women seeking to be an embryo recipient undergo infectious disease screening required by the (FDA), and reproductive tests to determine the best placement location and cycle timing before the actual Embryo Transfer occurs. The amount of screening the embryo has already undergone is largely dependent on the genetic parents' own IVF clinic and process. The embryo recipient may elect to have her own conduct further testing. Alternatives to donating unused embryos are destroying them (or having them implanted at a time where pregnancy is very unlikely), keeping them frozen indefinitely, or donating them for use in research (which results in their unviability). Individual moral views on disposing leftover embryos may depend on personal views on the and definition and/or value of and on the value that is given to fundamental research questions. Some people believe donation of leftover embryos for research is a good alternative to discarding the embryos when patients receive proper, honest and clear information about the research project, the procedures and the scientific values. The first successful birth of a child after IVF treatment, , occurred in 1978. Louise Brown was born as a result of natural cycle IVF where no stimulation was made. The procedure took place at Dr Kershaw's Cottage Hospital (now Dr Kershaw's Hospice) in , Oldham, England. was awarded the in 2010, the physiologist who co-developed the treatment together with and embryologist ; Steptoe and Purdy were not eligible for consideration as the Nobel Prize is not awarded posthumously. The second successful birth of a test tube baby occurred in just 67 days after Louise Brown was born. The girl, named Durga conceived in vitro using a method developed independently by Dr. , a physician and researcher from , India. With and IVF, women who are past their reproductive years, have infertile male partners, have idiopathic female-fertility issues, or have reached can still become pregnant. held the record as the oldest woman to give birth using IVF and a donor egg, when she gave birth in 2004 at the age of 66, a record passed in 2006. After the IVF treatment some couples are able to get pregnant without any fertility treatments. In 2018 it was estimated that eight million children had been born worldwide using IVF and other assisted reproduction techniques. In some cases, laboratory mix-ups (misidentified gametes, transfer of wrong embryos) have occurred, leading to legal action against the IVF provider and complex paternity suits. An example is the case of a woman in California who received the embryo of another couple and was notified of this mistake after the birth of her son. This has led to many authorities and individual clinics implementing procedures to minimise the risk of such mix-ups. The , for example, requires clinics to use a double witnessing system, the identity of specimens is checked by two people at each point at which specimens are transferred. Alternatively, technological solutions are gaining favour, to reduce the manpower cost of manual double witnessing, and to further reduce risks with uniquely numbered tags which can be identified by readers connected to a computer. The computer tracks specimens throughout the process and alerts the embryologist if non-matching specimens are identified. Although the use of RFID tracking has expanded in the US, it is still not widely adopted. While PGD was originally designed to screen for embryos carrying hereditary genetic diseases, the method has been applied to select features that are unrelated to diseases, thus raising ethical questions. Examples of such cases include the selection of embryos based on (HLA) for the donation of tissues to a sick family member, the diagnosis of genetic susceptibility to disease, and . These examples raise ethical issues because of the morality of . It becomes frowned upon because of the advantage of being able to eliminate unwanted traits and selecting desired traits. By using PGD, individuals are given the opportunity to create a human life unethically and rely on science and not by . For example, a deaf British couple, Tom and Paula Lichy, have petitioned to create a deaf baby using IVF. Some have been very critical of this approach. wrote that ""intentionally culling out blind or deaf embryos might prevent considerable future suffering, while a policy that allowed deaf or blind parents to select such traits intentionally would be far more troublesome."" In 2008, a California physician transferred 12 embryos to a woman who gave birth to octuplets (). This led to accusations that a doctor is willing to endanger the health and even life of women in order to gain money. Robert Winston, professor of fertility studies at Imperial College London, had called the industry ""corrupt"" and ""greedy"" stating that ""one of the major problems facing us in healthcare is that IVF has become a massive commercial industry,"" and that ""what has happened, of course, is that money is corrupting this whole technology"", and accused authorities of failing to protect couples from exploitation: ""The regulatory authority has done a consistently bad job. It's not prevented the exploitation of women, it's not put out very good information to couples, it's not limited the number of unscientific treatments people have access to"". The IVF industry has been described as a market-driven construction of health, medicine and the human body. In the US, the provides innovators with a temporary monopoly over their respective work. As a result, IVF is prohibitively expensive for patients as providers have to also cover the costs of patents. For example, has patented a process used to calculate the probability of gene inheritance. The industry has been accused of making unscientific claims, and distorting facts relating to infertility, in particular through widely exaggerated claims about how common infertility is in society, in an attempt to get as many couples as possible and as soon as possible to try treatments (rather than trying to conceive naturally for a longer time). This risks removing infertility from its social context and reducing the experience to a simple biological malfunction, which not only be treated through bio-medical procedures, but should be treated by them. Indeed, there are serious concerns about the overuse of treatments, for instance Dr Sami David, a fertility specialist, has expressed disappointment over the current state of the industry, and said many procedures are unnecessary; he said: ""It's being the first choice of treatment rather than the last choice. When it was first opening up in late 1970s, early 80s, it was meant to be the last resort. Now it's a first resort. I think that it can harm women in the long run."" IVF thus raises ethical issues concerning the abuse of bio-medical facts to 'sell' corrective procedures and treatments for conditions that deviate from a constructed ideal of the 'healthy' or 'normal' body i.e., fertile females and males with reproductive systems capable of co-producing offspring. All pregnancies can be risky, but there are greater risk for women who are older and are over the age of 40. The older the women the riskier the pregnancy. As women get older, they are more likely to suffer from conditions such as gestational diabetes and pre-eclampsia. If older women do conceive over the age of 40, their offspring may be of lower birth weight, and more likely to requires intensive care. Because of this, the increased risk is a sufficient cause for concern. The high incidence of caesarean in older mothers is commonly regarded as a risk. Though there are some risk with older women pregnancies, there are some benefits associated with caesareans. A study has shown that births over 40 have a lower rate of birth trauma due to increased delivery by caesarean. Though caesarean is seen to benefit mothers over 40, there are still many risk factors to consider. Caesarean section may be a risk in the same way that gestational diabetes is. Women conceiving at 40 have a greater risk of gestational hypertension and premature birth. The offspring is at risk when being born from older mothers, and the risks associated with being conceived through IVF. held the record for a while as the oldest woman to give birth using IVF and a donor egg, when she gave birth in 2004 at the age of 66. In September 2019, a 74-year-old woman became the oldest-ever to give birth after she delivered twins at a hospital in , . Although menopause is a natural barrier to further conception, IVF has allowed women to be pregnant in their fifties and sixties. Women whose uteruses have been appropriately prepared receive embryos that originated from an egg of an egg donor. Therefore, although these women do not have a genetic link with the child, they have a physical link through pregnancy and childbirth. In many cases the genetic father of the child is the woman's partner. Even after menopause the uterus is fully capable of carrying out a pregnancy. A 2009 statement from the found no persuasive evidence that children are harmed or disadvantaged solely by being raised by single parents, unmarried parents, or homosexual parents. It did not support restricting access to assisted reproductive technologies on the basis of a prospective parent's marital status or sexual orientation. Ethical concerns include reproductive rights, the welfare of offspring, nondiscrimination against unmarried individuals, homosexual, and professional autonomy. A recent controversy in California focused on the question of whether physicians opposed to same-sex relationships should be required to perform IVF for a lesbian couple. Guadalupe T. Benitez, a lesbian medical assistant from San Diego, sued doctors Christine Brody and Douglas Fenton of the North Coast Women's Care Medical Group after Brody told her that she had ""religious-based objections to treating her and homosexuals in general to help them conceive children by artificial insemination,"" and Fenton refused to authorise a refill of her prescription for the fertility drug Clomid on the same grounds. The California Medical Association had initially sided with Brody and Fenton, but the case, North Coast Women's Care Medical Group v. Superior Court, was decided unanimously by the California State Supreme Court in favour of Benitez on 19 August 2008. IVF is increasingly being used to allow lesbian and other LGBT couples to share in the reproductive process through a technique called . The eggs of one partner are used to create embryos which the other partner carries through pregnancy. came to international attention after having twelve embryos implanted, eight of which survived, resulting in eight newborns being added to her existing six-child family. The Medical Board of California sought to have fertility doctor Michael Kamrava, who treated Suleman, stripped of his licence. State officials allege that performing Suleman's procedure is evidence of unreasonable judgment, substandard care, and a lack of concern for the eight children she would conceive and the six she was already struggling to raise. On 1 June 2011 the Medical Board issued a ruling that Kamrava's medical licence be revoked effective 1 July 2011. Some children conceived by IVF using anonymous report being troubled over not knowing about their donor parent as well any genetic relatives they may have and their family history. Alana Stewart, who was conceived using donor sperm, began an online forum for donor children called AnonymousUS in 2010. The forum welcomes the viewpoints of anyone involved in the IVF process. Olivia Pratten, a donor-conceived Canadian, sued the province of British Columbia for access to records on her donor father's identity in 2008. ""I'm not a treatment, I'm a person, and those records belong to me,"" Pratten said. In May 2012, a court ruled in Pratten's favour, agreeing that the laws at the time discriminated against donor children and making anonymous sperm and egg donation in British Columbia illegal. In the U.K., Sweden, Norway, Germany, Italy, New Zealand, and some Australian states, donors are not paid and cannot be anonymous. In 2000, a website called was created to help biological children with a common donor connect with each other. In 2012, a documentary called was released that focuses on donor-conceived children. During the and transfer phases, many embryos may be discarded in favour of others. This selection may be based on criteria such as genetic disorders or the sex. One of the earliest cases of special gene selection through IVF was the case of the Collins family in the 1990s, who selected the sex of their child. The ethic issues remain unresolved as no consensus exists in science, religion, and philosophy on when a human embryo should be recognised as a person. For those who believe that this is at the moment of conception, IVF becomes a moral question when multiple eggs are fertilised, begin development, and only a few are chosen for implantation. If IVF were to involve the fertilisation of only a single egg, or at least only the number that will be implanted, then this would not be an issue. However, this has the chance of increasing costs dramatically as only a few eggs can be attempted at a time. As a result, the couple must decide what to do with these extra embryos. Depending on their view of the embryo's humanity or the chance the couple will want to try to have another child, the couple has multiple options for dealing with these extra embryos. Couples can choose to keep them frozen, donate them to other infertile couples, thaw them, or donate them to medical research. Keeping them frozen costs money, donating them does not ensure they will survive, thawing them renders them immediately unviable, and medical research results in their termination. In the realm of medical research, the couple is not necessarily told what the embryos will be used for, and as a result, some can be used in research, a field perceived to have ethical issues. Main article: Religious response to assisted reproductive technology The opposes all kinds of and artificial , on the grounds that they separate the procreative goal of from the goal of uniting married couples. The Catholic Church permits the use of a small number of reproductive technologies and contraceptive methods such as , which involves charting ovulation times, and allows other forms of reproductive technologies that allow conception to take place from normative sexual intercourse, such as a fertility lubricant. Pope Benedict XVI had publicly re-emphasised the Catholic Church's opposition to in vitro fertilisation, saying that it replaces love between a husband and wife. The Catechism of the Catholic Church, in accordance with the Catholic understanding of , teaches that reproduction has an ""inseparable connection"" to the sexual union of married couples. In addition, the church opposes IVF because it might result in the disposal of embryos; in Catholicism, an embryo is viewed as an individual with a that must be treated as a person. The Catholic Church maintains that it is not objectively evil to be infertile, and advocates adoption as an option for such couples who still wish to have children. welcome IVF as a gift for those who are unable to bear children and have declared doctors related to IVF to be conducting as there are several characters who were claimed to be born without intercourse, mainly and five . Regarding the response to IVF by , a general consensus from the contemporary Sunni scholars concludes that IVF methods are immoral and prohibited. However, Gad El-Hak Ali Gad El-Hak's ART fatwa includes that: IVF of an egg from the wife with the sperm of her husband and the transfer of the fertilised egg back to the uterus of the wife is allowed, provided that the procedure is indicated for a medical reason and is carried out by an expert physician. Since marriage is a contract between the wife and husband during the span of their marriage, no third party should intrude into the marital functions of sex and procreation. This means that a third party donor is not acceptable, whether he or she is providing sperm, eggs, embryos, or a uterus. The use of a third party is tantamount to , or . Within the community the concept is debated as there is little precedent in traditional Jewish legal textual sources. Regarding , religious challenges include (which may be regarded as ""seed wasting""), laws related to sexual activity and menstruation () and the specific laws regarding intercourse. An additional major issue is that of establishing paternity and lineage. For a baby conceived naturally, the father's identity is determined by a legal presumption () of legitimacy: – a woman's are assumed to be with her husband. Regarding an IVF child, this assumption does not exist and as such Rabbi (among others) requires an outside supervisor to positively identify the father. has generally approved IVF. Many people of sub-Saharan Africa choose to foster their children to infertile women. IVF enables these infertile women to have their own children, which imposes new ideals to a culture in which fostering children is seen as both natural and culturally important. Many infertile women are able to earn more respect in their society by taking care of the children of other mothers, and this may be lost if they choose to use IVF instead. As IVF is seen as unnatural, it may even hinder their societal position as opposed to making them equal with fertile women. It is also economically advantageous for infertile women to raise foster children as it gives these children greater ability to access resources that are important for their development and also aids the development of their society at large. If IVF becomes more popular without the birth rate decreasing, there could be more large family homes with fewer options to send their newborn children. This could result in an increase of orphaned children and/or a decrease in resources for the children of large families. This would ultimately stifle the children's and the community's growth. In the US, the has emerged as a symbol of IVF users, possibly because some people thought, without scientific evidence, that eating pineapple might slightly increase the success rate for the procedure. Studies have indicated that IVF mothers show greater emotional involvement with their child, and they enjoy motherhood more than mothers by natural conception. Similarly, studies have indicated that IVF father's express more warmth and emotional involvement than fathers by adoption and natural conception and enjoy fatherhood more. Some IVF parents become overly involved with their children. Research has shown that men largely view themselves as ""passive contributors"" since they have ""less physical involvement"" in IVF treatment. Despite this, many men feel distressed after seeing the toll of hormonal injections and ongoing physical intervention on their female partner. Fertility was found to be a significant factor in a man's perception of his masculinity, driving many to keep the treatment a secret. In cases where the men did share that he and his partner were undergoing IVF, they reported to have been teased, mainly by other men, although some viewed this as an affirmation of support and friendship. For others, this led to feeling socially isolated. In comparison with women, men showed less deterioration in mental health in the years following a failed treatment. However many men did feel guilt, disappointment and inadequacy, stating that they were simply trying to provide an 'emotional rock' for their partners. Costs of IVF can be broken down into direct and indirect costs. Direct costs include the medical treatments themselves, including doctor consultations, medications, ultrasound scanning, laboratory tests, the actual IVF procedure, and any associated hospital charges and administrative costs. Indirect costs includes the cost of addressing any complications with treatments, patients' travel costs and lost hours of productivity. These costs can be exaggerated by the increasing age of the woman undergoing IVF treatment (particularly those over the age of 40), and the increase costs associated with multiple births. For instance, a pregnancy with twins can cost up to three times that of a singleton pregnancy. High costs keep IVF out of reach for many developing countries, but research by the Genk Institute for Fertility Technology, in Belgium, claim to have found a much lower cost methodology (about 90% reduction) with similar efficacy, which may be suitable for some fertility treatment. Moreover, the laws of many countries permit IVF for only single women, lesbian couples, and persons participating in surrogacy arrangements. Using PGD gives members of these select demographic groups disproportionate access to a means of creating a child possessing characteristics that they consider ""ideal,"" raising issues of equal opportunity for both the parents'/parent's and the child's generation. Many fertile couples now demand equal access to embryonic screening so that their child can be just as healthy as one created through IVF. Mass use of PGD, especially as a means of or in the presence of legal measures related to population or demographic control, can lead to intentional or demographic effects such as the skewed live-birth sex ratios seen in communist China following implementation of its . In Australia, the average age of women undergoing ART treatment is 35.5 years among those using their own eggs (one in four being 40 or older) and 40.5 years among those using . While IVF is available in Australia, Australians using IVF are unable to choose their baby's gender. supervised the first Cameroonian child born by IVF in 1998. In Canada, one cycle of IVF treatment can cost between $7,750 to $12,250 CAD, and medications alone can cost between $2,500 to over $7,000 CAD. The funding mechanisms that influence accessibility in Canada vary by province and territory, with some provinces providing full, partial or no coverage. provides partial funding through their Infertility Special Assistance Fund – a one time grant of up to $5,000. Patients may only claim up to 50% of treatment costs or $5,000 (whichever is less) occurred after April 2014. Eligible patients must be a full-time New Brunswick resident with a valid and have an official medical infertility diagnosis by a physician. In December 2015, the provincial government enacted the Ontario Fertility Program for patients with medical and non-medical infertility, regardless of sexual orientation, gender or family composition. Eligible patients for IVF treatment must be Ontario residents under the age of 43 and have a valid card and have not already undergone any IVF cycles. Coverage is extensive, but not universal. Coverage extends to certain blood and urine tests, physician/nurse counselling and consultations, certain ultrasounds, up to two cycle monitorings, embryo thawing, freezing and culture, fertilisation and embryology services, single transfers of all embryos, and one surgical sperm retrieval using certain techniques only if necessary. Drugs and medications are not covered under this Program, along with psychologist or social worker counselling, storage and shipping of eggs, sperm or embryos, and the purchase of donor sperm or eggs. The penetration of the IVF market in India is quite low at present with only 2,800 cycles/million infertile women in the reproductive age group (20–44 years) as compared to China which has 6,500 cycles. The key challenges are lack of awareness, affordability and accessibility. India in 2018 becomes the destination for Fertility Tourism because of most affordable IVF treatment cost. IVF treatment cost in India varies from $2000 to $4000 (roughly between 150000/- INR to 250000/- INR including all aspects of IVF treatment with medicines which is almost 5 times lower than IVF Cost in Western part of the world. Israel has the highest rate of IVF in the world, with 1657 procedures performed per million people per year. Couples without children can receive funding for IVF for up to two children. The same funding is available for women without children who will raise up to 2 children in a home. IVF is available for women aged 18 to 45. The Israeli Health Ministry says it spends roughly $3450 per procedure. One, two or three IVF treatments are government subsidised for women who are younger than 40 and have no children. The rules for how many treatments are subsidised, and the upper age limit for the women, vary between different . Single women are treated, and embryo adoption is allowed. There are also private clinics that offer the treatment for a fee. Availability of IVF in England is determined by . The recommends up to 3 cycles of treatment for women under 40 years old with minimal success conceiving after 2 years of unprotected sex. Cycles will not be continued for women who are older than 40 years old. CCGs in , and have reduced funding to one cycle, or none, and it is expected that reductions will become more widespread. Funding may be available in ""exceptional circumstances"" – for example if a male partner has a transmittable infection or one partner is affected by cancer treatment. According to the campaign group Fertility Fairness at the end of 2014 every CCG in England was funding at least one cycle of IVF"". Prices paid by the in England varied between under £3,000 to more than £6,000 in 2014/5. In February 2013, the cost of implementing the NICE guidelines for IVF along with other treatments for infertility was projected to be £236,000 per year per 100,000 members of the population. IVF increasingly appears on . In August 2017 five of the 208 CCGs had stopped funding IVF completely and others were considering doing so. By October 2017 only 25 CCGs were delivering the three recommended NHS IVF cycles to eligible women under 40. Policies could fall foul of if they treat same sex couples differently from heterosexual ones. In July 2019 said that women were registering with surgeries further away from their own home in order to get around CCG rationing policies. The said in September 2018 that parents who are limited to one cycle of IVF, or have to fund it themselves, are more likely choose to implant multiple embryos in the hope it increases the chances of pregnancy. This significantly increases the chance of multiple births and the associated poor outcomes, which would increase NHS costs. The president of the said that funding 3 cycles was ""the most important factor in maintaining low rates of multiple pregnancies and reduce(s) associated complications"". In the United States, overall availability of IVF in 2005 was 2.5 IVF physicians per 100,000 population, and utilisation was 236 IVF cycles per 100,000. 126 procedures are performed per million people per year. Utilisation highly increases with availability and IVF insurance coverage, and to a significant extent also with percentage of single persons and median income. In the US, an average cycle, from egg retrieval to embryo implantation, costs $12,400, and insurance companies that do cover treatment, even partially, usually cap the number of cycles they pay for. As of 2015, more than 1 million babies had been born utilising IVF technologies. The cost of IVF rather reflects the costliness of the underlying healthcare system than the regulatory or funding environment, and ranges, on average for a standard IVF cycle and in 2006 United States dollars, between $12,500 in the United States to $4,000 in Japan. In Ireland, IVF costs around €4,000, with fertility drugs, if required, costing up to €3,000. The cost per live birth is highest in the United States ($41,000) and United Kingdom ($40,000) and lowest in Scandinavia and Japan (both around $24,500). Many fertility clinics in the United States limit the upper age at which women are eligible for IVF to 50 or 55 years. These cut-offs make it difficult for women older than fifty-five to utilise the procedure. Further information: Schematic illustration of artificial insemination. , including and of semen. It requires that a woman , but is a relatively simple procedure, and can be used in the home for self-insemination without medical practitioner assistance. The beneficiaries of artificial insemination are women who desire to give birth to their own child who may be single, women who are in a relationship or women who are in a relationship but with a male partner who is or who has a physical impairment which prevents full intercourse from taking place.

People may seek a surrogacy arrangement when pregnancy is medically impossible, when are too dangerous for the intended mother, or when a single man or a male couple wish to have a child. whereby a person assumes the of another, usually a child, from that person's biological or legal parent or parents. Government agencies in China passed bans on the use of IVF in 2003 by unmarried women or by couples with certain infectious diseases. In India, the use of IVF as a means of sex selection () is banned under the Pre-Conception and Pre-Natal Diagnostic Techniques Act, 1994. Sunni Muslim nations generally allow IVF between married couples when conducted with their own respective sperm and eggs, but not with donor eggs from other couples. But Iran, which is Shi'a Muslim, has a more complex scheme. Iran bans sperm donation but allows donation of both fertilised and unfertilised eggs. Fertilised eggs are donated from married couples to other married couples, while unfertilised eggs are donated in the context of mut'ah or temporary marriage to the father. By 2012 was the only country in the world with a complete ban on IVF technology, it having been ruled unconstitutional by the nation's Supreme Court because it ""violated life."" Costa Rica had been the only country in the western hemisphere that forbade IVF. A law project sent reluctantly by the government of President was rejected by parliament. President Chinchilla has not publicly stated her position on the question of IVF. However, given the massive influence of the Catholic Church in her government any change in the status quo seems very unlikely. In spite of Costa Rican government and strong religious opposition, the IVF ban has been struck down by the Inter-American Court of Human Rights in a decision of 20 December 2012. The court said that a long-standing Costa Rican guarantee of protection for every human embryo violated the reproductive freedom of infertile couples because it prohibited them from using IVF, which often involves the disposal of embryos not implanted in a patient's uterus. On 10 September 2015, President Luis Guillermo Solís signed a decree legalising in-vitro fertilisation. The decree was added to the country's official gazette on 11 September. Opponents of the practice have since filed a lawsuit before the country's Constitutional Court. All major restrictions on single but infertile women using IVF were lifted in Australia in 2002 after a final appeal to the Australian High Court was rejected on procedural grounds in the Leesa Meldrum case. A federal court had ruled in 2000 that the existing ban on all single women and lesbians using IVF constituted sex discrimination. Victoria's government announced changes to its IVF law in 2007 eliminating remaining restrictions on fertile single women and lesbians, leaving South Australia as the only state maintaining them. Federal regulations in the United States include screening on donations, but generally do not affect sexually intimate partners. However, doctors may be required to treatments due to nondiscrimination laws, as for example in California. The US state of proposed a bill in 2009 that would have defined donor IVF as adoption. During the same session another bill proposed barring adoption from any unmarried and cohabitating couple, and activist groups stated that passing the first bill would effectively stop unmarried people from using IVF. Neither of these bills passed. Few American courts have addressed the issue of the ""property"" status of a frozen embryo. This issue might arise in the context of a divorce case, in which a court would need to determine which spouse would be able to decide the disposition of the embryos. It could also arise in the context of a dispute between a sperm donor and egg donor, even if they were unmarried. In 2015, an Illinois court held that such disputes could be decided by reference to any contract between the parents-to-be. In the absence of a contract, the court would weigh the relative interests of the parties. , a key case at the Moreton C (14 January 2007).

Beshar, I., Johal, J. K., Saravanabavanandhan, B., Milki, A. A. OBJECTIVE: To assess the impact of withholding doxycycline on the success rate of natural cycle frozen embryo transfers (NC-FET).DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study.SETTING: Single academic institution.PATIENT(S): Women undergoing 250 NC-FET with euploid blastocysts performed by a single provider.INTERVENTION(S): One hundred and twenty-five NC-FET cycles performed after January 2019 without antibiotic administration compared with 125 NC-FET cycles before January 2019 with doxycycline administration.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Primary outcome: live birth (LB) or ongoing pregnancy rate (OPR, defined as pregnancies 13 weeks); secondary outcomes included positive beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (beta-hCG) level and clinical pregnancy rate (CPR, defined as the presence of fetal cardiac activity on ultrasound).RESULT(S): Each group of women comprised 125 NC-FET during the study period of March 2017 to March 2020. The women's mean age was 36.3 years and mean body mass index was 24 kg/m2. Between the two groups, the baseline characteristics were similar, including age, body mass index, race, smoking status, parity, endometrial thickness, Society of Assisted Reproductive Technology diagnosis, and number of prior failed transfers. Comparing NC-FET with doxycycline administration versus without, we found no statistically significant difference in LB-OPR (64% vs. 62.6%), positive beta-hCG (72.8% vs. 74.0%), or CPR (68% vs. 65.9%). After controlling for all variables in a logistic regression, doxycycline still had no effect on LB-OPR.CONCLUSION(S): In this analysis of similar patients undergoing NC-FET by a single provider, withholding doxycycline does not reduce success rates. Given the risks of antibiotics, our findings support withholding their use in NC-FET.

View details for View details for Spontaneous Conception during In Vitro Fertilization prior to Embryo Transfer without the Opportunity for Preimplantation Genetic Testing. In addition to the potential for multiple pregnancy, spontaneous conception during in vitro fertilization (IVF) can lead to undesired genetic outcomes. We present a case of a patient undergoing IVF with the intention of subsequent frozen embryo transfer after preimplantation genetic testing (PGT). Unprotected intercourse 6 days prior to egg retrieval resulted in a spontaneous pregnancy before the opportunity for embryo transfer. This case report highlights that spontaneous conception during IVF compromises the ability to transfer embryos that are euploid, unaffected by single gene disorders, or intended for gender balancing within a family when desired. Transvaginal Ultrasonographic Rates of Folliculogenesis Among Oligomenorrheic Women with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome To probe the rate of folliculogenesis among women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) who are oligomenorrheic, and to compare parameters among the group that de- veloped follicles with those who did not to determine how the 2 groups differed.A pro- spective cohort study per- formed on women with PCOS who gave a history of regular menstrual cycles less frequent than every 35 days. Transvaginal ultra- sound and urinary luteinizing hormone kits (ovulation predictor) were used to determine the development of a dominant follicle.A total of 55% of patients developed an ovulatory follicle with menstrual cycle lengths less frequent than every 35 days. The calculated cycle length for this group was 36-45 days.Among women with PCOS and oligo- menorrhea, rates of ovulation seem to be consistent with -the one study in the literature and lower than the other.

To study pregnancy outcomes between South Asian and Caucasian women undergoing frozen blastocyst transfer cycles.Retrospective cohort study.Not applicable.Caucasian and South Asian patients undergoing frozen blastocyst transfer between January 2011 and December2014.Not applicable.Live birth rate.A total of 196 Caucasian and 117 South Asian women were included in our study. Indians were on average 2.2years younger than Caucasian women (34.9 vs. 37.1years), and were more likely to be nulliparous (59% vs. 43%). All other baseline characteristics were similar. In women undergoing their first frozen ET cycle, implantation rate (49% vs. 47%), clinical pregnancy rate (PR; 54% vs. 49%), and live birth rate (43% vs. 43%) were similar between South Asians and Caucasians, respectively. In patients who underwent a prior fresh blastocyst transfer, the live birth rate was significantly lower in South Asian versus Caucasian women (21% vs. 37%).Our data demonstrate that IVF outcomes are better in frozen versus fresh cycles among South Asian women. The IVF clinics may wish to consider these findings when counseling South Asian patients about the timing of ET. View details for Drug-Induced Thrombocytopenia following a Transvaginal Oocyte Retrieval for In Vitro Fertilization. Comstock, I. A., Longmire, M., Aster, R. H., Milki, A. A. Drug-induced immune thrombocytopenia has been associated with hundreds of medications and can lead to devastating consequences for the patient. We present a case of a healthy 33-year-old female undergoing in vitro fertilization who developed a severe drug-induced thrombocytopenia, petechiae, and a large hemoperitoneum after receiving Cefazolin antibiotic prophylaxis for a transvaginal oocyte retrieval. The patient was admitted to the intensive care unit for resuscitation with blood products. The presence of drug-dependent platelet antibodies to Cefazolin was confirmed serologically. The role of serum testosterone in early pregnancy outcome: a comparison in women with and without polycystic ovary syndrome. Journal of obstetrics and gynaecology Canada : JOGC = Journal d'obsttrique et gyncologie du Canada : JOGC Lathi, R. B., Dahan, M. H., Reynolds-May, M. F., Milki, A. A., Behr, B., Westphal, L. M. Hyperandrogenic conditions in women are associated with increased rates of miscarriage. However, the specific role of maternal testosterone in early pregnancy and its association with pregnancy outcome is unknown. The purpose of this study was to compare serum testosterone levels during early pregnancy in women with and without polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) who either had successful pregnancies or miscarried.We collected serum samples from women attending a university-based fertility centre at the time of their first positive serum beta human chorionic gonadotropin pregnancy test. The samples were subsequently assayed for total testosterone level. We used logistical regression modelling to control for PCOS diagnosis, BMI, and age.Total testosterone levels were available for 346 pregnancies, including 286 successful pregnancies and 78 first trimester miscarriages. We found no difference in total testosterone levels between women who subsequently had an ongoing pregnancy (mean concentration 3.6 2.6 nmol/L) and women with a miscarriage (mean 3.6 2.4 nmol/L). Using the Rotterdam criteria to identify women with PCOS, we also found no differences in serum testosterone between women who had ongoing pregnancies or miscarriages, either with PCOS (P = 0.176) or without PCOS (P = 0.561).Our findings show that early pregnancy testosterone levels do not predict pregnancy outcome, and they call into question the role of testosterone in causing miscarriage in populations of women with PCOS. Further research is needed to elucidate the normal progression of testosterone levels during pregnancy and to investigate further the relationship between PCOS and miscarriage. Frequency of the Male Infertility Evaluation: Data from the National Survey of Family Growth Eisenberg, M. L., Lathi, R. B., Baker, V. L., Westphal, L. M., Milki, A. A., Nangia, A. K. An estimated 7 million American couples per year seek infertility care in the United States. A male factor contributes to 50% of cases but it is unclear what proportion of infertile couples undergoes male evaluation.We analyzed data from cycles 5 to 7 of the National Survey of Family Growth performed by the Centers for Disease Control to determine the frequency of a male infertility evaluation, and associated reproductive and demographic factors.A total of 25,846 women and 11,067 men were surveyed. Male evaluation was not completed in 18% of couples when the male partner was asked vs 27% when female partners were asked. This corresponds to approximately 370,000 to 860,000 men in the population who were not evaluated at the time of infertility evaluation. Longer infertility duration and white race were associated with increased odds of male infertility evaluation. The male and female samples showed no change in the receipt of male examination with time.Many men from infertile couples do not undergo male evaluation in the United States. Given the potential implications to reproductive goals and male health, further examination of this pattern is warranted. Outcomes of trophectoderm biopsy on cryopreserved blastocysts: a case series Lathi, R. B., Massie, J. A., Gilani, M., Milki, A. A., Westphal, L. M., Baker, V. L., Behr, B. Preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) is an increasingly common adjunct to IVF. The information gained from PGD may be used to reduce the incidence of chromosomally abnormal pregnancies and augment the current selection process of embryos. As such, patients may choose to utilize PGD in either fresh or cryopreserved IVF cycles. It is a common practice to cryopreserve excess embryos at the blastocyst stage. In these cases, trophectoderm biopsy is the only technique available for PGD. This articles reports this study centre's experience with trophectoderm biopsies of cryopreserved blastocysts in 12 patients who underwent 13 cycles of PGD. The implantation rate per embryo transferred was 46% and the ongoing pregnancy rate per embryo transfer was 63%. The results from this case series demonstrate that trophectoderm biopsy on cryopreserved blastocysts to perform PGD is logistically feasible. In addition, the rate of implantation and ongoing pregnancy were maintained within a reasonable range to justify the procedure. Preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) is an increasingly common adjunct to IVF and is used to evaluate the genetic makeup of the embryo prior to transfer of the embryo into the uterus. The information gained from PGD may be used to identify single-gene disorders that result in genetic disease, reduce the incidence of chromosomally abnormal pregnancies and/or augment the selection process of embryos to be transferred. In order to perform PGD, a biopsy of the embryo is the performed and cells are removed for testing. PGD may be performed in either fresh or frozen (cryopreserved) IVF cycles. Patients who have cryopreserved embryos remaining in storage from a previous fresh cycle may wish to have these embryos tested with PGD. Many embryos are frozen on day 5 of development, referred to as the blastocyst stage. At this stage of development, embryo biopsy is performed via a technique known as 'trophectoderm biopsy', in which 1-3 of the cells destined to become the placenta are removed from the embryo for chromosomal testing. We report our experience with trophectoderm biopsy of frozen blastocysts in 12 patients who underwent 13 cycles of PGD. The implantation rate per embryo transferred was 46% and the ongoing pregnancy rate per embryo transfer was 63%. The results from this case series demonstrate that trophectoderm biopsy on cryopreserved blastocysts to perform PGD is logistically feasible. In addition, the rate of implantation and ongoing pregnancy were maintained within a reasonable range to justify the procedure. View details for Successful frozen blastocyst transfers after failed fresh transfers in assisted reproductive technologies patients with hydrosalpinx Untreated hydrosalpinx is known to decrease in vitro fertilization success. We report on 4 patients with hydrosalpinx for whom fresh transfers of 11 good quality embryos did not produce a pregnancy; however, frozen blastocyst transfers in natural cycles resulted in several successful pregnancies, with an implantation rate of 60% (9/15 blastocysts implanted). View details for Early pregnancy testosterone after ovarian stimulation and pregnancy outcome Gustin, S. L., Mukherjee, G., Baker, V. L., Westphal, L. M., Milki, A. A., Lathi, R. B. To examine early pregnancy (EP) testosterone (T) after ovarian stimulation and its effect on singleton pregnancy outcomes.Prospective cohort study.University-based tertiary care center.Subfertile women who conceived with or without fertility treatment.Ovarian stimulation for assisted reproduction, collection of serum total T levels in early pregnancy, and pregnancy follow-up.Rate of preterm delivery, low birth weight (LBW) (<2,500 g), and hypertensive disorders of pregnancy.EP serum samples were measured from 266 singleton pregnancies. The mean T level among spontaneous conceptions was 74.90 ng/dL (SD48.35 ng/dL); 103 ng/mL was the 90th percentile. Mean EP T was increased among patients who underwent ovarian stimulation compared with nonstimulated control subjects. In patients undergoing IVF, T levels in EP were linearly correlated with the number of oocytes retrieved. When pregnancy outcomes in women with normal T were compared with women with elevated T (>90th percentile), we did not see an increased risk for preterm delivery, hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, LBW infants, or cesarean delivery (odds ratio ratios 1.43, 0.38, 1.39, and 0.85, respectively).Elevations in EP T are associated with ovarian stimulation but do not appear to be associated with adverse pregnancy outcome. Further investigation to determine the etiology of increased maternal and neonatal morbidity among subfertile women is warranted.

To investigate the relationship between air bubble position after blastocyst transfer (BT) and pregnancy rates (PRs).Retrospective cohort study.University-based infertility center.Three hundred fifteen consecutive nondonor BTs by a single provider.Catheters were loaded with 25 L of culture media, 20 L of air, 25 L of media containing the blastocysts, 20 L of air, and a small amount of additional media. The distance from the air bubble to the fundus, as seen on abdominal ultrasound examination, was measured at the time of transfer. Air bubble location was categorized as <10 mm, 10-20 mm, and >20 mm from the fundus.Clinical pregnancy rate.After controlling for age, parity, FSH and frozen transfers, and accounting for repeated cycles per patient, the PRs for both the >20-mm (38.3%) and the 10-20-mm (42.0%) from the fundus group were significantly reduced compared with the group in which the bubble was <10 mm from the fundus (62.5%).This study is the first to suggest that BT closer to the fundus is associated with higher PR. Although no ectopic pregnancies occurred in the <10-mm group, this outcome should be monitored closely in larger studies.

To examine the rate of aneuploidy in missed abortions in patients who conceived after FSH ovarian stimulation compared with women who conceived in a natural cycle.Retrospective cohort.Academic reproductive endocrinology and infertility center.Women with karyotyping of products of conception (POC) from a missed abortion from January 1999 through August 2007. The rate of aneuploidy was compared between patients with a history of infertility who conceived naturally and patients with a history of infertility who conceived with FSH treatment.Ovarian stimulation with FSH, intrauterine insemination, and in vitro fertilization; genetic testing of POC after dilation and curettage.Embryonic karyotype.A total of 229 pregnancies met inclusion criteria, and of these, 64% had an abnormal karyotype. The rate of aneuploidy was 63% in the study group and 70% in the control group. This difference was not statistically significant.The incidence of embryonic aneuploidy was not higher in pregnancies conceived with FSH stimulation compared with spontaneous conceptions in infertility patients. This suggests that exogenous FSH exposure does not increase the risk of aneuploidy. View details for View details for Age-Related Success with Elective Single versus Double Blastocyst Transfer. Friedman, B. E., Davis, L. B., Lathi, R. B., Westphal, L. M., Baker, V. L., Milki, A. A. Background. Although the optimal outcome of assisted reproductive technology (ART) is a healthy singleton pregnancy, the rate of twin gestation from ART in women over the age of 35 is persistently high. Methods/Findings. We compared clinical pregnancy rates (PRs), ongoing pregnancy/live birth rates, and multiple gestation rates (MGRs) in 108 women who chose elective single blastocyst transfer (eSBT) to 415 women who chose elective double blastocyst transfer (eDBT) at a hospital-based IVF center. There was no significant difference in PR between eSBT and eDBT (57.4% versus 50.2%, P = 0.47) nor between eSBT and eDBT within each age group: <35, 35-37, 38-40, and >40. The risk of multiple gestations, however, was greatly increased between eSBT and eDBT (1.6 versus 32.4%, P < 0.00005), and this difference did not vary across age groups. Conclusion(s). Women undergoing eDBT are at uniformly high risk of multiple gestation regardless of age. eSBT appears to significantly lower the risk of multiple gestation without compromising PR.

To determine the impact of infertility on female sexual function.A case-control study.Academic infertility and gynecology practices.One hundred nineteen women with infertility and 99 healthy female controls without infertility between the ages of 18 and 45 years were included in this study.Anonymous survey and Female Sexual Function Index.Female Sexual Function Index scores, frequency of sexual intercourse and masturbation, and sex-life satisfaction.Twenty-five percent of our control group had Female Sexual Function Index scores that put them at risk for sexual dysfunction (<26.55), whereas 40% of our patients with infertility met this criterion. Compared with the control group, the patients with infertility had significantly lower scores in the desire and arousal domains and lower frequency of intercourse and masturbation. The patients with infertility retrospectively reported a sex-life satisfaction score that was similar to that of the controls before their diagnosis, whereas their current sex-life satisfaction scores were significantly lower than those of the controls.Women with a diagnosis of infertility were found to be at higher risk for sexual dysfunction on the basis of their Female Sexual Function Index scores compared with women without infertility. The interaction of sexual function and infertility is complex and deserves further study.

Aneuploidy in the POC in women with RPL was compared with sporadic miscarriages (or=35 years.Among 43 RPL patients, there were 50 miscarriages in which cytogenetic analysis was performed. In the RPL group, the incidence of chromosomal abnormalities in the POC was 78% (39 out of 50) compared with a 70% incidence (98 out of 140) in the sporadic losses. Thrombophilia results in the RPL patients were normal in 38 patients, four patients had APA syndrome, and one had protein C deficiency. Forty out of 43 had normal uterine cavities. Both TSH and parental karyotypes were normal in all of the patients tested. When the evaluation of RPL included karyotype of the POC, only 18% remained without explanation. However, without fetal cytogenetics, 80% of miscarriages would have been unexplained.In older patients with RPL, fetal chromosomal abnormalities are responsible for the majority of miscarriages. Other causes were present in only 20% of cases. View details for View details for Karyotype of miscarriages in relation to maternal weight Obesity has been identified as a risk factor for spontaneous miscarriage although the mechanism is unclear. The purpose of this study is to better understand the effect of obesity on early pregnancy success by examining the cytogenetic results of miscarriages in women with normal and elevated body mass index (BMI).We conducted a retrospective case-control study in an academic infertility practice. Medical records of women ages <40 years with first trimester missed abortion (n = 204), who underwent dilatation and curettage between 1999 and 2008, were reviewed for demographics, BMI, diagnosis of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and karyotype analysis. chi(2) and Student's t-test analysis were used for statistical analysis, with P < 0.05 considered significant.A total of 204 miscarriages were included, from women with a mean age of 34.5 years. The overall rate of aneuploidy was 59%. Women with BMI > or = 25 kg/m(2) had a significant increase in euploid miscarriages compared with women with lower BMI (P = 0.04), despite a similar mean age (34.4 years for both).We found a significant increase in normal embryonic karyotypes in the miscarriages of overweight and obese women (BMI > or = 25). These results suggest that the excess risk of miscarriages in the overweight and obese population is independent of embryonic aneuploidy. Further studies are needed to assess the impact of lifestyle modification, insulin resistance and PCOS on pregnancy outcomes in the overweight and obese population.

Y., Westphal, L. M. To estimate the effect of ethnicity on in vitro fertilization (IVF) outcomes after blastocyst transfer.We conducted a review of fresh blastocyst transfer IVF cycles from January 1, 2005, to December 31, 2006. Data collection included demographic information, infertility history, treatment protocol details, and treatment outcomes. Statistics were performed using the Student t test and chi2 test. To establish the independent contribution of Asian ethnicity, a multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed.We reviewed 180 blastocyst transfer cycles among white (62%) and Asian (38%) women. The groups were similar in most baseline characteristics. Asian women, however, had a lower body mass index (22.6 compared with 24.2, P=.02), were more likely to be nulligravid (53% compared with 35%, P=.03), and were more likely to have had at least one prior IVF cycle (37% compared with 20%, P=.02) The groups were similar in treatment characteristics, number of oocytes retrieved, fertilization rate, and number of blastocysts transferred. However, Asian women had a thicker endometrial lining (10.9 compared with 10.2, P=.02). Despite these similarities, Asian women had a lower implantation rate (28% compared with 45%, P=.01), clinical pregnancy rate (43% compared with 59%, P=.03), and live birthrate (31% compared with 48%, P=.02). In multivariable analysis, the decreased live birthrate among Asian women persisted (adjusted odds ratio 0.48, 95% confidence interval 0.24-0.96, P=.04).When compared with white women, Asian women have lower clinical pregnancy and live birthrates after blastocyst transfer. Laparoscopy in Women With Unexplained Infertility: A Cost-Effectiveness Analysis EDITORIAL COMMENT Moayeri, S. E., Lee, H. C., Lathi, R. B., Westphal, L. M., Milki, A. A., Garber, A. M. View details for View details for Poor Prognosis with In Vitro Fertilization in Indian Women Compared to Caucasian Women Despite Similar Embryo Quality Shahine, L. K., Lamb, J. D., Lathi, R. B., Milki, A. A., Langen, E., Westphal, L. M. Disease prevalence and response to medical therapy may differ among patients of diverse ethnicities. Poor outcomes with in vitro fertilization (IVF) treatment have been previously shown in Indian women compared to Caucasian women, and some evidence suggests that poor embryo quality may be a cause for the discrepancy. In our center, only patients with the highest quality cleavage stage embryos are considered eligible for extending embryo culture to the blastocyst stage. We compared live birth rates (LBR) between Indian and Caucasian women after blastocyst transfer to investigate whether differences in IVF outcomes between these ethnicities would persist in patients who transferred similar quality embryos.In this retrospective cohort analysis, we compared IVF outcome between 145 Caucasians and 80 Indians who had a blastocyst transfer between January 1, 2005 and June 31, 2007 in our university center. Indians were younger than Caucasians by 2.7 years (34.03 vs. 36.71, P = 0.03), were more likely to have an agonist down regulation protocol (68% vs. 43%, P<0.01), and were more likely to have polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS), although not significant, (24% vs. 14%, P = 0.06). Sixty eight percent of Indian patients had the highest quality embryos (4AB blastocyst or better) transferred compared to 71% of the Caucasians (P = 0.2). LBR was significantly lower in the Indians compared to the Caucasians (24% vs. 41%, P<0.01) with an odds ratio of 0.63, (95%CI 0.46-0.86). Controlling for age, stimulation protocol and PCOS showed persistently lower LBR with an adjusted odds ratio of 0.56, (95%CI 0.40-0.79) in the multivariate analysis.Despite younger age and similar embryo quality, Indians had a significantly lower LBR than Caucasians. In this preliminary study, poor prognosis after IVF for Indian ethnicity persisted despite limiting analysis to patients with high quality embryos transferred. Further investigation into explanations for ethnic differences in reproduction is needed. Laparoscopy in women with unexplained infertility: a cost-effectiveness analysis Moayeri, S. E., Lee, H. C., Lathi, R. B., Westphal, L. M., Milki, A. A., Garber, A. M. To evaluate the cost effectiveness of laparoscopy for unexplained infertility.We performed a cost-effectiveness analysis using a computer-generated decision analysis tree. Data used to construct the mathematical model were extracted from the literature or obtained from our practice. We compared outcomes following four treatment strategies: [1] no treatment, [2] standard infertility treatment algorithm (SITA), [3] laparoscopy with expectant management (LSC/EM), and [4] laparoscopy with infertility therapy (LSC/IT). The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was calculated, and one-way sensitivity analyses assessed the impact of varying base-case estimates.Academic in vitro fertilization practice.Computer-simulated patients assigned to one of four treatments.Fertility treatment or laparoscopy.Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios.Using base-case assumptions, LSC/EM was preferred (ICER =$128,400 per live-birth in U.S. dollars). Changing the following did not alter results: rates and costs of multiple gestations, penalty for high-order multiples, infertility treatment costs, and endometriosis prevalence. Outcomes were most affected by patient dropout from infertility treatments-SITA was preferred when dropout was less than 9% per cycle. Less important factors included surgical costs, acceptability of twins, and the effects of untreated endometriosis on fecundity.Laparoscopy is cost effective in the initial management of young women with infertility, particularly when infertility treatment dropout rates exceed 9% per cycle.

F., Burney, R. O., Milki, A. A., Westphal, L. M., Dahan, M. H., Lathi, R. B. To evaluate the pregnancy rate, ovarian responsiveness, and endometrial thickness in infertility patients with a history of methotrexate exposure who subsequently underwent controlled ovarian stimulation.Retrospective cohort study.University reproductive endocrinology and infertility program.Forty-eight women with infertility undergoing ovarian stimulation after receiving methotrexate treatment for ectopic gestation.Methotrexate administration and controlled ovarian stimulation.Pregnancy rate, cycle day 3 FSH levels, number of oocytes retrieved, and endometrial thickness.The cumulative intrauterine pregnancy rate achieved with controlled ovarian stimulation at 2 years after methotrexate exposure was 43%, with a mean time to conceive of 181 days. Thirty-five patients with similar fertility treatments pre- and post-methotrexate were identified. Within this group, when an IVF cycle occurred within 180 days of methotrexate exposure, a significant decline in oocytes retrieved was observed. Cycles performed later than 180 days after methotrexate exposure did not exhibit a decrease in oocyte production. Endometrial development was similar at all time points examined.These findings suggest a time-limited and reversible impact of methotrexate on oocyte yield. If confirmed by larger clinical series and/or animal data, these results may impact the management of ectopic gestation in the patient with a history of infertility or the timing of subsequent treatments. View details for Embryo quality before and after surgical treatment of endometriosis in infertile patients Shahine, L. K., Burney, R. O., Behr, B., Milki, A. A., Westphal, L. M., Lathi, R. B. To investigate the hypothesis that surgical treatment of endometriosis in infertile patients may improve pregnancy rates by improving embryo quality.We conducted a retrospective evaluation of 30 infertile patients treated with in vitro fertilization (IVF) before and after surgery for endometriosis. Patients served as their own controls and only cycles with similar stimulation protocols were compared.Using standard visual evaluation, embryo quality on day 3 was similar before and after surgical treatment of endometriosis. Fifty seven percent of patients had stage I-II endometriosis and 43% had stage III-IV disease. No patients had a live birth after the first IVF cycle and 43% of patients had a live birth with the IVF cycle after surgery.Surgical treatment of endometriosis does not alter embryo quality in patients with infertility treated with IVF. Basal follicle-stimulating hormone as a predictor of fetal aneuploidy Massie, J. A., Burney, R. O., Milki, A. A., Westphal, L. M., Lathi, R. B. To determine whether an elevated basal FSH concentration is an independent predictor of fetal aneuploidy, as measured in spontaneous abortions (SAB).Retrospective study.Academic reproductive endocrinology and infertility center.All women with karyotypes of chorionic villi isolated from first trimester spontaneous miscarriages at the time of dilation and curettage from 1999 to 2006. The highest basal serum FSH level in the year preceding dilation and curettage was recorded.Monitoring of early pregnancy.Fetal karyotype.A total of 177 spontaneous miscarriages with karyotypes (70 euploid and 107 aneuploid) were identified, of which 53% were conceived by IVF. The aneuploid cohort consisted of trisomic (87%), teraploid (9.3%), and monosomic (3.7%) gestations. Using logistic regression analysis, basal FSH was not found to be independently predictive of an aneuploid gestation in our data set.Our data do not support the hypothesis that an elevated basal FSH concentration is associated with an increase in fetal aneuploidy. Our findings suggest that the association between diminished ovarian reserve and SAB may result from nonkaryotypic factors.

The second patient initially had a miscarriage but did redevelop cholestasis of pregnancy in the latter stages of a pregnancy resulting from frozen embryo transfer.We report two cases of intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy in the first trimester of pregnancies by IVF in association with ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome and markedly elevated maternal serum estrogen levels. Early recognition of this unusual clinical presentation allows for optimal pregnancy management by both the reproductive endocrinologist and the obstetrician.

B., Lathi, R. B., Milki, A. A., Dahan, M. H. Hemorrhage from a cervical pregnancy is a time-sensitive matter. Effective temporization measures for the initial management of this hemorrhage have not previously been reported in the literature.A 43-year-old woman, gravida 0, underwent in vitro fertilization and embryo transfer. She subsequently presented to the office with sudden onset of vaginal hemorrhage due to a cervical pregnancy. Cervical artery sutures were placed, and a cervical vasoconstricting agent was injected, at which point the patient's bleeding stopped. She then underwent successful treatment with dilation and curettage.Conservative measures to manage hemorrhage due to cervical pregnancy can be initiated, with possible rapid establishment of hemostasis until definitive treatment can be achieved. Aneuploidy in the miscarriages of infertile women and the potential benefit of preimplanation genetic diagnosis To evaluate the frequency of specific aneuploidies in miscarriages in an infertility practice and calculate the potential sensitivities of the different aneuploidy screening options for preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) in this setting.Retrospective analysis.Academic reproductive endocrinology and infertility practice.Women with miscarriages that had karyotype analysis on products of conception.None.Karyotype of spontaneous abortions compared with commercially available PGD options.Of the 273 karyotypes analyzed, 177 (64.8%) were abnormal. The average age of the patients was 37 +/- 4.5 years. Using a limited five-probe panel, 54 of the 177 (31%) abnormal karyotypes would have been detected. In contrast, an extended PGD panel (using 9, 10, or 12 chromosome probes) would have detected 127, 131, and 140 of 177 abnormalities, 72%, 74%, and 79% respectively. The difference between the limited (5-probe) and extended (9-, 10-, and 12-probe) panels was statistically significant. There was not a statistically significant difference among the extended panels.Most of the abnormalities seen in miscarriages are detectable by PGD with extended panels. A significantly higher percentage of these abnormalities could be detected by screening for 9, 10, or 12 chromosomes compared with only 5.

A retrospective review of all patients older than 35 who underwent elective single blastocyst transfer was performed. Twenty-three of the 45 patients (51.1%) have an ongoing pregnancy or liveborn delivery, with a mean age of 37.3 years, demonstrating a clear role for elective single transfer in this relatively older IVF population.

The objective of this study is to determine the rate of abnormalities detected by cytogenetic testing of first trimester miscarriages, in patients with and without an embryonic pole seen on ultrasound.A retrospective study of 272 D&Cs for missed abortions in an academic infertility practice from 1999 to 2006. Karyotype results were compared with transvaginal ultrasound findings. Chi-squared analysis was used with a P < 0.05 for significance.There was a high rate of abnormal karyotypes in all miscarriages (65%). Rates of abnormal karyotypes were 58% and 68% in cases with anembryonic gestations and those with a fetal pole seen, respectively (P > 0.05).The high rate of abnormalities detected in both groups suggests that useful results can be obtained from chromosomal testing of the POC regardless of ultrasound findings. Further studies on the prognostic value and cost effectiveness of chromosomal testing are needed. Ectopic pregnancy rates with frozen compared with fresh blastocyst transfer To compare the rate of ectopic pregnancy (EP) with fresh versus frozen blastocyst transfer in our program during the same time period.Retrospective analysis.University IVF program.Women who achieved a clinical pregnancy after IVF between 1998 and 2005.In our program, cryopreservation is performed at the blastocyst stage. Embryo transfer was performed 1 to 1.5 cm short of the fundus by abdominal ultrasound guidance.The incidence of EP was examined in relation to fresh versus frozen blastocyst transfer.In the frozen blastocyst group, there were 5 EPs out of 180 clinical pregnancies (2.8%), and there were 10 EPs out of 564 clinical pregnancies (1.8%) in the fresh blastocyst group.The rate of EP is not significantly increased after the transfer of frozen thawed blastocysts compared with fresh blastocyst transfer.

The purpose of our study is to compare the occurrence of monozygotic twinning (MZT) from blastocyst transfer (BT) in our program between an earlier and more recent time period.Retrospective.Academic IVF practice.All pregnancies conceived between March 2002 and December 2005 (N = 932) in our program were compared to pregnancies conceived before March 2002 (N = 554), which were the subject of a previous study.None.The incidence of MZT with day 3 embryo transfer and BT were compared between the study and control groups.During the study period, the rate of MZT was not significantly different for BT at 2.3% (9/385) compared to day 3 embryo transfer at 1.8% (10/547). This rate of 2.3% for BT was significantly lower than the rate of 5.6% (11/197) reported at our institution for BT before March 2002.Our study suggests that the risk of MZT with BT is significantly lower in the more recent time period and is in the range of what is seen with cleavage stage transfer. It is likely that improvements in culture systems as experience is gained with BT played a role. View details for Effect of reduced oxygen concentrations on the outcome of in vitro fertilization Kea, B., Gebhardt, J., Watt, J., Westphal, L. M., Lathi, R. B., Milki, A. A., Behr, B. We compared the effects of two standard oxygen concentrations, physiological (5% O(2), 5% CO(2), and 90% N(2)) and atmospheric (5% CO(2) with the balance as air), on fertilization, embryo development, and pregnancy rate in 106 patients undergoing IVF, excluding donor oocyte cycles and preimplantation genetic diagnosis cycles. The differences in oxygen concentration did not significantly affect fertilization rate, blastocyst formation, or pregnancy rate, but there was a significant difference in mean embryo score between physiological and atmospheric groups on day 3.

M. To evaluate the effect of oral contraceptive pill (OCP) pretreatment in patients undergoing IVF cycles with an antagonist.In this retrospective study, 194 cycles of women with diminished ovarian reserve undergoing IVF with a protocol using GnRH antagonists were evaluated. Oral contraceptive pretreatment was used in 146 cycles.Pregnancy rates were the same in both groups. Patients using OCPs required more gonadotropins (5,890 IU) compared to patients not undergoing OCP pretreatment (4,410 IU).Pregnancy outcomes were the same whether or not OCP pretreatment was implemented in poor responders using an antagonist protocol. While OCP pretreatment may help with scheduling flexibility, the higher dose of gonadotropins needed for ovarian stimulation should be considered. The dilemma of endometriosis: is consensus possible with an enigma? Nezhat, C., Littman, E. D., Lathi, R. B., Berker, B., Westphal, L. M., Giudice, L. C., Milki, A. A. Many will agree that the use of laparoscopy to diagnose and potientially treat endometriosis in patients who suffer from infertility has been superseded by IVF and sometimes oocyte donation, especially in older patients. The findings of our study add another dimension to management of endometriosis in the setting of infertility and emphasize the importance of keeping laparoscopy in the infertility management equation. View details for Subclavian vein thrombosis following IVF and ovarian hyperstimulation: a case report Thromboembolic phenomena are a serious consequence of assisted reproductive technology. We present a case of upper extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT) at 7 weeks gestation following ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) and IVF. Three weeks after recovering from OHSS, the patient presented with left neck pain and swelling. Ultrasound revealed a thrombus in the left jugular vein and left subclavian vein. Low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) was initiated with symptom resolution within 1 week. The patient remained on LWMH throughout her pregnancy and delivered at term. A literature review showed 97 published cases of thromboembolism following ovulation induction. A majority of these cases was associated with OHSS and pregnancy and the site of involvement was predominantly in the upper extremity and neck. Infertility physicians and obstetricians should be aware of this complication and keep in mind that it may occur weeks after resolution of OHSS symptoms. Role of laparoscopic treatment of endometriosis in patients with failed in vitro fertilization cycles Littman, E., Giudice, L., Lathi, R., Berker, B., Milki, A., Nezhat, C.

View details for Severe intrauterine growth restriction associated with the development of a submucosal leiomyoma during pregnancy - A case report Small, intramural leiomyomas are not generally considered a risk factor for poor reproductive outcomes.A patient with a 6-mm intramural leiomyoma and a normal uterine cavity by hysteroscopic evaluation who conceived after in vitro fertilization developed severe early-onset intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR), leading to pregnancy termination at 23.4 weeks' gestation. At 6 weeks postpartum, a 1.7-cm, intracavitary leiomyoma was detected on ultrasound evaluation and removed by hysteroscopic resection. The patient conceived in a subsequent in vitro fertilization cycle and gave birth to monozygotic twins with appropriate weights at 34 weeks of gestation. In the absence of other identifiable etiologies of the IUGR, it is plausible that the small, intramural leiomyoma enlarged and migrated into the cavity, causing abnormal placentation and leading to fetal growth restriction in the first pregnancy.Uterine cavity reevaluation is recommended in the investigation of IUGR before a woman attempts further pregnancies. Monochorionic triplet gestation after in vitro fertilization using donor oocytes: case report and review To report on a patient with a monochorionic triamnionic triplet pregnancy after IVF with donor oocytes.Case report.Academic tertiary care hospital.A 42-year-old woman who underwent IVF with donor oocytes.After failed IVF attempts, the patient chose to undergo treatment with donor oocytes. Her 23-year-old oocyte donor underwent standard controlled ovarian hyperstimulation. Retrieved oocytes were fertilized in vitro, and two embryos were transferred at the blastocyst stage.Intrauterine pregnancy with single gestational sac and three fetal poles with cardiac activity.After extensive counseling with perinatologists about pregnancy complications, the patient elected to terminate at 10 weeks of gestation.Several processes have been suggested to explain the increase in monozygotic twinning after IVF. These factors include advanced maternal age, superovulation, manipulation of the zona pellucida, and prolonged culture. It is possible that other factors may also play a role, especially in high-order monozygotic multiple pregnancies. All patients should be informed of the potential risk of a high-order multiple pregnancy after IVF, even when only one or two embryos are transferred.

It illustrates that observing a single PN in an oocyte at fertilization check should not be an absolute deterrent to transferring the resulting embryo even in an older patient with a high FSH level. This report also suggests that single observations, especially at the assessment of fertilization, in the IVF laboratory are limited when evaluating embryo potential and normalcy.

The patients with ICSI were more likely to have aneuploidy identified in their POC than conventional IVF, 76% vs. 41%. The average ages in these groups were similar: 37.1 vs. 37.8 years. There was a trend toward decreased aneuploidy with day 5 compared to day 3 embryo transfers; 38% vs. 63%.We found a significantly higher aneuploidy rate in the abortuses of patients who conceived with ICSI. It is possible that this increased incidence is due to abnormalities in the sperm of patients with ICSI, but could also be partially related to the technique itself. View details for 1000 office-based hysteroscopies prior to in vitro fertilization: feasibility and findings. JSLS : Journal of the Society of Laparoendoscopic Surgeons / Society of Laparoendoscopic Surgeons Hysteroscopy offers diagnostic accuracy and the ability to treat uterine pathology, but practitioners may be reluctant to perform it without a high index of suspicion because it traditionally requires an operating room. This study reviews the findings and feasibility of office-based diagnostic and operative hysteroscopy in an unselected in vitro fertilization (IVF) population to evaluate whether first-line hysteroscopy should be recommended.One thousand consecutive infertile patients scheduled for in vitro fertilization underwent office hysteroscopy. A rigid 20-degree 5-mm hysteroscope, with an operative channel for grasping forceps, scissors, or coaxial bipolar electrode was used. Operative findings, complications, and patient tolerance were noted.Sixty-two percent of patients had a normal uterine cavity. Thirty-two percent had endometrial polyps. Other pathology included submucous fibroids (3%), intrauterine adhesions (3%), polypoid endometrium (0.9%), septum (0.5%) retained products of conception (0.3%), and bicornuate uterus (0.3%). The pathology was treated in all patients without complication.When hysteroscopy is routinely performed prior to in vitro fertilization, a significant percentage of patients have uterine pathology that may impair the success of fertility treatment. Patient tolerance, safety, and the feasibility of simultaneous operative correction make office hysteroscopy an ideal procedure. Uterine position at real embryo transfer compared with mock embryo transfer The purpose of this study was to determine the consistency in the uterine position between mock and real embryo transfer.We reviewed 996 consecutive embryo transfer cycles (585 patients); 74% of patients had an anteverted (AV) uterus and 26% had a retroverted (RV) uterus at mock embryo transfer. All mock and real embryo transfers were performed under abdominal ultrasound guidance.Of 623 fresh embryo transfers in patients with an AV uterus at mock embryo transfer, only 2% became RV, while 55% of 213 embryo transfers in patients with an RV uterus on mock embryo transfer converted to AV at real embryo transfer (P < 0.0001). For frozen-thawed embryo transfer, 12% of AV uteri at mock embryo transfer became RV, while 33% of RV uteri became AV (P = 0.01).Our data suggest that an RV uterus at mock embryo transfer will often change position at real embryo transfer. Misdirecting the embryo transfer catheter can be avoided by accurate knowledge of the uterine position at the time of embryo transfer, which can be more accurately assessed by routine ultrasound guidance. Additionally, patients with an RV uterus at mock embryo transfer should still present with a full bladder for embryo transfer, since a significant number will convert to an AV position.

Embryo transfer was deferred until after tubal surgery, and all embryos were cryopreserved.In patients with hydrosalpinges, ultrasonography before ET is useful to detect newly developed hydrometra. Aspiration of the uterine fluid is unlikely to help because of rapid reaccumulation of hydrometra. Cryopreservation of the embryos for future transfer after the hydrosalpinx is removed or ligated is recommended.

In this report we describe exercise-induced ovarian torsion in an ovary with a persistent cyst, following a failed gonadotrophin-stimulated intra-uterine insemination cycle. This report suggests that the risk of ovarian torsion persists beyond the treatment cycle and that patients should be instructed to refrain from exercise or strenuous activity if regression to normal ovarian size has not been documented. Ovarian torsion should be high in the differential diagnosis in patients experiencing abdominal pain with a history of recent gonadotrophin stimulation.

To evaluate the sex ratio in births conceived with blastocyst transfer compared to day 3-ET.A retrospective analysis of IVF patients who became pregnant after blastocyst or cleavage stage transfer at Stanford University Hospital and a literature review were performed.In the day 3-ET group, the male-to-female (M/F) ratio was 157/139 (53%/47%) compared to 97/66 (59.5%/40.5%) in the blastocyst group (P = 0.18). Similar trends have been found in individual studies in the literature but reached statistical significance in only one out of six reports reviewed. The combined data from our study and the literature show a male-to-female ratio of 797/594 (57.3%/42.7%) in blastocyst transfer compared to 977/932 (51.2%/48.8%) in day 3-ET (P = 0.001).Although individual studies may lack power to show an altered sex ratio with blastocyst transfer, the combined data presented in this report do suggest that the M/F ratio is higher with blastocyst transfer compared to cleavage stage transfer.

D., Behr, B., Milki, A. A. To investigate whether ICSI (intracytoplasmic sperm injection) results in decreased blastocyst formation and pregnancy compared to IVF (in vitro fertilization).We performed a retrospective analysis of blastocyst transfer (BT) offered routinely to patients under age 40 with > or = three 8-cell embryos on day 3 and compared IVF to ICSI cycles. Sequential media were used with P1 until day 3, then Blastocyst Medium until day 5/6.There were 131 IVF and 75 ICSI cycles. There was no difference in age, number of oocytes, zygotes, 8-cell embryos, blastocysts on days 5 and 6, or embryos transferred. Progression to blastocyst was similar (78% for IVF and 73% for ICSI) as was the viable pregnancy rate (51.4% for IVF and 55% for ICSI). No cycles failed to form blastocysts.The progression to blastocyst and the likelihood of conceiving a viable pregnancy were unaltered by ICSI. Thus it seems appropriate for programs to offer BT to patients undergoing ICSI using the same inclusion criteria applied to their IVF patients.

To evaluate the incidence of monozygotic twinning (MZT) in pregnancies conceived after blastocyst transfer compared to cleavage-stage transfer.Retrospective study.University IVF program.All IVF patients with viable pregnancies conceived during a 4-year period.Blastocyst transfer or day 3 ET.Incidence of MZT assessed by transvaginal ultrasound.There were 11 incidences of MZT in 197 viable pregnancies (5.6%) with blastocyst transfer compared to 7 of 357 viable pregnancies (2%) with day 3 ET. In 10 of 18 pregnancies, MZT was observed in the setting of a higher order multiple gestation (6 of 11 for blastocyst transfer and 4 of 7 for day 3 ET). In the day 3 ET group, assisted hatching or intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) did not increase MZT (4 of 213, 1.9%) compared to cycles without zona breaching (3 of 144, 2.1%). Similarly, in the blastocyst-transfer group, ICSI did not increase the incidence of MZT (4 of 74, 5.5% for ICSI and 7 of 123, 5.7% for non-ICSI IVF).Compared to day 3 ET, blastocyst transfer appears to significantly increase the incidence of gestations with MZT. This information should be taken into account when counseling patients about the pros and cons of extended culture.

BACKGROUND: Blastocyst transfer may theoretically decrease the incidence of ectopic pregnancy following IVF-ET in view of the decreased uterine contractility reported on day 5. The purpose of our study is to specifically compare the tubal pregnancy rates between day 3 and day 5 transfers. METHODS: A retrospective analysis of all clinical pregnancies conceived in our IVF program since 1998 was performed. The ectopic pregnancy rates were compared for day 3 and day 5 transfers. RESULTS: There were 623 clinical pregnancies resulting from day 3 transfers of which 22 were ectopic (3.5%). In day 5 transfers, there were 13 ectopic pregnancies out of 333 clinical pregnancies (3.9%). The difference between these rates is not statistically significant (P = 0.8). CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggests that the ectopic pregnancy rate is not reduced following blastocyst transfer compared to day 3 transfer. While there may be several benefits to extended culture in IVF, the decision to offer blastocyst transfer should be made independently from the issue of ectopic pregnancy risk. Comparison of blastocyst transfer to day 3 transfer with assisted hatching in the older patient 56th Annual Meeting of the American-Society-for-Reproductive-Medicine To compare cycle outcomes in similar populations of women over 40 who underwent blastocyst transfer compared with women who had day 3 embryo transfer with assisted hatching (ET/AH).Retrospective study. STTING: University hospital-based program.Eighty-six IVF cycles in women ages 40 to 43 years who had more than three eight-cell embryos on day 3. On day 3 of embryo culture, patients chose either to undergo blastocyst transfer or day 3 ET/AH.Pregnancy and cryopreservation rates were recorded.In 48 cycles, blastocyst transfer was performed, and in 38 cycles day 3 ET/AH was performed. There was no statistically significant difference between the blastocyst transfer group and the day 3 ET/AH group with respect to age (41.1 +/- 0.9 years vs. 41.6 +/- 0.8 years), percentage of intracytoplasmic sperm injection cycles (29.2% vs. and 27.6%), number of oocytes (14.9 +/- 5.6 vs. 12.8 +/- 4.0), or number of eight-cell embryos (6.1 +/- 2.2 vs. 5.4 +/- 1.5). Significantly fewers embryos were transferred per cycle with blastocyst transfer (2.6 +/- 1.0) compared with day 3 ET/AH (5.9 +/- 2.0). The viable pregnancy rate was similar in the blastocyst transfer group (29.2%) and in the day 3 ET/AH group (26.3%). Embryos for cryopreservation were available in significantly more cycles in the blastocyst transfer group (52.1%) than in the day 3 ET/AH group (21.1%). Cleavage stage arrest occurred only in one cycle.Blastocyst transfer appears to be as effective as day 3 ET/AH in older patients with good embryos. Higher cryopreservation rate in the blastocyst transfer group may represent an advantage over day 3 ET/AH. Older women may also benefit from the information that extended culture provides them regarding their oocyte quality. Tissue sampling technique affects accuracy of karyotype from missed abortions To determine if careful specimen selection and washing of tissue from first trimester missed abortion products of conception specimens increases the sensitivity of routine cytogenetics in detecting aneuploidy.Retrospective review of cytogenetics results from tissue from dilation and curettage for missed abortion in a university fertility practice between 1998 and 2001. A technique of careful selection and washing of the specimen was implemented in July 1999. Results from before (n = 15) and after (n = 41) this change were compared. Cytogenetics reports from other physicians using the same laboratory were used for comparison (n = 59).The percentage of 46XX results was significantly decreased in the test group when compared to historical and community controls: 29% vs. 73% and 56% respectively. The percentage of aneuploid results was significantly higher in the test group at 61% vs. 7% and 36% in the historical and community controls respectively.Thorough separation and cleaning of villi prior to sending missed abortion specimens significantly increases sensitivity of conventional cytogenetics for detecting aneuploidy by decreasing maternal contamination. Endometrioma of uterine serosa in a woman with mosaic Turner's syndrome receiving hormone replacement therapy 56th Annual Meeting of the American-Society-for-Reproductive-Medicine Endometriosis in Turner's syndrome patients has only been reported in five isolated cases. We present here an endometrioma on the uterine serosa and pelvic endometriosis arising in a mosaic Turner's patient receiving hormone replacement therapy (HRT). The 24 year old patient with mosaic Turner's syndrome [45,X; 46,X pseudo dicentric Y (q11.23)], on cyclic HRT after laparoscopic gonadectomy 5 years previously, was found to have an adnexal mass on routine examination. Given her history, due to the fear of a malignant process arising from a potential gonadal remnant, she underwent a laparoscopy and was found to have a 5 cm serosal endometrioma arising on a stalk from the uterine fundal surface as well as pelvic endometriosis. De-novo endometrioma and endometriosis occurred in a mosaic Turner's patient after gonadectomy on cyclic HRT. The presentation was also unusual with a pedunculated endometrioma arising from the uterine serosa. Due to the fact that the patient did have cyclic menstrual flow, her endometriosis may have arisen from retrograde menstruation or coelomic metaplasia induced by exogenous hormones.

Non-invasive embryo viability assessments: The influence of media constituents during the first culture interval. 58th Annual Meeting of the American-Society-for-Reproductive-Medicine Dasig, D., Gebhardt, J., Lyon, J., Milki, A. A., Watt, J., Behr, B. View details for Accuracy of day 3 criteria for selecting the best embryos Milki, A. A., Hinckley, M. D., Gebhardt, J., Dasig, D., Westphal, L. M., Behr, B. To assess the accuracy of day 3 morphologic criteria in identifying the best embryos.Prospective observational study.University IVF program.One hundred cycles in women desiring blastocyst transfer who had > or =3 eight-cell embryos on day 3.On day 3, the embryologist chose the two embryos that would have been transferred that day. On day 5, embryos were examined to determine the best and second-best blastocysts.Accuracy of day 3 picks as measured in culture on day 5, outcome of nontransferred picks, and cryopreservation rate.All cycles reached the blastocyst stage and 73% had cryopreservation. The mean number of blastocysts was 4.8 (3.2 on day 5 and 1.6 on day 6). Neither pick was chosen in 39% of cycles; one pick was transferred in 38%; and both picks were transferred in 23%. Of 116 nontransferred picks, 51 were frozen and 65 arrested, with both picks arresting in 9 cycles. The single best blastocyst was chosen from the picks in 39% of cycles.Morphologic criteria for cleavage-stage embryo selection may fall short when the transfer is limited to two embryos. Culture to blastocyst is warranted in this population to avoid high-order multiples and still be able to choose the two embryos with the highest implantation potential. Factors relating to a successful cryopreserved blastocyst transfer program 56th Annual Meeting of the American-Society-for-Reproductive-Medicine To review the authors' experience in a successful frozen blastocyst program.Retrospective study.University IVF program.Women of all ages undergoing 64 frozen blastocyst nondonor thaw cycles.Thaw cycles with day 5 or day 6 frozen blastocysts replaced into luteal day 5 endometrium in natural or programmed cycles; cryopreservation of blastocysts by Menezo two-step protocol and Testart slow cool program; thawing by two step thaw protocol.Implantation, clinical pregnancy, and delivery rates.The implantation rate was 16% and was similar with day 5 frozen blastocysts and day 6 frozen blastocysts cycles. The clinical pregnancy rate was 36% and the delivery rate was 27%, with no significant difference between day 5 and 6 blastocysts.Blastocyst cryopreservation is a viable option for patients of all ages and complements fresh blastocyst culture and transfer. The presence of good quality blastocysts for freezing on day 5 and day 6 yields comparable results and is critical for the success of thaw cycles. Concurrent IVF and spontaneous conception resulting in a quadruplet pregnancy Milki, A. A., Hinckley, M. D., GRUMET, F. C., Chitkara, U. Blastocyst transfer of just one or two embryos has been used to help limit the number of high-order gestations. In this case report we describe the occurrence of a quadruplet pregnancy after the transfer of only two blastocysts during IVF. Sonographic examination showed four fetuses and what appeared to be quadriamniotic/quadrichorionic sacs, suggesting that a concomitant spontaneous conception had occurred. Definite confirmation of zygosity was obtained by genetic testing using DNA microsatellite polymorphism determinations after the birth of one boy and three girls at 32 weeks gestation. Although this event has not been reported previously, the possibility of its occurrence should be kept in mind. IVF patients with patent Fallopian tubes should be cautioned against intercourse late in their controlled ovarian stimulation, especially if they would decline multifetal reduction. View details for Recombinant DNA technology makes it possible to produce large amounts of human gene products for pharmacologic applications, supplanting the need for human tissues. The genes for the alpha and beta subunits of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), and human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) have been characterized and cloned. Recombinant FSH (rFSH) has been shown to be safe and effective in the treatment of fertility disorders. In comparison with the urinary gonadotropin products, human menopausal gonadotropins (HMG), and urinary follitropins (uFSH), rFSH is more potent and better tolerated by patients. Recombinant HCG appears to be as efficacious as urinary HCG with the benefit of improved local tolerance. Recombinant LH (rLH) is likely to be recommended as a supplement to rFSH for ovulation induction in hypogonadotropic women. It may also benefit in vitro fertilization patients undergoing controlled ovarian hyperstimulation with rFSH combined with pituitary suppression, with a gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist or antagonist.

View details for Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) mRNA splice variants are differentially expressed in human blastocysts 16th Annual Meeting of the European-Society-of-Human-Reproduction-and-Embryology (ESHRE) Krussell, J. S., Behr, B., Milki, A. A., Hirchenhain, J., Wen, Y., Bielfeld, P., Polan, M. L. The aim of our study was to detect and characterize mRNA expression of VEGF isoforms VEGF(121), VEGF(145), VEGF(165), VEGF(189), and VEGF(206) in human blastocysts. We recently demonstrated VEGF mRNA expression during human preimplantation embryo development, and further information regarding the alternatively spliced mRNAs resulting in freely secreted proteins or proteins bound to cell surface heparan-sulphate proteoglycans is needed to better understand the process of angiogenesis during implantation. Human blastocysts unsuitable for transfer obtained from the IVF programme at Stanford University were examined by reverse transcription/hemi-nested polymerase chain reaction for their expression of VEGF mRNA splice variants. VEGF mRNA was expressed in 17 out of 19 (89%) blastocysts. Of the 17 blastocysts, VEGF(121) mRNA was detected in 88%, VEGF(145) mRNA in 100%, VEGF(165) mRNA in 71%, and VEGF(189) mRNA in 24% of blastocysts. There was co-expression of mRNA for VEGF(121) and VEGF(145) only in 29% blastocysts, of mRNA for VEGF(165) and VEGF(145) only in 12%, and of mRNA for VEGF(121), VEGF(145) and VEGF(165) in 59% blastocysts. VEGF(206) mRNA could not be detected. In conclusion, we demonstrated that blastocysts express the mRNAs encoding for the free VEGF proteins, enabling the implanting embryo to immediately induce angiogenesis at the implantation site.

To detect the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) mRNA and/or secretion of VEGF protein by human preimplantation embryos.Human preimplantation embryos not suitable for uterine transfer were examined for beta-actin and VEGF mRNA expression. Culture media from normally fertilized and developing preimplantation embryos were assessed for VEGF protein secretion.Clinics and academic research laboratories at the Departments of Obstetrics and Gynecology at the Stanford University, Palo Alto, California and the Heinrich-Heine-University, Dsseldorf, Germany.Couples undergoing IVF by intracytoplasmic sperm injection for various reasons.Six unfertilized oocytes and 33 pathologically fertilized (tripronucleic, 3PN) preimplantation embryos were examined for VEGF mRNA expression, and 16 embryos were examined for VEGF protein secretion.Embryonic expression of VEGF mRNA and VEGF protein as determined by reverse transcription (RT)/nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and ELISA.VEGF mRNA and protein could not be detected in unfertilized oocytes. However, 30/33 preimplantation embryos did express VEGF mRNA (11/12 10-to-16-cell embryos, 3/4 morulae, 11/12 early blastocysts, 5/5 hatched blastocysts). The VEGF protein level was below the sensitivity of the ELISA.Production of VEGF may give the embryo the ability to induce neoangiogenesis at the implantation site, thus creating an environment necessary for its survival.

To examine the rate of monozygotic twinning associated with blastocyst transfer using commercially available, cell-free culture systems with unmanipulated blastocysts.A retrospective analysis was conducted in multiple private and academic infertility centers throughout the United States, of 199 pregnant patients following in vitro fertilization (IVF) blastocyst embryo transfer (ET). Human embryos obtained through standard IVF stimulation protocols were cultured in commercially available, cell-free media systems and transferred as blastocysts. The main outcome measure was the rate of monozygotic twinning.A total of 199 blastocyst-ET pregnancies were achieved during the study period at the fertility centers examined. Monozygotic twinning was noted in 10/199 (5%) of these pregnancies. All were monochorionic diamnionic.Monozygotic twinning previously has been reported following IVF, especially in relation to assisted hatching. While blastocyst transfer has been available for many years using coculture, there have been no published multicenter reports of monozygotic twinning associated with unmanipulated blastocysts. In a multicenter analysis, a definite increase in monozygotic twinning was seen following blastocyst-ET. We believe this phenomenon is real and that this information should be considered when counseling patients for treatment.

View details for Comparison of blastocyst transfer with day 3 embryo transfer in similar patient populations Milki, A. A., Hinckley, M. D., Fisch, J. D., Dasig, D., Behr, B. To compare implantation and pregnancy rates (PRs) achieved with blastocyst transfer (BT) and day 3 ET in similar patient populations.Retrospective analysis.Academic infertility center.One hundred consecutive patients <40 years undergoing IVF, each with more than three eight-cell embryos on day 3.Patients used their own eggs for IVF or IVF and intracytoplasmic sperm injection. Embryos were cultured in P1 medium (Irvine Scientific, Santa Ana, CA) until day 3, when they were either transferred or, in the case of embryos for BT, incubated in Blastocyst Medium (Irvine Scientific), followed by transferring on day 5.Implantation and PRs.There were no statistically significant differences in patient age, FSH level, or number of oocytes or zygotes. The BT group had fewer embryos transferred (mean, 2.4) compared with the day 3-ET group (mean, 4.6). The viable PR (cardiac activity at 6-7 weeks was considered indicative of a viable pregnancy) was higher with BT (68%, 34/50) than with day 3 ET (46%, 23/50). The implantation rate was increased with BT (47%, 56 sacs/120 embryos) compared with day 3 ET (20%, 46 sacs/231 embryos).The BT group in our study had higher implantation and PRs compared with the day 3-ET group. Better embryo selection, improved embryo-uterine synchrony, and decreased cervical mucus on day 5 may have accounted for the enhanced outcome. Our data support the use of BT to limit the number of embryos transferred while improving PRs. View details for Two-blastocyst transfer has similar pregnancy rates and a decreased multiple gestation rate compared with three-blastocyst transfer To examine the effect of the number of blastocysts transferred on pregnancy and multiple gestation rates.Retrospective study.Academic infertility center.Patients < 40 years undergoing IVF, with FSH levels of < 15 mIU/mL and more than three eight-cell embryos.Embryos were cultured in P1 until day 3 and then transferred to blastocyst medium. A maximum of three blastocysts were transferred.Pregnancy, multiple gestation, and implantation rates.All 55 patients developed blastocysts and underwent ET. Twenty-four patients had three embryos transferred and 29 patients had two embryos transferred. Two patients had only one embryo each for transfer. There was no difference in the viable pregnancy rate between the two-blastocyst transfer and three-blastocyst transfer groups (62% vs. 58%). In the two-blastocyst transfer group, 39% of pregnancies were multiple gestations (all twin gestations), compared with 79% of pregnancies in the three-blastocyst transfer group (50% twin gestations, 29% triplet gestations). The implantation rate was 47% in both groups.A commercially available, sequential culture system is highly effective for producing viable blastocysts. Two-blastocyst transfer eliminated the risk of triplets while maintaining the same high success rates seen with three-blastocyst ET.

After midcycle aspiration of the single lead follicle, a new cohort of seven follicles developed and seven oocytes were recovered. Six embryos were replaced by tubal ET and an ongoing singleton gestation resulted.Midcycle aspiration of a single lead follicle in a patient with poor response to IVF treatment allowed the development of a larger secondary cohort of follicles during the same cycle and ultimately led to a viable pregnancy. This intervention may have future implications for the treatment of poor responders. View details for Human preimplantation embryos express vascular endothelial growth factor mRNA Kruessel, J.

Forty-eight percent of patients had sibling embryos develop to blastocyst. The blastocyst group had more oocytes retrieved (17.4+/-6.6 versus 14.4+/-5.6), more embryos formed (11.2+/-4.2 versus 8.8+/-3.2), and a higher clinical pregnancy rate (60% versus 18%) than the group without blastocyst development.Blastocyst transfer has been shown to improve implantation rates and reduce the risk of multiple gestations from assisted reproductive technology. Sibling embryo blastocyst development may reflect superior embryo quality, as manifested by increased IVF-ET pregnancy rates. In addition to predicting pregnancy in the current cycle, sibling embryo blastocyst development may provide information about the potential for fresh blastocyst transfer in subsequent cycles and help to identify patients at risk for multiple gestations. View details for Preliminary clinical experience with human blastocyst development in vitro without co-culture Behr, B., Pool, T. B., Milki, A. A., Moore, D., Gebhardt, J., Dasig, D. This preliminary analysis was designed to quantify blastocyst development of supernumerary embryos without the use of feeder cells, conditioned medium or whole serum. Embryos derived from in-vitro fertilization (IVF) that were not transferred or cryopreserved were included in this study. Ova were harvested for IVF after a standard ovarian stimulation with gonadotrophin-releasing hormone agonist/ human menopausal gonadotrophin (GnRHa/HMG) or follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH). Ova were collected and culture in 150 microliters droplets of P1 medium under mineral oil, in groups at 37 degrees C under 5% CO2, 5% O2, 90% N2 (group A) or under 5% CO2 in air (group B) environment. Embryo transfer was performed 72 h post-harvest. Viable embryos not transferred or cryopreserved were placed in blastocyst medium and cultured for an additional 48 h in 5% CO2 in air. Embryos that exhibited an expanded blastocoelic cavity and well-defined inner cell mass at 120 h were counted. Of 838 supernumerary embryos cultured, 448 (53.5%) reached the expanded blastocyst stage by 120 h of culture. Patients were given the option of cryopreservation at that time. The embryos were cryopreserved using a standard protocol with serial addition of glycerol. Embryos reaching the blastocyst stage after more than 120 h of culture were not included. There was no difference in the proportions of blastocyst development between group A, 217/410 (53.5%) and group B, 231/428 (54%). To date, 16 patients have each had up to three thawed blastocysts transferred, out of whom seven became pregnant. This report demonstrates that a simple system of sequential culture generated acceptable, viable blastocyst development (54%) with supernumerary embryos, without the use of feeder cells, conditioned medium or whole serum. Recognizing the differential metabolic requirements of early and late cleavage stage embryos has enabled the application of a glucose/phosphate-free simple culture medium (P1) for up to 72 h of culture and a complex, glucose-containing medium (blastocyst medium) for subsequent blastocyst development.

Diagnosis and surgical intervention are often delayed.A 38-year-old woman presented with acute lower right abdominal pain initially managed as renal colic. She returned to the emergency department three days later. After surgical consultation, a computed tomography scan and ultrasound showed a cystic pelvic mass with normal ovarian flow studies. Ultimately, the gynecology team performed laparoscopy with the suspicion of intermittent adnexal torsion. A 6 x 8-cm, twisted, dusky purple right fallopian tube was noted. A laparoscopic salpingectomy was performed.In the differential diagnosis of acute lower abdominal pain, isolated torsion of the fallopian tube should be considered. A timely diagnosis and surgical intervention may allow preservation of the tube. Even when irreversible damage has occurred, laparoscopic management is recommended.

Latex condoms were used to cover the probe. Following examination, the condoms were removed and the probe was wiped with a germicidal disposable cloth and left to air dry for 5 minutes. Condoms were filled with water and examined for leaks.Number of perforations and distance from condom tip.Seventeen (2%) of 840 condoms leaked. The mean distance from the tip to the point of leakage was 10.6 cm +/- 2.8 (mean +/- SD; range, 7-14). Sixty-five percent of the leaks were < or = 10 cm from the tip. In several instances, two leaking condoms were found within a few examinations of each other. No visual contamination of the probe was noted.Although only 2% of condoms leaked, 65% were at distances that could have led to probe soiling intravaginally. While no body fluids were grossly visible, microscopic contamination was still possible. Since perforations were noted in close, and even consecutive scans, this study underscores the need for routine probe disinfection between examinations.

The difference in the viable PRs between the two groups (43% versus 37%) for patients < 40 years old was not statistically significant.Patient tolerance and PRs are similar for air and CO2 pneumoperitoneum during GIFT under local anesthesia. Given the theoretical risk of air embolus and lack of detrimental effect of CO2 on patient tolerance and success rate, it seems prudent to use CO2 in such a setting.

Sixty-nine percent of the patients scored ""very good,"" 20% ""good,"" 9% ""acceptable,"" and 2% ""poor."" All 38 patients undergoing 97 repeat procedures selected local anesthesia again. For women < 40 years of age, clinical PR and delivery rate were 43% and 38%, respectively.Routine office GIFT under local anesthesia is effective and well accepted by the surgeon and is preferred by patients. It offers a significant cost containment and scheduling flexibility in addition to high success rates.

L. Interleukin-1 receptor type I, IL-1 beta, IL-1 receptor antagonist, and human macrophages were immunohistochemically localized in the villous trophoblast, maternal-trophoblast interphase, and maternal decidua during early human implantation. Immunostaining for IL-1 receptor type I was present in the syncytiotrophoblast and hyperplastic endometrial glands in the maternal decidua. Immunoreactive IL-1 beta was present in the villous cytotrophoblast, syncytiotrophoblast, intermediate trophoblast, and maternal stromal decidual cells. IL-1 receptor antagonist staining was observed in the glandular endometrium of the maternal decidua and in isolated cells located inside the chorionic villi, intervillous space, and maternal decidua. Mature human macrophages, as defined by both CD/68+ and HAM56+, were present in the chorionic villi, maternal blood of intervillous space, and maternal decidua. Co-localization studies demonstrated that macrophages in all of the reported locations also stained for immunoreactive IL-1 beta. Our results show the shared presence in maternal and embryonic tissues of this receptor-agonist-antagonist system during early human implantation. This finding supports an autocrine/paracrine role for the IL-1 system in human implantation.

To improve the assessment of sperm penetration during the hamster penetration assay, we compared the Hoechst 33342 and 33258 DNA-specific fluorescent stains with the standard acetolacmoid stain. The fluorescence stains produced distinct staining of the DNA within the egg cytoplasm and nucleus, and this allowed for accurate and fast assessment of sperm penetration. REGULATION OF PLASMINOGEN-ACTIVATOR INHIBITOR-1 AND INHIBITOR-2 MESSENGER-RIBONUCLEIC-ACID LEVELS IN HUMAN CUMULUS AND GRANULOSA-LUTEAL CELLS Piquette, G. N., CRABTREE, M. E., ELDANASOURI, I., Milki, A., Polan, M. L. Plasminogen activators and their inhibitors have been implicated in the process of fibrinolysis, tissue remodeling, and ovulation. Epidermal growth factor (EGF), a paracrine hormone found in the human ovary, increases plasminogen activator (PA) activity and the gene expression of PA and plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI) in human endothelial cells and human cell lines. Gonadotropins also increase PA activity and gene expression in rat preovulatory granulosa cells. We have now analyzed the gene expression of PAI-1 and PAI-2 in uncultured human cumulus cells (CC), uncultured granulosa-luteal cells (GLC), and cultured GLC obtained from preovulatory follicles of patients undergoing assisted reproductive technologies. We also studied the effects of hCG and EGF on PAI-1 and PAI-2 mRNA levels in cultured GLC; GLC were cultured in serum-free medium for various times within 24 h with or without hCG and for 6 h with or without hCG, EGF, or EGF plus hCG. Total RNAs from CC and GLC were extracted, and blot hybridizations with 32P-labeled PAI-1, PAI-2, or 28S ribosomal RNA cDNA probes were performed. Both CC and GLC expressed PAI-1 and PAI-2 genes. In GLC, steady state levels of PAI-1 mRNA levels steadily increased within 24 h of culture, whereas PAI-2 levels peaked at 6 h of culture. PAI-1 mRNA levels were not affected by hCG or EGF at 6 h of culture, but PAI-2 mRNA levels were significantly increased by EGF at 6 h of culture. These studies demonstrate that human GLC PAI-1 and PAI-2 mRNA levels are differentially regulated and suggest that EGF may be involved in modulation of the human ovarian PA system during the periovulatory period.

Local anesthesia with conscious sedation is well accepted by patients and provides scheduling flexibility, cost containment, patient safety, and ease of recovery. We believe the technique should be offered to selected patients undergoing intrafallopian transfer. By adhering to specific guidelines for surgical technique and monitoring, the procedure is a safe and acceptable alternative to general anesthesia for laparoscopic intrafallopian transfers. A NEW CERVICAL INTRODUCER FOR EMBRYO TRANSFER WITH SOFT OPEN-END CATHETERS Fine open-end ET catheters offer several benefits and are now commonly used in IVF-ET procedures. However, they are not always easy to thread into the uterine cavity. We describe a metallic cervical cannula that allows the use of the popular Tomcat catheter in the majority of patients in whom we were unable to achieve a successful ET with the Tomcat alone.

A., Milkowski, D. A., ELDANASOURI, I. To determine if luteinizing human granulosa cells contain messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNAs) encoding insulin-like growth factor-binding protein (IGFBPs) and if cultured granulosa secrete IGFBPs into conditioned medium (CM).Northern analysis, using IGFBP-specific complementary deoxyribonucleic acid probes, was used to detect granulosa-derived IGFBP mRNAs. Western ligand blot analysis of CM was used to detect IGFBPs secreted by granulosa cultures with and without human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG).Granulosa cells were obtained from the In Vitro Fertilization (IVF) Program at Stanford University, a private teaching institution.Patients undergoing IVF for tubal disease.None.Transcripts of IGFBP mRNA and IGFBPs secreted into CM were detected by autoradiography of Northern and Western ligand blots, respectively.Transcripts of IGFBP-3, IGFBP-2, and IGFBP-1 mRNA were detected in human luteinizing granulosa. Cultured granulosa secreted IGFBPs with molecular weights corresponding to IGFBP-3, IGFBP-2, and IGFBP-1, and the latter two IGFBPs increased with 10 ng/mL hCG. A 24 kd IGFBP was noted, which may be newly characterized IGFBP-4.These data show that luteinizing human granulosa cells express mRNAs encoding three IGFBPs, secrete IGFBPs into culture medium, and that production of at least two of the IGFBPs is hCG-dependent, further supporting a role for the IGF system in human folliculogenesis.

c72867ca-3585-4843-8623-df7dc7750073,"Oogenesis is the process of the production of egg cells that takes places in the ovaries of Females , , or is the differentiation of the (egg cell) into a cell competent to further develop when fertilized. It is developed from the primary oocyte by maturation. Oogenesis is initiated in the embryonic stage. Reinitiation of meiosis and stimulation of ovulation by luteinizing hormone Diagram showing the reduction in number of the in the process of maturation of the . (In mammals, the first normally disintegrates before dividing, so only two polar bodies are produced.) In , the first part of oogenesis starts in the , which gives rise to the development of , the functional unit of the . Oogenesis consists of several sub-processes: oocytogenesis, , and finally maturation to form an ovum (oogenesis proper). is a separate sub-process that accompanies and supports all three oogenetic sub-processes. Oogonium —(Oocytogenesis)—> Primary Oocyte —(Meiosis I)—> First (Discarded afterward) + Secondary oocyte —(Meiosis II)—> Second Polar Body (Discarded afterward) + Ovum Oocyte meiosis, important to all animal life cycles yet unlike all other instances of animal cell division, occurs completely without the aid of -coordinating . The creation of traditionally doesn't belong to oogenesis proper, but, instead, to the of , which, in the female human, begins with the processes of , oocytogenesis, and . Oogonia enter meiosis during embryonic development, becoming oocytes. Meiosis begins with DNA replication and meiotic crossing over. It then stops in early prophase. Mammalian oocytes are maintained in meiotic prophase arrest for a very long time -- months in mice, years in humans. Initially the arrest is due to lack of sufficient cell cycle proteins to allow meiotic progression. However, as the oocyte grows, these proteins are synthesized, and meiotic arrest becomes dependent on . The cyclic AMP is generated by the oocyte by adenylyl cyclase in the oocyte membrane. The adenylyl cyclase is kept active by a constitutively active G-protein-coupled receptor known as GPR3 and a G-protein, Gs, also present in the oocyte membrane. Maintenance of meiotic arrest also depends on the presence of a multilayered complex of cells, known as a follicle, that surrounds the oocyte. Removal of the oocyte from the follicle causes meiosis to progress in the oocyte. The cells that comprise the follicle, known as granulosa cells, are connected to each other by proteins known as gap junctions, that allow small molecules to pass between the cells. The granulosa cells produce a small molecule, , that diffuses into the oocyte through the gap junctions. In the oocyte, cyclic GMP prevents the breakdown of cyclic AMP by the phosphodiesterase PDE3, and thus maintains meiotic arrest. The cyclic GMP is produced by the guanylyl cyclase NPR2. Reinitiation of meiosis and stimulation of ovulation by luteinizing hormone As follicles grow, they acquire receptors for luteinizing hormone, a pituitary hormone that reinitiates meiosis in the oocyte and causes ovulation of a fertilizable egg. Luteinizing hormone acts on receptors in the outer layers of granulosa cells of the follicle, causing a decrease in cyclic GMP in the granulosa cells. Because the granulosa cells and oocyte are connected by gap junctions, cyclic GMP also decreases in the oocyte, causing meiosis to resume. Meiosis then proceeds to second metaphase, where it pauses again until fertilization. Luteinizing hormone also stimulates gene expression leading to ovulation.

Oocytogenesis is complete either before or shortly after birth. It is commonly believed that, when oocytogenesis is complete, no additional primary oocytes are created, in contrast to the male process of spermatogenesis, where gametocytes are continuously created. In other words, primary oocytes reach their maximum development at ~20 weeks of gestational age, when approximately seven million primary oocytes have been created; however, at birth, this number has already been reduced to approximately 1-2 million. Two publications have challenged the belief that a finite number of oocytes are set around the time of birth. The renewal of ovarian follicles from germline stem cells (originating from bone marrow and peripheral blood) has been reported in the postnatal mouse ovary. In contrast, DNA clock measurements do not indicate ongoing oogenesis during human females' lifetimes. Thus, further experiments are required to determine the true dynamics of small follicle formation. The succeeding phase of ootidogenesis occurs when the develops into an ootid. This is achieved by the process of meiosis. In fact, a primary oocyte is, by its biological definition, a cell whose primary function is to divide by the process of meiosis. However, although this process begins at prenatal age, it stops at . In late fetal life, all oocytes, still primary oocytes, have halted at this stage of development, called the . After , these cells then continue to develop, although only a few do so every . of ootidogenesis begins during embryonic development, but halts in the stage of prophase I until puberty. The mouse oocyte in the dictyate (prolonged diplotene) stage actively repairs DNA damage, whereas DNA repair is not detectable in the pre-dictyate (, and ) stages of meiosis. For those primary oocytes that continue to develop in each menstrual cycle, however, occurs and form, enabling to occur. As a result of meiosis I, the primary oocyte has now developed into the and the first . Immediately after meiosis I, the secondary oocyte initiates . However, this process is also halted at the stage until , if such should ever occur. If the egg is not fertilized, it is disintegrated and released () and the secondary oocyte does not complete meiosis II (and doesn't become an ). When meiosis II has completed, an ootid and another polar body have now been created. The polar body is small in size. Synchronously with ootidogenesis, the surrounding the ootid has developed from a primordial follicle to a preovulatory one. Both polar bodies disintegrate at the end of Meiosis II, leaving only the ootid, which then eventually undergoes maturation into a mature ovum. The function of forming polar bodies is to discard the extra haploid sets of chromosomes that have resulted as a consequence of meiosis. () is the technique of letting mature . It can potentially be performed before an . In such cases, isn't essential. Rather, oocytes can mature outside the body prior to IVF. Hence, no (or at least a lower dose of) gonadotropins have to be injected in the body. Immature eggs have been grown until maturation at a 10% survival rate, but the technique is not yet clinically available. With this technique, cryopreserved ovarian tissue could possibly be used to make oocytes that can directly undergo . By definition it means, to recapitulate mammalian oogenesis and producing fertilizable oocytes in vitro.it is a complex process involving several different cell types, precise follicular cell-oocyte reciprocal interactions, a variety of nutrients and combinations of cytokines, and precise growth factors and hormones depending on the developmental stage. In 2016, two papers published by Morohaku et al. and Hikabe et al. reported in vitro procedures that appear to reproduce efficiently these conditions allowing for the production, completely in a dish, of a relatively large number of oocytes that are fertilizable and capable of giving rise to viable offspring in the mouse. This technique can be mainly benefited in cancer patients where in today's condition their ovarian tissue is cryopreserved for fertility preservation.Alternately to the autologous transplantation, the development of culture systems that support oocyte development from the primordial follicle stage represent a valid strategy to restore fertility.Over time, many studies have been conducted with the aim to optimize the characteristics of ovarian tissue culture systems and to better support the three main phases: 1) activation of primordial follicles; 2) isolation and culture of growing preantral follicles; 3) removal from the follicle environment and maturation of oocyte cumulus complexes. While complete oocyte in vitro development has been achieved in mouse, with the production of live offspring, the goal of obtaining oocytes of sufficient quality to support embryo development has not been completely reached into higher mammals despite decades of effort. Diagram of oogenesis in a () Some and the produce eggs in . In the brown alga , all four egg cells survive oogenesis, which is an exception to the rule that generally only one product of female meiosis survives to maturity. In , oogenesis occurs inside the female via . In many plants such as , , and , egg cells are formed in . In , the female gametophyte has been reduced to an eight-celled within the inside the of the flower. Oogenesis occurs within the embryo sac and leads to the formation of a single egg cell per ovule. In , the oocyte does not even begin meiosis until the touches it, in contrast to mammals, where meiosis is completed in the cycle. In female flies, occurs during . This recombination is associated with formation of and the of these breaks.

Define ""hormone.""Essential Idea: Hormones are used when signals need to be widely distributed. A hormone is a molecule released by a cell in a multicellular organism that influences the behavior of another cell within the same organism. Hormones are secreted from one cell and bind to a specific receptor on (or in) the target cell. Hormones are used to coordinate and control everything from metabolism to behavior. Explain the role of insulin in the control of blood glucose concentration.Understanding: Insulin and glucagon are secreted by beta and alpha cells of the pancreas respectively to control blood glucose concentrations. Insulin is a protein hormone secreted from β cells of the pancreas in response to high blood glucose levels. Insulin moves through the blood and binds to receptor proteins located in the membrane of target cells, major ones being liver, skeletal muscle and fat. Insulin helps reduce blood glucose levels by signaling the liver to convert glucose to the storage molecule glycogen. Insulin causes muscle and fat cells to take in glucose from the blood. Explain the role of glucagon in the control of blood glucose concentration.Understanding: Insulin and glucagon are secreted by beta and alpha cells of the pancreas respectively to control blood glucose concentrations. Glucagon is a protein hormone secreted from α cells of the pancreas in response to low blood glucose levels. Glucagon moves through the blood and binds to receptor proteins located in the membrane of liver cells (hepatocytes). When glucagon binds to the glucagon receptors, the liver cells convert the storage polysaccharide glycogen into individual glucose molecules and release them into the bloodstream, thereby increasing blood glucose levels. Explain the role of pancreas alpha cells in the control of blood glucose concentration.Understanding: Insulin and glucagon are secreted by beta and alpha cells of the pancreas respectively to control blood glucose concentrations. Alpha (α) cells are endocrine cells of the pancreas that produce and secrete the hormone glucagon when blood glucose levels are low. Glucagon promotes the breakdown of glycogen by liver cells and the subsequent release of glucose into the bloodstream, thereby raising the blood glucose levels. Explain the role of pancreas beta cells in the control of blood glucose concentration.Understanding: Insulin and glucagon are secreted by beta and alpha cells of the pancreas respectively to control blood glucose concentrations. Beta (β) cells are endocrine cells of the pancreas that produce and secrete the hormone insulin when blood glucose levels are high. Insulin promotes the storage of glucose as glycogen by liver cells and the uptake of glucose from the bloodstream of muscle and fat cells, thereby lowering the blood glucose levels. Outline how the human body regulates blood glucose levels.Understanding: Insulin and glucagon are secreted by beta and alpha cells of the pancreas respectively to control blood glucose concentrations. High blood glucose levels are detected by beta cells in the pancreas. The cells secrete insulin in response. Insulin circulates in the bloodstream until it finds and binds to its receptor protein located on the target cell membranes (primarily liver, muscle and fat cells). Insulin stimulates the target cells to absorb glucose, thereby reducing the blood glucose levels. Within the target cells, the glucose is used in cell respiration, converted to glycogen (in liver and muscle) and/or converted to fat. Low blood glucose levels are detected by alpha cells in the pancreas. The cells secrete glucagon in response. Glucagon circulates in the bloodstream until it finds and binds to its receptor protein located on the target cell membranes (primarily liver cells). Glucagon stimulates the target cells to digest glycogen and release glucose, thereby increasing the blood glucose levels. Define ""homeostasis.""Understanding: Insulin and glucagon are secreted by beta and alpha cells of the pancreas respectively to control blood glucose concentrations. Homeostasis refers to stability, balance, or equilibrium. Physiologically, homeostasis is the body’s attempt to maintain a constant and balanced internal environment, which requires persistent monitoring and adjustments as conditions change. Outline how blood glucose homeostasis depends negative feedback mechanisms.Understanding: Insulin and glucagon are secreted by beta and alpha cells of the pancreas respectively to control blood glucose concentrations. Negative feedback is a situation in which a change in a given direction causes change in the opposite direction. Negative feedback involving insulin and glucagon keep blood glucose levels within a narrow concentration range. After a meal, the small intestine absorbs glucose from digested food. If glucose levels get too high, the body releases insulin into the bloodstream. Insulin causes the body’s cells to take in and store glucose, lowering the blood glucose concentration. If blood glucose gets too low, the body releases glucagon, which causes the release of glucose from some of the body’s cells. Describe the function of thyroxine.Understanding: Thyroxine is secreted by the thyroid gland to regulate the metabolic rate and help control body temperature. Thyroxine is a hormone secreted into the bloodstream by the thyroid gland. All cells in the body are likely targets for thyroid hormones. Thyroid hormones play vital roles in regulating the body’s metabolic rate and are essential for normal development, growth, and neural differentiation. Outline the role of thyroxine in body temperature regulation.Understanding: Thyroxine is secreted by the thyroid gland to regulate the metabolic rate and help control body temperature. Thyroid hormones stimulate diverse metabolic activities in most tissues, leading to an increase in basal metabolic rate. One consequence of this increase in metabolic activity is an increase in body heat production. Heat generated by metabolism plays an important role in keeping the bodies of endothermic animals warm. Endotherms, primarily birds and mammals, are animals that are able to regulate their own body temperature using the energy generated by metabolism. List symptoms of thyroxine deficiency.Understanding: Thyroxine is secreted by the thyroid gland to regulate the metabolic rate and help control body temperature. Too little production of thyroxine by the thyroid gland is known as hypothyroidism. It may be caused by autoimmune diseases, low iodine intake or by the use of certain drugs. Thyroid hormones are essential for physical and mental development so untreated hypothyroidism before birth or during childhood can cause mental impairment and reduced growth. Hypothyroidism in adults causes reduced metabolism. It can result in symptoms such as fatigue, decreased body temperature, weight gain, poor memory, depression, stiffness of the muscles and reduced fertility. List symptoms of thyroxine over production.Understanding: Thyroxine is secreted by the thyroid gland to regulate the metabolic rate and help control body temperature. Overproduction of thyroxine by the thyroid gland is known as hyperthyroidism. It may be caused by overactivity of the thyroid gland, autoimmune diseases, inflammation of the thyroid or a benign tumour. Hyperthyroidism is often recognised by a goitre, which is a swelling of the neck due to enlargement of the thyroid gland.Common symptoms of hyperthyroidism include increased body temperature, nervousness, insomnia, high heart rate, eye disease and anxiety. Outline the function of endocrine glands.Understanding: Thyroxin is secreted by the thyroid gland to regulate the metabolic rate and help control body temperature. Endocrine glands are glands of the endocrine system that secrete hormones directly into the blood. The major glands of the endocrine system include the pineal gland, pituitary gland, pancreas, ovaries, testes, thyroid, parathyroid, hypothalamus and adrenal. Outline how thyroxine regulates metabolic rate and body temperature based on negative feedback mechanisms.Understanding: Thyroxine is secreted by the thyroid gland to regulate the metabolic rate and help control body temperature. Negative feedback is a situation in which a change in a given direction causes change in the opposite direction. An example of a negative feedback is seen in control of thyroid hormone secretion. Neurons in the brain (hypothalamus) sense circulating levels of thyroid hormone. If blood concentrations of thyroid hormones increase above a certain threshold, the thyroid stops thyroxine secretion until the levels in the blood return to normal.If thyroid hormone levels drop below the threshold, the thyroid is stimulated to produce and secrete thyroxine until levels in the blood return to normal. Outline the mechanism of action of leptin.Understanding: Leptin is secreted by cells in adipose tissue and acts on the hypothalamus of the brain to inhibit appetite. Leptin is a hormone secreted into the bloodstream by adipose cells. If the amount of adipose tissue increases, blood leptin concentration rises. Leptin acts on cell receptors in the hypothalamus. Leptin helps to regulate energy balance by causing the hypothalamus to inhibit appetite, which in turn diminishes fat storage in adipocytes. Define ""adipose tissue.""Understanding: Leptin is secreted by cells in adipose tissue and acts on the hypothalamus of the brain to inhibit appetite. Adipose tissue is a loose connective tissue composed of adipocytes. Its main role is to store energy in the form of fat, although it also cushions and insulates the body. Outline how leptin regulates hunger based on negative feedback mechanisms.Understanding: Leptin is secreted by cells in adipose tissue and acts on the hypothalamus of the brain to inhibit appetite. Negative feedback is a situation in which a change in a given direction causes change in the opposite direction. Adipose tissue produces leptin in amounts proportional to the amount of fat stored in the body. When a person eats less and their fat tissue decreases, their leptin levels also decrease. This change signals an area of the brain called the hypothalamus, which increases the person’s appetite. When a person eats more and their fat tissue increases, leptin levels increase and reduce appetite. Describe the role and discovery of the ob allele in obese mice.Understanding: Leptin is secreted by cells in adipose tissue and acts on the hypothalamus of the brain to inhibit appetite. Leptin is a protein that is coded for by the ""obese gene"" (OB). The dominant allele (OB) leads to the production of leptin. The recessive allele (ob) is the mutated version of the gene.The OB gene was discovered by chance in a laboratory mouse colony in 1949. Homozygous recessive (ob/ob) mice were discovered that ate excessively and gained weight rapidly throughout their lives, reaching a weight three times that of unaffected mice. The ob/ob mice were not making functional leptin, and therefore there was no hormone to signal that the animal had had enough to eat. Outline the cause and consequence of leptin resistance.Understanding: Leptin is secreted by cells in adipose tissue and acts on the hypothalamus of the brain to inhibit appetite. People with leptin resistance make high levels of leptin, but the leptin receptor protein doesn't function and as a result the hypothalamus doesn't receive the signal to reduce appetite and limit food-intake. Leptin resistance is caused by mutations in the LEPR gene. This gene provides instructions for making the leptin receptor protein, which is found on the surface of cells in the hypothalamus. LEPR gene mutations that cause leptin receptor deficiency prevent the receptor from responding to leptin, leading to the excessive hunger and weight gain associated with the disorder. Define ""circadian rhythm.""Understanding: Melatonin is secreted by the pineal gland to control circadian rhythms. The circadian rhythm is the physical, mental, and behavioral changes that follow a daily cycle. The circadian rhythm responds primarily to light and darkness in an organism's environment. Sleeping at night and being awake during the day is an example of a light-related circadian rhythm. Circadian rhythms are found in most living things, including animals, plants, and microbes. Describe the action of melatonin.Understanding: Melatonin is secreted by the pineal gland to control circadian rhythms. Melatonin is a hormone secreted into the bloodstream by the pineal gland. Melatonin regulates the sleep-wake circadian rhythm in mammals. Melatonin is a protein hormone that binds to melatonin receptor proteins embedded in target cell membranes. Melatonin receptors are found throughout the body in places such as brain, retina, cardiovascular system, liver and gallbladder, colon, skin, and kidney. Outline the mechanism that regulates melatonin secretion in response to the day-night cycle.Understanding: Melatonin is secreted by the pineal gland to control circadian rhythms. Melatonin production is controlled by the amount of light detected by the retina in the eyes. When the retina detects light, the pineal gland's production of melatonin is inhibited and the mammal is awake. When the retina does not depict light, melatonin is produced in the pineal gland and the mammal becomes tired. Describe the mechanism by which the SRY gene regulates prenatal gonad development.​​ ​Understanding: A gene on the Y chromosomes causes embryonic gonads to develop as testes and secretes testosterone. The sex-determining region Y (SRY) gene is found on the Y chromosome. The SRY gene provides instructions for making a protein called the sex-determining region Y protein (also called testis-determining factor, TDF). The protein acts as a transcription factor, which means it attaches to specific regions of DNA and helps control the activity of particular genes. The protein initiates processes that cause a fetus to develop male gonads (testes) and suppresses genes that are important in female development .of female reproductive structures (uterus and fallopian tubes). Define ""gonad.""Understanding: A gene on the Y chromosomes causes embryonic gonads to develop as testes and secrete testosterone. A gonad is a gland that produces the gametes and sex hormones of an organism. The gonads are testis in males and ovaries in females. No difference can be observed in the gonads until the 6th week of embryonic life in humans. Undifferentiated gonads of XX or XY individuals are identical and can form either ovaries or testes. This period is called the bipotential stage of gonadal development.Presence of the SRY gene on the Y chromosome drives the bipotential gonad to differentiate into a testis. If there is no SRY gene, the gonad will develop into an ovary. As part of this SRY-prompted cascade, germ cells in the bipotential gonads differentiate into spermatogonia. Without SRY, different genes are expressed, oogonia form, and primordial follicles develop in the primitive ovary.Soon after the formation of the testis, the Leydig cells begin to secrete testosterone. Testosterone can influence tissues that are bipotential to become male reproductive structures. Outline role of testosterone in prenatal development of male genitalia.Understanding: Testosterone causes prenatal development of male genitalia and both sperm production and development of male secondary sexual characteristics during puberty. Male phenotypic differentiation of the bipotential gonad depends on the presence of the SRY gene on the Y chromosome. The gene codes for a protein called the sex-determining region Y protein (also called testis-determining factor, TDF). The protein acts as a transcription factor and initiates processes that cause the bipotential gonad to develop into testes. The fetal testes then begin to produce testosterone. Testosterone stimulates the development of the male reproductive structures during fetal development; the penis, the epididymis, the seminal vesicles, the prostate and the duct systems. State testosterone's role in stimulating the primary sexual characteristic of males.Understanding: Testosterone causes prenatal development of male genitalia and both sperm production and development of male secondary sexual characteristics during puberty. Soon after the formation of the testis, the Leydig cells within the testes begin to secrete testosterone. Testosterone can influence tissues to become the male primary sexual characteristics during fetal development. Male primary sexual characteristics are the external and internal reproductive structures present at birth: the penis, the epididymis, the seminal vesicles, the prostate and the duct systems. Define ""secondary sexual characteristic.""Understanding: Testosterone causes prenatal development of male genitalia and both sperm production and development of male secondary sexual characteristics during puberty. Secondary sex characteristics are features that appear during sexual maturity (puberty in humans). They are characteristics that distinguish the sexes of the species but are not directly part of the reproductive system (for example, deeper voice of male). List characteristics triggered by testosterone at puberty.Understanding: Testosterone causes prenatal development of male genitalia and both sperm production and development of male secondary sexual characteristics during puberty. During human puberty, there is an approximate 30X increase in testosterone production in boys. Testosterone is linked to many of the changes seen in boys during puberty, including:-sperm and semen production-increase in height and muscle mass-increase in body and pubic hair growth-deepening of the voice-enlargement of the penis, testes and prostate gland-development and maintenance of a sex drive State the sources of estrogen and progesterone used in prenatal development.Understanding: Estrogen and progesterone cause prenatal development of female reproductive organs and female secondary sexual characteristics during puberty. In placental mammals, both female and male fetuses are bathed in estrogens and progesterone of maternal origin (hormones from the mom and the placenta). Development of female reproductive structures is independent of maternal estrogen and progesterone (rather, female sex determination is based on absence of SRY gene). Once developed, the fetal ovary does not contribute significantly to circulating estrogens. The female fetus ovary has no documented role in differentiation of the female genital tract. Outline the prenatal development of female reproductive organs.Understanding: Estrogen and progesterone cause prenatal development of female reproductive organs and female secondary sexual characteristics during puberty. In a chromosomal XX embryo, the the sex-determining region Y (SRY) gene is absent since there is no Y chromosome. Without the SRY gene, the bipotential gonads will differentiate to become the ovaries. List characteristics triggered by estrogen at puberty.Understanding: Estrogen and progesterone cause prenatal development of female reproductive organs and female secondary sexual characteristics during puberty. During human puberty, there is an increase in estrogen in females. Estrogen is secreted by the ovaries and is linked to many of the changes seen in girls during puberty, including:-breast growth-widening of pelvis-fat deposits in the breast, buttocks, thighs, and hips-growth of the uterus-commencement of menstruation.-growth of underarm and pubic hair Outline events occurring during the follicular phase of the menstrual cycle.Understanding: The menstrual cycle is controlled by negative and positive feedback mechanisms involving ovarian and pituitary hormones. The follicular phase starts on the first day of menstruation and ends with ovulation (typically day 14). Prompted by the hypothalamus, the pituitary gland releases follicle stimulating hormone (FSH). This hormone stimulates the ovary to produce 5 to 20 follicles (tiny nodules or cysts), which bead on the surface of the ovary. Each follicle contains an immature egg and secretes estrogen.As the follicular phase progresses, one follicle in one ovary becomes dominant and continues to mature. This dominant follicle suppresses all of the other follicles in the group. As a result, they stop growing and die (around day 10). The dominant follicle continues to produce estrogen. Estrogen stimulates the lining of the uterus (endometrium) to thicken in preparation for possible pregnancy. Outline events occurring during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle.Understanding: The menstrual cycle is controlled by negative and positive feedback mechanisms involving ovarian and pituitary hormones. The luteal phase begins at ovulation and ends with the start of menstruation (days 14-28). After ovulation, the pituitary hormones FSH and LH released from the anterior pituitary cause the remaining parts of the dominant follicle to transform into a structure known as the corpus luteum. This structure starts releasing progesterone, along with small amounts of estrogen. This combination of hormones maintains the thickened endometrium lining of the uterus, waiting for a blastocyst to implant.If a blastocyst implants in the lining of the uterus, it produces the hormones that are necessary to maintain the corpus luteum. The corpus luteum keeps producing the raised levels of progesterone that are needed to maintain the thickened lining of the uterus during the pregnancy.If implantation of a does not occur, the corpus luteum withers and dies, usually around day 22. The resulting drop in progesterone level causes the endometrium lining of the uterus to fall away (menstruation). Outline events occurring the menstruation phase of the menstrual cycle.Understanding: The menstrual cycle is controlled by negative and positive feedback mechanisms involving ovarian and pituitary hormones. Menstruation is the elimination of the thickened lining of the uterus (endometrium) from the body through the vagina. Menstrual fluid contains blood, cells from the lining of the uterus (endometrial cells) and mucus. State the source and location of action of LH (luteinising hormone) in the menstrual cycle. Understanding: The menstrual cycle is controlled by negative and positive feedback mechanisms involving ovarian and pituitary hormones. Luteinising hormone (LH) is a protein hormone produced and released by cells in the anterior pituitary gland. In females, LH moves through the blood and binds to receptor proteins found on ovary cells. State the source and location of action of FSH (follicle stimulating hormone) in the menstrual cycle. Understanding: The menstrual cycle is controlled by negative and positive feedback mechanisms involving ovarian and pituitary hormones. Follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) is a protein hormone produced and released by cells in the anterior pituitary gland. In females, FSH moves through the blood and binds to receptor proteins found on ovary cells, where it stimulates the growth of follicles (and resulting increased estrogen production) during the follicular phase of the menstrual cycle. State the source and location of action of estrogen in the menstrual cycle. Understanding: The menstrual cycle is controlled by negative and positive feedback mechanisms involving ovarian and pituitary hormones. Estrogens are steroid hormones produced by the ovaries (follicle and corpus luteum). In the menstrual cycle, the target tissue for estrogen action is the uterus, where it causes growth of the endometrial lining. Estrogen penetrates the cell surface and binds to an estrogen receptor protein in the cytoplasm of the cells. The estrogen-receptor complexes enter the cell nucleus, where it binds to DNA and influences the rate at which particular genes are transcribed. State the source and location of action of progesterone in the menstrual cycle. Understanding: The menstrual cycle is controlled by negative and positive feedback mechanisms involving ovarian and pituitary hormones. Progesterone is a steroid hormone produced by the corpus luteum of the ovary during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle. In the menstrual cycle, the target tissue for progesterone action is the uterus, where it prepares the endometrium for pregnancy in the event that the released egg is fertilized.Progesterone penetrates the cell surface and binds to a progesterone receptor protein in the cytoplasm of the cells. The progesterone-receptor complexes enter the cell nucleus, where it binds to DNA and influences the rate at which particular genes are transcribed. Outline the role of luteinising hormone (LH) in the menstrual cycle. Understanding: The menstrual cycle is controlled by negative and positive feedback mechanisms involving ovarian and pituitary hormones. During the follicular phase, LH is stimulates the follicles in the ovary to produce estrogen. Around day 14 of the cycle, a surge in LH levels causes the ovarian follicle to release a mature oocyte (egg), a process called ovulation. During the luteal phase, LH promotes the change of the follicle to the corpus luteum. The corpus luteum produces progesterone, which is required to support the early stages of pregnancy. Outline the role of follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) in the menstrual cycle. Understanding: The menstrual cycle is controlled by negative and positive feedback mechanisms involving ovarian and pituitary hormones. During the follicular phase, FSH stimulates follicle development. With their growth, the cells of the follicles produce and secrete increasing amounts of estrogens. Outline the role of estrogen in the menstrual cycle. Understanding: The menstrual cycle is controlled by negative and positive feedback mechanisms involving ovarian and pituitary hormones. During the follicular phase, estrogens are released from the developing follicle of the ovary. The estrogens stimulate the building of the endometrium lining of the uterus. Additionally, as more and more estrogen is produced from the follicles, it simulates a surge in luteinising hormone which in turn triggers the release of an egg from a mature follicle (ovulation).During the luteal phase, estrogens are released from the corpus luteum of the ovary. The estrogen, along with progesterone, cause the endometrium to thicken. If there is is no pregnancy, estrogen levels fall after day 21–24. The drop in estrogen levels signals the endometrium layer to shed, resulting in menstrual bleeding. Outline the role of progesterone in the menstrual cycle. Understanding: The menstrual cycle is controlled by negative and positive feedback mechanisms involving ovarian and pituitary hormones. During the luteal phase, the remnants of the ruptured ovarian follicle form the corpus luteum. The corpus luteum releases progesterone, which prepares the body for pregnancy in the event that the ovulated egg is fertilized. If the egg is not fertilized, the corpus luteum breaks down. Along with estrogen, the drop in progesterone levels signals the endometrium layer to shed, resulting in menstrual bleeding.If the egg is fertilized, progesterone stimulates the growth of blood vessels that supply the endometrium and stimulates glands in the endometrium to secrete nutrients that nourish the early embryo. Progesterone helps to maintain the endometrium throughout pregnancy. Summarize the action of hormones used to control the human menstrual cycle.Understanding: The menstrual cycle is controlled by negative and positive feedback mechanisms involving ovarian and pituitary hormones. Follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) stimulates the development of follicles.Follicles produce estrogen.Estrogen stimulates the growth of the endometrium lining of the the uterus and stimulates luteinizing hormone (LH) secretion.LH surge causes ovulation.LH stimulates the development of the corpus luteum.The corpus luteum secretes progesterone and estrogen.Progesterone and estrogen cause thickening of the endometrium lining and prepares the uterus for implantation.Progesterone and estrogen inhibit the secretion of FSH and LH (so that new follicles aren't developed and/or ovulated in the case of a pregnancy).Without pregnancy, aging corpus luteum secretes less estrogen and progesterone. Decreasing levels of estrogen and progesterone trigger menstruation. Additionally, with less estrogen and progesterone the inhibition on FSH and LH secretion is lifted.FSH levels begin to rise again, and the cycle repeats. Define ""negative feedback.""Understanding: The menstrual cycle is controlled by negative and positive feedback mechanisms involving ovarian and pituitary hormones. Negative feedback is a situation in which a change in a given direction causes change in the opposite direction. For example, an increase in the concentration of a substance causes a response that ultimately causes the concentration of the substance to decrease. Negative feedback typically produces a condition in which a variable oscillates around a set point. Outline a negative feedback mechanism that regulates the menstrual cycle.Understanding: The menstrual cycle is controlled by negative and positive feedback mechanisms involving ovarian and pituitary hormones. Negative feedback is a situation in which a change in a given direction causes change in the opposite direction. With the exception of events of ovulation, negative feedback mechanisms regulate the menstrual cycle, for example:Increasing FSH leads to increasing estrogen production by ovarian follicles. Increasing estrogen then inhibits the production of FSH, decreasing FSH which in turn causes ovaries to make less estrogen. Decreasing estrogen will again lead to increasing FSH... and the cycle repeats.The negative feedback loop outlined above ensures that only one dominant follicle can continue to maturity and complete each menstrual cycle. As estrogen levels rise, negative feedback reduces FSH levels, and only one follicle can survive. Define ""positive feedback loop.""Understanding: The menstrual cycle is controlled by negative and positive feedback mechanisms involving ovarian and pituitary hormones. Positive feedback is a situation in which a change in a given direction causes additional change in the same direction. For example, an increase in the concentration of a substance causes a response that causes continued increase in concentration of the substance. Outline a positive feedback mechanism that regulates the menstrual cycle.Understanding: The menstrual cycle is controlled by negative and positive feedback mechanisms involving ovarian and pituitary hormones. In positive feedback, rising levels of hormones feedback to increase hormone production. Positive feedback mechanisms regulate ovulation.During days 12–14, there is a dramatic increase in estrogen produced by the preovulatory follicle. The very high levels of estrogen (along with the absence of progesterone) provides positive feedback to the pituitary gland, initiating a rapid rise in the production of follicle stimulating and luteinizing hormones. This ""LH surge"" is what triggers ovulation. Annotate a graph of follicle stimulating hormone levels during the menstrual cycle.Understanding: The menstrual cycle is controlled by negative and positive feedback mechanisms involving ovarian and pituitary hormones. X axis = day of menstrual cycle (0-28)Y axis = relative hormone levelFSH has the lowest levels relative to the other hormones. Day 0-5: (low estrogen negative feedback causes) gradual increase in FSH leads to follicle growth.Day 6-11: gradual decrease in FSH due to dominant follicle secreting estrogen (estrogen negative feedback on FSH). Day 12-14: increase in FSH to peak at ovulation (due to high estrogen positive feedback).Day 14-19: decrease in FSH to lowest level (due to loss of high estrogen positive feedback after ovulation).Days 20-28: FSH remains at lowest level (as estrogen from the corpus luteum provides negative feedback). Annotate a graph of luteinizing hormone levels during the menstrual cycle.Understanding: The menstrual cycle is controlled by negative and positive feedback mechanisms involving ovarian and pituitary hormones. X axis = day of menstrual cycle (0-28)Y axis = relative hormone levelDay 0-9: LH levels remain low (estrogen negative feedback on pituitary hormones). Day 10-14: LH surges to peak level (due to high estrogen positive feedback) and triggers ovulation.Day 15-18: LH drops (due to loss of high estrogen positive feedback after ovulation).Day 19-28: LH levels remain low (estrogen negative feedback on pituitary hormones). Annotate a graph of estrogen hormone levels during the menstrual cycle.Understanding: The menstrual cycle is controlled by negative and positive feedback mechanisms involving ovarian and pituitary hormones. X axis = day of menstrual cycle (0-28)Y axis = relative hormone levelDay 0-8: gradual increase in estrogen as FSH stimulates follicles to grow and secrete estrogen.Day 9-11: steeper increase to the estrogen peak as the dominant follicle grows (this increase activates positive feedback on FSH and LH which leads to ovulation).Day 12-19: drop in estrogen levels as follicle ruptures and develops in to the corpus luteum.Day 20-25: increase in estrogen as the corpus luteum secretes the hormone to prepare the uterus for a pregnancy.Day 25-28: without a pregnancy, estrogen levels drop as the corpus luteum degrades (eventually triggering menstruation). Annotate a graph of progesterone hormone levels during the menstrual cycle.Understanding: The menstrual cycle is controlled by negative and positive feedback mechanisms involving ovarian and pituitary hormones. X axis = day of menstrual cycle (0-28)Y axis = relative hormone levelDay 0-14: low levels of progesterone (since there is no corpus luteum to produce it).Day 15-25: increase in progesterone as the corpus luteum secretes the hormone to prepare the uterus for a pregnancy.Day 25-28: without a pregnancy, progesterone levels drop as the corpus luteum degrades. Name the two pituitary hormones that control the menstrual cycle.Understanding: The menstrual cycle is controlled by negative and positive feedback mechanisms involving ovarian and pituitary hormones. Follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) are the two hormones that are released from the anterior pituitary and control the menstrual cycle. FSH and LH are protein hormones. Name the two ovarian hormones that control the menstrual cycle.Understanding: The menstrual cycle is controlled by negative and positive feedback mechanisms involving ovarian and pituitary hormones. Estrogen and progesterone are the two hormones that are released from the ovary and control the menstrual cycle. Estrogen and progesterone are steroid hormones. Define ""ovulation.""Understanding: The menstrual cycle is controlled by negative and positive feedback mechanisms involving ovarian and pituitary hormones. Ovulation is the release of a mature egg from the surface of the ovary. This usually occurs mid-cycle, around day 14 of the average 28 day cycle. Ovulation is triggered by high levels of luteinizing hormone. Define ""menstrual cycle.""Understanding: The menstrual cycle is controlled by negative and positive feedback mechanisms involving ovarian and pituitary hormones. The menstrual cycle is the pattern of changes in the ovary and uterus that occurs in the human female reproductive system and which makes pregnancy possible. The cycle starts on the first day of a menstrual period and averages 28 days long. Outline the cause of Type I diabetes.Application: Causes and treatment of Type I and Type II diabetes. Type 1 diabetes occurs when the pancreatic beta cells are destroyed by an autoimmune process due to a genetic disorder. Because the pancreatic beta cells sense plasma glucose levels and respond by releasing insulin, individuals with type 1 diabetes have a reduced or complete lack of insulin. Type 1 diabetes is often diagnosed in childhood. With this disease, daily injections of insulin are needed. Outline the cause of Type II diabetes.Application: Causes and treatment of Type I and Type II diabetes. Type 2 diabetes occurs when the pancreas does not produce enough insulin for the amount of circulating glucose in the blood and/or the target cells do not respond effectively to normal levels of insulin, a condition termed insulin resistance. Type 2 diabetes is due to a combination of genetic and lifestyle factors. Type 2 diabetes is far more common than type 1. Type 2 diabetes is becoming more common due to increasing obesity and failure to exercise, both of which contribute to insulin resistance. Distinguish between treatment of type I and type II diabetes.​Application: Causes and treatment of Type I and Type II diabetes. Controlling blood glucose levels is the major goal of diabetes treatment. Type 1 diabetes is managed with insulin injections and diet management. Type 2 diabetes is first managed with dietary changes, weight reduction and exercise. Diabetes medications are prescribed when these measures fail to control the elevated blood sugars of type 2 diabetes. If other medications become ineffective treatment with insulin may be initiated. Outline the role of medical insulin the treatment of diabetes.Application: Causes and treatment of Type I and Type II diabetes. Before the availability of medical insulin, the life expectancy of children with type 1 diabetes was short and the prognosis for the adult onset type 2 diabetes was very poor. The discovery of insulin in 1922 marked a major breakthrough in medicine for treatment of patients with diabetes. Medical insulin was initially isolated from animal pancreas but the potency varied and the supply fell short of the demand. In the early 1980's, recombinant DNA human insulin was prepared by adding the human insulin genes for expression in Escherichia coli. Insulin continues to be the primary therapy used in diabetes treatment. Out the effects of diabetes on the body.Application: Causes and treatment of Type I and Type II diabetes. With diabetes, the pancreas either produces no insulin, too little insulin or the cells become resistant to the insulin. All of these causes allows blood glucose levels to rise while depriving the body cells of the much-needed glucose energy source. This can lead to a wide variety of problems affecting nearly every major body system. The most common long-term diabetes-related health effects are: -damage to the large blood vessels of the heart, brain and legs -damage to the small blood vessels, causing problems in the eyes, kidneys, feet and nerves Discuss the use of leptin to treat human obesity.Application: Testing of leptin on patients with clinical obesity and reasons for the failure to control the disease. Leptin is a hormone that is secreted from adipocytes that acts on target cells in the hypothalamus and functions to suppress appetite and increase energy expenditure. Inheriting mutations of the OB gene (ob/ob; homozygous recessive) can lead to obesity because the leptin protein is not made. Leptin has been successfully used in the treatment of leptin-deficient obese patients. However...… injections of leptin must occur multiple times a day.… leptin injection affect the development and functioning of the reproductive systems.… weight loss with leptin treatment was immediately regained when treatment stopped....injections irritated the skin and caused swelling.… and, giving leptin to people who are obese due to leptin resistance (as opposed to having the leptin mutation) has no effect on weight loss. Outline role of leptin resistance in human obesity.Application: Testing of leptin on patients with clinical obesity and reasons for the failure to control the disease. Leptin is a hormone that is secreted from adipocytes that acts on target cells in the hypothalamus and functions to suppress appetite and increase energy expenditure.Most obese people produce plenty of leptin, but their bodies fail to respond to it. The leptin is secreted but the receptor proteins in the hypothalamus fail to respond to it. When the hypothalamus doesn't receive the leptin signal, it erroneously thinks that the body is starving. The brain then encourages more eating and reduced energy expenditure. Define ""obesity.""Application: Testing of leptin on patients with clinical obesity and reasons for the failure to control the disease. Obesity is defined by excessive fat accumulation that presents a risk to health. A crude measure of obesity is the body mass index (BMI). A person with a BMI of 30 or more is generally considered obese. Obesity is a major risk factors for a number of chronic diseases, including diabetes, cardiovascular diseases and cancer. State symptoms of jet lag.Application: Causes of jet lag and use of melatonin to alleviate it. Jet lag is a temporary sleep problem that can affect anyone who quickly travels across multiple time zones. Jet lag can cause daytime fatigue, difficulty concentrating, a generalized unwell feeling, and gastrointestinal problems. Outline the biological cause of jet lag.Application: Causes of jet lag and use of melatonin to alleviate it. Jet lag results from the desynchronization of the body's natural circadian rhythm and environmental cues for day and night. Jet lab is caused by traveling to different time zones. Melatonin concentration is key to the body's circadian rhythm synchronizing with daylight and darkness cycles. When jet lag happens, melatonin secretion is out of sync with the environmental cues of nightime. Describe use of melatonin in treatment for jet lag.​Application: Causes of jet lag and use of melatonin to alleviate it. Melatonin pills are a commonly accepted jet lag treatment. Melatonin aids sleep during times when the body would not normally be resting, making it beneficial for people with jet lag. Define in vitro fertilization.Application: The use of IVF of drugs to suspend the normal secretion of hormones, followed by the use of artificial doses of hormones to induce superovulation and establish a pregnancy. In vitro fertilization (IVF) is a complex series of procedures used to help with fertility or prevent genetic problems and assist with the conception of a child. During IVF , mature eggs are collected from ovaries and fertilized by sperm in a lab. Outline the process of ""down-regulation"" in vitro fertilization.Application: The use of IVF of drugs to suspend the normal secretion of hormones, followed by the use of artificial doses of hormones to induce superovulation and establish a pregnancy. Down-regulation is a term to describe the process of reducing or suppressing the body's response to specific stimuli. When used with regard to in vitro fertilization (IVF), down-regulation uses drugs to suppress the natural action of FSH and LH on the ovaries so that doctors can better control ovulation and egg maturation during treatment. Down-regulation is the first step of IVF. Outline the process of ""superovulation"" in vitro fertilization.Application: The use of IVF of drugs to suspend the normal secretion of hormones, followed by the use of artificial doses of hormones to induce superovulation and establish a pregnancy. Administration of high doses of artificial FSH induces ""superovulation"", or the stimulation of the development of more than the usual number of mature follicles and hence, an increased number of mature eggs. Multiple eggs are needed because some eggs won't fertilize or develop normally after fertilization. Outline the process of ""egg retrieval"" in vitro fertilization.Application: The use of IVF of drugs to suspend the normal secretion of hormones, followed by the use of artificial doses of hormones to induce superovulation and establish a pregnancy. When the follicles are large enough, the woman is given a dose of a hormone that is similar to LH. This hormone stimulates ovulation. The eggs must be retrieved before they are released from the ovary. 34-36 hours after the drug is given, an ultrasound probe is inserted into the vagina to identify follicles. Then a thin needle is inserted through the vagina and into the follicles to retrieve the eggs. The eggs are removed from the follicles through a connected suction device. Because of superovulation, multiple eggs will be removed, typically up to 12. Not all of the eggs will be viable. Outline the process of ""fertilization"" in vitro fertilization.Application: The use of IVF of drugs to suspend the normal secretion of hormones, followed by the use of artificial doses of hormones to induce superovulation and establish a pregnancy. After retrieval, eggs that appear healthy and mature will be mixed with sperm in a dish under a dissecting microscope. The sperm may then fertilize some of the eggs. Any resulting embryos are kept in the incubator to develop for up to 6 days before they are placed into the woman's uterus. Outline the process of ""embryo transfer"" in vitro fertilization.Application: The use of IVF of drugs to suspend the normal secretion of hormones, followed by the use of artificial doses of hormones to induce superovulation and establish a pregnancy. After 2-6 days of development in an incubator, healthy fertilized eggs will have gone through multiple rounds of cell division and will have developed into an embryo. 1-2 embryos are transferred to the uterus for implantation. Prior to embryo transfer, the recipient woman is given artificial doses of estrogen and progesterone. These hormones prepare the endometrium lining of the uterus so that it becomes receptive to the embryo. Discuss the ethical issues surrounding IVF.Application: The use of IVF of drugs to suspend the normal secretion of hormones, followed by the use of artificial doses of hormones to induce superovulation and establish a pregnancy. Positive considerations: -chance for infertile couples to have children-decision to have children is clearly a conscious one -genetic screening of embryos could decrease suffering from genetic diseases-spare embryos can safely be frozen and used for future pregnancies or for stem cell researchNegative considerations: -IVF is expensive and not equally accessible to all people-success rate is relatively low -ethical or religious objections-could lead to eugenic choices-could lead to pregnancies with multiple fetuses, with associated risks-ethical dilemma of what to do with unused embryos Outline early beliefs about the process of human reproduction.Application: William Harvey’s investigation of sexual reproduction in deer. Generally, there were two historical ideas about the process of human reproduction. PreformationismPreformationism is the idea that that organisms develop from preformed, miniature versions of themselves that have existed since the beginning of creation. The new animal developed from these tiny particles that were fully formed, but smaller versions of the adult animals.EpigenesisEpigenesis proposed that the new animal develops progressively through a series of steps in which structures differentiate from each other. Aristotle was the first to propose this (correct) philosophy, however the idea was controversial until the 18th century.While Aristotle was correct in proposing epigenesis, his mechanism was incorrect! He believed that fathers contribute the essential characteristics of their offspring while mothers contribute only a material substrate, the menstrual blood. This 'soil and seed' idea was that males provide a ""seed"" which forms an egg when mixed with menstrual blood (the ""soil""). The ‘egg’ then develops into a fetus inside the mother according to the information contained within the male 'seed’ alone. Outline Harvey's methods of studying reproduction.Application: William Harvey’s investigation of sexual reproduction in deer. Renowned physician and scientist William Harvey is best known for his accurate description of how blood circulates through the body. However, he also studied chicken embryos developing in eggs, carefully documenting differentiation and the stages of embryonic development. Through his work, Harvey (1651) was able to support the idea of development through epigenesis.Harvey thought that omne vivum ex ovum, or ‘every living thing comes from an egg’. In order to support his hypothesis, Harvey thought it would be easier to observe eggs in the uterus of large mammals. He slaughtered deer that had recently mated, opened the uterus, and searched for eggs or other early signs of embryonic development. However, he was not able to observe anything in the initial stages. He did not know that the eggs were microscopic in size (strong enough microscopes were not developed for almost another 200 years)! State Harvey's discoveries about reproduction.Application: William Harvey’s investigation of sexual reproduction in deer. Harvey's (1651) observations of developing chicken embryos provided support for the idea of epigenesis (development progresses through a series of steps in which structures differentiate from each other). However, Harvey contradicted many of Aristotle's fundamental ideas on the matter. He correctly came to the conclusion that menstrual blood did not contribute to the formation of a fetus and that the fetus does not develop strictly from a male ‘seed.’Harvey was also the first to speculate that humans and other mammals reproduce through the an egg. While he was incorrect in his proposed mechanism (suggesting that an egg found inside a female becomes fertilized by a kind of infection set in motion by the sexual act), Harvey's doctrine of omne vivum ex ovo (all life comes from the egg) was the first definite statement against the idea of spontaneous generation and was made nearly 200 years before a mammalian egg was observed in a microscope.

The following structures should be included on a diagram of the male reproductive system:Scrotum – shown around testesTestis/testicle - shown inside scrotumEpididymis - shown on top of the testis and connected to the vas deferensVas deferens (sperm duct) - drawn as a double line connecting the epididymis to the urethraSeminal vesicle - sac shown branched off sperm ductProstate gland - shown positioned where sperm duct connects with urethraUrethra - shown as double line linking bladder to end of penis, connecting to the vas deferens at the prostate glandPenis – shown with erectile tissue inside and with the urethra passing through it Outline the function of the testis in male reproduction.Skill: Annotate diagrams of the male and female reproductive system to show names of structures and their functions. The testicle or testis (plural testes) is the male gonad. The functions of the testes are to produce sperm and testosterone. Outline the function of the scrotum in male reproduction.Skill: Annotate diagrams of the male and female reproductive system to show names of structures and their functions. The scrotum is a suspended sack of skin and smooth muscle that is present in most terrestrial male mammals and located under the penis. The scrotum contains the testes, epididymis, and vas deferens. Outline the function of the epididymis in male reproduction.Skill: Annotate diagrams of the male and female reproductive system to show names of structures and their functions. The epididymis is a narrow, tightly coiled tube that connects a testicle to a vas deferens in the male reproductive system. It is present in all male reptiles, birds, and mammals. The epididymis is where sperm matures and develop the ability to be motile (swim). Mature sperm is stored in the epididymis until ejaculation Outline the function of the vas deferens (sperm duct) in male reproduction.Skill: Annotate diagrams of the male and female reproductive system to show names of structures and their functions. The vas deferens is a long tube through which sperm move during ejaculation. Smooth muscle in the walls of the vas deferens contracts reflexively, propelling the sperm from the epididymis to the urethra. Outline the function of the seminal vesicles in male reproduction.Skill: Annotate diagrams of the male and female reproductive system to show names of structures and their functions. The seminal vesicles are a pair of exocrine glands that secrete a significant proportion of the fluid that ultimately becomes semen.The secretions from the seminal vesicles contain fructose (provide nutrient energy for the sperm), mucus (for lubrication and immune protection), and prostaglandins (triggers uterine contractions). Outline the function of the prostate gland in male reproduction.Skill: Annotate diagrams of the male and female reproductive system to show names of structures and their functions. The prostate is a exocrine gland located between the bladder and the penis. The urethra runs through the center of the prostate, from the bladder to the penis. During ejaculation, the secretes an alkaline fluid, which helps protect sperm and prolong their life after they are deposited in the acidic environment of the vagina. The muscles of the prostate gland help propel this seminal fluid into the urethra during ejaculation . Outline the function of the urethra in male reproduction.Skill: Annotate diagrams of the male and female reproductive system to show names of structures and their functions. The male urethra is a narrow tube that conducts urine and semen from the bladder and vas deferens, respectively, to the exterior of the body via the penis. Outline the function of the penis in male reproduction.Skill: Annotate diagrams of the male and female reproductive system to show names of structures and their functions. The penis is the male organ used in sexual intercourse. The opening of the urethra, the tube that transports semen and urine, is at the tip of the penis. The glans of the penis also contains a number of sensitive nerve endings. The penis contains erectile tissue that fill with blood when the man is sexually aroused. The skin of the penis is loose and elastic to accommodate changes in penis size during an erection. Label a diagram of the female reproductive system.Skill: Annotate diagrams of the male and female reproductive system to show names of structures and their functions. The following structures should be included on a diagram of the female reproductive system:Ovary – two, shown adjacent to but not joined to the fallopian tube.Fallopian tube (oviduct) – drawn as a pair of arched tubes leading from just outside the ovary into the uterus.Uterus – drawn as an ovular pyramid with a thicker wall than the fallopian tube.Endometrium – drawn as a line on the inner lining of uterus.Cervix – shown as a constriction between the vagina and uterus.Vagina – drawn as a wide tube leading from the uterus Outline the function of the ovary in female reproduction.Skill: Annotate diagrams of the male and female reproductive system to show names of structures and their functions. The ovaries have two main reproductive functions in the body. They produce oocytes (eggs) for fertilization and they produce the reproductive hormones, estrogen and progesterone. Outline the function of the fallopian tubes (oviducts) in female reproduction.Skill: Annotate diagrams of the male and female reproductive system to show names of structures and their functions. The fallopian tubes (oviducts), are of a pair of long, narrow tubes that transport the egg from the ovary towards the uterus, transport male sperm cells to the egg and are the location of fertilization. If fertilization occurs, the zygote will continue through the fallopian tube for implantation in the uterus. Outline the function of the uterus in female reproduction.Skill: Annotate diagrams of the male and female reproductive system to show names of structures and their functions. The uterus is the hollow organ in the female reproductive system that holds a fetus during pregnancy. During pregnancy, the uterus grows and the muscles become stretched and thinner. Without the ability to expand, the human body would be unable to tolerate the rapid growth of a fetus. Outline the function of the endometrium in female reproduction.Skill: Annotate diagrams of the male and female reproductive system to show names of structures and their functions. The endometrium is the inner layer of the mammalian uterus. It thickens and then is shed during menstruation in humans and some other mammals (in most other mammals, the endometrium is reabsorbed). After fertilization, the embryo implants into the endometrium. During pregnancy, the glands and blood vessels in the endometrium further increase in size and number to support the placenta and developing fetus. Outline the function of the cervix in female reproduction.Skill: Annotate diagrams of the male and female reproductive system to show names of structures and their functions. The cervix is the lowermost part of the uterus and is made up of strong muscles. The function of the cervix is to allow flow of menstrual blood from the uterus into the vagina, and direct the sperms into the uterus during intercourse. Outline the function of the vagina in female reproduction.Skill: Annotate diagrams of the male and female reproductive system to show names of structures and their functions. The vagina is a muscular canal lined with nerves and mucus membranes. It connects the uterus and cervix to the outside of the body, allowing for menstruation, intercourse, and childbirth. Describe how Harvey was limited in his reproduction research given the tools available at the time.​Nature of Science: Developments in scientific research follow improvements in apparatus- William Harvey was hampered in his observational research into reproduction by lack of equipment. The microscope was invented 17 years after his death. Working in the mid 1600's, William Harvey did not have the tools required for visualizing mammalian egg cells. The microscope was invented 17 years after his death, and a compound microscope with the magnification required for visualizing mammalian egg cells would not be developed for about 200 more years! So, Harvey used a simple hand lens while observing deer reproductive structures. Given the technology available, Harvey was unable to observe direct evidence of his omne vivum ex ovo (all life comes from the egg) hypothesis.

Adherence to the recommendedfollitropin alfa dosage and regimen of administration, and careful monitoring of therapy will minimise the incidence of such events. For accurate interpretation of the indices of follicle development and maturation, the physician should be experienced in the interpretation of the relevant tests. In clinical trials, an increase of the ovarian sensitivity to follitropin alfa was shown when administered with lutropin alfa. If an FSH dose increase is deemed appropriate, dose adaptation should preferably be at 7-14 day intervals and preferably with 37.5-75 IU increments. No direct comparison of follitropin alfa/LH versus humanmenopausal gonadotropin (hMG) has been performed. Comparison with historicaldata suggests that the ovulation rate obtained with follitropin alfa/LH issimilar to that obtained with hMG. The most commonly reported adverse reactions are headache, ovariancysts and local injection site reactions (e.g. pain, erythema, haematoma,swelling and/or irritation at the site of injection). Mild or moderate ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) has beencommonly reported and should be considered as an intrinsic risk of thestimulation procedure.

Stimulation of multifollicular development in patients undergoing superovulation for assisted reproductive technologies (ART) such as fertilisation (IVF), gamete intra-fallopian transfer (GIFT) and zygote intra-fallopian transfer (ZIFT). Follitropin alfa in association with a luteinising hormone (LH) preparation is recommended for the stimulation of follicular development in women with severe LH and FSH deficiency. In clinical trials these patients were defined by an endogenous serum LH level < 1.2 IU/. Follitropin alfa is indicated for the stimulation of spermatogenesis in men who have congenital or acquired hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism with concomitant human Chorionic Gonadotrophin (hCG) therapy. Treatment with Bemfola should be initiated under the supervision of a physician experienced in the treatment of fertility disorders. Patients must be provided with the correct number of pens for their treatment course and educated to use the proper injection techniques. The dose recommendations given for follitropin alfa are those in use for urinary FSH. Clinical assessment of follitropin alfa indicates that its daily doses, regimens of administration and treatment monitoring procedures should not be different from those currently used for urinary FSH-containing medicinal products. It is advised to adhere to the recommended starting doses indicated below. Comparative clinical studies have shown that on average patients require a lower cumulative dose and shorter treatment duration with follitropin alfa compared with urinary FSH. Therefore, it is considered appropriate to give a lower total dose of follitropin alfa than generally used for urinary FSH, not only in order to optimise follicular development but also to minimise the risk of unwanted ovarian hyperstimulation (see section 5.1). Women with anovulation (including polycystic ovarian syndrome) Bemfola may be given as a course of daily injections. In menstruating women treatment should commence within the first 7 days of the menstrual cycle. A commonly used regimen commences at 75-150 IU FSH daily and is increased preferably by 37.5 or 75 IU at 7 or preferably 14 day intervals if necessary, to obtain an adequate, but not excessive, response. Treatment should be tailored to the individual patient’s response as assessed by measuring follicle size by ultrasound and/or oestrogen secretion. The maximal daily dose is usually not higher than 225 IU FSH. If a patient fails to respond adequately after 4 weeks of treatment, that cycle should be abandoned and the patient should undergo further evaluation after which she may recommence treatment at a higher starting dose than in the abandoned cycle. When an optimal response is obtained, a single injection of 250 micrograms r-hCG) or 5,000 IU up to 10,000 IU hCG should be administered 24‑48 hours after the last follitropin alfa injection. The patient is recommended to have coitus on the day of, and the day following, hCG administration. Alternatively intrauterine insemination (IUI) may be performed. If an excessive response is obtained, treatment should be stopped and hCG withheld (see section 4.4). Treatment should recommence in the next cycle at a dose lower than that of the previous cycle. Women undergoing ovarian stimulation for multiple follicular development prior to in vitro fertilisation or other assisted reproductive technologies A commonly used regimen for superovulation involves the administration of 150-225 IU of follitropin alfa daily commencing on days 2 or 3 of the cycle. Treatment is continued until adequate follicular development has been achieved (as assessed by monitoring of serum strogen concentrations and/or ultrasound examination), with the dose adjusted according to the patient's response, to usually not higher than 450 IU daily. In general adequate follicular development is achieved on average by the tenth day of treatment (range 5 to 20 days). A single injection of 250 micrograms r-hCG or 5,000 IU up to 10,000 IU hCG is administered 24‑48 hours after the last follitropin alfa injection to induce final follicular maturation. Down-regulation with a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist or antagonist is now commonly used in order to suppress the endogenous LH surge and to control tonic levels of LH. In a commonly used protocol, follitropin alfa is started approximately 2 weeks after the start of agonist treatment, both being continued until adequate follicular development is achieved. For example, following two weeks of treatment with an agonist, 150-225 IU follitropin alfa are administered for the first 7 days. The dose is then adjusted according to the ovarian response. Overall experience with IVF indicates that in general the treatment success rate remains stable during the first four attempts and gradually declines thereafter. Women with anovulation resulting from severe LH and FSH deficiency In LH and FSH deficient women (hypogonadotropic hypogonadism), the objective of Bemfola therapy in association with lutropin alfa is to develop a single mature Graafian follicle from which the oocyte will be liberated after the administration of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). Follitropin alfa should be given as a course of daily injections simultaneously with lutropin alfa. Since these patients are amenorrhoeic and have low endogenous strogen secretion, treatment can commence at any time. A recommended regimen commences at 75 IU of lutropin alfa daily with 75-150 IU FSH. Treatment should be tailored to the individual patient's response as assessed by measuring follicle size by ultrasound and oestrogen response. If an FSH dose increase is deemed appropriate, dose adaptation should preferably be after 7-14 day intervals and preferably by 37.5-75 IU increments. It may be acceptable to extend the duration of stimulation in any one cycle to up to 5 weeks. When an optimal response is obtained, a single injection of 250 micrograms r-hCG or 5,000 IU up to 10,000 IU hCG should be administered 24-48 hours after the last follitropin alfa and lutropin alfa injections. The patient is recommended to have coitus on the day of, and on the day following, hCG administration. Luteal phase support may be considered since lack of substances with luteotrophic activity (LH/hCG) after ovulation may lead to premature failure of the corpus luteum. If an excessive response is obtained, treatment should be stopped and hCG withheld. Treatment should recommence in the next cycle at a dose of FSH lower than that of the previous cycle. Bemfola should be given at a dose of 150 IU three times a week, concomitantly with hCG, for a minimum of 4 months. If after this period, the patient has not responded, the combination treatment may be continued; current clinical experience indicates that treatment for at least 18 months may be necessary to achieve spermatogenesis. There is no relevant use of follitropin alfa in the elderly population. Safety and effectiveness of follitropin alfa in elderly patients have not been established. Safety, efficacy and pharmacokinetics of follitropin alfa in patients with renal or hepatic impairment have not been established. There is no relevant use of follitropin alfa in the paediatric population. Bemfola is intended for subcutaneous administration. The first injection of Bemfola should be performed under direct medical supervision. Self-administration of Bemfola should only be performed by patients who are well motivated, adequately trained and have access to expert advice. single-dose cartridge is intended for only one injection, clear instructions should be provided to the patients to avoid misuse of the single dose presentation.

Gonadotropin therapy requires a certain time commitment by physicians and supportive health professionals, as well as the availability of appropriate monitoring facilities. In women, safe and effective use of follitropin alfa calls for monitoring of ovarian response with ultrasound, alone or preferably in combination with measurement of serum stradiol levels, on a regular basis. There may be a degree of interpatient variability in response to FSH administration, with a poor response to FSH in some patients . The lowest effective dose in relation to the treatment objective should be used in both men and women. Patients with porphyria or a family history of porphyria should be closely monitored during treatment with follitropin alfa. Deterioration or a first appearance of this condition may require cessation of treatment. Before starting treatment, the couple's infertility should be assessed as appropriate and putative contraindications for pregnancy evaluated. In particular, patients should be evaluated for hypothyroidism, adrenocortical deficiency, hyperprolactinemia and appropriate specific treatment given. Patients undergoing stimulation of follicular growth, whether as treatment for anovulatory infertility or ART procedures, may experience ovarian enlargement or develop hyperstimulation. Adherence to the recommended follitropin alfa dosage and regimen of administration, and careful monitoring of therapy will minimise the incidence of such events. For accurate interpretation of the indices of follicle development and maturation, the physician should be experienced in the interpretation of the relevant tests. In clinical trials, an increase of the ovarian sensitivity to follitropin alfa was shown when administered with lutropin alfa. If an FSH dose increase is deemed appropriate, dose adaptation should preferably be at 7-14 day intervals and preferably with 37.5-75 IU increments. No direct comparison of follitropin alfa/LH versus human menopausal gonadotropin (hMG) has been performed. Comparison with historical data suggests that the ovulation rate obtained with follitropin alfa/LH is similar to that obtained with hMG. A certain degree of ovarian enlargement is an expected effect of controlled ovarian stimulation. It is more commonly seen in women with polycystic ovarian syndrome and usually regresses without treatment. In distinction to uncomplicated ovarian enlargement, OHSS is a condition that can manifest itself with increasing degrees of severity. It comprises marked ovarian enlargement, high serum sex steroids, and an increase in vascular permeability which can result in an accumulation of fluid in the peritoneal, pleural and, rarely, in the pericardial cavities. The following symptomatology may be observed in severe cases of OHSS: abdominal pain, abdominal distension, severe ovarian enlargement, weight gain, dyspnoea, oliguria and gastrointestinal symptoms including nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea. Clinical evaluation may reveal hypovolaemia, haemoconcentration, electrolyte imbalances, ascites, haemoperitoneum, pleural effusions, hydrothorax, or acute pulmonary distress. Very rarely, severe OHSS may be complicated by ovarian torsion or thromboembolic events such as pulmonary embolism, ischaemic stroke or myocardial infarction. Independent risk factors for developing OHSS include polycystic ovarian syndrome high absolute or rapidly rising serum oestradiol levels (e.g. > 900 pg/ in ART) and large number of developing ovarian follicles (e.g. > 3 follicles of ≥ 14 mm in diameter in anovulation; ≥ 20 follicles of ≥ 12 mm in diameter in ART). regimen of administration can minimise the risk of ovarian hyperstimulation (see sections 4.2 and 4.8). Monitoring of stimulation cycles by ultrasound scans as well as stradiol measurements are recommended to early identify risk factors. There is evidence to suggest that hCG plays a key role in triggering OHSS and that the syndrome may be more severe and more protracted if pregnancy occurs. Therefore, if signs of ovarian hyperstimulation occur such as and/or ≥ 40 follicles in total, it is recommended that hCG be withheld and the patient be advised to refrain from coitus or to use barrier contraceptive methods for at least 4 days. OHSS may progress rapidly (within 24 hours) or over several days to become a serious medical event. It most often occurs after hormonal treatment has been discontinued and reaches its maximum at about seven to ten days following treatment. Therefore patients should be followed for at least two weeks after hCG administration. In ART, aspiration of all follicles prior to ovulation may reduce the occurrence of hyperstimulation. Mild or moderate OHSS usually resolves spontaneously. If severe OHSS occurs, it is recommended that gonadotropin treatment be stopped if still ongoing, and that the patient be hospitalised and appropriate therapy be started. In patients undergoing ovulation induction, the incidence of multiple pregnancy is increased compared with natural conception. The majority of multiple an increased risk of adverse maternal and perinatal outcomes. multiple pregnancy, careful monitoring of ovarian response is recommended. In patients undergoing ART procedures the risk of multiple pregnancy is related mainly to the number of embryos placed, their quality and the patient age. The patients should be advised of the potential risk of multiple before starting treatment. The incidence of pregnancy loss by miscarriage or abortion is higher in patients undergoing stimulation of follicular growth for ovulation induction or ART than following natural conception. Women with a history of tubal disease are at risk of ectopic pregnancy, whether the pregnancy is obtained by spontaneous conception or with fertility treatments. The prevalence of ectopic pregnancy after ART was reported to be higher than in the general population. There have been reports of ovarian and other reproductive system neoplasms, both benign and malignant, in women who have undergone multiple treatment regimens for infertility treatment. It is not yet established whether or not treatment with gonadotropins increases the risk of these tumours in infertile women. The prevalence of congenital malformations after ART may be slightly higher than after spontaneous conceptions. This is thought to be due to differences in parental characteristics (e.g. maternal age, sperm characteristics) and multiple pregnancies. In women with recent or ongoing thromboembolic disease or women with generally recognised risk factors for thromboembolic events, such as personal or family history, treatment with gonadotropins may further increase the risk for aggravation or occurrence of such events. In these women, the benefits of gonadotropin administration need to be weighed against the risks. It should be noted however that pregnancy itself as well as OHSS also carry an increased risk of thromboembolic events. Elevated endogenous FSH levels are indicative of primary testicular failure. Such patients are unresponsive to follitropin alfa/hCG therapy. Follitropin alfa should not be used when an effective response cannot be obtained. Semen analysis is recommended 4 to 6 months after the beginning of treatment as part of the assessment of the response. Bemfola contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i.e. essentially “sodium-free”. 4.5Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction Concomitant use of follitropin alfa with other medicinal products used to stimulate ovulation (e.g. hCG, clomiphene citrate) may potentiate the follicular response, whereas concurrent use of a GnRH agonist or antagonist to induce pituitary desensitisation may increase the dose of follitropin alfa needed to elicit an adequate ovarian response. No other clinically significant drug interaction has been reported during follitropin alfa therapy . Sex hormones and modulators of the genital systems, gonadotropins Bemfola is a biosimilar medicinal product, that has been demonstrated to be similar in quality, safety and efficacy to the reference medicinal product GONAL-f. More detailed information is available on the website of the European Medicines Agency In women, the most important effect resulting from parenteral administration of FSH is the development of mature Graafian follicles. In women with anovulation, the objective of therapy with follitropin alfa is to develop a single mature Graafian follicle from which the ovum will be liberated after the administration of hCG In clinical trials, patients with severe FSH and LH deficiency were defined by an endogenous serum LH level < 1.2 IU/ as measured in a central laboratory. However, it should be taken into account that there are variations between LH measurements performed in different laboratories. In clinical studies comparing r-hFSH (follitropin alfa) and urinary FSH in ART (see table 1 below) and in ovulation induction, follitropin alfa was more potent than urinary FSH in terms of a lower total dose and a shorter treatment period needed to trigger follicular maturation. In ART, follitropin alfa at a lower total dose and shorter treatment period than urinary FSH, resulted in a higher number of oocytes retrieved when compared to urinary FSH. Table 1: Results of study GF 8407 (randomised parallel group study comparing efficacy and safety of follitropin alfa with urinary FSH in assisted reproduction technologies) Total dose of FSH required (number of FSH 75 IU ampoules) Differences between the 2 groups were statistically significant (p< 0.05) for all criteria listed. In men deficient in FSH, follitropin alfa administered concomitantly with hCG for at least 4 months induces spermatogenesis. Following intravenous administration, follitropin alfa is distributed to the extracellular fluid space with an initial half-life of around 2 hours and eliminated from the body with a terminal half-life of about one day. The steady state volume of distribution and total clearance are 10  and 0.6 /h, respectively. One-eighth of the follitropin alfa dose is excreted in the urine. Following subcutaneous administration, the absolute bioavailability is about 70%. Following repeated administration, follitropin alfa accumulates 3-fold achieving a steadystate within 3-4 days. In women whose endogenous gonadotropin secretion is suppressed, follitropin alfa has nevertheless been shown to effectively stimulate follicular development and steroidogenesis, despite unmeasurable LH levels. Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of single and repeated dose toxicity and genotoxicity additional to that already stated in other sections of this SmPC. Impaired fertility has been reported in rats exposed to pharmacological doses of follitropin alfa (≥ 40 IU/kg/day) for extended periods, through reduced fecundity.  5 IU/kg/day) follitropin alfa caused a decrease in the number of viable foetuses without being teratogen, and dystocia similar to that observed with urinary enopausal onadotropin (hMG).

Adherence to the recommendedfollitropin alfa dosage and regimen of administration, and careful monitoring of therapy will minimise the incidence of such events. For accurate interpretation of the indices of follicle development and maturation, the physician should be experienced in the interpretation of the relevant tests. In clinical trials, an increase of the ovarian sensitivity to follitropin alfa was shown when administered with lutropin alfa. If an FSH dose increase is deemed appropriate, dose adaptation should preferably be at 7-14 day intervals and preferably with 37.5-75 IU increments. No direct comparison of follitropin alfa/LH versus humanmenopausal gonadotropin (hMG) has been performed. Comparison with historicaldata suggests that the ovulation rate obtained with follitropin alfa/LH issimilar to that obtained with hMG. The most commonly reported adverse reactions are headache, ovariancysts and local injection site reactions (e.g. pain, erythema, haematoma,swelling and/or irritation at the site of injection). Mild or moderate ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) has beencommonly reported and should be considered as an intrinsic risk of thestimulation procedure.

Stimulation of multifollicular development in patients undergoing superovulation for assisted reproductive technologies (ART) such as fertilisation (IVF), gamete intra-fallopian transfer (GIFT) and zygote intra-fallopian transfer (ZIFT). Follitropin alfa in association with a luteinising hormone (LH) preparation is recommended for the stimulation of follicular development in women with severe LH and FSH deficiency. In clinical trials these patients were defined by an endogenous serum LH level < 1.2 IU/. Follitropin alfa is indicated for the stimulation of spermatogenesis in men who have congenital or acquired hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism with concomitant human Chorionic Gonadotrophin (hCG) therapy. Treatment with Bemfola should be initiated under the supervision of a physician experienced in the treatment of fertility disorders. Patients must be provided with the correct number of pens for their treatment course and educated to use the proper injection techniques. The dose recommendations given for follitropin alfa are those in use for urinary FSH. Clinical assessment of follitropin alfa indicates that its daily doses, regimens of administration and treatment monitoring procedures should not be different from those currently used for urinary FSH-containing medicinal products. It is advised to adhere to the recommended starting doses indicated below. Comparative clinical studies have shown that on average patients require a lower cumulative dose and shorter treatment duration with follitropin alfa compared with urinary FSH. Therefore, it is considered appropriate to give a lower total dose of follitropin alfa than generally used for urinary FSH, not only in order to optimise follicular development but also to minimise the risk of unwanted ovarian hyperstimulation (see section 5.1). Women with anovulation (including polycystic ovarian syndrome) Bemfola may be given as a course of daily injections. In menstruating women treatment should commence within the first 7 days of the menstrual cycle. A commonly used regimen commences at 75-150 IU FSH daily and is increased preferably by 37.5 or 75 IU at 7 or preferably 14 day intervals if necessary, to obtain an adequate, but not excessive, response. Treatment should be tailored to the individual patient’s response as assessed by measuring follicle size by ultrasound and/or oestrogen secretion. The maximal daily dose is usually not higher than 225 IU FSH. If a patient fails to respond adequately after 4 weeks of treatment, that cycle should be abandoned and the patient should undergo further evaluation after which she may recommence treatment at a higher starting dose than in the abandoned cycle. When an optimal response is obtained, a single injection of 250 micrograms r-hCG) or 5,000 IU up to 10,000 IU hCG should be administered 24‑48 hours after the last follitropin alfa injection. The patient is recommended to have coitus on the day of, and the day following, hCG administration. Alternatively intrauterine insemination (IUI) may be performed. If an excessive response is obtained, treatment should be stopped and hCG withheld (see section 4.4). Treatment should recommence in the next cycle at a dose lower than that of the previous cycle. Women undergoing ovarian stimulation for multiple follicular development prior to in vitro fertilisation or other assisted reproductive technologies A commonly used regimen for superovulation involves the administration of 150-225 IU of follitropin alfa daily commencing on days 2 or 3 of the cycle. Treatment is continued until adequate follicular development has been achieved (as assessed by monitoring of serum strogen concentrations and/or ultrasound examination), with the dose adjusted according to the patient's response, to usually not higher than 450 IU daily. In general adequate follicular development is achieved on average by the tenth day of treatment (range 5 to 20 days). A single injection of 250 micrograms r-hCG or 5,000 IU up to 10,000 IU hCG is administered 24‑48 hours after the last follitropin alfa injection to induce final follicular maturation. Down-regulation with a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist or antagonist is now commonly used in order to suppress the endogenous LH surge and to control tonic levels of LH. In a commonly used protocol, follitropin alfa is started approximately 2 weeks after the start of agonist treatment, both being continued until adequate follicular development is achieved. For example, following two weeks of treatment with an agonist, 150-225 IU follitropin alfa are administered for the first 7 days. The dose is then adjusted according to the ovarian response. Overall experience with IVF indicates that in general the treatment success rate remains stable during the first four attempts and gradually declines thereafter. Women with anovulation resulting from severe LH and FSH deficiency In LH and FSH deficient women (hypogonadotropic hypogonadism), the objective of Bemfola therapy in association with lutropin alfa is to develop a single mature Graafian follicle from which the oocyte will be liberated after the administration of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). Follitropin alfa should be given as a course of daily injections simultaneously with lutropin alfa. Since these patients are amenorrhoeic and have low endogenous strogen secretion, treatment can commence at any time. A recommended regimen commences at 75 IU of lutropin alfa daily with 75-150 IU FSH. Treatment should be tailored to the individual patient's response as assessed by measuring follicle size by ultrasound and oestrogen response. If an FSH dose increase is deemed appropriate, dose adaptation should preferably be after 7-14 day intervals and preferably by 37.5-75 IU increments. It may be acceptable to extend the duration of stimulation in any one cycle to up to 5 weeks. When an optimal response is obtained, a single injection of 250 micrograms r-hCG or 5,000 IU up to 10,000 IU hCG should be administered 24-48 hours after the last follitropin alfa and lutropin alfa injections. The patient is recommended to have coitus on the day of, and on the day following, hCG administration. Luteal phase support may be considered since lack of substances with luteotrophic activity (LH/hCG) after ovulation may lead to premature failure of the corpus luteum. If an excessive response is obtained, treatment should be stopped and hCG withheld. Treatment should recommence in the next cycle at a dose of FSH lower than that of the previous cycle. Bemfola should be given at a dose of 150 IU three times a week, concomitantly with hCG, for a minimum of 4 months. If after this period, the patient has not responded, the combination treatment may be continued; current clinical experience indicates that treatment for at least 18 months may be necessary to achieve spermatogenesis. There is no relevant use of follitropin alfa in the elderly population. Safety and effectiveness of follitropin alfa in elderly patients have not been established. Safety, efficacy and pharmacokinetics of follitropin alfa in patients with renal or hepatic impairment have not been established. There is no relevant use of follitropin alfa in the paediatric population. Bemfola is intended for subcutaneous administration. The first injection of Bemfola should be performed under direct medical supervision. Self-administration of Bemfola should only be performed by patients who are well motivated, adequately trained and have access to expert advice. single-dose cartridge is intended for only one injection, clear instructions should be provided to the patients to avoid misuse of the single dose presentation.

Gonadotropin therapy requires a certain time commitment by physicians and supportive health professionals, as well as the availability of appropriate monitoring facilities. In women, safe and effective use of follitropin alfa calls for monitoring of ovarian response with ultrasound, alone or preferably in combination with measurement of serum stradiol levels, on a regular basis. There may be a degree of interpatient variability in response to FSH administration, with a poor response to FSH in some patients . The lowest effective dose in relation to the treatment objective should be used in both men and women. Patients with porphyria or a family history of porphyria should be closely monitored during treatment with follitropin alfa. Deterioration or a first appearance of this condition may require cessation of treatment. Before starting treatment, the couple's infertility should be assessed as appropriate and putative contraindications for pregnancy evaluated. In particular, patients should be evaluated for hypothyroidism, adrenocortical deficiency, hyperprolactinemia and appropriate specific treatment given. Patients undergoing stimulation of follicular growth, whether as treatment for anovulatory infertility or ART procedures, may experience ovarian enlargement or develop hyperstimulation. Adherence to the recommended follitropin alfa dosage and regimen of administration, and careful monitoring of therapy will minimise the incidence of such events. For accurate interpretation of the indices of follicle development and maturation, the physician should be experienced in the interpretation of the relevant tests. In clinical trials, an increase of the ovarian sensitivity to follitropin alfa was shown when administered with lutropin alfa. If an FSH dose increase is deemed appropriate, dose adaptation should preferably be at 7-14 day intervals and preferably with 37.5-75 IU increments. No direct comparison of follitropin alfa/LH versus human menopausal gonadotropin (hMG) has been performed. Comparison with historical data suggests that the ovulation rate obtained with follitropin alfa/LH is similar to that obtained with hMG. A certain degree of ovarian enlargement is an expected effect of controlled ovarian stimulation. It is more commonly seen in women with polycystic ovarian syndrome and usually regresses without treatment. In distinction to uncomplicated ovarian enlargement, OHSS is a condition that can manifest itself with increasing degrees of severity. It comprises marked ovarian enlargement, high serum sex steroids, and an increase in vascular permeability which can result in an accumulation of fluid in the peritoneal, pleural and, rarely, in the pericardial cavities. The following symptomatology may be observed in severe cases of OHSS: abdominal pain, abdominal distension, severe ovarian enlargement, weight gain, dyspnoea, oliguria and gastrointestinal symptoms including nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea. Clinical evaluation may reveal hypovolaemia, haemoconcentration, electrolyte imbalances, ascites, haemoperitoneum, pleural effusions, hydrothorax, or acute pulmonary distress. Very rarely, severe OHSS may be complicated by ovarian torsion or thromboembolic events such as pulmonary embolism, ischaemic stroke or myocardial infarction. Independent risk factors for developing OHSS include polycystic ovarian syndrome high absolute or rapidly rising serum oestradiol levels (e.g. > 900 pg/ in ART) and large number of developing ovarian follicles (e.g. > 3 follicles of ≥ 14 mm in diameter in anovulation; ≥ 20 follicles of ≥ 12 mm in diameter in ART). regimen of administration can minimise the risk of ovarian hyperstimulation (see sections 4.2 and 4.8). Monitoring of stimulation cycles by ultrasound scans as well as stradiol measurements are recommended to early identify risk factors. There is evidence to suggest that hCG plays a key role in triggering OHSS and that the syndrome may be more severe and more protracted if pregnancy occurs. Therefore, if signs of ovarian hyperstimulation occur such as and/or ≥ 40 follicles in total, it is recommended that hCG be withheld and the patient be advised to refrain from coitus or to use barrier contraceptive methods for at least 4 days. OHSS may progress rapidly (within 24 hours) or over several days to become a serious medical event. It most often occurs after hormonal treatment has been discontinued and reaches its maximum at about seven to ten days following treatment. Therefore patients should be followed for at least two weeks after hCG administration. In ART, aspiration of all follicles prior to ovulation may reduce the occurrence of hyperstimulation. Mild or moderate OHSS usually resolves spontaneously. If severe OHSS occurs, it is recommended that gonadotropin treatment be stopped if still ongoing, and that the patient be hospitalised and appropriate therapy be started. In patients undergoing ovulation induction, the incidence of multiple pregnancy is increased compared with natural conception. The majority of multiple an increased risk of adverse maternal and perinatal outcomes. multiple pregnancy, careful monitoring of ovarian response is recommended. In patients undergoing ART procedures the risk of multiple pregnancy is related mainly to the number of embryos placed, their quality and the patient age. The patients should be advised of the potential risk of multiple before starting treatment. The incidence of pregnancy loss by miscarriage or abortion is higher in patients undergoing stimulation of follicular growth for ovulation induction or ART than following natural conception. Women with a history of tubal disease are at risk of ectopic pregnancy, whether the pregnancy is obtained by spontaneous conception or with fertility treatments. The prevalence of ectopic pregnancy after ART was reported to be higher than in the general population. There have been reports of ovarian and other reproductive system neoplasms, both benign and malignant, in women who have undergone multiple treatment regimens for infertility treatment. It is not yet established whether or not treatment with gonadotropins increases the risk of these tumours in infertile women. The prevalence of congenital malformations after ART may be slightly higher than after spontaneous conceptions. This is thought to be due to differences in parental characteristics (e.g. maternal age, sperm characteristics) and multiple pregnancies. In women with recent or ongoing thromboembolic disease or women with generally recognised risk factors for thromboembolic events, such as personal or family history, treatment with gonadotropins may further increase the risk for aggravation or occurrence of such events. In these women, the benefits of gonadotropin administration need to be weighed against the risks. It should be noted however that pregnancy itself as well as OHSS also carry an increased risk of thromboembolic events. Elevated endogenous FSH levels are indicative of primary testicular failure. Such patients are unresponsive to follitropin alfa/hCG therapy. Follitropin alfa should not be used when an effective response cannot be obtained. Semen analysis is recommended 4 to 6 months after the beginning of treatment as part of the assessment of the response. Bemfola contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i.e. essentially “sodium-free”. 4.5Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction Concomitant use of follitropin alfa with other medicinal products used to stimulate ovulation (e.g. hCG, clomiphene citrate) may potentiate the follicular response, whereas concurrent use of a GnRH agonist or antagonist to induce pituitary desensitisation may increase the dose of follitropin alfa needed to elicit an adequate ovarian response. No other clinically significant drug interaction has been reported during follitropin alfa therapy . Sex hormones and modulators of the genital systems, gonadotropins Bemfola is a biosimilar medicinal product, that has been demonstrated to be similar in quality, safety and efficacy to the reference medicinal product GONAL-f. More detailed information is available on the website of the European Medicines Agency In women, the most important effect resulting from parenteral administration of FSH is the development of mature Graafian follicles. In women with anovulation, the objective of therapy with follitropin alfa is to develop a single mature Graafian follicle from which the ovum will be liberated after the administration of hCG In clinical trials, patients with severe FSH and LH deficiency were defined by an endogenous serum LH level < 1.2 IU/ as measured in a central laboratory. However, it should be taken into account that there are variations between LH measurements performed in different laboratories. In clinical studies comparing r-hFSH (follitropin alfa) and urinary FSH in ART (see table 1 below) and in ovulation induction, follitropin alfa was more potent than urinary FSH in terms of a lower total dose and a shorter treatment period needed to trigger follicular maturation. In ART, follitropin alfa at a lower total dose and shorter treatment period than urinary FSH, resulted in a higher number of oocytes retrieved when compared to urinary FSH. Table 1: Results of study GF 8407 (randomised parallel group study comparing efficacy and safety of follitropin alfa with urinary FSH in assisted reproduction technologies) Total dose of FSH required (number of FSH 75 IU ampoules) Differences between the 2 groups were statistically significant (p< 0.05) for all criteria listed. In men deficient in FSH, follitropin alfa administered concomitantly with hCG for at least 4 months induces spermatogenesis. Following intravenous administration, follitropin alfa is distributed to the extracellular fluid space with an initial half-life of around 2 hours and eliminated from the body with a terminal half-life of about one day. The steady state volume of distribution and total clearance are 10  and 0.6 /h, respectively. One-eighth of the follitropin alfa dose is excreted in the urine. Following subcutaneous administration, the absolute bioavailability is about 70%. Following repeated administration, follitropin alfa accumulates 3-fold achieving a steadystate within 3-4 days. In women whose endogenous gonadotropin secretion is suppressed, follitropin alfa has nevertheless been shown to effectively stimulate follicular development and steroidogenesis, despite unmeasurable LH levels. Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of single and repeated dose toxicity and genotoxicity additional to that already stated in other sections of this SmPC. Impaired fertility has been reported in rats exposed to pharmacological doses of follitropin alfa (≥ 40 IU/kg/day) for extended periods, through reduced fecundity.  5 IU/kg/day) follitropin alfa caused a decrease in the number of viable foetuses without being teratogen, and dystocia similar to that observed with urinary enopausal onadotropin (hMG).

Therefore, it is considered appropriate to give a lower total dose of follitropin alfa than generally used for urinary FSH, not only in order to optimise follicular development but also to minimise the risk of unwanted ovarian hyperstimulation (see section 5.1). Women with anovulation (including polycystic ovarian syndrome) Bemfola may be given as a course of daily injections. In menstruating women treatment should commence within the first 7 days of the menstrual cycle. A commonly used regimen commences at 75-150 IU FSH daily and is increased preferably by 37.5 or 75 IU at 7 or preferably 14 day intervals if necessary, to obtain an adequate, but not excessive, response. Treatment should be tailored to the individual patient’s response as assessed by measuring follicle size by ultrasound and/or oestrogen secretion. The maximal daily dose is usually not higher than 225 IU FSH. If a patient fails to respond adequately after 4 weeks of treatment, that cycle should be abandoned and the patient should undergo further evaluation after which she may recommence treatment at a higher starting dose than in the abandoned cycle. When an optimal response is obtained, a single injection of 250 micrograms r-hCG) or 5,000 IU up to 10,000 IU hCG should be administered 24‑48 hours after the last follitropin alfa injection. The patient is recommended to have coitus on the day of, and the day following, hCG administration. Alternatively intrauterine insemination (IUI) may be performed. If an excessive response is obtained, treatment should be stopped and hCG withheld (see section 4.4). Treatment should recommence in the next cycle at a dose lower than that of the previous cycle. Women undergoing ovarian stimulation for multiple follicular development prior to in vitro fertilisation or other assisted reproductive technologies A commonly used regimen for superovulation involves the administration of 150-225 IU of follitropin alfa daily commencing on days 2 or 3 of the cycle. Treatment is continued until adequate follicular development has been achieved (as assessed by monitoring of serum strogen concentrations and/or ultrasound examination), with the dose adjusted according to the patient's response, to usually not higher than 450 IU daily. In general adequate follicular development is achieved on average by the tenth day of treatment (range 5 to 20 days). A single injection of 250 micrograms r-hCG or 5,000 IU up to 10,000 IU hCG is administered 24‑48 hours after the last follitropin alfa injection to induce final follicular maturation. Down-regulation with a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist or antagonist is now commonly used in order to suppress the endogenous LH surge and to control tonic levels of LH. In a commonly used protocol, follitropin alfa is started approximately 2 weeks after the start of agonist treatment, both being continued until adequate follicular development is achieved. For example, following two weeks of treatment with an agonist, 150-225 IU follitropin alfa are administered for the first 7 days. The dose is then adjusted according to the ovarian response. Overall experience with IVF indicates that in general the treatment success rate remains stable during the first four attempts and gradually declines thereafter. Women with anovulation resulting from severe LH and FSH deficiency In LH and FSH deficient women (hypogonadotropic hypogonadism), the objective of Bemfola therapy in association with lutropin alfa is to develop a single mature Graafian follicle from which the oocyte will be liberated after the administration of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). Follitropin alfa should be given as a course of daily injections simultaneously with lutropin alfa. Since these patients are amenorrhoeic and have low endogenous strogen secretion, treatment can commence at any time. A recommended regimen commences at 75 IU of lutropin alfa daily with 75-150 IU FSH. Treatment should be tailored to the individual patient's response as assessed by measuring follicle size by ultrasound and oestrogen response. If an FSH dose increase is deemed appropriate, dose adaptation should preferably be after 7-14 day intervals and preferably by 37.5-75 IU increments. It may be acceptable to extend the duration of stimulation in any one cycle to up to 5 weeks. When an optimal response is obtained, a single injection of 250 micrograms r-hCG or 5,000 IU up to 10,000 IU hCG should be administered 24-48 hours after the last follitropin alfa and lutropin alfa injections. The patient is recommended to have coitus on the day of, and on the day following, hCG administration. Luteal phase support may be considered since lack of substances with luteotrophic activity (LH/hCG) after ovulation may lead to premature failure of the corpus luteum. If an excessive response is obtained, treatment should be stopped and hCG withheld. Treatment should recommence in the next cycle at a dose of FSH lower than that of the previous cycle. Bemfola should be given at a dose of 150 IU three times a week, concomitantly with hCG, for a minimum of 4 months. If after this period, the patient has not responded, the combination treatment may be continued; current clinical experience indicates that treatment for at least 18 months may be necessary to achieve spermatogenesis. There is no relevant use of follitropin alfa in the elderly population. Safety and effectiveness of follitropin alfa in elderly patients have not been established. Safety, efficacy and pharmacokinetics of follitropin alfa in patients with renal or hepatic impairment have not been established. There is no relevant use of follitropin alfa in the paediatric population. Bemfola is intended for subcutaneous administration. The first injection of Bemfola should be performed under direct medical supervision. Self-administration of Bemfola should only be performed by patients who are well motivated, adequately trained and have access to expert advice. single-dose cartridge is intended for only one injection, clear instructions should be provided to the patients to avoid misuse of the single dose presentation. For instructions on the administration with the pre-filled pen, see section 6.6 and the package leaflet. •hypersensitivity to the active substance follitropin alfa, FSH or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1; •tumours of the hypothalamus or pituitary gland; •ovarian enlargement or ovarian cyst not due to polycystic ovarian syndrome; •gynaecological haemorrhages of unknown aetiology; Follitropin alfa must not be used when an effective response cannot be obtained, such as •malformations of sexual organs incompatible with pregnancy; •fibroid tumours of the uterus incompatible with pregnancy; Follitropin alfa is a potent gonadotrophic substance capable of causing mild to severe adverse reactions, and should only be used by physicians who are thoroughly familiar with infertility problems and their management. Gonadotropin therapy requires a certain time commitment by physicians and supportive health professionals, as well as the availability of appropriate monitoring facilities. In women, safe and effective use of follitropin alfa calls for monitoring of ovarian response with ultrasound, alone or preferably in combination with measurement of serum stradiol levels, on a regular basis. There may be a degree of interpatient variability in response to FSH administration, with a poor response to FSH in some patients . The lowest effective dose in relation to the treatment objective should be used in both men and women. Patients with porphyria or a family history of porphyria should be closely monitored during treatment with follitropin alfa. Deterioration or a first appearance of this condition may require cessation of treatment. Before starting treatment, the couple's infertility should be assessed as appropriate and putative contraindications for pregnancy evaluated. In particular, patients should be evaluated for hypothyroidism, adrenocortical deficiency, hyperprolactinemia and appropriate specific treatment given. Patients undergoing stimulation of follicular growth, whether as treatment for anovulatory infertility or ART procedures, may experience ovarian enlargement or develop hyperstimulation. Adherence to the recommended follitropin alfa dosage and regimen of administration, and careful monitoring of therapy will minimise the incidence of such events. For accurate interpretation of the indices of follicle development and maturation, the physician should be experienced in the interpretation of the relevant tests. In clinical trials, an increase of the ovarian sensitivity to follitropin alfa was shown when administered with lutropin alfa. If an FSH dose increase is deemed appropriate, dose adaptation should preferably be at 7-14 day intervals and preferably with 37.5-75 IU increments. No direct comparison of follitropin alfa/LH versus human menopausal gonadotropin (hMG) has been performed. Comparison with historical data suggests that the ovulation rate obtained with follitropin alfa/LH is similar to that obtained with hMG. A certain degree of ovarian enlargement is an expected effect of controlled ovarian stimulation. It is more commonly seen in women with polycystic ovarian syndrome and usually regresses without treatment. In distinction to uncomplicated ovarian enlargement, OHSS is a condition that can manifest itself with increasing degrees of severity. It comprises marked ovarian enlargement, high serum sex steroids, and an increase in vascular permeability which can result in an accumulation of fluid in the peritoneal, pleural and, rarely, in the pericardial cavities. The following symptomatology may be observed in severe cases of OHSS: abdominal pain, abdominal distension, severe ovarian enlargement, weight gain, dyspnoea, oliguria and gastrointestinal symptoms including nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea. Clinical evaluation may reveal hypovolaemia, haemoconcentration, electrolyte imbalances, ascites, haemoperitoneum, pleural effusions, hydrothorax, or acute pulmonary distress. Very rarely, severe OHSS may be complicated by ovarian torsion or thromboembolic events such as pulmonary embolism, ischaemic stroke or myocardial infarction. Independent risk factors for developing OHSS include polycystic ovarian syndrome high absolute or rapidly rising serum oestradiol levels (e.g. > 900 pg/ in ART) and large number of developing ovarian follicles (e.g. > 3 follicles of ≥ 14 mm in diameter in anovulation; ≥ 20 follicles of ≥ 12 mm in diameter in ART). regimen of administration can minimise the risk of ovarian hyperstimulation (see sections 4.2 and 4.8). Monitoring of stimulation cycles by ultrasound scans as well as stradiol measurements are recommended to early identify risk factors. There is evidence to suggest that hCG plays a key role in triggering OHSS and that the syndrome may be more severe and more protracted if pregnancy occurs. Therefore, if signs of ovarian hyperstimulation occur such as and/or ≥ 40 follicles in total, it is recommended that hCG be withheld and the patient be advised to refrain from coitus or to use barrier contraceptive methods for at least 4 days. OHSS may progress rapidly (within 24 hours) or over several days to become a serious medical event. It most often occurs after hormonal treatment has been discontinued and reaches its maximum at about seven to ten days following treatment. Therefore patients should be followed for at least two weeks after hCG administration. In ART, aspiration of all follicles prior to ovulation may reduce the occurrence of hyperstimulation. Mild or moderate OHSS usually resolves spontaneously. If severe OHSS occurs, it is recommended that gonadotropin treatment be stopped if still ongoing, and that the patient be hospitalised and appropriate therapy be started. In patients undergoing ovulation induction, the incidence of multiple pregnancy is increased compared with natural conception. The majority of multiple an increased risk of adverse maternal and perinatal outcomes. multiple pregnancy, careful monitoring of ovarian response is recommended. In patients undergoing ART procedures the risk of multiple pregnancy is related mainly to the number of embryos placed, their quality and the patient age. The patients should be advised of the potential risk of multiple before starting treatment. The incidence of pregnancy loss by miscarriage or abortion is higher in patients undergoing stimulation of follicular growth for ovulation induction or ART than following natural conception. Women with a history of tubal disease are at risk of ectopic pregnancy, whether the pregnancy is obtained by spontaneous conception or with fertility treatments. The prevalence of ectopic pregnancy after ART was reported to be higher than in the general population. There have been reports of ovarian and other reproductive system neoplasms, both benign and malignant, in women who have undergone multiple treatment regimens for infertility treatment. It is not yet established whether or not treatment with gonadotropins increases the risk of these tumours in infertile women. The prevalence of congenital malformations after ART may be slightly higher than after spontaneous conceptions. This is thought to be due to differences in parental characteristics (e.g. maternal age, sperm characteristics) and multiple pregnancies. In women with recent or ongoing thromboembolic disease or women with generally recognised risk factors for thromboembolic events, such as personal or family history, treatment with gonadotropins may further increase the risk for aggravation or occurrence of such events. In these women, the benefits of gonadotropin administration need to be weighed against the risks. It should be noted however that pregnancy itself as well as OHSS also carry an increased risk of thromboembolic events. Elevated endogenous FSH levels are indicative of primary testicular failure. Such patients are unresponsive to follitropin alfa/hCG therapy. Follitropin alfa should not be used when an effective response cannot be obtained. Semen analysis is recommended 4 to 6 months after the beginning of treatment as part of the assessment of the response. Bemfola contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i.e. essentially “sodium-free”. 4.5Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction Concomitant use of follitropin alfa with other medicinal products used to stimulate ovulation (e.g. hCG, clomiphene citrate) may potentiate the follicular response, whereas concurrent use of a GnRH agonist or antagonist to induce pituitary desensitisation may increase the dose of follitropin alfa needed to elicit an adequate ovarian response. No other clinically significant drug interaction has been reported during follitropin alfa therapy . Sex hormones and modulators of the genital systems, gonadotropins Bemfola is a biosimilar medicinal product, that has been demonstrated to be similar in quality, safety and efficacy to the reference medicinal product GONAL-f. More detailed information is available on the website of the European Medicines Agency In women, the most important effect resulting from parenteral administration of FSH is the development of mature Graafian follicles. In women with anovulation, the objective of therapy with follitropin alfa is to develop a single mature Graafian follicle from which the ovum will be liberated after the administration of hCG In clinical trials, patients with severe FSH and LH deficiency were defined by an endogenous serum LH level < 1.2 IU/ as measured in a central laboratory. However, it should be taken into account that there are variations between LH measurements performed in different laboratories. In clinical studies comparing r-hFSH (follitropin alfa) and urinary FSH in ART (see table 1 below) and in ovulation induction, follitropin alfa was more potent than urinary FSH in terms of a lower total dose and a shorter treatment period needed to trigger follicular maturation. In ART, follitropin alfa at a lower total dose and shorter treatment period than urinary FSH, resulted in a higher number of oocytes retrieved when compared to urinary FSH. Table 1: Results of study GF 8407 (randomised parallel group study comparing efficacy and safety of follitropin alfa with urinary FSH in assisted reproduction technologies) Total dose of FSH required (number of FSH 75 IU ampoules) Differences between the 2 groups were statistically significant (p< 0.05) for all criteria listed. In men deficient in FSH, follitropin alfa administered concomitantly with hCG for at least 4 months induces spermatogenesis. Following intravenous administration, follitropin alfa is distributed to the extracellular fluid space with an initial half-life of around 2 hours and eliminated from the body with a terminal half-life of about one day. The steady state volume of distribution and total clearance are 10  and 0.6 /h, respectively. One-eighth of the follitropin alfa dose is excreted in the urine. Following subcutaneous administration, the absolute bioavailability is about 70%. Following repeated administration, follitropin alfa accumulates 3-fold achieving a steadystate within 3-4 days. In women whose endogenous gonadotropin secretion is suppressed, follitropin alfa has nevertheless been shown to effectively stimulate follicular development and steroidogenesis, despite unmeasurable LH levels. Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of single and repeated dose toxicity and genotoxicity additional to that already stated in other sections of this SmPC. Impaired fertility has been reported in rats exposed to pharmacological doses of follitropin alfa (≥ 40 IU/kg/day) for extended periods, through reduced fecundity.  5 IU/kg/day) follitropin alfa caused a decrease in the number of viable foetuses without being teratogen, and dystocia similar to that observed with urinary enopausal onadotropin (hMG).

Stimulation of multifollicular development in patients undergoing superovulation for assisted reproductive technologies (ART) such as fertilisation (IVF), gamete intra-fallopian transfer (GIFT) and zygote intra-fallopian transfer (ZIFT). Follitropin alfa in association with a luteinising hormone (LH) preparation is recommended for the stimulation of follicular development in women with severe LH and FSH deficiency. In clinical trials these patients were defined by an endogenous serum LH level < 1.2 IU/. Follitropin alfa is indicated for the stimulation of spermatogenesis in men who have congenital or acquired hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism with concomitant human Chorionic Gonadotrophin (hCG) therapy. Treatment with Bemfola should be initiated under the supervision of a physician experienced in the treatment of fertility disorders. Patients must be provided with the correct number of pens for their treatment course and educated to use the proper injection techniques. The dose recommendations given for follitropin alfa are those in use for urinary FSH. Clinical assessment of follitropin alfa indicates that its daily doses, regimens of administration and treatment monitoring procedures should not be different from those currently used for urinary FSH-containing medicinal products. It is advised to adhere to the recommended starting doses indicated below. Comparative clinical studies have shown that on average patients require a lower cumulative dose and shorter treatment duration with follitropin alfa compared with urinary FSH. Therefore, it is considered appropriate to give a lower total dose of follitropin alfa than generally used for urinary FSH, not only in order to optimise follicular development but also to minimise the risk of unwanted ovarian hyperstimulation (see section 5.1). Women with anovulation (including polycystic ovarian syndrome) Bemfola may be given as a course of daily injections. In menstruating women treatment should commence within the first 7 days of the menstrual cycle. A commonly used regimen commences at 75-150 IU FSH daily and is increased preferably by 37.5 or 75 IU at 7 or preferably 14 day intervals if necessary, to obtain an adequate, but not excessive, response. Treatment should be tailored to the individual patient’s response as assessed by measuring follicle size by ultrasound and/or oestrogen secretion. The maximal daily dose is usually not higher than 225 IU FSH. If a patient fails to respond adequately after 4 weeks of treatment, that cycle should be abandoned and the patient should undergo further evaluation after which she may recommence treatment at a higher starting dose than in the abandoned cycle. When an optimal response is obtained, a single injection of 250 micrograms r-hCG) or 5,000 IU up to 10,000 IU hCG should be administered 24‑48 hours after the last follitropin alfa injection. The patient is recommended to have coitus on the day of, and the day following hCG administration. Alternatively intrauterine insemination (IUI) may be performed. If an excessive response is obtained, treatment should be stopped and hCG withheld (see section 4.4). Treatment should recommence in the next cycle at a dose lower than that of the previous cycle. Women undergoing ovarian stimulation for multiple follicular development prior to in vitro fertilisation or other assisted reproductive technologies A commonly used regimen for superovulation involves the administration of 150-225 IU of follitropin alfa daily commencing on days 2 or 3 of the cycle. Treatment is continued until adequate follicular development has been achieved (as assessed by monitoring of serum strogen concentrations and/or ultrasound examination), with the dose adjusted according to the patient's response, to usually not higher than 450 IU daily. In general adequate follicular development is achieved on average by the tenth day of treatment (range 5 to 20 days). A single injection of 250 micrograms r-hCG or 5,000 IU up to 10,000 IU hCG is administered 24‑48 hours after the last follitropin alfa injection to induce final follicular maturation. Down-regulation with a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist or antagonist is now commonly used in order to suppress the endogenous LH surge and to control tonic levels of LH. In a commonly used protocol, follitropin alfa is started approximately 2 weeks after the start of agonist treatment, both being continued until adequate follicular development is achieved. For example, following two weeks of treatment with an agonist, 150-225 IU follitropin alfa are administered for the first 7 days. The dose is then adjusted according to the ovarian response. Overall experience with IVF indicates that in general the treatment success rate remains stable during the first four attempts and gradually declines thereafter. Women with anovulation resulting from severe LH and FSH deficiency In LH and FSH deficient women (hypogonadotropic hypogonadism), the objective of Bemfola therapy in association with lutropin alfa is to develop a single mature Graafian follicle from which the oocyte will be liberated after the administration of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). Follitropin alfa should be given as a course of daily injections simultaneously with lutropin alfa. Since these patients are amenorrhoeic and have low endogenous strogen secretion, treatment can commence at any time. A recommended regimen commences at 75 IU of lutropin alfa daily with 75-150 IU FSH. Treatment should be tailored to the individual patient's response as assessed by measuring follicle size by ultrasound and strogen response. If an FSH dose increase is deemed appropriate, dose adaptation should preferably be after 7-14 day intervals and preferably by 37.5-75 IU increments. It may be acceptable to extend the duration of stimulation in any one cycle to up to 5 weeks. When an optimal response is obtained, a single injection of 250 micrograms r-hCG or 5,000 IU up to 10,000 IU hCG should be administered 24-48 hours after the last follitropin alfa and lutropin alfa injections. The patient is recommended to have coitus on the day of, and on the day following hCG administration. Luteal phase support may be considered since lack of substances with luteotrophic activity (LH/hCG) after ovulation may lead to premature failure of the corpus luteum. If an excessive response is obtained, treatment should be stopped and hCG withheld. Treatment should recommence in the next cycle at a dose of FSH lower than that of the previous cycle. Bemfola should be given at a dose of 150 IU three times a week, concomitantly with hCG, for a minimum of 4 months. If after this period, the patient has not responded, the combination treatment may be continued; current clinical experience indicates that treatment for at least 18 months may be necessary to achieve spermatogenesis.

Gonadotropin therapy requires a certain time commitment by physicians and supportive health professionals, as well as the availability of appropriate monitoring facilities. In women, safe and effective use of follitropin alfa calls for monitoring of ovarian response with ultrasound, alone or preferably in combination with measurement of serum stradiol levels, on a regular basis. There may be a degree of interpatient variability in response to FSH administration, with a poor response to FSH in some patients . The lowest effective dose in relation to the treatment objective should be used in both men and women. Patients with porphyria or a family history of porphyria should be closely monitored during treatment with follitropin alfa. Deterioration or a first appearance of this condition may require cessation of treatment. Before starting treatment, the couple's infertility should be assessed as appropriate and putative contraindications for pregnancy evaluated. In particular, patients should be evaluated for hypothyroidism, adrenocortical deficiency, hyperprolactinemia and appropriate specific treatment given. Patients undergoing stimulation of follicular growth, whether as treatment for anovulatory infertility or ART procedures, may experience ovarian enlargement or develop hyperstimulation. Adherence to the recommended follitropin alfa dosage and regimen of administration, and careful monitoring of therapy will minimise the incidence of such events. For accurate interpretation of the indices of follicle development and maturation, the physician should be experienced in the interpretation of the relevant tests. In clinical trials, an increase of the ovarian sensitivity to follitropin alfa was shown when administered with lutropin alfa. If an FSH dose increase is deemed appropriate, dose adaptation should preferably be at 7-14 day intervals and preferably with 37.5-75 IU increments. No direct comparison of follitropin alfa/LH versus human menopausal gonadotropin (hMG) has been performed. Comparison with historical data suggests that the ovulation rate obtained with follitropin alfa/LH is similar to that obtained with hMG. A certain degree of ovarian enlargement is an expected effect of controlled ovarian stimulation. It is more commonly seen in women with polycystic ovarian syndrome and usually regresses without treatment. In distinction to uncomplicated ovarian enlargement, OHSS is a condition that can manifest itself with increasing degrees of severity. It comprises marked ovarian enlargement, high serum sex steroids, and an increase in vascular permeability which can result in an accumulation of fluid in the peritoneal, pleural and, rarely, in the pericardial cavities. The following symptomatology may be observed in severe cases of OHSS: abdominal pain, abdominal distension, severe ovarian enlargement, weight gain, dyspnoea, oliguria and gastrointestinal symptoms including nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea. Clinical evaluation may reveal hypovolaemia, haemoconcentration, electrolyte imbalances, ascites, haemoperitoneum, pleural effusions, hydrothorax, or acute pulmonary distress. Very rarely, severe OHSS may be complicated by ovarian torsion or thromboembolic events such as pulmonary embolism, ischaemic stroke or myocardial infarction. Independent risk factors for developing OHSS include polycystic ovarian syndrome high absolute or rapidly rising serum estradiol levels (e.g. > 900 pg/ in ART) and large number of developing ovarian follicles (e.g. > 3 follicles of ≥ 14 mm in diameter in anovulation; ≥ 20 follicles of ≥ 12 mm in diameter in ART). regimen of administration can minimise the risk of ovarian hyperstimulation (see sections 4.2 and 4.8). Monitoring of stimulation cycles by ultrasound scans as well as stradiol measurements are recommended to early identify risk factors. There is evidence to suggest that hCG plays a key role in triggering OHSS and that the syndrome may be more severe and more protracted if pregnancy occurs. Therefore, if signs of ovarian hyperstimulation occur such as and/or ≥ 40 follicles in total, it is recommended that hCG be withheld and the patient be advised to refrain from coitus or to use barrier contraceptive methods for at least 4 days. OHSS may progress rapidly (within 24 hours) or over several days to become a serious medical event. It most often occurs after hormonal treatment has been discontinued and reaches its maximum at about seven to ten days following treatment. Therefore patients should be followed for at least two weeks after hCG administration. In ART, aspiration of all follicles prior to ovulation may reduce the occurrence of hyperstimulation. Mild or moderate OHSS usually resolves spontaneously. If severe OHSS occurs, it is recommended that gonadotropin treatment be stopped if still ongoing, and that the patient be hospitalised and appropriate therapy be started. In patients undergoing ovulation induction, the incidence of multiple pregnancy is increased compared with natural conception. The majority of multiple an increased risk of adverse maternal and perinatal outcomes. multiple pregnancy, careful monitoring of ovarian response is recommended. In patients undergoing ART procedures the risk of multiple pregnancy is related mainly to the number of embryos placed, their quality and the patient age. The patients should be advised of the potential risk of multiple before starting treatment. The incidence of pregnancy loss by miscarriage or abortion is higher in patients undergoing stimulation of follicular growth for ovulation induction or ART than following natural conception. Women with a history of tubal disease are at risk of ectopic pregnancy, whether the pregnancy is obtained by spontaneous conception or with fertility treatments. The prevalence of ectopic pregnancy after ART was reported to be higher than in the general population. There have been reports of ovarian and other reproductive system neoplasms, both benign and malignant, in women who have undergone multiple treatment regimens for infertility treatment. It is not yet established whether or not treatment with gonadotropins increases the risk of these tumours in infertile women. The prevalence of congenital malformations after ART may be slightly higher than after spontaneous conceptions. This is thought to be due to differences in parental characteristics (e.g. maternal age, sperm characteristics) and multiple pregnancies. In women with recent or ongoing thromboembolic disease or women with generally recognised risk factors for thromboembolic events, such as personal or family history, treatment with gonadotropins may further increase the risk for aggravation or occurrence of such events. In these women, the benefits of gonadotropin administration need to be weighed against the risks. It should be noted however that pregnancy itself as well as OHSS also carry an increased risk of thromboembolic events. Elevated endogenous FSH levels are indicative of primary testicular failure. Such patients are unresponsive to follitropin alfa/hCG therapy. Follitropin alfa should not be used when an effective response cannot be obtained. Semen analysis is recommended 4 to 6 months after the beginning of treatment as part of the assessment of the response. Bemfola contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i.e. essentially “sodium-free”. 4.5Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction Concomitant use of follitropin alfa with other medicinal products used to stimulate ovulation (e.g. hCG, clomiphene citrate) may potentiate the follicular response, whereas concurrent use of a GnRH agonist or antagonist to induce pituitary desensitisation may increase the dose of follitropin alfa needed to elicit an adequate ovarian response. No other clinically significant drug interaction has been reported during follitropin alfa therapy . Sex hormones and modulators of the genital systems, gonadotropins Bemfola is a biosimilar medicinal product, that has been demonstrated to be similar in quality, safety and efficacy to the reference medicinal product GONAL-f. More detailed information is available on the website of the European Medicines Agency In women, the most important effect resulting from parenteral administration of FSH is the development of mature Graafian follicles. In women with anovulation, the objective of therapy with follitropin alfa is to develop a single mature Graafian follicle from which the ovum will be liberated after the administration of hCG In clinical trials, patients with severe FSH and LH deficiency were defined by an endogenous serum LH level < 1.2 IU/ as measured in a central laboratory. However, it should be taken into account that there are variations between LH measurements performed in different laboratories. In clinical studies comparing r-hFSH (follitropin alfa) and urinary FSH in ART (see table 1 below) and in ovulation induction, follitropin alfa was more potent than urinary FSH in terms of a lower total dose and a shorter treatment period needed to trigger follicular maturation. In ART, follitropin alfa at a lower total dose and shorter treatment period than urinary FSH, resulted in a higher number of oocytes retrieved when compared to urinary FSH. Table 1: Results of study GF 8407 (randomised parallel group study comparing efficacy and safety of follitropin alfa with urinary FSH in assisted reproduction technologies) Total dose of FSH required (number of FSH 75 IU ampoules) Differences between the 2 groups were statistically significant (p< 0.05) for all criteria listed. In men deficient in FSH, follitropin alfa administered concomitantly with hCG for at least 4 months induces spermatogenesis. Following intravenous administration, follitropin alfa is distributed to the extracellular fluid space with an initial half-life of around 2 hours and eliminated from the body with a terminal half-life of about one day. The steady state volume of distribution and total clearance are 10  and 0.6 /h, respectively. One-eighth of the follitropin alfa dose is excreted in the urine. Following subcutaneous administration, the absolute bioavailability is about 70%. Following repeated administration, follitropin alfa accumulates 3-fold achieving a steadystate within 3-4 days. In women whose endogenous gonadotropin secretion is suppressed, follitropin alfa has nevertheless been shown to effectively stimulate follicular development and steroidogenesis, despite unmeasurable LH levels. Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of single and repeated dose toxicity and genotoxicity additional to that already stated in other sections of this SmPC. Impaired fertility has been reported in rats exposed to pharmacological doses of follitropin alfa (≥ 40 IU/kg/day) for extended periods, through reduced fecundity.  5 IU/kg/day) follitropin alfa caused a decrease in the number of viable foetuses without being teratogen, and dystocia similar to that observed with urinary enopausal onadotropin (hMG).

Stimulation of multifollicular development in patients undergoing superovulation for assisted reproductive technologies (ART) such as fertilisation (IVF), gamete intra-fallopian transfer (GIFT) and zygote intra-fallopian transfer (ZIFT). Follitropin alfa in association with a luteinising hormone (LH) preparation is recommended for the stimulation of follicular development in women with severe LH and FSH deficiency. In clinical trials these patients were defined by an endogenous serum LH level < 1.2 IU/. Follitropin alfa is indicated for the stimulation of spermatogenesis in men who have congenital or acquired hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism with concomitant human Chorionic Gonadotrophin (hCG) therapy. Treatment with Bemfola should be initiated under the supervision of a physician experienced in the treatment of fertility disorders. Patients must be provided with the correct number of pens for their treatment course and educated to use the proper injection techniques. The dose recommendations given for follitropin alfa are those in use for urinary FSH. Clinical assessment of follitropin alfa indicates that its daily doses, regimens of administration and treatment monitoring procedures should not be different from those currently used for urinary FSH-containing medicinal products. It is advised to adhere to the recommended starting doses indicated below. Comparative clinical studies have shown that on average patients require a lower cumulative dose and shorter treatment duration with follitropin alfa compared with urinary FSH. Therefore, it is considered appropriate to give a lower total dose of follitropin alfa than generally used for urinary FSH, not only in order to optimise follicular development but also to minimise the risk of unwanted ovarian hyperstimulation (see section 5.1). Women with anovulation (including polycystic ovarian syndrome) Bemfola may be given as a course of daily injections. In menstruating women treatment should commence within the first 7 days of the menstrual cycle. A commonly used regimen commences at 75-150 IU FSH daily and is increased preferably by 37.5 or 75 IU at 7 or preferably 14 day intervals if necessary, to obtain an adequate, but not excessive, response. Treatment should be tailored to the individual patient’s response as assessed by measuring follicle size by ultrasound and/or oestrogen secretion. The maximal daily dose is usually not higher than 225 IU FSH. If a patient fails to respond adequately after 4 weeks of treatment, that cycle should be abandoned and the patient should undergo further evaluation after which she may recommence treatment at a higher starting dose than in the abandoned cycle. When an optimal response is obtained, a single injection of 250 micrograms r-hCG) or 5,000 IU up to 10,000 IU hCG should be administered 24‑48 hours after the last follitropin alfa injection. The patient is recommended to have coitus on the day of, and the day following hCG administration. Alternatively intrauterine insemination (IUI) may be performed. If an excessive response is obtained, treatment should be stopped and hCG withheld (see section 4.4). Treatment should recommence in the next cycle at a dose lower than that of the previous cycle. Women undergoing ovarian stimulation for multiple follicular development prior to in vitro fertilisation or other assisted reproductive technologies A commonly used regimen for superovulation involves the administration of 150-225 IU of follitropin alfa daily commencing on days 2 or 3 of the cycle. Treatment is continued until adequate follicular development has been achieved (as assessed by monitoring of serum strogen concentrations and/or ultrasound examination), with the dose adjusted according to the patient's response, to usually not higher than 450 IU daily. In general adequate follicular development is achieved on average by the tenth day of treatment (range 5 to 20 days). A single injection of 250 micrograms r-hCG or 5,000 IU up to 10,000 IU hCG is administered 24‑48 hours after the last follitropin alfa injection to induce final follicular maturation. Down-regulation with a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist or antagonist is now commonly used in order to suppress the endogenous LH surge and to control tonic levels of LH. In a commonly used protocol, follitropin alfa is started approximately 2 weeks after the start of agonist treatment, both being continued until adequate follicular development is achieved. For example, following two weeks of treatment with an agonist, 150-225 IU follitropin alfa are administered for the first 7 days. The dose is then adjusted according to the ovarian response. Overall experience with IVF indicates that in general the treatment success rate remains stable during the first four attempts and gradually declines thereafter. Women with anovulation resulting from severe LH and FSH deficiency In LH and FSH deficient women (hypogonadotropic hypogonadism), the objective of Bemfola therapy in association with lutropin alfa is to develop a single mature Graafian follicle from which the oocyte will be liberated after the administration of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). Follitropin alfa should be given as a course of daily injections simultaneously with lutropin alfa. Since these patients are amenorrhoeic and have low endogenous strogen secretion, treatment can commence at any time. A recommended regimen commences at 75 IU of lutropin alfa daily with 75-150 IU FSH. Treatment should be tailored to the individual patient's response as assessed by measuring follicle size by ultrasound and strogen response. If an FSH dose increase is deemed appropriate, dose adaptation should preferably be after 7-14 day intervals and preferably by 37.5-75 IU increments. It may be acceptable to extend the duration of stimulation in any one cycle to up to 5 weeks. When an optimal response is obtained, a single injection of 250 micrograms r-hCG or 5,000 IU up to 10,000 IU hCG should be administered 24-48 hours after the last follitropin alfa and lutropin alfa injections. The patient is recommended to have coitus on the day of, and on the day following hCG administration. Luteal phase support may be considered since lack of substances with luteotrophic activity (LH/hCG) after ovulation may lead to premature failure of the corpus luteum. If an excessive response is obtained, treatment should be stopped and hCG withheld. Treatment should recommence in the next cycle at a dose of FSH lower than that of the previous cycle. Bemfola should be given at a dose of 150 IU three times a week, concomitantly with hCG, for a minimum of 4 months. If after this period, the patient has not responded, the combination treatment may be continued; current clinical experience indicates that treatment for at least 18 months may be necessary to achieve spermatogenesis.

Gonadotropin therapy requires a certain time commitment by physicians and supportive health professionals, as well as the availability of appropriate monitoring facilities. In women, safe and effective use of follitropin alfa calls for monitoring of ovarian response with ultrasound, alone or preferably in combination with measurement of serum stradiol levels, on a regular basis. There may be a degree of interpatient variability in response to FSH administration, with a poor response to FSH in some patients . The lowest effective dose in relation to the treatment objective should be used in both men and women. Patients with porphyria or a family history of porphyria should be closely monitored during treatment with follitropin alfa. Deterioration or a first appearance of this condition may require cessation of treatment. Before starting treatment, the couple's infertility should be assessed as appropriate and putative contraindications for pregnancy evaluated. In particular, patients should be evaluated for hypothyroidism, adrenocortical deficiency, hyperprolactinemia and appropriate specific treatment given. Patients undergoing stimulation of follicular growth, whether as treatment for anovulatory infertility or ART procedures, may experience ovarian enlargement or develop hyperstimulation. Adherence to the recommended follitropin alfa dosage and regimen of administration, and careful monitoring of therapy will minimise the incidence of such events. For accurate interpretation of the indices of follicle development and maturation, the physician should be experienced in the interpretation of the relevant tests. In clinical trials, an increase of the ovarian sensitivity to follitropin alfa was shown when administered with lutropin alfa. If an FSH dose increase is deemed appropriate, dose adaptation should preferably be at 7-14 day intervals and preferably with 37.5-75 IU increments. No direct comparison of follitropin alfa/LH versus human menopausal gonadotropin (hMG) has been performed. Comparison with historical data suggests that the ovulation rate obtained with follitropin alfa/LH is similar to that obtained with hMG. A certain degree of ovarian enlargement is an expected effect of controlled ovarian stimulation. It is more commonly seen in women with polycystic ovarian syndrome and usually regresses without treatment. In distinction to uncomplicated ovarian enlargement, OHSS is a condition that can manifest itself with increasing degrees of severity. It comprises marked ovarian enlargement, high serum sex steroids, and an increase in vascular permeability which can result in an accumulation of fluid in the peritoneal, pleural and, rarely, in the pericardial cavities. The following symptomatology may be observed in severe cases of OHSS: abdominal pain, abdominal distension, severe ovarian enlargement, weight gain, dyspnoea, oliguria and gastrointestinal symptoms including nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea. Clinical evaluation may reveal hypovolaemia, haemoconcentration, electrolyte imbalances, ascites, haemoperitoneum, pleural effusions, hydrothorax, or acute pulmonary distress. Very rarely, severe OHSS may be complicated by ovarian torsion or thromboembolic events such as pulmonary embolism, ischaemic stroke or myocardial infarction. Independent risk factors for developing OHSS include polycystic ovarian syndrome high absolute or rapidly rising serum estradiol levels (e.g. > 900 pg/ in ART) and large number of developing ovarian follicles (e.g. > 3 follicles of ≥ 14 mm in diameter in anovulation; ≥ 20 follicles of ≥ 12 mm in diameter in ART). regimen of administration can minimise the risk of ovarian hyperstimulation (see sections 4.2 and 4.8). Monitoring of stimulation cycles by ultrasound scans as well as stradiol measurements are recommended to early identify risk factors. There is evidence to suggest that hCG plays a key role in triggering OHSS and that the syndrome may be more severe and more protracted if pregnancy occurs. Therefore, if signs of ovarian hyperstimulation occur such as and/or ≥ 40 follicles in total, it is recommended that hCG be withheld and the patient be advised to refrain from coitus or to use barrier contraceptive methods for at least 4 days. OHSS may progress rapidly (within 24 hours) or over several days to become a serious medical event. It most often occurs after hormonal treatment has been discontinued and reaches its maximum at about seven to ten days following treatment. Therefore patients should be followed for at least two weeks after hCG administration. In ART, aspiration of all follicles prior to ovulation may reduce the occurrence of hyperstimulation. Mild or moderate OHSS usually resolves spontaneously. If severe OHSS occurs, it is recommended that gonadotropin treatment be stopped if still ongoing, and that the patient be hospitalised and appropriate therapy be started. In patients undergoing ovulation induction, the incidence of multiple pregnancy is increased compared with natural conception. The majority of multiple an increased risk of adverse maternal and perinatal outcomes. multiple pregnancy, careful monitoring of ovarian response is recommended. In patients undergoing ART procedures the risk of multiple pregnancy is related mainly to the number of embryos placed, their quality and the patient age. The patients should be advised of the potential risk of multiple before starting treatment. The incidence of pregnancy loss by miscarriage or abortion is higher in patients undergoing stimulation of follicular growth for ovulation induction or ART than following natural conception. Women with a history of tubal disease are at risk of ectopic pregnancy, whether the pregnancy is obtained by spontaneous conception or with fertility treatments. The prevalence of ectopic pregnancy after ART was reported to be higher than in the general population. There have been reports of ovarian and other reproductive system neoplasms, both benign and malignant, in women who have undergone multiple treatment regimens for infertility treatment. It is not yet established whether or not treatment with gonadotropins increases the risk of these tumours in infertile women. The prevalence of congenital malformations after ART may be slightly higher than after spontaneous conceptions. This is thought to be due to differences in parental characteristics (e.g. maternal age, sperm characteristics) and multiple pregnancies. In women with recent or ongoing thromboembolic disease or women with generally recognised risk factors for thromboembolic events, such as personal or family history, treatment with gonadotropins may further increase the risk for aggravation or occurrence of such events. In these women, the benefits of gonadotropin administration need to be weighed against the risks. It should be noted however that pregnancy itself as well as OHSS also carry an increased risk of thromboembolic events. Elevated endogenous FSH levels are indicative of primary testicular failure. Such patients are unresponsive to follitropin alfa/hCG therapy. Follitropin alfa should not be used when an effective response cannot be obtained. Semen analysis is recommended 4 to 6 months after the beginning of treatment as part of the assessment of the response. Bemfola contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i.e. essentially “sodium-free”. 4.5Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction Concomitant use of follitropin alfa with other medicinal products used to stimulate ovulation (e.g. hCG, clomiphene citrate) may potentiate the follicular response, whereas concurrent use of a GnRH agonist or antagonist to induce pituitary desensitisation may increase the dose of follitropin alfa needed to elicit an adequate ovarian response. No other clinically significant drug interaction has been reported during follitropin alfa therapy . Sex hormones and modulators of the genital systems, gonadotropins Bemfola is a biosimilar medicinal product, that has been demonstrated to be similar in quality, safety and efficacy to the reference medicinal product GONAL-f. More detailed information is available on the website of the European Medicines Agency In women, the most important effect resulting from parenteral administration of FSH is the development of mature Graafian follicles. In women with anovulation, the objective of therapy with follitropin alfa is to develop a single mature Graafian follicle from which the ovum will be liberated after the administration of hCG In clinical trials, patients with severe FSH and LH deficiency were defined by an endogenous serum LH level < 1.2 IU/ as measured in a central laboratory. However, it should be taken into account that there are variations between LH measurements performed in different laboratories. In clinical studies comparing r-hFSH (follitropin alfa) and urinary FSH in ART (see table 1 below) and in ovulation induction, follitropin alfa was more potent than urinary FSH in terms of a lower total dose and a shorter treatment period needed to trigger follicular maturation. In ART, follitropin alfa at a lower total dose and shorter treatment period than urinary FSH, resulted in a higher number of oocytes retrieved when compared to urinary FSH. Table 1: Results of study GF 8407 (randomised parallel group study comparing efficacy and safety of follitropin alfa with urinary FSH in assisted reproduction technologies) Total dose of FSH required (number of FSH 75 IU ampoules) Differences between the 2 groups were statistically significant (p< 0.05) for all criteria listed. In men deficient in FSH, follitropin alfa administered concomitantly with hCG for at least 4 months induces spermatogenesis. Following intravenous administration, follitropin alfa is distributed to the extracellular fluid space with an initial half-life of around 2 hours and eliminated from the body with a terminal half-life of about one day. The steady state volume of distribution and total clearance are 10  and 0.6 /h, respectively. One-eighth of the follitropin alfa dose is excreted in the urine. Following subcutaneous administration, the absolute bioavailability is about 70%. Following repeated administration, follitropin alfa accumulates 3-fold achieving a steadystate within 3-4 days. In women whose endogenous gonadotropin secretion is suppressed, follitropin alfa has nevertheless been shown to effectively stimulate follicular development and steroidogenesis, despite unmeasurable LH levels. Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of single and repeated dose toxicity and genotoxicity additional to that already stated in other sections of this SmPC. Impaired fertility has been reported in rats exposed to pharmacological doses of follitropin alfa (≥ 40 IU/kg/day) for extended periods, through reduced fecundity.  5 IU/kg/day) follitropin alfa caused a decrease in the number of viable foetuses without being teratogen, and dystocia similar to that observed with urinary enopausal onadotropin (hMG).

In particular, patients should be evaluated for hypothyroidism, adrenocortical deficiency, hyperprolactinemia and Patients undergoing stimulation of follicular growth, whether as treatment for an ovulatory infertility or ART procedures, may experience ovarian enlargement or develop hyperstimulation. Adherence to the recommended follitropin alfa dosage and regimen of administration, and careful monitoring of therapy will minimise the incidence of such events. For accurateinterpretation of the indices of follicle development and maturation, the physician should be experienced in the interpretation of the relevant tests. In clinical trials, an increase of the ovarian sensitivity tofollitropin alfa was shown when administered with lutropin alfa. If an FSH dose increase is deemed appropriate, dose adaptation should preferably be at7-14 day intervals and preferably with 37.5-75 IU increments No direct comparison of follitropin alfa/LH versus human menopausal gonadotropin (hMG) has been performed. Comparison with historical data suggests that the ovulation rate obtained with follitropin alfa/LH is similar to that obtained with hMG. The most commonly reported adverse reactions are headache, ovarian cysts and local injection site reactions (e.g. pain, erythema, haematoma, swelling and/or irritation at the site of injection). Mild or moderate ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) has been commonly reported and should be considered as an intrinsic risk of the stimulation procedure.

Stimulation of multifollicular development in patients undergoing superovulation for assisted reproductive technologies (ART) such as fertilisation (IVF), gamete intra-fallopian transfer (GIFT) and zygote intra-fallopian transfer (ZIFT). Follitropin alfa in association with a luteinising hormone (LH) preparation is recommended for the stimulation of follicular development in women with severe LH and FSH deficiency. In clinical trials these patients were defined by an endogenous serum LH level < 1.2 IU/. Follitropin alfa is indicated for the stimulation of spermatogenesis in men who have congenital or acquired hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism with concomitant human Chorionic Gonadotrophin (hCG) therapy. Treatment with Bemfola should be initiated under the supervision of a physician experienced in the treatment of fertility disorders. Patients must be provided with the correct number of pens for their treatment course and educated to use the proper injection techniques. The dose recommendations given for follitropin alfa are those in use for urinary FSH. Clinical assessment of follitropin alfa indicates that its daily doses, regimens of administration and treatment monitoring procedures should not be different from those currently used for urinary FSH-containing medicinal products. It is advised to adhere to the recommended starting doses indicated below. Comparative clinical studies have shown that on average patients require a lower cumulative dose and shorter treatment duration with follitropin alfa compared with urinary FSH. Therefore, it is considered appropriate to give a lower total dose of follitropin alfa than generally used for urinary FSH, not only in order to optimise follicular development but also to minimise the risk of unwanted ovarian hyperstimulation (see section 5.1). Women with anovulation (including polycystic ovarian syndrome) Bemfola may be given as a course of daily injections. In menstruating women treatment should commence within the first 7 days of the menstrual cycle. A commonly used regimen commences at 75-150 IU FSH daily and is increased preferably by 37.5 or 75 IU at 7 or preferably 14 day intervals if necessary, to obtain an adequate, but not excessive, response. Treatment should be tailored to the individual patient’s response as assessed by measuring follicle size by ultrasound and/or oestrogen secretion. The maximal daily dose is usually not higher than 225 IU FSH. If a patient fails to respond adequately after 4 weeks of treatment, that cycle should be abandoned and the patient should undergo further evaluation after which she may recommence treatment at a higher starting dose than in the abandoned cycle. When an optimal response is obtained, a single injection of 250 micrograms r-hCG) or 5,000 IU up to 10,000 IU hCG should be administered 24‑48 hours after the last follitropin alfa injection. The patient is recommended to have coitus on the day of, and the day following hCG administration. Alternatively intrauterine insemination (IUI) may be performed. If an excessive response is obtained, treatment should be stopped and hCG withheld (see section 4.4). Treatment should recommence in the next cycle at a dose lower than that of the previous cycle. Women undergoing ovarian stimulation for multiple follicular development prior to in vitro fertilisation or other assisted reproductive technologies A commonly used regimen for superovulation involves the administration of 150-225 IU of follitropin alfa daily commencing on days 2 or 3 of the cycle. Treatment is continued until adequate follicular development has been achieved (as assessed by monitoring of serum strogen concentrations and/or ultrasound examination), with the dose adjusted according to the patient's response, to usually not higher than 450 IU daily. In general adequate follicular development is achieved on average by the tenth day of treatment (range 5 to 20 days). A single injection of 250 micrograms r-hCG or 5,000 IU up to 10,000 IU hCG is administered 24‑48 hours after the last follitropin alfa injection to induce final follicular maturation. Down-regulation with a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist or antagonist is now commonly used in order to suppress the endogenous LH surge and to control tonic levels of LH. In a commonly used protocol, follitropin alfa is started approximately 2 weeks after the start of agonist treatment, both being continued until adequate follicular development is achieved. For example, following two weeks of treatment with an agonist, 150-225 IU follitropin alfa are administered for the first 7 days. The dose is then adjusted according to the ovarian response. Overall experience with IVF indicates that in general the treatment success rate remains stable during the first four attempts and gradually declines thereafter. Women with anovulation resulting from severe LH and FSH deficiency In LH and FSH deficient women (hypogonadotropic hypogonadism), the objective of Bemfola therapy in association with lutropin alfa is to develop a single mature Graafian follicle from which the oocyte will be liberated after the administration of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). Follitropin alfa should be given as a course of daily injections simultaneously with lutropin alfa. Since these patients are amenorrhoeic and have low endogenous strogen secretion, treatment can commence at any time. A recommended regimen commences at 75 IU of lutropin alfa daily with 75-150 IU FSH. Treatment should be tailored to the individual patient's response as assessed by measuring follicle size by ultrasound and strogen response. If an FSH dose increase is deemed appropriate, dose adaptation should preferably be after 7-14 day intervals and preferably by 37.5-75 IU increments. It may be acceptable to extend the duration of stimulation in any one cycle to up to 5 weeks. When an optimal response is obtained, a single injection of 250 micrograms r-hCG or 5,000 IU up to 10,000 IU hCG should be administered 24-48 hours after the last follitropin alfa and lutropin alfa injections. The patient is recommended to have coitus on the day of, and on the day following hCG administration. Luteal phase support may be considered since lack of substances with luteotrophic activity (LH/hCG) after ovulation may lead to premature failure of the corpus luteum. If an excessive response is obtained, treatment should be stopped and hCG withheld. Treatment should recommence in the next cycle at a dose of FSH lower than that of the previous cycle. Bemfola should be given at a dose of 150 IU three times a week, concomitantly with hCG, for a minimum of 4 months. If after this period, the patient has not responded, the combination treatment may be continued; current clinical experience indicates that treatment for at least 18 months may be necessary to achieve spermatogenesis. There is no relevant use of follitropin alfa in the elderly population. Safety and effectiveness of follitropin alfa in elderly patients have not been established. Safety, efficacy and pharmacokinetics of follitropin alfa in patients with renal or hepatic impairment have not been established. There is no relevant use of follitropin alfa in the paediatric population. Bemfola is intended for subcutaneous administration. The first injection of Bemfola should be performed under direct medical supervision. Self-administration of Bemfola should only be performed by patients who are well motivated, adequately trained and have access to expert advice. single-dose cartridge is intended for only one injection, clear instructions should be provided to the patients to avoid misuse of the single dose presentation.

Gonadotropin therapy requires a certain time commitment by physicians and supportive health professionals, as well as the availability of appropriate monitoring facilities. In women, safe and effective use of follitropin alfa calls for monitoring of ovarian response with ultrasound, alone or preferably in combination with measurement of serum stradiol levels, on a regular basis. There may be a degree of interpatient variability in response to FSH administration, with a poor response to FSH in some patients . The lowest effective dose in relation to the treatment objective should be used in both men and women. Patients with porphyria or a family history of porphyria should be closely monitored during treatment with follitropin alfa. Deterioration or a first appearance of this condition may require cessation of treatment. Before starting treatment, the couple's infertility should be assessed as appropriate and putative contraindications for pregnancy evaluated. In particular, patients should be evaluated for hypothyroidism, adrenocortical deficiency, hyperprolactinemia and appropriate specific treatment given. Patients undergoing stimulation of follicular growth, whether as treatment for anovulatory infertility or ART procedures, may experience ovarian enlargement or develop hyperstimulation. Adherence to the recommended follitropin alfa dosage and regimen of administration, and careful monitoring of therapy will minimise the incidence of such events. For accurate interpretation of the indices of follicle development and maturation, the physician should be experienced in the interpretation of the relevant tests. In clinical trials, an increase of the ovarian sensitivity to follitropin alfa was shown when administered with lutropin alfa. If an FSH dose increase is deemed appropriate, dose adaptation should preferably be at 7-14 day intervals and preferably with 37.5-75 IU increments. No direct comparison of follitropin alfa/LH versus human menopausal gonadotropin (hMG) has been performed. Comparison with historical data suggests that the ovulation rate obtained with follitropin alfa/LH is similar to that obtained with hMG. A certain degree of ovarian enlargement is an expected effect of controlled ovarian stimulation. It is more commonly seen in women with polycystic ovarian syndrome and usually regresses without treatment. In distinction to uncomplicated ovarian enlargement, OHSS is a condition that can manifest itself with increasing degrees of severity. It comprises marked ovarian enlargement, high serum sex steroids, and an increase in vascular permeability which can result in an accumulation of fluid in the peritoneal, pleural and, rarely, in the pericardial cavities. The following symptomatology may be observed in severe cases of OHSS: abdominal pain, abdominal distension, severe ovarian enlargement, weight gain, dyspnoea, oliguria and gastrointestinal symptoms including nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea. Clinical evaluation may reveal hypovolaemia, haemoconcentration, electrolyte imbalances, ascites, haemoperitoneum, pleural effusions, hydrothorax, or acute pulmonary distress. Very rarely, severe OHSS may be complicated by ovarian torsion or thromboembolic events such as pulmonary embolism, ischaemic stroke or myocardial infarction. Independent risk factors for developing OHSS include polycystic ovarian syndrome high absolute or rapidly rising serum estradiol levels (e.g. > 900 pg/ in ART) and large number of developing ovarian follicles (e.g. > 3 follicles of ≥ 14 mm in diameter in anovulation; ≥ 20 follicles of ≥ 12 mm in diameter in ART). regimen of administration can minimise the risk of ovarian hyperstimulation (see sections 4.2 and 4.8). Monitoring of stimulation cycles by ultrasound scans as well as stradiol measurements are recommended to early identify risk factors. There is evidence to suggest that hCG plays a key role in triggering OHSS and that the syndrome may be more severe and more protracted if pregnancy occurs. Therefore, if signs of ovarian hyperstimulation occur such as and/or ≥ 40 follicles in total, it is recommended that hCG be withheld and the patient be advised to refrain from coitus or to use barrier contraceptive methods for at least 4 days. OHSS may progress rapidly (within 24 hours) or over several days to become a serious medical event. It most often occurs after hormonal treatment has been discontinued and reaches its maximum at about seven to ten days following treatment. Therefore patients should be followed for at least two weeks after hCG administration. In ART, aspiration of all follicles prior to ovulation may reduce the occurrence of hyperstimulation. Mild or moderate OHSS usually resolves spontaneously. If severe OHSS occurs, it is recommended that gonadotropin treatment be stopped if still ongoing, and that the patient be hospitalised and appropriate therapy be started. In patients undergoing ovulation induction, the incidence of multiple pregnancy is increased compared with natural conception. The majority of multiple an increased risk of adverse maternal and perinatal outcomes. multiple pregnancy, careful monitoring of ovarian response is recommended. In patients undergoing ART procedures the risk of multiple pregnancy is related mainly to the number of embryos placed, their quality and the patient age. The patients should be advised of the potential risk of multiple before starting treatment. The incidence of pregnancy loss by miscarriage or abortion is higher in patients undergoing stimulation of follicular growth for ovulation induction or ART than following natural conception. Women with a history of tubal disease are at risk of ectopic pregnancy, whether the pregnancy is obtained by spontaneous conception or with fertility treatments. The prevalence of ectopic pregnancy after ART was reported to be higher than in the general population. There have been reports of ovarian and other reproductive system neoplasms, both benign and malignant, in women who have undergone multiple treatment regimens for infertility treatment. It is not yet established whether or not treatment with gonadotropins increases the risk of these tumours in infertile women. The prevalence of congenital malformations after ART may be slightly higher than after spontaneous conceptions. This is thought to be due to differences in parental characteristics (e.g. maternal age, sperm characteristics) and multiple pregnancies. In women with recent or ongoing thromboembolic disease or women with generally recognised risk factors for thromboembolic events, such as personal or family history, treatment with gonadotropins may further increase the risk for aggravation or occurrence of such events. In these women, the benefits of gonadotropin administration need to be weighed against the risks. It should be noted however that pregnancy itself as well as OHSS also carry an increased risk of thromboembolic events. Elevated endogenous FSH levels are indicative of primary testicular failure. Such patients are unresponsive to follitropin alfa/hCG therapy. Follitropin alfa should not be used when an effective response cannot be obtained. Semen analysis is recommended 4 to 6 months after the beginning of treatment as part of the assessment of the response. Bemfola contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i.e. essentially “sodium-free”. 4.5Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction Concomitant use of follitropin alfa with other medicinal products used to stimulate ovulation (e.g. hCG, clomiphene citrate) may potentiate the follicular response, whereas concurrent use of a GnRH agonist or antagonist to induce pituitary desensitisation may increase the dose of follitropin alfa needed to elicit an adequate ovarian response. No other clinically significant drug interaction has been reported during follitropin alfa therapy . Sex hormones and modulators of the genital systems, gonadotropins Bemfola is a biosimilar medicinal product, that has been demonstrated to be similar in quality, safety and efficacy to the reference medicinal product GONAL-f. More detailed information is available on the website of the European Medicines Agency In women, the most important effect resulting from parenteral administration of FSH is the development of mature Graafian follicles. In women with anovulation, the objective of therapy with follitropin alfa is to develop a single mature Graafian follicle from which the ovum will be liberated after the administration of hCG In clinical trials, patients with severe FSH and LH deficiency were defined by an endogenous serum LH level < 1.2 IU/ as measured in a central laboratory. However, it should be taken into account that there are variations between LH measurements performed in different laboratories. In clinical studies comparing r-hFSH (follitropin alfa) and urinary FSH in ART (see table 1 below) and in ovulation induction, follitropin alfa was more potent than urinary FSH in terms of a lower total dose and a shorter treatment period needed to trigger follicular maturation. In ART, follitropin alfa at a lower total dose and shorter treatment period than urinary FSH, resulted in a higher number of oocytes retrieved when compared to urinary FSH. Table 1: Results of study GF 8407 (randomised parallel group study comparing efficacy and safety of follitropin alfa with urinary FSH in assisted reproduction technologies) Total dose of FSH required (number of FSH 75 IU ampoules) Differences between the 2 groups were statistically significant (p< 0.05) for all criteria listed. In men deficient in FSH, follitropin alfa administered concomitantly with hCG for at least 4 months induces spermatogenesis. Following intravenous administration, follitropin alfa is distributed to the extracellular fluid space with an initial half-life of around 2 hours and eliminated from the body with a terminal half-life of about one day. The steady state volume of distribution and total clearance are 10  and 0.6 /h, respectively. One-eighth of the follitropin alfa dose is excreted in the urine. Following subcutaneous administration, the absolute bioavailability is about 70%. Following repeated administration, follitropin alfa accumulates 3-fold achieving a steadystate within 3-4 days. In women whose endogenous gonadotropin secretion is suppressed, follitropin alfa has nevertheless been shown to effectively stimulate follicular development and steroidogenesis, despite unmeasurable LH levels. Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of single and repeated dose toxicity and genotoxicity additional to that already stated in other sections of this SmPC. Impaired fertility has been reported in rats exposed to pharmacological doses of follitropin alfa (≥ 40 IU/kg/day) for extended periods, through reduced fecundity.  5 IU/kg/day) follitropin alfa caused a decrease in the number of viable foetuses without being teratogen, and dystocia similar to that observed with urinary enopausal onadotropin (hMG).

Beshar, I., Johal, J. K., Saravanabavanandhan, B., Milki, A. A. OBJECTIVE: To assess the impact of withholding doxycycline on the success rate of natural cycle frozen embryo transfers (NC-FET).DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study.SETTING: Single academic institution.PATIENT(S): Women undergoing 250 NC-FET with euploid blastocysts performed by a single provider.INTERVENTION(S): One hundred and twenty-five NC-FET cycles performed after January 2019 without antibiotic administration compared with 125 NC-FET cycles before January 2019 with doxycycline administration.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Primary outcome: live birth (LB) or ongoing pregnancy rate (OPR, defined as pregnancies 13 weeks); secondary outcomes included positive beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (beta-hCG) level and clinical pregnancy rate (CPR, defined as the presence of fetal cardiac activity on ultrasound).RESULT(S): Each group of women comprised 125 NC-FET during the study period of March 2017 to March 2020. The women's mean age was 36.3 years and mean body mass index was 24 kg/m2. Between the two groups, the baseline characteristics were similar, including age, body mass index, race, smoking status, parity, endometrial thickness, Society of Assisted Reproductive Technology diagnosis, and number of prior failed transfers. Comparing NC-FET with doxycycline administration versus without, we found no statistically significant difference in LB-OPR (64% vs. 62.6%), positive beta-hCG (72.8% vs. 74.0%), or CPR (68% vs. 65.9%). After controlling for all variables in a logistic regression, doxycycline still had no effect on LB-OPR.CONCLUSION(S): In this analysis of similar patients undergoing NC-FET by a single provider, withholding doxycycline does not reduce success rates. Given the risks of antibiotics, our findings support withholding their use in NC-FET.

View details for View details for Spontaneous Conception during In Vitro Fertilization prior to Embryo Transfer without the Opportunity for Preimplantation Genetic Testing. In addition to the potential for multiple pregnancy, spontaneous conception during in vitro fertilization (IVF) can lead to undesired genetic outcomes. We present a case of a patient undergoing IVF with the intention of subsequent frozen embryo transfer after preimplantation genetic testing (PGT). Unprotected intercourse 6 days prior to egg retrieval resulted in a spontaneous pregnancy before the opportunity for embryo transfer. This case report highlights that spontaneous conception during IVF compromises the ability to transfer embryos that are euploid, unaffected by single gene disorders, or intended for gender balancing within a family when desired. Transvaginal Ultrasonographic Rates of Folliculogenesis Among Oligomenorrheic Women with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome To probe the rate of folliculogenesis among women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) who are oligomenorrheic, and to compare parameters among the group that de- veloped follicles with those who did not to determine how the 2 groups differed.A pro- spective cohort study per- formed on women with PCOS who gave a history of regular menstrual cycles less frequent than every 35 days. Transvaginal ultra- sound and urinary luteinizing hormone kits (ovulation predictor) were used to determine the development of a dominant follicle.A total of 55% of patients developed an ovulatory follicle with menstrual cycle lengths less frequent than every 35 days. The calculated cycle length for this group was 36-45 days.Among women with PCOS and oligo- menorrhea, rates of ovulation seem to be consistent with -the one study in the literature and lower than the other. View details for In vitro fertilization outcomes after fresh and frozen blastocyst transfer in South Asian compared with Caucasian women Shah, M. S., Caballes, M., Lathi, R. B., Baker, V. L., Westphal, L. M., Milki, A. A. To study pregnancy outcomes between South Asian and Caucasian women undergoing frozen blastocyst transfer cycles.Retrospective cohort study.Not applicable.Caucasian and South Asian patients undergoing frozen blastocyst transfer between January 2011 and December2014.Not applicable.Live birth rate.A total of 196 Caucasian and 117 South Asian women were included in our study. Indians were on average 2.2years younger than Caucasian women (34.9 vs. 37.1years), and were more likely to be nulliparous (59% vs. 43%). All other baseline characteristics were similar. In women undergoing their first frozen ET cycle, implantation rate (49% vs. 47%), clinical pregnancy rate (PR; 54% vs. 49%), and live birth rate (43% vs. 43%) were similar between South Asians and Caucasians, respectively. In patients who underwent a prior fresh blastocyst transfer, the live birth rate was significantly lower in South Asian versus Caucasian women (21% vs. 37%).Our data demonstrate that IVF outcomes are better in frozen versus fresh cycles among South Asian women. The IVF clinics may wish to consider these findings when counseling South Asian patients about the timing of ET. View details for Drug-Induced Thrombocytopenia following a Transvaginal Oocyte Retrieval for In Vitro Fertilization. Comstock, I. A., Longmire, M., Aster, R. H., Milki, A. A. Drug-induced immune thrombocytopenia has been associated with hundreds of medications and can lead to devastating consequences for the patient. We present a case of a healthy 33-year-old female undergoing in vitro fertilization who developed a severe drug-induced thrombocytopenia, petechiae, and a large hemoperitoneum after receiving Cefazolin antibiotic prophylaxis for a transvaginal oocyte retrieval. The patient was admitted to the intensive care unit for resuscitation with blood products. The presence of drug-dependent platelet antibodies to Cefazolin was confirmed serologically. The role of serum testosterone in early pregnancy outcome: a comparison in women with and without polycystic ovary syndrome. Journal of obstetrics and gynaecology Canada : JOGC = Journal d'obsttrique et gyncologie du Canada : JOGC Lathi, R. B., Dahan, M. H., Reynolds-May, M. F., Milki, A. A., Behr, B., Westphal, L. M. Hyperandrogenic conditions in women are associated with increased rates of miscarriage. However, the specific role of maternal testosterone in early pregnancy and its association with pregnancy outcome is unknown. The purpose of this study was to compare serum testosterone levels during early pregnancy in women with and without polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) who either had successful pregnancies or miscarried.We collected serum samples from women attending a university-based fertility centre at the time of their first positive serum beta human chorionic gonadotropin pregnancy test. The samples were subsequently assayed for total testosterone level. We used logistical regression modelling to control for PCOS diagnosis, BMI, and age.Total testosterone levels were available for 346 pregnancies, including 286 successful pregnancies and 78 first trimester miscarriages. We found no difference in total testosterone levels between women who subsequently had an ongoing pregnancy (mean concentration 3.6 2.6 nmol/L) and women with a miscarriage (mean 3.6 2.4 nmol/L). Using the Rotterdam criteria to identify women with PCOS, we also found no differences in serum testosterone between women who had ongoing pregnancies or miscarriages, either with PCOS (P = 0.176) or without PCOS (P = 0.561).Our findings show that early pregnancy testosterone levels do not predict pregnancy outcome, and they call into question the role of testosterone in causing miscarriage in populations of women with PCOS. Further research is needed to elucidate the normal progression of testosterone levels during pregnancy and to investigate further the relationship between PCOS and miscarriage. Frequency of the Male Infertility Evaluation: Data from the National Survey of Family Growth Eisenberg, M. L., Lathi, R. B., Baker, V. L., Westphal, L. M., Milki, A. A., Nangia, A. K. An estimated 7 million American couples per year seek infertility care in the United States. A male factor contributes to 50% of cases but it is unclear what proportion of infertile couples undergoes male evaluation.We analyzed data from cycles 5 to 7 of the National Survey of Family Growth performed by the Centers for Disease Control to determine the frequency of a male infertility evaluation, and associated reproductive and demographic factors.A total of 25,846 women and 11,067 men were surveyed. Male evaluation was not completed in 18% of couples when the male partner was asked vs 27% when female partners were asked. This corresponds to approximately 370,000 to 860,000 men in the population who were not evaluated at the time of infertility evaluation. Longer infertility duration and white race were associated with increased odds of male infertility evaluation. The male and female samples showed no change in the receipt of male examination with time.Many men from infertile couples do not undergo male evaluation in the United States. Given the potential implications to reproductive goals and male health, further examination of this pattern is warranted. Outcomes of trophectoderm biopsy on cryopreserved blastocysts: a case series Lathi, R. B., Massie, J. A., Gilani, M., Milki, A. A., Westphal, L. M., Baker, V. L., Behr, B. Preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) is an increasingly common adjunct to IVF. The information gained from PGD may be used to reduce the incidence of chromosomally abnormal pregnancies and augment the current selection process of embryos. As such, patients may choose to utilize PGD in either fresh or cryopreserved IVF cycles. It is a common practice to cryopreserve excess embryos at the blastocyst stage. In these cases, trophectoderm biopsy is the only technique available for PGD. This articles reports this study centre's experience with trophectoderm biopsies of cryopreserved blastocysts in 12 patients who underwent 13 cycles of PGD. The implantation rate per embryo transferred was 46% and the ongoing pregnancy rate per embryo transfer was 63%. The results from this case series demonstrate that trophectoderm biopsy on cryopreserved blastocysts to perform PGD is logistically feasible. In addition, the rate of implantation and ongoing pregnancy were maintained within a reasonable range to justify the procedure. Preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) is an increasingly common adjunct to IVF and is used to evaluate the genetic makeup of the embryo prior to transfer of the embryo into the uterus. The information gained from PGD may be used to identify single-gene disorders that result in genetic disease, reduce the incidence of chromosomally abnormal pregnancies and/or augment the selection process of embryos to be transferred. In order to perform PGD, a biopsy of the embryo is the performed and cells are removed for testing. PGD may be performed in either fresh or frozen (cryopreserved) IVF cycles. Patients who have cryopreserved embryos remaining in storage from a previous fresh cycle may wish to have these embryos tested with PGD. Many embryos are frozen on day 5 of development, referred to as the blastocyst stage. At this stage of development, embryo biopsy is performed via a technique known as 'trophectoderm biopsy', in which 1-3 of the cells destined to become the placenta are removed from the embryo for chromosomal testing. We report our experience with trophectoderm biopsy of frozen blastocysts in 12 patients who underwent 13 cycles of PGD. The implantation rate per embryo transferred was 46% and the ongoing pregnancy rate per embryo transfer was 63%. The results from this case series demonstrate that trophectoderm biopsy on cryopreserved blastocysts to perform PGD is logistically feasible. In addition, the rate of implantation and ongoing pregnancy were maintained within a reasonable range to justify the procedure. View details for Successful frozen blastocyst transfers after failed fresh transfers in assisted reproductive technologies patients with hydrosalpinx Untreated hydrosalpinx is known to decrease in vitro fertilization success. We report on 4 patients with hydrosalpinx for whom fresh transfers of 11 good quality embryos did not produce a pregnancy; however, frozen blastocyst transfers in natural cycles resulted in several successful pregnancies, with an implantation rate of 60% (9/15 blastocysts implanted). View details for Early pregnancy testosterone after ovarian stimulation and pregnancy outcome Gustin, S. L., Mukherjee, G., Baker, V. L., Westphal, L. M., Milki, A. A., Lathi, R. B. To examine early pregnancy (EP) testosterone (T) after ovarian stimulation and its effect on singleton pregnancy outcomes.Prospective cohort study.University-based tertiary care center.Subfertile women who conceived with or without fertility treatment.Ovarian stimulation for assisted reproduction, collection of serum total T levels in early pregnancy, and pregnancy follow-up.Rate of preterm delivery, low birth weight (LBW) (<2,500 g), and hypertensive disorders of pregnancy.EP serum samples were measured from 266 singleton pregnancies. The mean T level among spontaneous conceptions was 74.90 ng/dL (SD48.35 ng/dL); 103 ng/mL was the 90th percentile. Mean EP T was increased among patients who underwent ovarian stimulation compared with nonstimulated control subjects. In patients undergoing IVF, T levels in EP were linearly correlated with the number of oocytes retrieved. When pregnancy outcomes in women with normal T were compared with women with elevated T (>90th percentile), we did not see an increased risk for preterm delivery, hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, LBW infants, or cesarean delivery (odds ratio ratios 1.43, 0.38, 1.39, and 0.85, respectively).Elevations in EP T are associated with ovarian stimulation but do not appear to be associated with adverse pregnancy outcome. Further investigation to determine the etiology of increased maternal and neonatal morbidity among subfertile women is warranted. View details for The effect of air bubble position after blastocyst transfer on pregnancy rates in IVF cycles Friedman, B. E., Lathi, R. B., Henne, M. B., Fisher, S. L., Milki, A. A. To investigate the relationship between air bubble position after blastocyst transfer (BT) and pregnancy rates (PRs).Retrospective cohort study.University-based infertility center.Three hundred fifteen consecutive nondonor BTs by a single provider.Catheters were loaded with 25 L of culture media, 20 L of air, 25 L of media containing the blastocysts, 20 L of air, and a small amount of additional media. The distance from the air bubble to the fundus, as seen on abdominal ultrasound examination, was measured at the time of transfer. Air bubble location was categorized as <10 mm, 10-20 mm, and >20 mm from the fundus.Clinical pregnancy rate.After controlling for age, parity, FSH and frozen transfers, and accounting for repeated cycles per patient, the PRs for both the >20-mm (38.3%) and the 10-20-mm (42.0%) from the fundus group were significantly reduced compared with the group in which the bubble was <10 mm from the fundus (62.5%).This study is the first to suggest that BT closer to the fundus is associated with higher PR. Although no ectopic pregnancies occurred in the <10-mm group, this outcome should be monitored closely in larger studies.

To examine the rate of aneuploidy in missed abortions in patients who conceived after FSH ovarian stimulation compared with women who conceived in a natural cycle.Retrospective cohort.Academic reproductive endocrinology and infertility center.Women with karyotyping of products of conception (POC) from a missed abortion from January 1999 through August 2007. The rate of aneuploidy was compared between patients with a history of infertility who conceived naturally and patients with a history of infertility who conceived with FSH treatment.Ovarian stimulation with FSH, intrauterine insemination, and in vitro fertilization; genetic testing of POC after dilation and curettage.Embryonic karyotype.A total of 229 pregnancies met inclusion criteria, and of these, 64% had an abnormal karyotype. The rate of aneuploidy was 63% in the study group and 70% in the control group. This difference was not statistically significant.The incidence of embryonic aneuploidy was not higher in pregnancies conceived with FSH stimulation compared with spontaneous conceptions in infertility patients. This suggests that exogenous FSH exposure does not increase the risk of aneuploidy. View details for View details for Age-Related Success with Elective Single versus Double Blastocyst Transfer. Friedman, B. E., Davis, L. B., Lathi, R. B., Westphal, L. M., Baker, V. L., Milki, A. A. Background. Although the optimal outcome of assisted reproductive technology (ART) is a healthy singleton pregnancy, the rate of twin gestation from ART in women over the age of 35 is persistently high. Methods/Findings. We compared clinical pregnancy rates (PRs), ongoing pregnancy/live birth rates, and multiple gestation rates (MGRs) in 108 women who chose elective single blastocyst transfer (eSBT) to 415 women who chose elective double blastocyst transfer (eDBT) at a hospital-based IVF center. There was no significant difference in PR between eSBT and eDBT (57.4% versus 50.2%, P = 0.47) nor between eSBT and eDBT within each age group: <35, 35-37, 38-40, and >40. The risk of multiple gestations, however, was greatly increased between eSBT and eDBT (1.6 versus 32.4%, P < 0.00005), and this difference did not vary across age groups. Conclusion(s). Women undergoing eDBT are at uniformly high risk of multiple gestation regardless of age. eSBT appears to significantly lower the risk of multiple gestation without compromising PR. Day 2 versus day 3 embryo transfer in poor responders: a prospective randomized trial Shahine, L. K., Milki, A. A., Westphal, L. M., Baker, V. L., Behr, B., Lathi, R. B. Day 2 embryo transfer has been suggested as a method to improve pregnancy rates in poor responders compared with day 3 transfer. Our prospective randomized controlled trial does not show a difference in outcomes based on day of embryo transfer. View details for Is infertility a risk factor for female sexual dysfunction?

To determine the impact of infertility on female sexual function.A case-control study.Academic infertility and gynecology practices.One hundred nineteen women with infertility and 99 healthy female controls without infertility between the ages of 18 and 45 years were included in this study.Anonymous survey and Female Sexual Function Index.Female Sexual Function Index scores, frequency of sexual intercourse and masturbation, and sex-life satisfaction.Twenty-five percent of our control group had Female Sexual Function Index scores that put them at risk for sexual dysfunction (<26.55), whereas 40% of our patients with infertility met this criterion. Compared with the control group, the patients with infertility had significantly lower scores in the desire and arousal domains and lower frequency of intercourse and masturbation. The patients with infertility retrospectively reported a sex-life satisfaction score that was similar to that of the controls before their diagnosis, whereas their current sex-life satisfaction scores were significantly lower than those of the controls.Women with a diagnosis of infertility were found to be at higher risk for sexual dysfunction on the basis of their Female Sexual Function Index scores compared with women without infertility. The interaction of sexual function and infertility is complex and deserves further study.

A., Lathi, R. B. To determine the rate of embryonic chromosomal abnormalities, thrombophilias, and uterine anomalies in women over the age of 35 years with recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL).Retrospective cohort study.Academic reproductive endocrinology and infertility clinic.Women>or=35 years old with >or=3 first trimester miscarriages.None.Age, number of prior losses, cytogenetic testing of the products of conception (POC), uterine cavity evaluation, parental karyotype, TSH, and antiphospholipd antibody (APA) and thrombophilia testing. Aneuploidy in the POC in women with RPL was compared with sporadic miscarriages (or=35 years.Among 43 RPL patients, there were 50 miscarriages in which cytogenetic analysis was performed. In the RPL group, the incidence of chromosomal abnormalities in the POC was 78% (39 out of 50) compared with a 70% incidence (98 out of 140) in the sporadic losses. Thrombophilia results in the RPL patients were normal in 38 patients, four patients had APA syndrome, and one had protein C deficiency. Forty out of 43 had normal uterine cavities. Both TSH and parental karyotypes were normal in all of the patients tested. When the evaluation of RPL included karyotype of the POC, only 18% remained without explanation. However, without fetal cytogenetics, 80% of miscarriages would have been unexplained.In older patients with RPL, fetal chromosomal abnormalities are responsible for the majority of miscarriages. Other causes were present in only 20% of cases. View details for View details for Karyotype of miscarriages in relation to maternal weight Obesity has been identified as a risk factor for spontaneous miscarriage although the mechanism is unclear. The purpose of this study is to better understand the effect of obesity on early pregnancy success by examining the cytogenetic results of miscarriages in women with normal and elevated body mass index (BMI).We conducted a retrospective case-control study in an academic infertility practice. Medical records of women ages <40 years with first trimester missed abortion (n = 204), who underwent dilatation and curettage between 1999 and 2008, were reviewed for demographics, BMI, diagnosis of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and karyotype analysis. chi(2) and Student's t-test analysis were used for statistical analysis, with P < 0.05 considered significant.A total of 204 miscarriages were included, from women with a mean age of 34.5 years. The overall rate of aneuploidy was 59%. Women with BMI > or = 25 kg/m(2) had a significant increase in euploid miscarriages compared with women with lower BMI (P = 0.04), despite a similar mean age (34.4 years for both).We found a significant increase in normal embryonic karyotypes in the miscarriages of overweight and obese women (BMI > or = 25). These results suggest that the excess risk of miscarriages in the overweight and obese population is independent of embryonic aneuploidy. Further studies are needed to assess the impact of lifestyle modification, insulin resistance and PCOS on pregnancy outcomes in the overweight and obese population.

Y., Westphal, L. M. To estimate the effect of ethnicity on in vitro fertilization (IVF) outcomes after blastocyst transfer.We conducted a review of fresh blastocyst transfer IVF cycles from January 1, 2005, to December 31, 2006. Data collection included demographic information, infertility history, treatment protocol details, and treatment outcomes. Statistics were performed using the Student t test and chi2 test. To establish the independent contribution of Asian ethnicity, a multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed.We reviewed 180 blastocyst transfer cycles among white (62%) and Asian (38%) women. The groups were similar in most baseline characteristics. Asian women, however, had a lower body mass index (22.6 compared with 24.2, P=.02), were more likely to be nulligravid (53% compared with 35%, P=.03), and were more likely to have had at least one prior IVF cycle (37% compared with 20%, P=.02) The groups were similar in treatment characteristics, number of oocytes retrieved, fertilization rate, and number of blastocysts transferred. However, Asian women had a thicker endometrial lining (10.9 compared with 10.2, P=.02). Despite these similarities, Asian women had a lower implantation rate (28% compared with 45%, P=.01), clinical pregnancy rate (43% compared with 59%, P=.03), and live birthrate (31% compared with 48%, P=.02). In multivariable analysis, the decreased live birthrate among Asian women persisted (adjusted odds ratio 0.48, 95% confidence interval 0.24-0.96, P=.04).When compared with white women, Asian women have lower clinical pregnancy and live birthrates after blastocyst transfer. Laparoscopy in Women With Unexplained Infertility: A Cost-Effectiveness Analysis EDITORIAL COMMENT Moayeri, S. E., Lee, H. C., Lathi, R. B., Westphal, L. M., Milki, A. A., Garber, A. M. View details for View details for Poor Prognosis with In Vitro Fertilization in Indian Women Compared to Caucasian Women Despite Similar Embryo Quality Shahine, L. K., Lamb, J. D., Lathi, R. B., Milki, A. A., Langen, E., Westphal, L. M. Disease prevalence and response to medical therapy may differ among patients of diverse ethnicities. Poor outcomes with in vitro fertilization (IVF) treatment have been previously shown in Indian women compared to Caucasian women, and some evidence suggests that poor embryo quality may be a cause for the discrepancy. In our center, only patients with the highest quality cleavage stage embryos are considered eligible for extending embryo culture to the blastocyst stage. We compared live birth rates (LBR) between Indian and Caucasian women after blastocyst transfer to investigate whether differences in IVF outcomes between these ethnicities would persist in patients who transferred similar quality embryos.In this retrospective cohort analysis, we compared IVF outcome between 145 Caucasians and 80 Indians who had a blastocyst transfer between January 1, 2005 and June 31, 2007 in our university center. Indians were younger than Caucasians by 2.7 years (34.03 vs. 36.71, P = 0.03), were more likely to have an agonist down regulation protocol (68% vs. 43%, P<0.01), and were more likely to have polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS), although not significant, (24% vs. 14%, P = 0.06). Sixty eight percent of Indian patients had the highest quality embryos (4AB blastocyst or better) transferred compared to 71% of the Caucasians (P = 0.2). LBR was significantly lower in the Indians compared to the Caucasians (24% vs. 41%, P<0.01) with an odds ratio of 0.63, (95%CI 0.46-0.86). Controlling for age, stimulation protocol and PCOS showed persistently lower LBR with an adjusted odds ratio of 0.56, (95%CI 0.40-0.79) in the multivariate analysis.Despite younger age and similar embryo quality, Indians had a significantly lower LBR than Caucasians. In this preliminary study, poor prognosis after IVF for Indian ethnicity persisted despite limiting analysis to patients with high quality embryos transferred. Further investigation into explanations for ethnic differences in reproduction is needed. Laparoscopy in women with unexplained infertility: a cost-effectiveness analysis Moayeri, S. E., Lee, H. C., Lathi, R. B., Westphal, L. M., Milki, A. A., Garber, A. M. To evaluate the cost effectiveness of laparoscopy for unexplained infertility.We performed a cost-effectiveness analysis using a computer-generated decision analysis tree. Data used to construct the mathematical model were extracted from the literature or obtained from our practice. We compared outcomes following four treatment strategies: [1] no treatment, [2] standard infertility treatment algorithm (SITA), [3] laparoscopy with expectant management (LSC/EM), and [4] laparoscopy with infertility therapy (LSC/IT). The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was calculated, and one-way sensitivity analyses assessed the impact of varying base-case estimates.Academic in vitro fertilization practice.Computer-simulated patients assigned to one of four treatments.Fertility treatment or laparoscopy.Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios.Using base-case assumptions, LSC/EM was preferred (ICER =$128,400 per live-birth in U.S. dollars). Changing the following did not alter results: rates and costs of multiple gestations, penalty for high-order multiples, infertility treatment costs, and endometriosis prevalence. Outcomes were most affected by patient dropout from infertility treatments-SITA was preferred when dropout was less than 9% per cycle. Less important factors included surgical costs, acceptability of twins, and the effects of untreated endometriosis on fecundity.Laparoscopy is cost effective in the initial management of young women with infertility, particularly when infertility treatment dropout rates exceed 9% per cycle.

F., Burney, R. O., Milki, A. A., Westphal, L. M., Dahan, M. H., Lathi, R. B. To evaluate the pregnancy rate, ovarian responsiveness, and endometrial thickness in infertility patients with a history of methotrexate exposure who subsequently underwent controlled ovarian stimulation.Retrospective cohort study.University reproductive endocrinology and infertility program.Forty-eight women with infertility undergoing ovarian stimulation after receiving methotrexate treatment for ectopic gestation.Methotrexate administration and controlled ovarian stimulation.Pregnancy rate, cycle day 3 FSH levels, number of oocytes retrieved, and endometrial thickness.The cumulative intrauterine pregnancy rate achieved with controlled ovarian stimulation at 2 years after methotrexate exposure was 43%, with a mean time to conceive of 181 days. Thirty-five patients with similar fertility treatments pre- and post-methotrexate were identified. Within this group, when an IVF cycle occurred within 180 days of methotrexate exposure, a significant decline in oocytes retrieved was observed. Cycles performed later than 180 days after methotrexate exposure did not exhibit a decrease in oocyte production. Endometrial development was similar at all time points examined.These findings suggest a time-limited and reversible impact of methotrexate on oocyte yield. If confirmed by larger clinical series and/or animal data, these results may impact the management of ectopic gestation in the patient with a history of infertility or the timing of subsequent treatments. View details for Embryo quality before and after surgical treatment of endometriosis in infertile patients Shahine, L. K., Burney, R. O., Behr, B., Milki, A. A., Westphal, L. M., Lathi, R. B. To investigate the hypothesis that surgical treatment of endometriosis in infertile patients may improve pregnancy rates by improving embryo quality.We conducted a retrospective evaluation of 30 infertile patients treated with in vitro fertilization (IVF) before and after surgery for endometriosis. Patients served as their own controls and only cycles with similar stimulation protocols were compared.Using standard visual evaluation, embryo quality on day 3 was similar before and after surgical treatment of endometriosis. Fifty seven percent of patients had stage I-II endometriosis and 43% had stage III-IV disease. No patients had a live birth after the first IVF cycle and 43% of patients had a live birth with the IVF cycle after surgery.Surgical treatment of endometriosis does not alter embryo quality in patients with infertility treated with IVF.

The highest basal serum FSH level in the year preceding dilation and curettage was recorded.Monitoring of early pregnancy.Fetal karyotype.A total of 177 spontaneous miscarriages with karyotypes (70 euploid and 107 aneuploid) were identified, of which 53% were conceived by IVF. The aneuploid cohort consisted of trisomic (87%), teraploid (9.3%), and monosomic (3.7%) gestations. Using logistic regression analysis, basal FSH was not found to be independently predictive of an aneuploid gestation in our data set.Our data do not support the hypothesis that an elevated basal FSH concentration is associated with an increase in fetal aneuploidy. Our findings suggest that the association between diminished ovarian reserve and SAB may result from nonkaryotypic factors.

The second patient initially had a miscarriage but did redevelop cholestasis of pregnancy in the latter stages of a pregnancy resulting from frozen embryo transfer.We report two cases of intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy in the first trimester of pregnancies by IVF in association with ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome and markedly elevated maternal serum estrogen levels. Early recognition of this unusual clinical presentation allows for optimal pregnancy management by both the reproductive endocrinologist and the obstetrician.

B., Lathi, R. B., Milki, A. A., Dahan, M. H. Hemorrhage from a cervical pregnancy is a time-sensitive matter. Effective temporization measures for the initial management of this hemorrhage have not previously been reported in the literature.A 43-year-old woman, gravida 0, underwent in vitro fertilization and embryo transfer. She subsequently presented to the office with sudden onset of vaginal hemorrhage due to a cervical pregnancy. Cervical artery sutures were placed, and a cervical vasoconstricting agent was injected, at which point the patient's bleeding stopped. She then underwent successful treatment with dilation and curettage.Conservative measures to manage hemorrhage due to cervical pregnancy can be initiated, with possible rapid establishment of hemostasis until definitive treatment can be achieved. Aneuploidy in the miscarriages of infertile women and the potential benefit of preimplanation genetic diagnosis To evaluate the frequency of specific aneuploidies in miscarriages in an infertility practice and calculate the potential sensitivities of the different aneuploidy screening options for preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) in this setting.Retrospective analysis.Academic reproductive endocrinology and infertility practice.Women with miscarriages that had karyotype analysis on products of conception.None.Karyotype of spontaneous abortions compared with commercially available PGD options.Of the 273 karyotypes analyzed, 177 (64.8%) were abnormal. The average age of the patients was 37 +/- 4.5 years. Using a limited five-probe panel, 54 of the 177 (31%) abnormal karyotypes would have been detected. In contrast, an extended PGD panel (using 9, 10, or 12 chromosome probes) would have detected 127, 131, and 140 of 177 abnormalities, 72%, 74%, and 79% respectively. The difference between the limited (5-probe) and extended (9-, 10-, and 12-probe) panels was statistically significant. There was not a statistically significant difference among the extended panels.Most of the abnormalities seen in miscarriages are detectable by PGD with extended panels. A significantly higher percentage of these abnormalities could be detected by screening for 9, 10, or 12 chromosomes compared with only 5.

A retrospective review of all patients older than 35 who underwent elective single blastocyst transfer was performed. Twenty-three of the 45 patients (51.1%) have an ongoing pregnancy or liveborn delivery, with a mean age of 37.3 years, demonstrating a clear role for elective single transfer in this relatively older IVF population.

The objective of this study is to determine the rate of abnormalities detected by cytogenetic testing of first trimester miscarriages, in patients with and without an embryonic pole seen on ultrasound.A retrospective study of 272 D&Cs for missed abortions in an academic infertility practice from 1999 to 2006. Karyotype results were compared with transvaginal ultrasound findings. Chi-squared analysis was used with a P < 0.05 for significance.There was a high rate of abnormal karyotypes in all miscarriages (65%). Rates of abnormal karyotypes were 58% and 68% in cases with anembryonic gestations and those with a fetal pole seen, respectively (P > 0.05).The high rate of abnormalities detected in both groups suggests that useful results can be obtained from chromosomal testing of the POC regardless of ultrasound findings. Further studies on the prognostic value and cost effectiveness of chromosomal testing are needed. Ectopic pregnancy rates with frozen compared with fresh blastocyst transfer To compare the rate of ectopic pregnancy (EP) with fresh versus frozen blastocyst transfer in our program during the same time period.Retrospective analysis.University IVF program.Women who achieved a clinical pregnancy after IVF between 1998 and 2005.In our program, cryopreservation is performed at the blastocyst stage. Embryo transfer was performed 1 to 1.5 cm short of the fundus by abdominal ultrasound guidance.The incidence of EP was examined in relation to fresh versus frozen blastocyst transfer.In the frozen blastocyst group, there were 5 EPs out of 180 clinical pregnancies (2.8%), and there were 10 EPs out of 564 clinical pregnancies (1.8%) in the fresh blastocyst group.The rate of EP is not significantly increased after the transfer of frozen thawed blastocysts compared with fresh blastocyst transfer.

The purpose of our study is to compare the occurrence of monozygotic twinning (MZT) from blastocyst transfer (BT) in our program between an earlier and more recent time period.Retrospective.Academic IVF practice.All pregnancies conceived between March 2002 and December 2005 (N = 932) in our program were compared to pregnancies conceived before March 2002 (N = 554), which were the subject of a previous study.None.The incidence of MZT with day 3 embryo transfer and BT were compared between the study and control groups.During the study period, the rate of MZT was not significantly different for BT at 2.3% (9/385) compared to day 3 embryo transfer at 1.8% (10/547). This rate of 2.3% for BT was significantly lower than the rate of 5.6% (11/197) reported at our institution for BT before March 2002.Our study suggests that the risk of MZT with BT is significantly lower in the more recent time period and is in the range of what is seen with cleavage stage transfer. It is likely that improvements in culture systems as experience is gained with BT played a role. View details for Effect of reduced oxygen concentrations on the outcome of in vitro fertilization Kea, B., Gebhardt, J., Watt, J., Westphal, L. M., Lathi, R. B., Milki, A. A., Behr, B. We compared the effects of two standard oxygen concentrations, physiological (5% O(2), 5% CO(2), and 90% N(2)) and atmospheric (5% CO(2) with the balance as air), on fertilization, embryo development, and pregnancy rate in 106 patients undergoing IVF, excluding donor oocyte cycles and preimplantation genetic diagnosis cycles. The differences in oxygen concentration did not significantly affect fertilization rate, blastocyst formation, or pregnancy rate, but there was a significant difference in mean embryo score between physiological and atmospheric groups on day 3.

M. To evaluate the effect of oral contraceptive pill (OCP) pretreatment in patients undergoing IVF cycles with an antagonist.In this retrospective study, 194 cycles of women with diminished ovarian reserve undergoing IVF with a protocol using GnRH antagonists were evaluated. Oral contraceptive pretreatment was used in 146 cycles.Pregnancy rates were the same in both groups. Patients using OCPs required more gonadotropins (5,890 IU) compared to patients not undergoing OCP pretreatment (4,410 IU).Pregnancy outcomes were the same whether or not OCP pretreatment was implemented in poor responders using an antagonist protocol. While OCP pretreatment may help with scheduling flexibility, the higher dose of gonadotropins needed for ovarian stimulation should be considered. The dilemma of endometriosis: is consensus possible with an enigma? Nezhat, C., Littman, E. D., Lathi, R. B., Berker, B., Westphal, L. M., Giudice, L. C., Milki, A. A. Many will agree that the use of laparoscopy to diagnose and potientially treat endometriosis in patients who suffer from infertility has been superseded by IVF and sometimes oocyte donation, especially in older patients. The findings of our study add another dimension to management of endometriosis in the setting of infertility and emphasize the importance of keeping laparoscopy in the infertility management equation. View details for Subclavian vein thrombosis following IVF and ovarian hyperstimulation: a case report Thromboembolic phenomena are a serious consequence of assisted reproductive technology. We present a case of upper extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT) at 7 weeks gestation following ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) and IVF. Three weeks after recovering from OHSS, the patient presented with left neck pain and swelling. Ultrasound revealed a thrombus in the left jugular vein and left subclavian vein. Low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) was initiated with symptom resolution within 1 week. The patient remained on LWMH throughout her pregnancy and delivered at term. A literature review showed 97 published cases of thromboembolism following ovulation induction. A majority of these cases was associated with OHSS and pregnancy and the site of involvement was predominantly in the upper extremity and neck. Infertility physicians and obstetricians should be aware of this complication and keep in mind that it may occur weeks after resolution of OHSS symptoms. Role of laparoscopic treatment of endometriosis in patients with failed in vitro fertilization cycles Littman, E., Giudice, L., Lathi, R., Berker, B., Milki, A., Nezhat, C.

View details for Severe intrauterine growth restriction associated with the development of a submucosal leiomyoma during pregnancy - A case report Small, intramural leiomyomas are not generally considered a risk factor for poor reproductive outcomes.A patient with a 6-mm intramural leiomyoma and a normal uterine cavity by hysteroscopic evaluation who conceived after in vitro fertilization developed severe early-onset intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR), leading to pregnancy termination at 23.4 weeks' gestation. At 6 weeks postpartum, a 1.7-cm, intracavitary leiomyoma was detected on ultrasound evaluation and removed by hysteroscopic resection. The patient conceived in a subsequent in vitro fertilization cycle and gave birth to monozygotic twins with appropriate weights at 34 weeks of gestation. In the absence of other identifiable etiologies of the IUGR, it is plausible that the small, intramural leiomyoma enlarged and migrated into the cavity, causing abnormal placentation and leading to fetal growth restriction in the first pregnancy.Uterine cavity reevaluation is recommended in the investigation of IUGR before a woman attempts further pregnancies. Monochorionic triplet gestation after in vitro fertilization using donor oocytes: case report and review To report on a patient with a monochorionic triamnionic triplet pregnancy after IVF with donor oocytes.Case report.Academic tertiary care hospital.A 42-year-old woman who underwent IVF with donor oocytes.After failed IVF attempts, the patient chose to undergo treatment with donor oocytes. Her 23-year-old oocyte donor underwent standard controlled ovarian hyperstimulation. Retrieved oocytes were fertilized in vitro, and two embryos were transferred at the blastocyst stage.Intrauterine pregnancy with single gestational sac and three fetal poles with cardiac activity.After extensive counseling with perinatologists about pregnancy complications, the patient elected to terminate at 10 weeks of gestation.Several processes have been suggested to explain the increase in monozygotic twinning after IVF. These factors include advanced maternal age, superovulation, manipulation of the zona pellucida, and prolonged culture. It is possible that other factors may also play a role, especially in high-order monozygotic multiple pregnancies. All patients should be informed of the potential risk of a high-order multiple pregnancy after IVF, even when only one or two embryos are transferred.

It illustrates that observing a single PN in an oocyte at fertilization check should not be an absolute deterrent to transferring the resulting embryo even in an older patient with a high FSH level. This report also suggests that single observations, especially at the assessment of fertilization, in the IVF laboratory are limited when evaluating embryo potential and normalcy.

The patients with ICSI were more likely to have aneuploidy identified in their POC than conventional IVF, 76% vs. 41%. The average ages in these groups were similar: 37.1 vs. 37.8 years. There was a trend toward decreased aneuploidy with day 5 compared to day 3 embryo transfers; 38% vs. 63%.We found a significantly higher aneuploidy rate in the abortuses of patients who conceived with ICSI. It is possible that this increased incidence is due to abnormalities in the sperm of patients with ICSI, but could also be partially related to the technique itself. View details for 1000 office-based hysteroscopies prior to in vitro fertilization: feasibility and findings. JSLS : Journal of the Society of Laparoendoscopic Surgeons / Society of Laparoendoscopic Surgeons Hysteroscopy offers diagnostic accuracy and the ability to treat uterine pathology, but practitioners may be reluctant to perform it without a high index of suspicion because it traditionally requires an operating room. This study reviews the findings and feasibility of office-based diagnostic and operative hysteroscopy in an unselected in vitro fertilization (IVF) population to evaluate whether first-line hysteroscopy should be recommended.One thousand consecutive infertile patients scheduled for in vitro fertilization underwent office hysteroscopy. A rigid 20-degree 5-mm hysteroscope, with an operative channel for grasping forceps, scissors, or coaxial bipolar electrode was used. Operative findings, complications, and patient tolerance were noted.Sixty-two percent of patients had a normal uterine cavity. Thirty-two percent had endometrial polyps. Other pathology included submucous fibroids (3%), intrauterine adhesions (3%), polypoid endometrium (0.9%), septum (0.5%) retained products of conception (0.3%), and bicornuate uterus (0.3%). The pathology was treated in all patients without complication.When hysteroscopy is routinely performed prior to in vitro fertilization, a significant percentage of patients have uterine pathology that may impair the success of fertility treatment. Patient tolerance, safety, and the feasibility of simultaneous operative correction make office hysteroscopy an ideal procedure. Uterine position at real embryo transfer compared with mock embryo transfer The purpose of this study was to determine the consistency in the uterine position between mock and real embryo transfer.We reviewed 996 consecutive embryo transfer cycles (585 patients); 74% of patients had an anteverted (AV) uterus and 26% had a retroverted (RV) uterus at mock embryo transfer. All mock and real embryo transfers were performed under abdominal ultrasound guidance.Of 623 fresh embryo transfers in patients with an AV uterus at mock embryo transfer, only 2% became RV, while 55% of 213 embryo transfers in patients with an RV uterus on mock embryo transfer converted to AV at real embryo transfer (P < 0.0001). For frozen-thawed embryo transfer, 12% of AV uteri at mock embryo transfer became RV, while 33% of RV uteri became AV (P = 0.01).Our data suggest that an RV uterus at mock embryo transfer will often change position at real embryo transfer. Misdirecting the embryo transfer catheter can be avoided by accurate knowledge of the uterine position at the time of embryo transfer, which can be more accurately assessed by routine ultrasound guidance. Additionally, patients with an RV uterus at mock embryo transfer should still present with a full bladder for embryo transfer, since a significant number will convert to an AV position.

Embryo transfer was deferred until after tubal surgery, and all embryos were cryopreserved.In patients with hydrosalpinges, ultrasonography before ET is useful to detect newly developed hydrometra. Aspiration of the uterine fluid is unlikely to help because of rapid reaccumulation of hydrometra. Cryopreservation of the embryos for future transfer after the hydrosalpinx is removed or ligated is recommended.

To evaluate the sex ratio in births conceived with blastocyst transfer compared to day 3-ET.A retrospective analysis of IVF patients who became pregnant after blastocyst or cleavage stage transfer at Stanford University Hospital and a literature review were performed.In the day 3-ET group, the male-to-female (M/F) ratio was 157/139 (53%/47%) compared to 97/66 (59.5%/40.5%) in the blastocyst group (P = 0.18). Similar trends have been found in individual studies in the literature but reached statistical significance in only one out of six reports reviewed. The combined data from our study and the literature show a male-to-female ratio of 797/594 (57.3%/42.7%) in blastocyst transfer compared to 977/932 (51.2%/48.8%) in day 3-ET (P = 0.001).Although individual studies may lack power to show an altered sex ratio with blastocyst transfer, the combined data presented in this report do suggest that the M/F ratio is higher with blastocyst transfer compared to cleavage stage transfer.

D., Behr, B., Milki, A. A. To investigate whether ICSI (intracytoplasmic sperm injection) results in decreased blastocyst formation and pregnancy compared to IVF (in vitro fertilization).We performed a retrospective analysis of blastocyst transfer (BT) offered routinely to patients under age 40 with > or = three 8-cell embryos on day 3 and compared IVF to ICSI cycles. Sequential media were used with P1 until day 3, then Blastocyst Medium until day 5/6.There were 131 IVF and 75 ICSI cycles. There was no difference in age, number of oocytes, zygotes, 8-cell embryos, blastocysts on days 5 and 6, or embryos transferred. Progression to blastocyst was similar (78% for IVF and 73% for ICSI) as was the viable pregnancy rate (51.4% for IVF and 55% for ICSI). No cycles failed to form blastocysts.The progression to blastocyst and the likelihood of conceiving a viable pregnancy were unaltered by ICSI. Thus it seems appropriate for programs to offer BT to patients undergoing ICSI using the same inclusion criteria applied to their IVF patients. Incidence of monozygotic twinning with blastocyst transfer compared to cleavage-stage transfer Milki, A. A., Jun, S. H., Hinckley, M. D., Behr, B., Giudice, L. C., Westphal, L. M. To evaluate the incidence of monozygotic twinning (MZT) in pregnancies conceived after blastocyst transfer compared to cleavage-stage transfer.Retrospective study.University IVF program.All IVF patients with viable pregnancies conceived during a 4-year period.Blastocyst transfer or day 3 ET.Incidence of MZT assessed by transvaginal ultrasound.There were 11 incidences of MZT in 197 viable pregnancies (5.6%) with blastocyst transfer compared to 7 of 357 viable pregnancies (2%) with day 3 ET. In 10 of 18 pregnancies, MZT was observed in the setting of a higher order multiple gestation (6 of 11 for blastocyst transfer and 4 of 7 for day 3 ET). In the day 3 ET group, assisted hatching or intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) did not increase MZT (4 of 213, 1.9%) compared to cycles without zona breaching (3 of 144, 2.1%). Similarly, in the blastocyst-transfer group, ICSI did not increase the incidence of MZT (4 of 74, 5.5% for ICSI and 7 of 123, 5.7% for non-ICSI IVF).Compared to day 3 ET, blastocyst transfer appears to significantly increase the incidence of gestations with MZT. This information should be taken into account when counseling patients about the pros and cons of extended culture. View details for Effect of hysteroscopy performed in the cycle preceding controlled ovarian hyperstimulation on the outcome of in vitro fertilization View details for Ectopic pregnancy rates with day 3 versus day 5 embryo transfer: a retrospective analysis. BACKGROUND: Blastocyst transfer may theoretically decrease the incidence of ectopic pregnancy following IVF-ET in view of the decreased uterine contractility reported on day 5. The purpose of our study is to specifically compare the tubal pregnancy rates between day 3 and day 5 transfers. METHODS: A retrospective analysis of all clinical pregnancies conceived in our IVF program since 1998 was performed. The ectopic pregnancy rates were compared for day 3 and day 5 transfers. RESULTS: There were 623 clinical pregnancies resulting from day 3 transfers of which 22 were ectopic (3.5%). In day 5 transfers, there were 13 ectopic pregnancies out of 333 clinical pregnancies (3.9%). The difference between these rates is not statistically significant (P = 0.8). CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggests that the ectopic pregnancy rate is not reduced following blastocyst transfer compared to day 3 transfer. While there may be several benefits to extended culture in IVF, the decision to offer blastocyst transfer should be made independently from the issue of ectopic pregnancy risk. Comparison of blastocyst transfer to day 3 transfer with assisted hatching in the older patient 56th Annual Meeting of the American-Society-for-Reproductive-Medicine To compare cycle outcomes in similar populations of women over 40 who underwent blastocyst transfer compared with women who had day 3 embryo transfer with assisted hatching (ET/AH).Retrospective study. STTING: University hospital-based program.Eighty-six IVF cycles in women ages 40 to 43 years who had more than three eight-cell embryos on day 3. On day 3 of embryo culture, patients chose either to undergo blastocyst transfer or day 3 ET/AH.Pregnancy and cryopreservation rates were recorded.In 48 cycles, blastocyst transfer was performed, and in 38 cycles day 3 ET/AH was performed. There was no statistically significant difference between the blastocyst transfer group and the day 3 ET/AH group with respect to age (41.1 +/- 0.9 years vs. 41.6 +/- 0.8 years), percentage of intracytoplasmic sperm injection cycles (29.2% vs. and 27.6%), number of oocytes (14.9 +/- 5.6 vs. 12.8 +/- 4.0), or number of eight-cell embryos (6.1 +/- 2.2 vs. 5.4 +/- 1.5). Significantly fewers embryos were transferred per cycle with blastocyst transfer (2.6 +/- 1.0) compared with day 3 ET/AH (5.9 +/- 2.0). The viable pregnancy rate was similar in the blastocyst transfer group (29.2%) and in the day 3 ET/AH group (26.3%). Embryos for cryopreservation were available in significantly more cycles in the blastocyst transfer group (52.1%) than in the day 3 ET/AH group (21.1%). Cleavage stage arrest occurred only in one cycle.Blastocyst transfer appears to be as effective as day 3 ET/AH in older patients with good embryos. Higher cryopreservation rate in the blastocyst transfer group may represent an advantage over day 3 ET/AH. Older women may also benefit from the information that extended culture provides them regarding their oocyte quality. Tissue sampling technique affects accuracy of karyotype from missed abortions To determine if careful specimen selection and washing of tissue from first trimester missed abortion products of conception specimens increases the sensitivity of routine cytogenetics in detecting aneuploidy.Retrospective review of cytogenetics results from tissue from dilation and curettage for missed abortion in a university fertility practice between 1998 and 2001. A technique of careful selection and washing of the specimen was implemented in July 1999. Results from before (n = 15) and after (n = 41) this change were compared. Cytogenetics reports from other physicians using the same laboratory were used for comparison (n = 59).The percentage of 46XX results was significantly decreased in the test group when compared to historical and community controls: 29% vs. 73% and 56% respectively. The percentage of aneuploid results was significantly higher in the test group at 61% vs. 7% and 36% in the historical and community controls respectively.Thorough separation and cleaning of villi prior to sending missed abortion specimens significantly increases sensitivity of conventional cytogenetics for detecting aneuploidy by decreasing maternal contamination. Endometrioma of uterine serosa in a woman with mosaic Turner's syndrome receiving hormone replacement therapy 56th Annual Meeting of the American-Society-for-Reproductive-Medicine Endometriosis in Turner's syndrome patients has only been reported in five isolated cases. We present here an endometrioma on the uterine serosa and pelvic endometriosis arising in a mosaic Turner's patient receiving hormone replacement therapy (HRT). The 24 year old patient with mosaic Turner's syndrome [45,X; 46,X pseudo dicentric Y (q11.23)], on cyclic HRT after laparoscopic gonadectomy 5 years previously, was found to have an adnexal mass on routine examination. Given her history, due to the fear of a malignant process arising from a potential gonadal remnant, she underwent a laparoscopy and was found to have a 5 cm serosal endometrioma arising on a stalk from the uterine fundal surface as well as pelvic endometriosis. De-novo endometrioma and endometriosis occurred in a mosaic Turner's patient after gonadectomy on cyclic HRT. The presentation was also unusual with a pedunculated endometrioma arising from the uterine serosa. Due to the fact that the patient did have cyclic menstrual flow, her endometriosis may have arisen from retrograde menstruation or coelomic metaplasia induced by exogenous hormones.

A., Watt, J., Behr, B. View details for Accuracy of day 3 criteria for selecting the best embryos Milki, A. A., Hinckley, M. D., Gebhardt, J., Dasig, D., Westphal, L. M., Behr, B. To assess the accuracy of day 3 morphologic criteria in identifying the best embryos.Prospective observational study.University IVF program.One hundred cycles in women desiring blastocyst transfer who had > or =3 eight-cell embryos on day 3.On day 3, the embryologist chose the two embryos that would have been transferred that day. On day 5, embryos were examined to determine the best and second-best blastocysts.Accuracy of day 3 picks as measured in culture on day 5, outcome of nontransferred picks, and cryopreservation rate.All cycles reached the blastocyst stage and 73% had cryopreservation. The mean number of blastocysts was 4.8 (3.2 on day 5 and 1.6 on day 6). Neither pick was chosen in 39% of cycles; one pick was transferred in 38%; and both picks were transferred in 23%. Of 116 nontransferred picks, 51 were frozen and 65 arrested, with both picks arresting in 9 cycles. The single best blastocyst was chosen from the picks in 39% of cycles.Morphologic criteria for cleavage-stage embryo selection may fall short when the transfer is limited to two embryos. Culture to blastocyst is warranted in this population to avoid high-order multiples and still be able to choose the two embryos with the highest implantation potential. Factors relating to a successful cryopreserved blastocyst transfer program 56th Annual Meeting of the American-Society-for-Reproductive-Medicine To review the authors' experience in a successful frozen blastocyst program.Retrospective study.University IVF program.Women of all ages undergoing 64 frozen blastocyst nondonor thaw cycles.Thaw cycles with day 5 or day 6 frozen blastocysts replaced into luteal day 5 endometrium in natural or programmed cycles; cryopreservation of blastocysts by Menezo two-step protocol and Testart slow cool program; thawing by two step thaw protocol.Implantation, clinical pregnancy, and delivery rates.The implantation rate was 16% and was similar with day 5 frozen blastocysts and day 6 frozen blastocysts cycles. The clinical pregnancy rate was 36% and the delivery rate was 27%, with no significant difference between day 5 and 6 blastocysts.Blastocyst cryopreservation is a viable option for patients of all ages and complements fresh blastocyst culture and transfer. The presence of good quality blastocysts for freezing on day 5 and day 6 yields comparable results and is critical for the success of thaw cycles. Concurrent IVF and spontaneous conception resulting in a quadruplet pregnancy Milki, A. A., Hinckley, M. D., GRUMET, F. C., Chitkara, U. Blastocyst transfer of just one or two embryos has been used to help limit the number of high-order gestations. In this case report we describe the occurrence of a quadruplet pregnancy after the transfer of only two blastocysts during IVF. Sonographic examination showed four fetuses and what appeared to be quadriamniotic/quadrichorionic sacs, suggesting that a concomitant spontaneous conception had occurred. Definite confirmation of zygosity was obtained by genetic testing using DNA microsatellite polymorphism determinations after the birth of one boy and three girls at 32 weeks gestation. Although this event has not been reported previously, the possibility of its occurrence should be kept in mind. IVF patients with patent Fallopian tubes should be cautioned against intercourse late in their controlled ovarian stimulation, especially if they would decline multifetal reduction. View details for Recombinant DNA technology makes it possible to produce large amounts of human gene products for pharmacologic applications, supplanting the need for human tissues. The genes for the alpha and beta subunits of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), and human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) have been characterized and cloned. Recombinant FSH (rFSH) has been shown to be safe and effective in the treatment of fertility disorders. In comparison with the urinary gonadotropin products, human menopausal gonadotropins (HMG), and urinary follitropins (uFSH), rFSH is more potent and better tolerated by patients. Recombinant HCG appears to be as efficacious as urinary HCG with the benefit of improved local tolerance. Recombinant LH (rLH) is likely to be recommended as a supplement to rFSH for ovulation induction in hypogonadotropic women. It may also benefit in vitro fertilization patients undergoing controlled ovarian hyperstimulation with rFSH combined with pituitary suppression, with a gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist or antagonist.

View details for Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) mRNA splice variants are differentially expressed in human blastocysts 16th Annual Meeting of the European-Society-of-Human-Reproduction-and-Embryology (ESHRE) Krussell, J. S., Behr, B., Milki, A. A., Hirchenhain, J., Wen, Y., Bielfeld, P., Polan, M. L. The aim of our study was to detect and characterize mRNA expression of VEGF isoforms VEGF(121), VEGF(145), VEGF(165), VEGF(189), and VEGF(206) in human blastocysts. We recently demonstrated VEGF mRNA expression during human preimplantation embryo development, and further information regarding the alternatively spliced mRNAs resulting in freely secreted proteins or proteins bound to cell surface heparan-sulphate proteoglycans is needed to better understand the process of angiogenesis during implantation. Human blastocysts unsuitable for transfer obtained from the IVF programme at Stanford University were examined by reverse transcription/hemi-nested polymerase chain reaction for their expression of VEGF mRNA splice variants. VEGF mRNA was expressed in 17 out of 19 (89%) blastocysts. Of the 17 blastocysts, VEGF(121) mRNA was detected in 88%, VEGF(145) mRNA in 100%, VEGF(165) mRNA in 71%, and VEGF(189) mRNA in 24% of blastocysts. There was co-expression of mRNA for VEGF(121) and VEGF(145) only in 29% blastocysts, of mRNA for VEGF(165) and VEGF(145) only in 12%, and of mRNA for VEGF(121), VEGF(145) and VEGF(165) in 59% blastocysts. VEGF(206) mRNA could not be detected. In conclusion, we demonstrated that blastocysts express the mRNAs encoding for the free VEGF proteins, enabling the implanting embryo to immediately induce angiogenesis at the implantation site.

To detect the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) mRNA and/or secretion of VEGF protein by human preimplantation embryos.Human preimplantation embryos not suitable for uterine transfer were examined for beta-actin and VEGF mRNA expression. Culture media from normally fertilized and developing preimplantation embryos were assessed for VEGF protein secretion.Clinics and academic research laboratories at the Departments of Obstetrics and Gynecology at the Stanford University, Palo Alto, California and the Heinrich-Heine-University, Dsseldorf, Germany.Couples undergoing IVF by intracytoplasmic sperm injection for various reasons.Six unfertilized oocytes and 33 pathologically fertilized (tripronucleic, 3PN) preimplantation embryos were examined for VEGF mRNA expression, and 16 embryos were examined for VEGF protein secretion.Embryonic expression of VEGF mRNA and VEGF protein as determined by reverse transcription (RT)/nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and ELISA.VEGF mRNA and protein could not be detected in unfertilized oocytes. However, 30/33 preimplantation embryos did express VEGF mRNA (11/12 10-to-16-cell embryos, 3/4 morulae, 11/12 early blastocysts, 5/5 hatched blastocysts). The VEGF protein level was below the sensitivity of the ELISA.Production of VEGF may give the embryo the ability to induce neoangiogenesis at the implantation site, thus creating an environment necessary for its survival.

To examine the rate of monozygotic twinning associated with blastocyst transfer using commercially available, cell-free culture systems with unmanipulated blastocysts.A retrospective analysis was conducted in multiple private and academic infertility centers throughout the United States, of 199 pregnant patients following in vitro fertilization (IVF) blastocyst embryo transfer (ET). Human embryos obtained through standard IVF stimulation protocols were cultured in commercially available, cell-free media systems and transferred as blastocysts. The main outcome measure was the rate of monozygotic twinning.A total of 199 blastocyst-ET pregnancies were achieved during the study period at the fertility centers examined. Monozygotic twinning was noted in 10/199 (5%) of these pregnancies. All were monochorionic diamnionic.Monozygotic twinning previously has been reported following IVF, especially in relation to assisted hatching. While blastocyst transfer has been available for many years using coculture, there have been no published multicenter reports of monozygotic twinning associated with unmanipulated blastocysts. In a multicenter analysis, a definite increase in monozygotic twinning was seen following blastocyst-ET. We believe this phenomenon is real and that this information should be considered when counseling patients for treatment.

View details for Comparison of blastocyst transfer with day 3 embryo transfer in similar patient populations Milki, A. A., Hinckley, M. D., Fisch, J. D., Dasig, D., Behr, B. To compare implantation and pregnancy rates (PRs) achieved with blastocyst transfer (BT) and day 3 ET in similar patient populations.Retrospective analysis.Academic infertility center.One hundred consecutive patients <40 years undergoing IVF, each with more than three eight-cell embryos on day 3.Patients used their own eggs for IVF or IVF and intracytoplasmic sperm injection. Embryos were cultured in P1 medium (Irvine Scientific, Santa Ana, CA) until day 3, when they were either transferred or, in the case of embryos for BT, incubated in Blastocyst Medium (Irvine Scientific), followed by transferring on day 5.Implantation and PRs.There were no statistically significant differences in patient age, FSH level, or number of oocytes or zygotes. The BT group had fewer embryos transferred (mean, 2.4) compared with the day 3-ET group (mean, 4.6). The viable PR (cardiac activity at 6-7 weeks was considered indicative of a viable pregnancy) was higher with BT (68%, 34/50) than with day 3 ET (46%, 23/50). The implantation rate was increased with BT (47%, 56 sacs/120 embryos) compared with day 3 ET (20%, 46 sacs/231 embryos).The BT group in our study had higher implantation and PRs compared with the day 3-ET group. Better embryo selection, improved embryo-uterine synchrony, and decreased cervical mucus on day 5 may have accounted for the enhanced outcome. Our data support the use of BT to limit the number of embryos transferred while improving PRs. View details for Two-blastocyst transfer has similar pregnancy rates and a decreased multiple gestation rate compared with three-blastocyst transfer To examine the effect of the number of blastocysts transferred on pregnancy and multiple gestation rates.Retrospective study.Academic infertility center.Patients < 40 years undergoing IVF, with FSH levels of < 15 mIU/mL and more than three eight-cell embryos.Embryos were cultured in P1 until day 3 and then transferred to blastocyst medium. A maximum of three blastocysts were transferred.Pregnancy, multiple gestation, and implantation rates.All 55 patients developed blastocysts and underwent ET. Twenty-four patients had three embryos transferred and 29 patients had two embryos transferred. Two patients had only one embryo each for transfer. There was no difference in the viable pregnancy rate between the two-blastocyst transfer and three-blastocyst transfer groups (62% vs. 58%). In the two-blastocyst transfer group, 39% of pregnancies were multiple gestations (all twin gestations), compared with 79% of pregnancies in the three-blastocyst transfer group (50% twin gestations, 29% triplet gestations). The implantation rate was 47% in both groups.A commercially available, sequential culture system is highly effective for producing viable blastocysts. Two-blastocyst transfer eliminated the risk of triplets while maintaining the same high success rates seen with three-blastocyst ET.

After midcycle aspiration of the single lead follicle, a new cohort of seven follicles developed and seven oocytes were recovered. Six embryos were replaced by tubal ET and an ongoing singleton gestation resulted.Midcycle aspiration of a single lead follicle in a patient with poor response to IVF treatment allowed the development of a larger secondary cohort of follicles during the same cycle and ultimately led to a viable pregnancy. This intervention may have future implications for the treatment of poor responders. View details for Human preimplantation embryos express vascular endothelial growth factor mRNA Kruessel, J.

View details for Sibling embryo blastocyst development correlates with the in vitro fertilization day 3 embryo transfer pregnancy rate in patients under age 40 XVI World Congress on Fertility and Sterility/54th Annual Meeting of the American-Society-for-Reproductive-Medicine To examine the IVF day 3-ET pregnancy rate in patients under 40 with sibling embryo blastocyst development, compared with similar patients without blastocyst formation.Retrospective analysis.Academic infertility center.One hundred twenty-five IVF day 3-ET patients under 40 with sibling embryos for extended culture.Extended culture of nontransferred sibling embryos for blastocyst development.Pregnancy and multiple gestation rates, number of oocytes, embryos formed, and embryos transferred.Thirty-eight percent of patients became pregnant. Forty-eight percent of patients had sibling embryos develop to blastocyst. The blastocyst group had more oocytes retrieved (17.4+/-6.6 versus 14.4+/-5.6), more embryos formed (11.2+/-4.2 versus 8.8+/-3.2), and a higher clinical pregnancy rate (60% versus 18%) than the group without blastocyst development.Blastocyst transfer has been shown to improve implantation rates and reduce the risk of multiple gestations from assisted reproductive technology. Sibling embryo blastocyst development may reflect superior embryo quality, as manifested by increased IVF-ET pregnancy rates. In addition to predicting pregnancy in the current cycle, sibling embryo blastocyst development may provide information about the potential for fresh blastocyst transfer in subsequent cycles and help to identify patients at risk for multiple gestations. View details for Preliminary clinical experience with human blastocyst development in vitro without co-culture Behr, B., Pool, T. B., Milki, A. A., Moore, D., Gebhardt, J., Dasig, D. This preliminary analysis was designed to quantify blastocyst development of supernumerary embryos without the use of feeder cells, conditioned medium or whole serum. Embryos derived from in-vitro fertilization (IVF) that were not transferred or cryopreserved were included in this study. Ova were harvested for IVF after a standard ovarian stimulation with gonadotrophin-releasing hormone agonist/ human menopausal gonadotrophin (GnRHa/HMG) or follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH). Ova were collected and culture in 150 microliters droplets of P1 medium under mineral oil, in groups at 37 degrees C under 5% CO2, 5% O2, 90% N2 (group A) or under 5% CO2 in air (group B) environment. Embryo transfer was performed 72 h post-harvest. Viable embryos not transferred or cryopreserved were placed in blastocyst medium and cultured for an additional 48 h in 5% CO2 in air. Embryos that exhibited an expanded blastocoelic cavity and well-defined inner cell mass at 120 h were counted. Of 838 supernumerary embryos cultured, 448 (53.5%) reached the expanded blastocyst stage by 120 h of culture. Patients were given the option of cryopreservation at that time. The embryos were cryopreserved using a standard protocol with serial addition of glycerol. Embryos reaching the blastocyst stage after more than 120 h of culture were not included. There was no difference in the proportions of blastocyst development between group A, 217/410 (53.5%) and group B, 231/428 (54%). To date, 16 patients have each had up to three thawed blastocysts transferred, out of whom seven became pregnant. This report demonstrates that a simple system of sequential culture generated acceptable, viable blastocyst development (54%) with supernumerary embryos, without the use of feeder cells, conditioned medium or whole serum. Recognizing the differential metabolic requirements of early and late cleavage stage embryos has enabled the application of a glucose/phosphate-free simple culture medium (P1) for up to 72 h of culture and a complex, glucose-containing medium (blastocyst medium) for subsequent blastocyst development.

Diagnosis and surgical intervention are often delayed.A 38-year-old woman presented with acute lower right abdominal pain initially managed as renal colic. She returned to the emergency department three days later. After surgical consultation, a computed tomography scan and ultrasound showed a cystic pelvic mass with normal ovarian flow studies. Ultimately, the gynecology team performed laparoscopy with the suspicion of intermittent adnexal torsion. A 6 x 8-cm, twisted, dusky purple right fallopian tube was noted. A laparoscopic salpingectomy was performed.In the differential diagnosis of acute lower abdominal pain, isolated torsion of the fallopian tube should be considered. A timely diagnosis and surgical intervention may allow preservation of the tube. Even when irreversible damage has occurred, laparoscopic management is recommended.

Latex condoms were used to cover the probe. Following examination, the condoms were removed and the probe was wiped with a germicidal disposable cloth and left to air dry for 5 minutes. Condoms were filled with water and examined for leaks.Number of perforations and distance from condom tip.Seventeen (2%) of 840 condoms leaked. The mean distance from the tip to the point of leakage was 10.6 cm +/- 2.8 (mean +/- SD; range, 7-14). Sixty-five percent of the leaks were < or = 10 cm from the tip. In several instances, two leaking condoms were found within a few examinations of each other. No visual contamination of the probe was noted.Although only 2% of condoms leaked, 65% were at distances that could have led to probe soiling intravaginally. While no body fluids were grossly visible, microscopic contamination was still possible. Since perforations were noted in close, and even consecutive scans, this study underscores the need for routine probe disinfection between examinations.

The difference in the viable PRs between the two groups (43% versus 37%) for patients < 40 years old was not statistically significant.Patient tolerance and PRs are similar for air and CO2 pneumoperitoneum during GIFT under local anesthesia. Given the theoretical risk of air embolus and lack of detrimental effect of CO2 on patient tolerance and success rate, it seems prudent to use CO2 in such a setting.

Sixty-nine percent of the patients scored ""very good,"" 20% ""good,"" 9% ""acceptable,"" and 2% ""poor."" All 38 patients undergoing 97 repeat procedures selected local anesthesia again. For women < 40 years of age, clinical PR and delivery rate were 43% and 38%, respectively.Routine office GIFT under local anesthesia is effective and well accepted by the surgeon and is preferred by patients. It offers a significant cost containment and scheduling flexibility in addition to high success rates.

L. Interleukin-1 receptor type I, IL-1 beta, IL-1 receptor antagonist, and human macrophages were immunohistochemically localized in the villous trophoblast, maternal-trophoblast interphase, and maternal decidua during early human implantation. Immunostaining for IL-1 receptor type I was present in the syncytiotrophoblast and hyperplastic endometrial glands in the maternal decidua. Immunoreactive IL-1 beta was present in the villous cytotrophoblast, syncytiotrophoblast, intermediate trophoblast, and maternal stromal decidual cells. IL-1 receptor antagonist staining was observed in the glandular endometrium of the maternal decidua and in isolated cells located inside the chorionic villi, intervillous space, and maternal decidua. Mature human macrophages, as defined by both CD/68+ and HAM56+, were present in the chorionic villi, maternal blood of intervillous space, and maternal decidua. Co-localization studies demonstrated that macrophages in all of the reported locations also stained for immunoreactive IL-1 beta. Our results show the shared presence in maternal and embryonic tissues of this receptor-agonist-antagonist system during early human implantation. This finding supports an autocrine/paracrine role for the IL-1 system in human implantation.

E., ELDANASOURI, I., Milki, A., Polan, M. L. Plasminogen activators and their inhibitors have been implicated in the process of fibrinolysis, tissue remodeling, and ovulation. Epidermal growth factor (EGF), a paracrine hormone found in the human ovary, increases plasminogen activator (PA) activity and the gene expression of PA and plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI) in human endothelial cells and human cell lines. Gonadotropins also increase PA activity and gene expression in rat preovulatory granulosa cells. We have now analyzed the gene expression of PAI-1 and PAI-2 in uncultured human cumulus cells (CC), uncultured granulosa-luteal cells (GLC), and cultured GLC obtained from preovulatory follicles of patients undergoing assisted reproductive technologies. We also studied the effects of hCG and EGF on PAI-1 and PAI-2 mRNA levels in cultured GLC; GLC were cultured in serum-free medium for various times within 24 h with or without hCG and for 6 h with or without hCG, EGF, or EGF plus hCG. Total RNAs from CC and GLC were extracted, and blot hybridizations with 32P-labeled PAI-1, PAI-2, or 28S ribosomal RNA cDNA probes were performed. Both CC and GLC expressed PAI-1 and PAI-2 genes. In GLC, steady state levels of PAI-1 mRNA levels steadily increased within 24 h of culture, whereas PAI-2 levels peaked at 6 h of culture. PAI-1 mRNA levels were not affected by hCG or EGF at 6 h of culture, but PAI-2 mRNA levels were significantly increased by EGF at 6 h of culture. These studies demonstrate that human GLC PAI-1 and PAI-2 mRNA levels are differentially regulated and suggest that EGF may be involved in modulation of the human ovarian PA system during the periovulatory period.

LOCAL-ANESTHESIA WITH CONSCIOUS SEDATION FOR LAPAROSCOPIC INTRAFALLOPIAN TRANSFER Milki, A. A., Giudice, L. C., Hardy, R. I., Lamb, E. J., ELDANASOURI, I. Local anesthesia with conscious sedation is well accepted by patients and provides scheduling flexibility, cost containment, patient safety, and ease of recovery. We believe the technique should be offered to selected patients undergoing intrafallopian transfer. By adhering to specific guidelines for surgical technique and monitoring, the procedure is a safe and acceptable alternative to general anesthesia for laparoscopic intrafallopian transfers.

To determine if luteinizing human granulosa cells contain messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNAs) encoding insulin-like growth factor-binding protein (IGFBPs) and if cultured granulosa secrete IGFBPs into conditioned medium (CM).Northern analysis, using IGFBP-specific complementary deoxyribonucleic acid probes, was used to detect granulosa-derived IGFBP mRNAs. Western ligand blot analysis of CM was used to detect IGFBPs secreted by granulosa cultures with and without human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG).Granulosa cells were obtained from the In Vitro Fertilization (IVF) Program at Stanford University, a private teaching institution.Patients undergoing IVF for tubal disease.None.Transcripts of IGFBP mRNA and IGFBPs secreted into CM were detected by autoradiography of Northern and Western ligand blots, respectively.Transcripts of IGFBP-3, IGFBP-2, and IGFBP-1 mRNA were detected in human luteinizing granulosa. Cultured granulosa secreted IGFBPs with molecular weights corresponding to IGFBP-3, IGFBP-2, and IGFBP-1, and the latter two IGFBPs increased with 10 ng/mL hCG. A 24 kd IGFBP was noted, which may be newly characterized IGFBP-4.These data show that luteinizing human granulosa cells express mRNAs encoding three IGFBPs, secrete IGFBPs into culture medium, and that production of at least two of the IGFBPs is hCG-dependent, further supporting a role for the IGF system in human folliculogenesis.

Adherence to the recommended ollitropin alfa dosage and regimen of administration, and careful monitoring of therapy will minimise the incidence of such events. For accurate interpretation of the indices of follicle development and maturation, the physician should be experienced in the interpretation of the relevant tests. In clinical trials, an increase of the ovarian sensitivity tofollitropin alfa was shown when administered with lutropin alfa. If an FSH dose increase is deemed appropriate, dose adaptation should preferably be at7-14 day intervals and preferably with 37.5-75 IU increments. No direct comparison of follitropin alfa/LH versus human menopausal gonadotropin (hMG) has been performed. Comparison with historical data suggests that the ovulation rate obtained with follitropin alfa/LH issimilar to that obtained with hMG. The most commonly reported adverse reactions are headache, ovarian cysts and local injection site reactions (e.g. pain, erythema, haematoma, swelling and/or irritation at the site of injection). Mild or moderate ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) has been commonly reported and should be considered as an intrinsic risk of the stimulation procedure. Severe OHSS is uncommon (see section 4.4). following definitions apply to the frequency terminology used here after: Very rare: Mild to severe hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylactic reactions and shock Very rare: Exacerbation or aggravation of asthma Common: Abdominal pain, abdominal distension, abdominal discomfort, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea Common: Mild or moderate OHSS (including associated symptomatology) Uncommon: Severe OHSS (including associated symptomatology) (see section 4.4) General disorders and administration site conditions Very common: Injection site reactions (e.g. pain, erythema, haematoma, swelling and/or irritation at the site of injection) Very rare: Mild to severe hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylactic reactions ands hock Very rare: Exacerbation or aggravation of asthma General disorders and administration site conditions Very common:  Injection site reactions (e.g. pain, erythema, haematoma, swelling and/or irritation at the site of injection) Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important.

Stimulation of multifollicular development in patients undergoing superovulation for assisted reproductive technologies (ART) such as fertilisation (IVF), gamete intra-fallopian transfer (GIFT) and zygote intra-fallopian transfer (ZIFT). Follitropin alfa in association with a luteinising hormone (LH) preparation is recommended for the stimulation of follicular development in women with severe LH and FSH deficiency. In clinical trials these patients were defined by an endogenous serum LH level < 1.2 IU/. Follitropin alfa is indicated for the stimulation of spermatogenesis in men who have congenital or acquired hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism with concomitant human Chorionic Gonadotrophin (hCG) therapy. Treatment with Bemfola should be initiated under the supervision of a physician experienced in the treatment of fertility disorders. Patients must be provided with the correct number of pens for their treatment course and educated to use the proper injection techniques. The dose recommendations given for follitropin alfa are those in use for urinary FSH. Clinical assessment of follitropin alfa indicates that its daily doses, regimens of administration and treatment monitoring procedures should not be different from those currently used for urinary FSH-containing medicinal products. It is advised to adhere to the recommended starting doses indicated below. Comparative clinical studies have shown that on average patients require a lower cumulative dose and shorter treatment duration with follitropin alfa compared with urinary FSH. Therefore, it is considered appropriate to give a lower total dose of follitropin alfa than generally used for urinary FSH, not only in order to optimise follicular development but also to minimise the risk of unwanted ovarian hyperstimulation (see section 5.1). Women with anovulation (including polycystic ovarian syndrome) Bemfola may be given as a course of daily injections. In menstruating women treatment should commence within the first 7 days of the menstrual cycle. A commonly used regimen commences at 75-150 IU FSH daily and is increased preferably by 37.5 or 75 IU at 7 or preferably 14 day intervals if necessary, to obtain an adequate, but not excessive, response. Treatment should be tailored to the individual patient’s response as assessed by measuring follicle size by ultrasound and/or oestrogen secretion. The maximal daily dose is usually not higher than 225 IU FSH. If a patient fails to respond adequately after 4 weeks of treatment, that cycle should be abandoned and the patient should undergo further evaluation after which she may recommence treatment at a higher starting dose than in the abandoned cycle. When an optimal response is obtained, a single injection of 250 micrograms r-hCG) or 5,000 IU up to 10,000 IU hCG should be administered 24‑48 hours after the last follitropin alfa injection. The patient is recommended to have coitus on the day of, and the day following, hCG administration. Alternatively intrauterine insemination (IUI) may be performed. If an excessive response is obtained, treatment should be stopped and hCG withheld (see section 4.4). Treatment should recommence in the next cycle at a dose lower than that of the previous cycle. Women undergoing ovarian stimulation for multiple follicular development prior to in vitro fertilisation or other assisted reproductive technologies A commonly used regimen for superovulation involves the administration of 150-225 IU of follitropin alfa daily commencing on days 2 or 3 of the cycle. Treatment is continued until adequate follicular development has been achieved (as assessed by monitoring of serum strogen concentrations and/or ultrasound examination), with the dose adjusted according to the patient's response, to usually not higher than 450 IU daily. In general adequate follicular development is achieved on average by the tenth day of treatment (range 5 to 20 days). A single injection of 250 micrograms r-hCG or 5,000 IU up to 10,000 IU hCG is administered 24‑48 hours after the last follitropin alfa injection to induce final follicular maturation. Down-regulation with a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist or antagonist is now commonly used in order to suppress the endogenous LH surge and to control tonic levels of LH. In a commonly used protocol, follitropin alfa is started approximately 2 weeks after the start of agonist treatment, both being continued until adequate follicular development is achieved. For example, following two weeks of treatment with an agonist, 150-225 IU follitropin alfa are administered for the first 7 days. The dose is then adjusted according to the ovarian response. Overall experience with IVF indicates that in general the treatment success rate remains stable during the first four attempts and gradually declines thereafter. Women with anovulation resulting from severe LH and FSH deficiency In LH and FSH deficient women (hypogonadotropic hypogonadism), the objective of Bemfola therapy in association with lutropin alfa is to develop a single mature Graafian follicle from which the oocyte will be liberated after the administration of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). Follitropin alfa should be given as a course of daily injections simultaneously with lutropin alfa. Since these patients are amenorrhoeic and have low endogenous strogen secretion, treatment can commence at any time. A recommended regimen commences at 75 IU of lutropin alfa daily with 75-150 IU FSH. Treatment should be tailored to the individual patient's response as assessed by measuring follicle size by ultrasound and strogen response. If an FSH dose increase is deemed appropriate, dose adaptation should preferably be after 7-14 day intervals and preferably by 37.5-75 IU increments. It may be acceptable to extend the duration of stimulation in any one cycle to up to 5 weeks. When an optimal response is obtained, a single injection of 250 micrograms r-hCG or 5,000 IU up to 10,000 IU hCG should be administered 24-48 hours after the last follitropin alfa and lutropin alfa injections. The patient is recommended to have coitus on the day of, and on the day following hCG administration. Luteal phase support may be considered since lack of substances with luteotrophic activity (LH/hCG) after ovulation may lead to premature failure of the corpus luteum. If an excessive response is obtained, treatment should be stopped and hCG withheld. Treatment should recommence in the next cycle at a dose of FSH lower than that of the previous cycle. Bemfola should be given at a dose of 150 IU three times a week, concomitantly with hCG, for a minimum of 4 months. If after this period, the patient has not responded, the combination treatment may be continued; current clinical experience indicates that treatment for at least 18 months may be necessary to achieve spermatogenesis. There is no relevant use of follitropin alfa in the elderly population. Safety and effectiveness of follitropin alfa in elderly patients have not been established. Safety, efficacy and pharmacokinetics of follitropin alfa in patients with renal or hepatic impairment have not been established. There is no relevant use of follitropin alfa in the paediatric population. Bemfola is intended for subcutaneous administration. The first injection of Bemfola should be performed under direct medical supervision. Self-administration of Bemfola should only be performed by patients who are well motivated, adequately trained and have access to expert advice. single-dose cartridge is intended for only one injection, clear instructions should be provided to the patients to avoid misuse of the single dose presentation.

Gonadotropin therapy requires a certain time commitment by physicians and supportive health professionals, as well as the availability of appropriate monitoring facilities. In women, safe and effective use of follitropin alfa calls for monitoring of ovarian response with ultrasound, alone or preferably in combination with measurement of serum stradiol levels, on a regular basis. There may be a degree of interpatient variability in response to FSH administration, with a poor response to FSH in some patients . The lowest effective dose in relation to the treatment objective should be used in both men and women. Patients with porphyria or a family history of porphyria should be closely monitored during treatment with follitropin alfa. Deterioration or a first appearance of this condition may require cessation of treatment. Before starting treatment, the couple's infertility should be assessed as appropriate and putative contraindications for pregnancy evaluated. In particular, patients should be evaluated for hypothyroidism, adrenocortical deficiency, hyperprolactinemia and appropriate specific treatment given. Patients undergoing stimulation of follicular growth, whether as treatment for anovulatory infertility or ART procedures, may experience ovarian enlargement or develop hyperstimulation. Adherence to the recommended follitropin alfa dosage and regimen of administration, and careful monitoring of therapy will minimise the incidence of such events. For accurate interpretation of the indices of follicle development and maturation, the physician should be experienced in the interpretation of the relevant tests. In clinical trials, an increase of the ovarian sensitivity to follitropin alfa was shown when administered with lutropin alfa. If an FSH dose increase is deemed appropriate, dose adaptation should preferably be at 7-14 day intervals and preferably with 37.5-75 IU increments. No direct comparison of follitropin alfa/LH versus human menopausal gonadotropin (hMG) has been performed. Comparison with historical data suggests that the ovulation rate obtained with follitropin alfa/LH is similar to that obtained with hMG. A certain degree of ovarian enlargement is an expected effect of controlled ovarian stimulation. It is more commonly seen in women with polycystic ovarian syndrome and usually regresses without treatment. In distinction to uncomplicated ovarian enlargement, OHSS is a condition that can manifest itself with increasing degrees of severity. It comprises marked ovarian enlargement, high serum sex steroids, and an increase in vascular permeability which can result in an accumulation of fluid in the peritoneal, pleural and, rarely, in the pericardial cavities. The following symptomatology may be observed in severe cases of OHSS: abdominal pain, abdominal distension, severe ovarian enlargement, weight gain, dyspnoea, oliguria and gastrointestinal symptoms including nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea. Clinical evaluation may reveal hypovolaemia, haemoconcentration, electrolyte imbalances, ascites, haemoperitoneum, pleural effusions, hydrothorax, or acute pulmonary distress. Very rarely, severe OHSS may be complicated by ovarian torsion or thromboembolic events such as pulmonary embolism, ischaemic stroke or myocardial infarction. Independent risk factors for developing OHSS include polycystic ovarian syndrome high absolute or rapidly rising serum oestradiol levels (e.g. > 900 pg/ in ART) and large number of developing ovarian follicles (e.g. > 3 follicles of ≥ 14 mm in diameter in anovulation; ≥ 20 follicles of ≥ 12 mm in diameter in ART). regimen of administration can minimise the risk of ovarian hyperstimulation (see sections 4.2 and 4.8). Monitoring of stimulation cycles by ultrasound scans as well as oestradiol measurements are recommended to early identify risk factors. There is evidence to suggest that hCG plays a key role in triggering OHSS and that the syndrome may be more severe and more protracted if pregnancy occurs. Therefore, if signs of ovarian hyperstimulation occur such as e and/or ≥ 40 follicles in total, it is recommended that hCG be withheld and the patient be advised to refrain from coitus or to use barrier contraceptive methods for at least 4 days. OHSS may progress rapidly (within 24 hours) or over several days to become a serious medical event. It most often occurs after hormonal treatment has been discontinued and reaches its maximum at about seven to ten days following treatment. Therefore patients should be followed for at least two weeks after hCG administration. In ART, aspiration of all follicles prior to ovulation may reduce the occurrence of hyperstimulation. Mild or moderate OHSS usually resolves spontaneously. If severe OHSS occurs, it is recommended that gonadotropin treatment be stopped if still ongoing, and that the patient be hospitalised and appropriate therapy be started. In patients undergoing ovulation induction, the incidence of multiple pregnancy is increased compared with natural conception. The majority of multiple are twins. Multiple pregnancies, especially of high order, carr an increased risk of adverse maternal and perinatal outcomes. multiple pregnancy, careful monitoring of ovarian response is recommended. In patients undergoing ART procedures the risk of multiple pregnancy is related mainly to the number of embryos placed, their quality and the patient age. The patients should be advised of the potential risk of multiple births before starting treatment. The incidence of pregnancy loss by miscarriage or abortion is higher in patients undergoing stimulation of follicular growth for ovulation induction or ART than following natural conception. Women with a history of tubal disease are at risk of ectopic pregnancy, whether the pregnancy is obtained by spontaneous conception or with fertility treatments. The prevalence of ectopic pregnancy after ART was reported to be higher than in the general population. There have been reports of ovarian and other reproductive system neoplasms, both benign and malignant, in women who have undergone multiple treatment regimens for infertility treatment. It is not yet established whether or not treatment with gonadotropins increases the risk of these tumours in infertile women. The prevalence of congenital malformations after ART may be slightly higher than after spontaneous conceptions. This is thought to be due to differences in parental characteristics (e.g. maternal age, sperm characteristics) and multiple pregnancies. In women with recent or ongoing thromboembolic disease or women with generally recognised risk factors for thromboembolic events, such as personal or family history, treatment with gonadotropins may further increase the risk for aggravation or occurrence of such events. In these women, the benefits of gonadotropin administration need to be weighed against the risks. It should be noted however that pregnancy itself as well as OHSS also carry an increased risk of thromboembolic events. Elevated endogenous FSH levels are indicative of primary testicular failure. Such patients are unresponsive to follitropin alfa/hCG therapy. Follitropin alfa should not be used when an effective response cannot be obtained. Semen analysis is recommended 4 to 6 months after the beginning of treatment as part of the assessment of the response. Bemfola contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i.e. essentially “sodium-free”. 4.5Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction Concomitant use of follitropin alfa with other medicinal products used to stimulate ovulation (e.g. hCG, clomiphene citrate) may potentiate the follicular response, whereas concurrent use of a GnRH agonist or antagonist to induce pituitary desensitisation may increase the dose of follitropin alfa needed to elicit an adequate ovarian response. No other clinically significant drug interaction has been reported during follitropin alfa therapy . Sex hormones and modulators of the genital systems, gonadotropins Bemfola is a biosimilar medicinal product, that has been demonstrated to be similar in quality, safety and efficacy to the reference medicinal product GONAL-f. More detailed information is available on the website of the European Medicines Agency In women, the most important effect resulting from parenteral administration of FSH is the development of mature Graafian follicles. In women with anovulation, the objective of therapy with follitropin alfa is to develop a single mature Graafian follicle from which the ovum will be liberated after the administration of hCG In clinical trials, patients with severe FSH and LH deficiency were defined by an endogenous serum LH level < 1.2 IU/ as measured in a central laboratory. However, it should be taken into account that there are variations between LH measurements performed in different laboratories. In clinical studies comparing r-hFSH (follitropin alfa) and urinary FSH in ART (see table 1 below) and in ovulation induction, follitropin alfa was more potent than urinary FSH in terms of a lower total dose and a shorter treatment period needed to trigger follicular maturation. In ART, follitropin alfa at a lower total dose and shorter treatment period than urinary FSH, resulted in a higher number of oocytes retrieved when compared to urinary FSH. Table 1: Results of study GF 8407 (randomised parallel group study comparing efficacy and safety of follitropin alfa with urinary FSH in assisted reproduction technologies) Total dose of FSH required (number of FSH 75 IU ampoules) Differences between the 2 groups were statistically significant (p< 0.05) for all criteria listed. In men deficient in FSH, follitropin alfa administered concomitantly with hCG for at least 4 months induces spermatogenesis. Following intravenous administration, follitropin alfa is distributed to the extracellular fluid space with an initial half-life of around 2 hours and eliminated from the body with a terminal half-life of about one day. The steady state volume of distribution and total clearance are 10  and 0.6 /h, respectively. One-eighth of the follitropin alfa dose is excreted in the urine. Following subcutaneous administration, the absolute bioavailability is about 70%. Following repeated administration, follitropin alfa accumulates 3-fold achieving a steadystate within 3-4 days. In women whose endogenous gonadotropin secretion is suppressed, follitropin alfa has nevertheless been shown to effectively stimulate follicular development and steroidogenesis, despite unmeasurable LH levels. Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of single and repeated dose toxicity and genotoxicity additional to that already stated in other sections of this SmPC. Impaired fertility has been reported in rats exposed to pharmacological doses of follitropin alfa (≥ 40 IU/kg/day) for extended periods, through reduced fecundity.  5 IU/kg/day) follitropin alfa caused a decrease in the number of viable foetuses without being teratogen, and dystocia similar to that observed with urinary enopausal onadotropin (hMG).

Adherence to the recommended ollitropin alfa dosage and regimen of administration, and careful monitoring of therapy will minimise the incidence of such events. For accurate interpretation of the indices of follicle development and maturation, the physician should be experienced in the interpretation of the relevant tests. In clinical trials, an increase of the ovarian sensitivity tofollitropin alfa was shown when administered with lutropin alfa. If an FSH dose increase is deemed appropriate, dose adaptation should preferably be at7-14 day intervals and preferably with 37.5-75 IU increments. No direct comparison of follitropin alfa/LH versus human menopausal gonadotropin (hMG) has been performed. Comparison with historical data suggests that the ovulation rate obtained with follitropin alfa/LH issimilar to that obtained with hMG. The most commonly reported adverse reactions are headache, ovarian cysts and local injection site reactions (e.g. pain, erythema, haematoma, swelling and/or irritation at the site of injection). Mild or moderate ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) has been commonly reported and should be considered as an intrinsic risk of the stimulation procedure.

Stimulation of multifollicular development in patients undergoing superovulation for assisted reproductive technologies (ART) such as fertilisation (IVF), gamete intra-fallopian transfer (GIFT) and zygote intra-fallopian transfer (ZIFT). Follitropin alfa in association with a luteinising hormone (LH) preparation is recommended for the stimulation of follicular development in women with severe LH and FSH deficiency. In clinical trials these patients were defined by an endogenous serum LH level < 1.2 IU/. Follitropin alfa is indicated for the stimulation of spermatogenesis in men who have congenital or acquired hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism with concomitant human Chorionic Gonadotrophin (hCG) therapy. Treatment with Bemfola should be initiated under the supervision of a physician experienced in the treatment of fertility disorders. Patients must be provided with the correct number of pens for their treatment course and educated to use the proper injection techniques. The dose recommendations given for follitropin alfa are those in use for urinary FSH. Clinical assessment of follitropin alfa indicates that its daily doses, regimens of administration and treatment monitoring procedures should not be different from those currently used for urinary FSH-containing medicinal products. It is advised to adhere to the recommended starting doses indicated below. Comparative clinical studies have shown that on average patients require a lower cumulative dose and shorter treatment duration with follitropin alfa compared with urinary FSH. Therefore, it is considered appropriate to give a lower total dose of follitropin alfa than generally used for urinary FSH, not only in order to optimise follicular development but also to minimise the risk of unwanted ovarian hyperstimulation (see section 5.1). Women with anovulation (including polycystic ovarian syndrome) Bemfola may be given as a course of daily injections. In menstruating women treatment should commence within the first 7 days of the menstrual cycle. A commonly used regimen commences at 75-150 IU FSH daily and is increased preferably by 37.5 or 75 IU at 7 or preferably 14 day intervals if necessary, to obtain an adequate, but not excessive, response. Treatment should be tailored to the individual patient’s response as assessed by measuring follicle size by ultrasound and/or oestrogen secretion. The maximal daily dose is usually not higher than 225 IU FSH. If a patient fails to respond adequately after 4 weeks of treatment, that cycle should be abandoned and the patient should undergo further evaluation after which she may recommence treatment at a higher starting dose than in the abandoned cycle. When an optimal response is obtained, a single injection of 250 micrograms r-hCG) or 5,000 IU up to 10,000 IU hCG should be administered 24‑48 hours after the last follitropin alfa injection. The patient is recommended to have coitus on the day of, and the day following, hCG administration. Alternatively intrauterine insemination (IUI) may be performed. If an excessive response is obtained, treatment should be stopped and hCG withheld (see section 4.4). Treatment should recommence in the next cycle at a dose lower than that of the previous cycle. Women undergoing ovarian stimulation for multiple follicular development prior to in vitro fertilisation or other assisted reproductive technologies A commonly used regimen for superovulation involves the administration of 150-225 IU of follitropin alfa daily commencing on days 2 or 3 of the cycle. Treatment is continued until adequate follicular development has been achieved (as assessed by monitoring of serum strogen concentrations and/or ultrasound examination), with the dose adjusted according to the patient's response, to usually not higher than 450 IU daily. In general adequate follicular development is achieved on average by the tenth day of treatment (range 5 to 20 days). A single injection of 250 micrograms r-hCG or 5,000 IU up to 10,000 IU hCG is administered 24‑48 hours after the last follitropin alfa injection to induce final follicular maturation. Down-regulation with a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist or antagonist is now commonly used in order to suppress the endogenous LH surge and to control tonic levels of LH. In a commonly used protocol, follitropin alfa is started approximately 2 weeks after the start of agonist treatment, both being continued until adequate follicular development is achieved. For example, following two weeks of treatment with an agonist, 150-225 IU follitropin alfa are administered for the first 7 days. The dose is then adjusted according to the ovarian response. Overall experience with IVF indicates that in general the treatment success rate remains stable during the first four attempts and gradually declines thereafter. Women with anovulation resulting from severe LH and FSH deficiency In LH and FSH deficient women (hypogonadotropic hypogonadism), the objective of Bemfola therapy in association with lutropin alfa is to develop a single mature Graafian follicle from which the oocyte will be liberated after the administration of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). Follitropin alfa should be given as a course of daily injections simultaneously with lutropin alfa. Since these patients are amenorrhoeic and have low endogenous strogen secretion, treatment can commence at any time. A recommended regimen commences at 75 IU of lutropin alfa daily with 75-150 IU FSH. Treatment should be tailored to the individual patient's response as assessed by measuring follicle size by ultrasound and strogen response. If an FSH dose increase is deemed appropriate, dose adaptation should preferably be after 7-14 day intervals and preferably by 37.5-75 IU increments. It may be acceptable to extend the duration of stimulation in any one cycle to up to 5 weeks. When an optimal response is obtained, a single injection of 250 micrograms r-hCG or 5,000 IU up to 10,000 IU hCG should be administered 24-48 hours after the last follitropin alfa and lutropin alfa injections. The patient is recommended to have coitus on the day of, and on the day following hCG administration. Luteal phase support may be considered since lack of substances with luteotrophic activity (LH/hCG) after ovulation may lead to premature failure of the corpus luteum. If an excessive response is obtained, treatment should be stopped and hCG withheld. Treatment should recommence in the next cycle at a dose of FSH lower than that of the previous cycle. Bemfola should be given at a dose of 150 IU three times a week, concomitantly with hCG, for a minimum of 4 months. If after this period, the patient has not responded, the combination treatment may be continued; current clinical experience indicates that treatment for at least 18 months may be necessary to achieve spermatogenesis. There is no relevant use of follitropin alfa in the elderly population. Safety and effectiveness of follitropin alfa in elderly patients have not been established. Safety, efficacy and pharmacokinetics of follitropin alfa in patients with renal or hepatic impairment have not been established. There is no relevant use of follitropin alfa in the paediatric population. Bemfola is intended for subcutaneous administration. The first injection of Bemfola should be performed under direct medical supervision. Self-administration of Bemfola should only be performed by patients who are well motivated, adequately trained and have access to expert advice. single-dose cartridge is intended for only one injection, clear instructions should be provided to the patients to avoid misuse of the single dose presentation.

Gonadotropin therapy requires a certain time commitment by physicians and supportive health professionals, as well as the availability of appropriate monitoring facilities. In women, safe and effective use of follitropin alfa calls for monitoring of ovarian response with ultrasound, alone or preferably in combination with measurement of serum stradiol levels, on a regular basis. There may be a degree of interpatient variability in response to FSH administration, with a poor response to FSH in some patients . The lowest effective dose in relation to the treatment objective should be used in both men and women. Patients with porphyria or a family history of porphyria should be closely monitored during treatment with follitropin alfa. Deterioration or a first appearance of this condition may require cessation of treatment. Before starting treatment, the couple's infertility should be assessed as appropriate and putative contraindications for pregnancy evaluated. In particular, patients should be evaluated for hypothyroidism, adrenocortical deficiency, hyperprolactinemia and appropriate specific treatment given. Patients undergoing stimulation of follicular growth, whether as treatment for anovulatory infertility or ART procedures, may experience ovarian enlargement or develop hyperstimulation. Adherence to the recommended follitropin alfa dosage and regimen of administration, and careful monitoring of therapy will minimise the incidence of such events. For accurate interpretation of the indices of follicle development and maturation, the physician should be experienced in the interpretation of the relevant tests. In clinical trials, an increase of the ovarian sensitivity to follitropin alfa was shown when administered with lutropin alfa. If an FSH dose increase is deemed appropriate, dose adaptation should preferably be at 7-14 day intervals and preferably with 37.5-75 IU increments. No direct comparison of follitropin alfa/LH versus human menopausal gonadotropin (hMG) has been performed. Comparison with historical data suggests that the ovulation rate obtained with follitropin alfa/LH is similar to that obtained with hMG. A certain degree of ovarian enlargement is an expected effect of controlled ovarian stimulation. It is more commonly seen in women with polycystic ovarian syndrome and usually regresses without treatment. In distinction to uncomplicated ovarian enlargement, OHSS is a condition that can manifest itself with increasing degrees of severity. It comprises marked ovarian enlargement, high serum sex steroids, and an increase in vascular permeability which can result in an accumulation of fluid in the peritoneal, pleural and, rarely, in the pericardial cavities. The following symptomatology may be observed in severe cases of OHSS: abdominal pain, abdominal distension, severe ovarian enlargement, weight gain, dyspnoea, oliguria and gastrointestinal symptoms including nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea. Clinical evaluation may reveal hypovolaemia, haemoconcentration, electrolyte imbalances, ascites, haemoperitoneum, pleural effusions, hydrothorax, or acute pulmonary distress. Very rarely, severe OHSS may be complicated by ovarian torsion or thromboembolic events such as pulmonary embolism, ischaemic stroke or myocardial infarction. Independent risk factors for developing OHSS include polycystic ovarian syndrome high absolute or rapidly rising serum oestradiol levels (e.g. > 900 pg/ in ART) and large number of developing ovarian follicles (e.g. > 3 follicles of ≥ 14 mm in diameter in anovulation; ≥ 20 follicles of ≥ 12 mm in diameter in ART). regimen of administration can minimise the risk of ovarian hyperstimulation (see sections 4.2 and 4.8). Monitoring of stimulation cycles by ultrasound scans as well as oestradiol measurements are recommended to early identify risk factors. There is evidence to suggest that hCG plays a key role in triggering OHSS and that the syndrome may be more severe and more protracted if pregnancy occurs. Therefore, if signs of ovarian hyperstimulation occur such as e and/or ≥ 40 follicles in total, it is recommended that hCG be withheld and the patient be advised to refrain from coitus or to use barrier contraceptive methods for at least 4 days. OHSS may progress rapidly (within 24 hours) or over several days to become a serious medical event. It most often occurs after hormonal treatment has been discontinued and reaches its maximum at about seven to ten days following treatment. Therefore patients should be followed for at least two weeks after hCG administration. In ART, aspiration of all follicles prior to ovulation may reduce the occurrence of hyperstimulation. Mild or moderate OHSS usually resolves spontaneously. If severe OHSS occurs, it is recommended that gonadotropin treatment be stopped if still ongoing, and that the patient be hospitalised and appropriate therapy be started. In patients undergoing ovulation induction, the incidence of multiple pregnancy is increased compared with natural conception. The majority of multiple are twins. Multiple pregnancies, especially of high order, carr an increased risk of adverse maternal and perinatal outcomes. multiple pregnancy, careful monitoring of ovarian response is recommended. In patients undergoing ART procedures the risk of multiple pregnancy is related mainly to the number of embryos placed, their quality and the patient age. The patients should be advised of the potential risk of multiple births before starting treatment. The incidence of pregnancy loss by miscarriage or abortion is higher in patients undergoing stimulation of follicular growth for ovulation induction or ART than following natural conception. Women with a history of tubal disease are at risk of ectopic pregnancy, whether the pregnancy is obtained by spontaneous conception or with fertility treatments. The prevalence of ectopic pregnancy after ART was reported to be higher than in the general population. There have been reports of ovarian and other reproductive system neoplasms, both benign and malignant, in women who have undergone multiple treatment regimens for infertility treatment. It is not yet established whether or not treatment with gonadotropins increases the risk of these tumours in infertile women. The prevalence of congenital malformations after ART may be slightly higher than after spontaneous conceptions. This is thought to be due to differences in parental characteristics (e.g. maternal age, sperm characteristics) and multiple pregnancies. In women with recent or ongoing thromboembolic disease or women with generally recognised risk factors for thromboembolic events, such as personal or family history, treatment with gonadotropins may further increase the risk for aggravation or occurrence of such events. In these women, the benefits of gonadotropin administration need to be weighed against the risks. It should be noted however that pregnancy itself as well as OHSS also carry an increased risk of thromboembolic events. Elevated endogenous FSH levels are indicative of primary testicular failure. Such patients are unresponsive to follitropin alfa/hCG therapy. Follitropin alfa should not be used when an effective response cannot be obtained. Semen analysis is recommended 4 to 6 months after the beginning of treatment as part of the assessment of the response. Bemfola contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i.e. essentially “sodium-free”. 4.5Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction Concomitant use of follitropin alfa with other medicinal products used to stimulate ovulation (e.g. hCG, clomiphene citrate) may potentiate the follicular response, whereas concurrent use of a GnRH agonist or antagonist to induce pituitary desensitisation may increase the dose of follitropin alfa needed to elicit an adequate ovarian response. No other clinically significant drug interaction has been reported during follitropin alfa therapy . Sex hormones and modulators of the genital systems, gonadotropins Bemfola is a biosimilar medicinal product, that has been demonstrated to be similar in quality, safety and efficacy to the reference medicinal product GONAL-f. More detailed information is available on the website of the European Medicines Agency In women, the most important effect resulting from parenteral administration of FSH is the development of mature Graafian follicles. In women with anovulation, the objective of therapy with follitropin alfa is to develop a single mature Graafian follicle from which the ovum will be liberated after the administration of hCG In clinical trials, patients with severe FSH and LH deficiency were defined by an endogenous serum LH level < 1.2 IU/ as measured in a central laboratory. However, it should be taken into account that there are variations between LH measurements performed in different laboratories. In clinical studies comparing r-hFSH (follitropin alfa) and urinary FSH in ART (see table 1 below) and in ovulation induction, follitropin alfa was more potent than urinary FSH in terms of a lower total dose and a shorter treatment period needed to trigger follicular maturation. In ART, follitropin alfa at a lower total dose and shorter treatment period than urinary FSH, resulted in a higher number of oocytes retrieved when compared to urinary FSH. Table 1: Results of study GF 8407 (randomised parallel group study comparing efficacy and safety of follitropin alfa with urinary FSH in assisted reproduction technologies) Total dose of FSH required (number of FSH 75 IU ampoules) Differences between the 2 groups were statistically significant (p< 0.05) for all criteria listed. In men deficient in FSH, follitropin alfa administered concomitantly with hCG for at least 4 months induces spermatogenesis. Following intravenous administration, follitropin alfa is distributed to the extracellular fluid space with an initial half-life of around 2 hours and eliminated from the body with a terminal half-life of about one day. The steady state volume of distribution and total clearance are 10  and 0.6 /h, respectively. One-eighth of the follitropin alfa dose is excreted in the urine. Following subcutaneous administration, the absolute bioavailability is about 70%. Following repeated administration, follitropin alfa accumulates 3-fold achieving a steadystate within 3-4 days. In women whose endogenous gonadotropin secretion is suppressed, follitropin alfa has nevertheless been shown to effectively stimulate follicular development and steroidogenesis, despite unmeasurable LH levels. Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of single and repeated dose toxicity and genotoxicity additional to that already stated in other sections of this SmPC. Impaired fertility has been reported in rats exposed to pharmacological doses of follitropin alfa (≥ 40 IU/kg/day) for extended periods, through reduced fecundity.  5 IU/kg/day) follitropin alfa caused a decrease in the number of viable foetuses without being teratogen, and dystocia similar to that observed with urinary enopausal onadotropin (hMG).

Follitropin alfa in association with a luteinising hormone (LH) preparation is recommended for the stimulation of follicular development in women with severe LH and FSH deficiency. In clinical trials these patients were defined by an endogenous serum LH level < 1.2 IU/. Follitropin alfa is indicated for the stimulation of spermatogenesis in men who have congenital or acquired hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism with concomitant human Chorionic Gonadotrophin (hCG) therapy. Treatment with Bemfola should be initiated under the supervision of a physician experienced in the treatment of fertility disorders. Patients must be provided with the correct number of pens for their treatment course and educated to use the proper injection techniques. The dose recommendations given for follitropin alfa are those in use for urinary FSH. Clinical assessment of follitropin alfa indicates that its daily doses, regimens of administration and treatment monitoring procedures should not be different from those currently used for urinary FSH-containing medicinal products. It is advised to adhere to the recommended starting doses indicated below. Comparative clinical studies have shown that on average patients require a lower cumulative dose and shorter treatment duration with follitropin alfa compared with urinary FSH. Therefore, it is considered appropriate to give a lower total dose of follitropin alfa than generally used for urinary FSH, not only in order to optimise follicular development but also to minimise the risk of unwanted ovarian hyperstimulation (see section 5.1). Women with anovulation (including polycystic ovarian syndrome) Bemfola may be given as a course of daily injections. In menstruating women treatment should commence within the first 7 days of the menstrual cycle. A commonly used regimen commences at 75-150 IU FSH daily and is increased preferably by 37.5 or 75 IU at 7 or preferably 14 day intervals if necessary, to obtain an adequate, but not excessive, response. Treatment should be tailored to the individual patient’s response as assessed by measuring follicle size by ultrasound and/or oestrogen secretion. The maximal daily dose is usually not higher than 225 IU FSH. If a patient fails to respond adequately after 4 weeks of treatment, that cycle should be abandoned and the patient should undergo further evaluation after which she may recommence treatment at a higher starting dose than in the abandoned cycle. When an optimal response is obtained, a single injection of 250 micrograms r-hCG) or 5,000 IU up to 10,000 IU hCG should be administered 24‑48 hours after the last follitropin alfa injection. The patient is recommended to have coitus on the day of, and the day following, hCG administration. Alternatively intrauterine insemination (IUI) may be performed. If an excessive response is obtained, treatment should be stopped and hCG withheld (see section 4.4). Treatment should recommence in the next cycle at a dose lower than that of the previous cycle. Women undergoing ovarian stimulation for multiple follicular development prior to in vitro fertilisation or other assisted reproductive technologies A commonly used regimen for superovulation involves the administration of 150-225 IU of follitropin alfa daily commencing on days 2 or 3 of the cycle. Treatment is continued until adequate follicular development has been achieved (as assessed by monitoring of serum strogen concentrations and/or ultrasound examination), with the dose adjusted according to the patient's response, to usually not higher than 450 IU daily. In general adequate follicular development is achieved on average by the tenth day of treatment (range 5 to 20 days). A single injection of 250 micrograms r-hCG or 5,000 IU up to 10,000 IU hCG is administered 24‑48 hours after the last follitropin alfa injection to induce final follicular maturation. Down-regulation with a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist or antagonist is now commonly used in order to suppress the endogenous LH surge and to control tonic levels of LH. In a commonly used protocol, follitropin alfa is started approximately 2 weeks after the start of agonist treatment, both being continued until adequate follicular development is achieved. For example, following two weeks of treatment with an agonist, 150-225 IU follitropin alfa are administered for the first 7 days. The dose is then adjusted according to the ovarian response. Overall experience with IVF indicates that in general the treatment success rate remains stable during the first four attempts and gradually declines thereafter. Women with anovulation resulting from severe LH and FSH deficiency In LH and FSH deficient women (hypogonadotropic hypogonadism), the objective of Bemfola therapy in association with lutropin alfa is to develop a single mature Graafian follicle from which the oocyte will be liberated after the administration of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). Follitropin alfa should be given as a course of daily injections simultaneously with lutropin alfa. Since these patients are amenorrhoeic and have low endogenous estrogen secretion, treatment can commence at any time. A recommended regimen commences at 75 IU of lutropin alfa daily with 75-150 IU FSH. Treatment should be tailored to the individual patient's response as assessed by measuring follicle size by ultrasound and estrogen response. If an FSH dose increase is deemed appropriate, dose adaptation should preferably be after 7-14 day intervals and preferably by 37.5-75 IU increments. It may be acceptable to extend the duration of stimulation in any one cycle to up to 5 weeks. When an optimal response is obtained, a single injection of 250 micrograms r-hCG or 5,000 IU up to 10,000 IU hCG should be administered 24-48 hours after the last follitropin alfa and lutropin alfa injections. The patient is recommended to have coitus on the day of, and on the day following hCG administration. Luteal phase support may be considered since lack of substances with luteotrophic activity (LH/hCG) after ovulation may lead to premature failure of the corpus luteum. If an excessive response is obtained, treatment should be stopped and hCG withheld. Treatment should recommence in the next cycle at a dose of FSH lower than that of the previous cycle. Bemfola should be given at a dose of 150 IU three times a week, concomitantly with hCG, for a minimum of 4 months. If after this period, the patient has not responded, the combination treatment may be continued; current clinical experience indicates that treatment for at least 18 months may be necessary to achieve spermatogenesis. There is no relevant use of follitropin alfa in the elderly population. Safety and effectiveness of follitropin alfa in elderly patients have not been established. Safety, efficacy and pharmacokinetics of follitropin alfa in patients with renal or hepatic impairment have not been established. There is no relevant use of follitropin alfa in the paediatric population. Bemfola is intended for subcutaneous administration. The first injection of Bemfola should be performed under direct medical supervision. Self-administration of Bemfola should only be performed by patients who are well motivated, adequately trained and have access to expert advice. single-dose cartridge is intended for only one injection, clear instructions should be provided to the patients to avoid misuse of the single dose presentation. For instructions on the administration with the pre-filled pen, see section 6.6 and the package leaflet. •hypersensitivity to the active substance follitropin alfa, FSH or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1; •tumours of the hypothalamus or pituitary gland; •ovarian enlargement or ovarian cyst not due to polycystic ovarian syndrome; •gynaecological haemorrhages of unknown aetiology; Follitropin alfa must not be used when an effective response cannot be obtained, such as •malformations of sexual organs incompatible with pregnancy; •fibroid tumours of the uterus incompatible with pregnancy; Follitropin alfa is a potent gonadotrophic substance capable of causing mild to severe adverse reactions, and should only be used by physicians who are thoroughly familiar with infertility problems and their management. Gonadotropin therapy requires a certain time commitment by physicians and supportive health professionals, as well as the availability of appropriate monitoring facilities. In women, safe and effective use of follitropin alfa calls for monitoring of ovarian response with ultrasound, alone or preferably in combination with measurement of serum estradiol levels, on a regular basis. There may be a degree of interpatient variability in response to FSH administration, with a poor response to FSH in some patients . The lowest effective dose in relation to the treatment objective should be used in both men and women. Patients with porphyria or a family history of porphyria should be closely monitored during treatment with follitropin alfa. Deterioration or a first appearance of this condition may require cessation of treatment. Before starting treatment, the couple's infertility should be assessed as appropriate and putative contraindications for pregnancy evaluated. In particular, patients should be evaluated for hypothyroidism, adrenocortical deficiency, hyperprolactinemia and appropriate specific treatment given. Patients undergoing stimulation of follicular growth, whether as treatment for anovulatory infertility or ART procedures, may experience ovarian enlargement or develop hyperstimulation. Adherence to the recommended follitropin alfa dosage and regimen of administration, and careful monitoring of therapy will minimise the incidence of such events. For accurate interpretation of the indices of follicle development and maturation, the physician should be experienced in the interpretation of the relevant tests. In clinical trials, an increase of the ovarian sensitivity to follitropin alfa was shown when administered with lutropin alfa. If an FSH dose increase is deemed appropriate, dose adaptation should preferably be at 7-14 day intervals and preferably with 37.5-75 IU increments. No direct comparison of follitropin alfa/LH versus human menopausal gonadotropin (hMG) has been performed. Comparison with historical data suggests that the ovulation rate obtained with follitropin alfa/LH is similar to that obtained with hMG. A certain degree of ovarian enlargement is an expected effect of controlled ovarian stimulation. It is more commonly seen in women with polycystic ovarian syndrome and usually regresses without treatment. In distinction to uncomplicated ovarian enlargement, OHSS is a condition that can manifest itself with increasing degrees of severity. It comprises marked ovarian enlargement, high serum sex steroids, and an increase in vascular permeability which can result in an accumulation of fluid in the peritoneal, pleural and, rarely, in the pericardial cavities. The following symptomatology may be observed in severe cases of OHSS: abdominal pain, abdominal distension, severe ovarian enlargement, weight gain, dyspnoea, oliguria and gastrointestinal symptoms including nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea. Clinical evaluation may reveal hypovolaemia, haemoconcentration, electrolyte imbalances, ascites, haemoperitoneum, pleural effusions, hydrothorax, or acute pulmonary distress. Very rarely, severe OHSS may be complicated by ovarian torsion or thromboembolic events such as pulmonary embolism, ischaemic stroke or myocardial infarction. Independent risk factors for developing OHSS include polycystic ovarian syndrome high absolute or rapidly rising serum oestradiol levels (e.g. > 900 pg/ in ART) and large number of developing ovarian follicles (e.g. > 3 follicles of ≥ 14 mm in diameter in anovulation; ≥ 20 follicles of ≥ 12 mm in diameter in ART). regimen of administration can minimise the risk of ovarian hyperstimulation (see sections 4.2 and 4.8). Monitoring of stimulation cycles by ultrasound scans as well as oestradiol measurements are recommended to early identify risk factors. There is evidence to suggest that hCG plays a key role in triggering OHSS and that the syndrome may be more severe and more protracted if pregnancy occurs. Therefore, if signs of ovarian hyperstimulation occur such as serum oestradiol level > 5,500 pg/ and/or ≥ 40 follicles in total, it is recommended that hCG be withheld and the patient be advised to refrain from coitus or to use barrier contraceptive methods for at least 4 days. OHSS may progress rapidly (within 24 hours) or over several days to become a serious medical event. It most often occurs after hormonal treatment has been discontinued and reaches its maximum at about seven to ten days following treatment. Therefore patients should be followed for at least two weeks after hCG administration. In ART, aspiration of all follicles prior to ovulation may reduce the occurrence of hyperstimulation. Mild or moderate OHSS usually resolves spontaneously. If severe OHSS occurs, it is recommended that gonadotropin treatment be stopped if still ongoing, and that the patient be hospitalised and appropriate therapy be started. In patients undergoing ovulation induction, the incidence of multiple pregnancy is increased compared with natural conception. The majority of multiple an increased risk of adverse maternal and perinatal outcomes. To minimise the risk of multiple pregnancy, careful monitoring of ovarian response is recommended. In patients undergoing ART procedures the risk of multiple pregnancy is related mainly to the number of embryos placed, their quality and the patient age. The patients should be advised of the potential risk of multiple before starting treatment. The incidence of pregnancy loss by miscarriage or abortion is higher in patients undergoing stimulation of follicular growth for ovulation induction or ART than following natural conception. Women with a history of tubal disease are at risk of ectopic pregnancy, whether the pregnancy is obtained by spontaneous conception or with fertility treatments. The prevalence of ectopic pregnancy after ART was reported to be higher than in the general population. There have been reports of ovarian and other reproductive system neoplasms, both benign and malignant, in women who have undergone multiple treatment regimens for infertility treatment. It is not yet established whether or not treatment with gonadotropins increases the risk of these tumours in infertile women. The prevalence of congenital malformations after ART may be slightly higher than after spontaneous conceptions. This is thought to be due to differences in parental characteristics (e.g. maternal age, sperm characteristics) and multiple pregnancies. In women with recent or ongoing thromboembolic disease or women with generally recognised risk factors for thromboembolic events, such as personal or family history, treatment with gonadotropins may further increase the risk for aggravation or occurrence of such events. In these women, the benefits of gonadotropin administration need to be weighed against the risks. It should be noted however that pregnancy itself as well as OHSS also carry an increased risk of thromboembolic events. Elevated endogenous FSH levels are indicative of primary testicular failure. Such patients are unresponsive to follitropin alfa/hCG therapy. Follitropin alfa should not be used when an effective response cannot be obtained. Semen analysis is recommended 4 to 6 months after the beginning of treatment as part of the assessment of the response. Bemfola contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i.e. essentially “sodium-free”. 4.5Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction Concomitant use of follitropin alfa with other medicinal products used to stimulate ovulation (e.g. hCG, clomiphene citrate) may potentiate the follicular response, whereas concurrent use of a GnRH agonist or antagonist to induce pituitary desensitisation may increase the dose of follitropin alfa needed to elicit an adequate ovarian response. No other clinically significant drug interaction has been reported during follitropin alfa therapy . Sex hormones and modulators of the genital systems, gonadotropins Bemfola is a biosimilar medicinal product, that has been demonstrated to be similar in quality, safety and efficacy to the reference medicinal product GONAL-f. More detailed information is available on the website of the European Medicines Agency In women, the most important effect resulting from parenteral administration of FSH is the development of mature Graafian follicles. In women with anovulation, the objective of therapy with follitropin alfa is to develop a single mature Graafian follicle from which the ovum will be liberated after the administration of hCG In clinical trials, patients with severe FSH and LH deficiency were defined by an endogenous serum LH level < 1.2 IU/ as measured in a central laboratory. However, it should be taken into account that there are variations between LH measurements performed in different laboratories. In clinical studies comparing r-hFSH (follitropin alfa) and urinary FSH in ART (see table 1 below) and in ovulation induction, follitropin alfa was more potent than urinary FSH in terms of a lower total dose and a shorter treatment period needed to trigger follicular maturation. In ART, follitropin alfa at a lower total dose and shorter treatment period than urinary FSH, resulted in a higher number of oocytes retrieved when compared to urinary FSH. Table 1: Results of study GF 8407 (randomised parallel group study comparing efficacy and safety of follitropin alfa with urinary FSH in assisted reproduction technologies) Total dose of FSH required (number of FSH 75 IU ampoules) Differences between the 2 groups were statistically significant (p< 0.05) for all criteria listed. In men deficient in FSH, follitropin alfa administered concomitantly with hCG for at least 4 months induces spermatogenesis. Following intravenous administration, follitropin alfa is distributed to the extracellular fluid space with an initial half-life of around 2 hours and eliminated from the body with a terminal half-life of about one day. The steady state volume of distribution and total clearance are 10  and 0.6 /h, respectively. One-eighth of the follitropin alfa dose is excreted in the urine. Following subcutaneous administration, the absolute bioavailability is about 70%. Following repeated administration, follitropin alfa accumulates 3-fold achieving a steadystate within 3-4 days. In women whose endogenous gonadotropin secretion is suppressed, follitropin alfa has nevertheless been shown to effectively stimulate follicular development and steroidogenesis, despite unmeasurable LH levels. Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of single and repeated dose toxicity and genotoxicity additional to that already stated in other sections of this SmPC. Impaired fertility has been reported in rats exposed to pharmacological doses of follitropin alfa (≥ 40 IU/kg/day) for extended periods, through reduced fecundity.  5 IU/kg/day) follitropin alfa caused a decrease in the number of viable foetuses without being teratogenic, and dystocia similar to that observed with urinary enopausal onadotropin (hMG).

In clinical trials, an increase of the ovarian sensitivity to follitropin alfa was shown when administered with lutropin alfa. If an FSH dose increase is deemed appropriate, dose adaptation should preferably be at 7-14 day intervals and preferably with 37.5-75 IU increments. No direct comparison of follitropin alfa/LH versus human menopausal gonadotropin (hMG) has been performed. Comparison with historical data suggests that the ovulation rate obtained with follitropin alfa/LH is similar to that obtained with hMG. The most commonly reported adverse reactions are headache, ovarian cysts and local injection site reactions (e.g. pain, erythema, haematoma, swelling and/or irritation at the site of injection). Mild or moderate ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) has been commonly reported and should be considered as an intrinsic risk of the stimulation procedure.

Stimulation of multifollicular development in patients undergoing superovulation for assisted reproductive technologies (ART) such as fertilisation (IVF), gamete intra-fallopian transfer (GIFT) and zygote intra-fallopian transfer (ZIFT). Follitropin alfa in association with a luteinising hormone (LH) preparation is recommended for the stimulation of follicular development in women with severe LH and FSH deficiency. In clinical trials these patients were defined by an endogenous serum LH level < 1.2 IU/. Follitropin alfa is indicated for the stimulation of spermatogenesis in men who have congenital or acquired hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism with concomitant human Chorionic Gonadotrophin (hCG) therapy. Treatment with Bemfola should be initiated under the supervision of a physician experienced in the treatment of fertility disorders. Patients must be provided with the correct number of pens for their treatment course and educated to use the proper injection techniques. The dose recommendations given for follitropin alfa are those in use for urinary FSH. Clinical assessment of follitropin alfa indicates that its daily doses, regimens of administration and treatment monitoring procedures should not be different from those currently used for urinary FSH-containing medicinal products. It is advised to adhere to the recommended starting doses indicated below. Comparative clinical studies have shown that on average patients require a lower cumulative dose and shorter treatment duration with follitropin alfa compared with urinary FSH. Therefore, it is considered appropriate to give a lower total dose of follitropin alfa than generally used for urinary FSH, not only in order to optimise follicular development but also to minimise the risk of unwanted ovarian hyperstimulation (see section 5.1). Women with anovulation (including polycystic ovarian syndrome) Bemfola may be given as a course of daily injections. In menstruating women treatment should commence within the first 7 days of the menstrual cycle. A commonly used regimen commences at 75-150 IU FSH daily and is increased preferably by 37.5 or 75 IU at 7 or preferably 14 day intervals if necessary, to obtain an adequate, but not excessive, response. Treatment should be tailored to the individual patient’s response as assessed by measuring follicle size by ultrasound and/or oestrogen secretion. The maximal daily dose is usually not higher than 225 IU FSH. If a patient fails to respond adequately after 4 weeks of treatment, that cycle should be abandoned and the patient should undergo further evaluation after which she may recommence treatment at a higher starting dose than in the abandoned cycle. When an optimal response is obtained, a single injection of 250 micrograms r-hCG) or 5,000 IU up to 10,000 IU hCG should be administered 24‑48 hours after the last follitropin alfa injection. The patient is recommended to have coitus on the day of, and the day following, hCG administration. Alternatively intrauterine insemination (IUI) may be performed. If an excessive response is obtained, treatment should be stopped and hCG withheld (see section 4.4). Treatment should recommence in the next cycle at a dose lower than that of the previous cycle. Women undergoing ovarian stimulation for multiple follicular development prior to in vitro fertilisation or other assisted reproductive technologies A commonly used regimen for superovulation involves the administration of 150-225 IU of follitropin alfa daily commencing on days 2 or 3 of the cycle. Treatment is continued until adequate follicular development has been achieved (as assessed by monitoring of serum strogen concentrations and/or ultrasound examination), with the dose adjusted according to the patient's response, to usually not higher than 450 IU daily. In general adequate follicular development is achieved on average by the tenth day of treatment (range 5 to 20 days). A single injection of 250 micrograms r-hCG or 5,000 IU up to 10,000 IU hCG is administered 24‑48 hours after the last follitropin alfa injection to induce final follicular maturation. Down-regulation with a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist or antagonist is now commonly used in order to suppress the endogenous LH surge and to control tonic levels of LH. In a commonly used protocol, follitropin alfa is started approximately 2 weeks after the start of agonist treatment, both being continued until adequate follicular development is achieved. For example, following two weeks of treatment with an agonist, 150-225 IU follitropin alfa are administered for the first 7 days. The dose is then adjusted according to the ovarian response. Overall experience with IVF indicates that in general the treatment success rate remains stable during the first four attempts and gradually declines thereafter. Women with anovulation resulting from severe LH and FSH deficiency In LH and FSH deficient women (hypogonadotropic hypogonadism), the objective of Bemfola therapy in association with lutropin alfa is to develop a single mature Graafian follicle from which the oocyte will be liberated after the administration of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). Follitropin alfa should be given as a course of daily injections simultaneously with lutropin alfa. Since these patients are amenorrhoeic and have low endogenous estrogen secretion, treatment can commence at any time. A recommended regimen commences at 75 IU of lutropin alfa daily with 75-150 IU FSH. Treatment should be tailored to the individual patient's response as assessed by measuring follicle size by ultrasound and estrogen response. If an FSH dose increase is deemed appropriate, dose adaptation should preferably be after 7-14 day intervals and preferably by 37.5-75 IU increments. It may be acceptable to extend the duration of stimulation in any one cycle to up to 5 weeks. When an optimal response is obtained, a single injection of 250 micrograms r-hCG or 5,000 IU up to 10,000 IU hCG should be administered 24-48 hours after the last follitropin alfa and lutropin alfa injections. The patient is recommended to have coitus on the day of, and on the day following hCG administration. Luteal phase support may be considered since lack of substances with luteotrophic activity (LH/hCG) after ovulation may lead to premature failure of the corpus luteum. If an excessive response is obtained, treatment should be stopped and hCG withheld. Treatment should recommence in the next cycle at a dose of FSH lower than that of the previous cycle. Bemfola should be given at a dose of 150 IU three times a week, concomitantly with hCG, for a minimum of 4 months. If after this period, the patient has not responded, the combination treatment may be continued; current clinical experience indicates that treatment for at least 18 months may be necessary to achieve spermatogenesis.

Gonadotropin therapy requires a certain time commitment by physicians and supportive health professionals, as well as the availability of appropriate monitoring facilities. In women, safe and effective use of follitropin alfa calls for monitoring of ovarian response with ultrasound, alone or preferably in combination with measurement of serum estradiol levels, on a regular basis. There may be a degree of interpatient variability in response to FSH administration, with a poor response to FSH in some patients . The lowest effective dose in relation to the treatment objective should be used in both men and women. Patients with porphyria or a family history of porphyria should be closely monitored during treatment with follitropin alfa. Deterioration or a first appearance of this condition may require cessation of treatment. Before starting treatment, the couple's infertility should be assessed as appropriate and putative contraindications for pregnancy evaluated. In particular, patients should be evaluated for hypothyroidism, adrenocortical deficiency, hyperprolactinemia and appropriate specific treatment given. Patients undergoing stimulation of follicular growth, whether as treatment for anovulatory infertility or ART procedures, may experience ovarian enlargement or develop hyperstimulation. Adherence to the recommended follitropin alfa dosage and regimen of administration, and careful monitoring of therapy will minimise the incidence of such events. For accurate interpretation of the indices of follicle development and maturation, the physician should be experienced in the interpretation of the relevant tests. In clinical trials, an increase of the ovarian sensitivity to follitropin alfa was shown when administered with lutropin alfa. If an FSH dose increase is deemed appropriate, dose adaptation should preferably be at 7-14 day intervals and preferably with 37.5-75 IU increments. No direct comparison of follitropin alfa/LH versus human menopausal gonadotropin (hMG) has been performed. Comparison with historical data suggests that the ovulation rate obtained with follitropin alfa/LH is similar to that obtained with hMG. A certain degree of ovarian enlargement is an expected effect of controlled ovarian stimulation. It is more commonly seen in women with polycystic ovarian syndrome and usually regresses without treatment. In distinction to uncomplicated ovarian enlargement, OHSS is a condition that can manifest itself with increasing degrees of severity. It comprises marked ovarian enlargement, high serum sex steroids, and an increase in vascular permeability which can result in an accumulation of fluid in the peritoneal, pleural and, rarely, in the pericardial cavities. The following symptomatology may be observed in severe cases of OHSS: abdominal pain, abdominal distension, severe ovarian enlargement, weight gain, dyspnoea, oliguria and gastrointestinal symptoms including nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea. Clinical evaluation may reveal hypovolaemia, haemoconcentration, electrolyte imbalances, ascites, haemoperitoneum, pleural effusions, hydrothorax, or acute pulmonary distress. Very rarely, severe OHSS may be complicated by ovarian torsion or thromboembolic events such as pulmonary embolism, ischaemic stroke or myocardial infarction. Independent risk factors for developing OHSS include polycystic ovarian syndrome high absolute or rapidly rising serum oestradiol levels (e.g. > 900 pg/ in ART) and large number of developing ovarian follicles (e.g. > 3 follicles of ≥ 14 mm in diameter in anovulation; ≥ 20 follicles of ≥ 12 mm in diameter in ART). regimen of administration can minimise the risk of ovarian hyperstimulation (see sections 4.2 and 4.8). Monitoring of stimulation cycles by ultrasound scans as well as oestradiol measurements are recommended to early identify risk factors. There is evidence to suggest that hCG plays a key role in triggering OHSS and that the syndrome may be more severe and more protracted if pregnancy occurs. Therefore, if signs of ovarian hyperstimulation occur such as serum oestradiol level > 5,500 pg/ and/or ≥ 40 follicles in total, it is recommended that hCG be withheld and the patient be advised to refrain from coitus or to use barrier contraceptive methods for at least 4 days. OHSS may progress rapidly (within 24 hours) or over several days to become a serious medical event. It most often occurs after hormonal treatment has been discontinued and reaches its maximum at about seven to ten days following treatment. Therefore patients should be followed for at least two weeks after hCG administration. In ART, aspiration of all follicles prior to ovulation may reduce the occurrence of hyperstimulation. Mild or moderate OHSS usually resolves spontaneously. If severe OHSS occurs, it is recommended that gonadotropin treatment be stopped if still ongoing, and that the patient be hospitalised and appropriate therapy be started. In patients undergoing ovulation induction, the incidence of multiple pregnancy is increased compared with natural conception. The majority of multiple an increased risk of adverse maternal and perinatal outcomes. To minimise the risk of multiple pregnancy, careful monitoring of ovarian response is recommended. In patients undergoing ART procedures the risk of multiple pregnancy is related mainly to the number of embryos placed, their quality and the patient age. The patients should be advised of the potential risk of multiple before starting treatment. The incidence of pregnancy loss by miscarriage or abortion is higher in patients undergoing stimulation of follicular growth for ovulation induction or ART than following natural conception. Women with a history of tubal disease are at risk of ectopic pregnancy, whether the pregnancy is obtained by spontaneous conception or with fertility treatments. The prevalence of ectopic pregnancy after ART was reported to be higher than in the general population. There have been reports of ovarian and other reproductive system neoplasms, both benign and malignant, in women who have undergone multiple treatment regimens for infertility treatment. It is not yet established whether or not treatment with gonadotropins increases the risk of these tumours in infertile women. The prevalence of congenital malformations after ART may be slightly higher than after spontaneous conceptions. This is thought to be due to differences in parental characteristics (e.g. maternal age, sperm characteristics) and multiple pregnancies. In women with recent or ongoing thromboembolic disease or women with generally recognised risk factors for thromboembolic events, such as personal or family history, treatment with gonadotropins may further increase the risk for aggravation or occurrence of such events. In these women, the benefits of gonadotropin administration need to be weighed against the risks. It should be noted however that pregnancy itself as well as OHSS also carry an increased risk of thromboembolic events. Elevated endogenous FSH levels are indicative of primary testicular failure. Such patients are unresponsive to follitropin alfa/hCG therapy. Follitropin alfa should not be used when an effective response cannot be obtained. Semen analysis is recommended 4 to 6 months after the beginning of treatment as part of the assessment of the response. Bemfola contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i.e. essentially “sodium-free”. 4.5Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction Concomitant use of follitropin alfa with other medicinal products used to stimulate ovulation (e.g. hCG, clomiphene citrate) may potentiate the follicular response, whereas concurrent use of a GnRH agonist or antagonist to induce pituitary desensitisation may increase the dose of follitropin alfa needed to elicit an adequate ovarian response. No other clinically significant drug interaction has been reported during follitropin alfa therapy . Sex hormones and modulators of the genital systems, gonadotropins Bemfola is a biosimilar medicinal product, that has been demonstrated to be similar in quality, safety and efficacy to the reference medicinal product GONAL-f. More detailed information is available on the website of the European Medicines Agency In women, the most important effect resulting from parenteral administration of FSH is the development of mature Graafian follicles. In women with anovulation, the objective of therapy with follitropin alfa is to develop a single mature Graafian follicle from which the ovum will be liberated after the administration of hCG In clinical trials, patients with severe FSH and LH deficiency were defined by an endogenous serum LH level < 1.2 IU/ as measured in a central laboratory. However, it should be taken into account that there are variations between LH measurements performed in different laboratories. In clinical studies comparing r-hFSH (follitropin alfa) and urinary FSH in ART (see table 1 below) and in ovulation induction, follitropin alfa was more potent than urinary FSH in terms of a lower total dose and a shorter treatment period needed to trigger follicular maturation. In ART, follitropin alfa at a lower total dose and shorter treatment period than urinary FSH, resulted in a higher number of oocytes retrieved when compared to urinary FSH. Table 1: Results of study GF 8407 (randomised parallel group study comparing efficacy and safety of follitropin alfa with urinary FSH in assisted reproduction technologies) Total dose of FSH required (number of FSH 75 IU ampoules) Differences between the 2 groups were statistically significant (p< 0.05) for all criteria listed. In men deficient in FSH, follitropin alfa administered concomitantly with hCG for at least 4 months induces spermatogenesis. Following intravenous administration, follitropin alfa is distributed to the extracellular fluid space with an initial half-life of around 2 hours and eliminated from the body with a terminal half-life of about one day. The steady state volume of distribution and total clearance are 10  and 0.6 /h, respectively. One-eighth of the follitropin alfa dose is excreted in the urine. Following subcutaneous administration, the absolute bioavailability is about 70%. Following repeated administration, follitropin alfa accumulates 3-fold achieving a steadystate within 3-4 days. In women whose endogenous gonadotropin secretion is suppressed, follitropin alfa has nevertheless been shown to effectively stimulate follicular development and steroidogenesis, despite unmeasurable LH levels. Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of single and repeated dose toxicity and genotoxicity additional to that already stated in other sections of this SmPC. Impaired fertility has been reported in rats exposed to pharmacological doses of follitropin alfa (≥ 40 IU/kg/day) for extended periods, through reduced fecundity.  5 IU/kg/day) follitropin alfa caused a decrease in the number of viable foetuses without being teratogenic, and dystocia similar to that observed with urinary enopausal onadotropin (hMG).

Stimulation of multifollicular development in patients undergoing superovulation for assisted reproductive technologies (ART) such as fertilisation (IVF), gamete intra-fallopian transfer (GIFT) and zygote intra-fallopian transfer (ZIFT). Follitropin alfa in association with a luteinising hormone (LH) preparation is recommended for the stimulation of follicular development in women with severe LH and FSH deficiency. In clinical trials these patients were defined by an endogenous serum LH level < 1.2 IU/. Follitropin alfa is indicated for the stimulation of spermatogenesis in men who have congenital or acquired hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism with concomitant human Chorionic Gonadotrophin (hCG) therapy. Treatment with Bemfola should be initiated under the supervision of a physician experienced in the treatment of fertility disorders. Patients must be provided with the correct number of pens for their treatment course and educated to use the proper injection techniques. The dose recommendations given for follitropin alfa are those in use for urinary FSH. Clinical assessment of follitropin alfa indicates that its daily doses, regimens of administration and treatment monitoring procedures should not be different from those currently used for urinary FSH-containing medicinal products. It is advised to adhere to the recommended starting doses indicated below. Comparative clinical studies have shown that on average patients require a lower cumulative dose and shorter treatment duration with follitropin alfa compared with urinary FSH. Therefore, it is considered appropriate to give a lower total dose of follitropin alfa than generally used for urinary FSH, not only in order to optimise follicular development but also to minimise the risk of unwanted ovarian hyperstimulation (see section 5.1). Women with anovulation (including polycystic ovarian syndrome) Bemfola may be given as a course of daily injections. In menstruating women treatment should commence within the first 7 days of the menstrual cycle. A commonly used regimen commences at 75-150 IU FSH daily and is increased preferably by 37.5 or 75 IU at 7 or preferably 14 day intervals if necessary, to obtain an adequate, but not excessive, response. Treatment should be tailored to the individual patient’s response as assessed by measuring follicle size by ultrasound and/or oestrogen secretion. The maximal daily dose is usually not higher than 225 IU FSH. If a patient fails to respond adequately after 4 weeks of treatment, that cycle should be abandoned and the patient should undergo further evaluation after which she may recommence treatment at a higher starting dose than in the abandoned cycle. When an optimal response is obtained, a single injection of 250 micrograms r-hCG) or 5,000 IU up to 10,000 IU hCG should be administered 24‑48 hours after the last follitropin alfa injection. The patient is recommended to have coitus on the day of, and the day following, hCG administration. Alternatively intrauterine insemination (IUI) may be performed. If an excessive response is obtained, treatment should be stopped and hCG withheld (see section 4.4). Treatment should recommence in the next cycle at a dose lower than that of the previous cycle. Women undergoing ovarian stimulation for multiple follicular development prior to in vitro fertilisation or other assisted reproductive technologies A commonly used regimen for superovulation involves the administration of 150-225 IU of follitropin alfa daily commencing on days 2 or 3 of the cycle. Treatment is continued until adequate follicular development has been achieved (as assessed by monitoring of serum strogen concentrations and/or ultrasound examination), with the dose adjusted according to the patient's response, to usually not higher than 450 IU daily. In general adequate follicular development is achieved on average by the tenth day of treatment (range 5 to 20 days). A single injection of 250 micrograms r-hCG or 5,000 IU up to 10,000 IU hCG is administered 24‑48 hours after the last follitropin alfa injection to induce final follicular maturation. Down-regulation with a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist or antagonist is now commonly used in order to suppress the endogenous LH surge and to control tonic levels of LH. In a commonly used protocol, follitropin alfa is started approximately 2 weeks after the start of agonist treatment, both being continued until adequate follicular development is achieved. For example, following two weeks of treatment with an agonist, 150-225 IU follitropin alfa are administered for the first 7 days. The dose is then adjusted according to the ovarian response. Overall experience with IVF indicates that in general the treatment success rate remains stable during the first four attempts and gradually declines thereafter. Women with anovulation resulting from severe LH and FSH deficiency In LH and FSH deficient women (hypogonadotropic hypogonadism), the objective of Bemfola therapy in association with lutropin alfa is to develop a single mature Graafian follicle from which the oocyte will be liberated after the administration of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). Follitropin alfa should be given as a course of daily injections simultaneously with lutropin alfa. Since these patients are amenorrhoeic and have low endogenous strogen secretion, treatment can commence at any time. A recommended regimen commences at 75 IU of lutropin alfa daily with 75-150 IU FSH. Treatment should be tailored to the individual patient's response as assessed by measuring follicle size by ultrasound and oestrogen response. If an FSH dose increase is deemed appropriate, dose adaptation should preferably be after 7-14 day intervals and preferably by 37.5-75 IU increments. It may be acceptable to extend the duration of stimulation in any one cycle to up to 5 weeks. When an optimal response is obtained, a single injection of 250 micrograms r-hCG or 5,000 IU up to 10,000 IU hCG should be administered 24-48 hours after the last follitropin alfa and lutropin alfa injections. The patient is recommended to have coitus on the day of, and on the day following, hCG administration. Luteal phase support may be considered since lack of substances with luteotrophic activity (LH/hCG) after ovulation may lead to premature failure of the corpus luteum. If an excessive response is obtained, treatment should be stopped and hCG withheld. Treatment should recommence in the next cycle at a dose of FSH lower than that of the previous cycle. Bemfola should be given at a dose of 150 IU three times a week, concomitantly with hCG, for a minimum of 4 months. If after this period, the patient has not responded, the combination treatment may be continued; current clinical experience indicates that treatment for at least 18 months may be necessary to achieve spermatogenesis.

There may be a degree of interpatient variability in response to FSH administration, with a poor response to FSH in some patients . The lowest effective dose in relation to the treatment objective should be used in both men and women.

A certain degree of ovarian enlargement is an expected effect of controlled ovarian stimulation. It is more commonly seen in women with polycystic ovarian syndrome and usually regresses without treatment. In distinction to uncomplicated ovarian enlargement, OHSS is a condition that can manifest itself with increasing degrees of severity. It comprises marked ovarian enlargement, high serum sex steroids, and an increase in vascular permeability which can result in an accumulation of fluid in the peritoneal, pleural and, rarely, in the pericardial cavities. The following symptomatology may be observed in severe cases of OHSS: abdominal pain, abdominal distension, severe ovarian enlargement, weight gain, dyspnoea, oliguria and gastrointestinal symptoms including nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea. Clinical evaluation may reveal hypovolaemia, haemoconcentration, electrolyte imbalances, ascites, haemoperitoneum, pleural effusions, hydrothorax, or acute pulmonary distress. Very rarely, severe OHSS may be complicated by ovarian torsion or thromboembolic events such as pulmonary embolism, ischaemic stroke or myocardial infarction. Independent risk factors for developing OHSS include polycystic ovarian syndrome high absolute or rapidly rising serum oestradiol levels (e.g. > 900 pg/ in ART) and large number of developing ovarian follicles (e.g. > 3 follicles of ≥ 14 mm in diameter in anovulation; ≥ 20 follicles of ≥ 12 mm in diameter in ART). regimen of administration can minimise the risk of ovarian hyperstimulation (see sections 4.2 and 4.8). Monitoring of stimulation cycles by ultrasound scans as well as stradiol measurements are recommended to early identify risk factors. There is evidence to suggest that hCG plays a key role in triggering OHSS and that the syndrome may be more severe and more protracted if pregnancy occurs. Therefore, if signs of ovarian hyperstimulation occur such as and/or ≥ 40 follicles in total, it is recommended that hCG be withheld and the patient be advised to refrain from coitus or to use barrier contraceptive methods for at least 4 days. OHSS may progress rapidly (within 24 hours) or over several days to become a serious medical event. It most often occurs after hormonal treatment has been discontinued and reaches its maximum at about seven to ten days following treatment. Therefore patients should be followed for at least two weeks after hCG administration. In ART, aspiration of all follicles prior to ovulation may reduce the occurrence of hyperstimulation. Mild or moderate OHSS usually resolves spontaneously. If severe OHSS occurs, it is recommended that gonadotropin treatment be stopped if still ongoing, and that the patient be hospitalised and appropriate therapy be started. In patients undergoing ovulation induction, the incidence of multiple pregnancy is increased compared with natural conception. The majority of multiple an increased risk of adverse maternal and perinatal outcomes. multiple pregnancy, careful monitoring of ovarian response is recommended. In patients undergoing ART procedures the risk of multiple pregnancy is related mainly to the number of embryos placed, their quality and the patient age. The patients should be advised of the potential risk of multiple before starting treatment. The incidence of pregnancy loss by miscarriage or abortion is higher in patients undergoing stimulation of follicular growth for ovulation induction or ART than following natural conception. Women with a history of tubal disease are at risk of ectopic pregnancy, whether the pregnancy is obtained by spontaneous conception or with fertility treatments. The prevalence of ectopic pregnancy after ART was reported to be higher than in the general population. There have been reports of ovarian and other reproductive system neoplasms, both benign and malignant, in women who have undergone multiple treatment regimens for infertility treatment. It is not yet established whether or not treatment with gonadotropins increases the risk of these tumours in infertile women. The prevalence of congenital malformations after ART may be slightly higher than after spontaneous conceptions. This is thought to be due to differences in parental characteristics (e.g. maternal age, sperm characteristics) and multiple pregnancies. In women with recent or ongoing thromboembolic disease or women with generally recognised risk factors for thromboembolic events, such as personal or family history, treatment with gonadotropins may further increase the risk for aggravation or occurrence of such events. In these women, the benefits of gonadotropin administration need to be weighed against the risks. It should be noted however that pregnancy itself as well as OHSS also carry an increased risk of thromboembolic events. Elevated endogenous FSH levels are indicative of primary testicular failure. Such patients are unresponsive to follitropin alfa/hCG therapy. Follitropin alfa should not be used when an effective response cannot be obtained. Semen analysis is recommended 4 to 6 months after the beginning of treatment as part of the assessment of the response. Bemfola contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i.e. essentially “sodium-free”. 4.5Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction Concomitant use of follitropin alfa with other medicinal products used to stimulate ovulation (e.g. hCG, clomiphene citrate) may potentiate the follicular response, whereas concurrent use of a GnRH agonist or antagonist to induce pituitary desensitisation may increase the dose of follitropin alfa needed to elicit an adequate ovarian response. No other clinically significant drug interaction has been reported during follitropin alfa therapy . Sex hormones and modulators of the genital systems, gonadotropins Bemfola is a biosimilar medicinal product, that has been demonstrated to be similar in quality, safety and efficacy to the reference medicinal product GONAL-f. More detailed information is available on the website of the European Medicines Agency In women, the most important effect resulting from parenteral administration of FSH is the development of mature Graafian follicles. In women with anovulation, the objective of therapy with follitropin alfa is to develop a single mature Graafian follicle from which the ovum will be liberated after the administration of hCG In clinical trials, patients with severe FSH and LH deficiency were defined by an endogenous serum LH level < 1.2 IU/ as measured in a central laboratory. However, it should be taken into account that there are variations between LH measurements performed in different laboratories. In clinical studies comparing r-hFSH (follitropin alfa) and urinary FSH in ART (see table 1 below) and in ovulation induction, follitropin alfa was more potent than urinary FSH in terms of a lower total dose and a shorter treatment period needed to trigger follicular maturation. In ART, follitropin alfa at a lower total dose and shorter treatment period than urinary FSH, resulted in a higher number of oocytes retrieved when compared to urinary FSH. Table 1: Results of study GF 8407 (randomised parallel group study comparing efficacy and safety of follitropin alfa with urinary FSH in assisted reproduction technologies) Total dose of FSH required (number of FSH 75 IU ampoules) Differences between the 2 groups were statistically significant (p< 0.05) for all criteria listed. In men deficient in FSH, follitropin alfa administered concomitantly with hCG for at least 4 months induces spermatogenesis. Following intravenous administration, follitropin alfa is distributed to the extracellular fluid space with an initial half-life of around 2 hours and eliminated from the body with a terminal half-life of about one day. The steady state volume of distribution and total clearance are 10  and 0.6 /h, respectively. One-eighth of the follitropin alfa dose is excreted in the urine. Following subcutaneous administration, the absolute bioavailability is about 70%. Following repeated administration, follitropin alfa accumulates 3-fold achieving a steadystate within 3-4 days. In women whose endogenous gonadotropin secretion is suppressed, follitropin alfa has nevertheless been shown to effectively stimulate follicular development and steroidogenesis, despite unmeasurable LH levels. Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of single and repeated dose toxicity and genotoxicity additional to that already stated in other sections of this SmPC. Impaired fertility has been reported in rats exposed to pharmacological doses of follitropin alfa (≥ 40 IU/kg/day) for extended periods, through reduced fecundity.  5 IU/kg/day) follitropin alfa caused a decrease in the number of viable foetuses without being teratogen, and dystocia similar to that observed with urinary enopausal onadotropin (hMG).

Adherence to the recommended follitropin alfa dosage and regimen of administration, and careful monitoring of therapy will minimise the incidence of such events. For accurate interpretation of the indices of follicle development and maturation, the physician should be experienced in the interpretation of the relevant tests. In clinical trials, an increase of the ovarian sensitivity to follitropin alfa was shown when administered with lutropin alfa. If an FSH dose increase is deemed appropriate, dose adaptation should preferably be at 7-14 day intervals and preferably with 37.5-75 IU increments. No direct comparison of follitropin alfa/LH versus human menopausal gonadotropin (hMG) has been performed. Comparison with historical data suggests that the ovulation rate obtained with follitropin alfa/LH is similar to that obtained with hMG. The most commonly reported adverse reactions are headache, ovarian cysts and local injection site reactions (e.g. pain, erythema, haematoma, swelling and/or irritation at the site of injection). Mild or moderate ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) has been commonly reported and should be considered as an intrinsic risk of the stimulation procedure. Severe OHSS is uncommon (see section 4.4).

Each pre-filled pen delivers 150 IU (equivalent to 11 micrograms) in 0.25  * recombinant human follicle stimulating hormone (r-hFSH) produced in Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells by recombinant DNA technology Anovulation (including polycystic ovarian disease, PCOD) in women who have been unresponsive to treatment with clomiphene citrate. Stimulation of multifollicular development in patients undergoing superovulation for assisted reproductive technologies (ART) such as fertilisation (IVF), gamete intra-fallopian transfer (GIFT) and zygote intra-fallopian transfer (ZIFT). Follitropin alfa in association with a luteinising hormone (LH) preparation is recommended for the stimulation of follicular development in women with severe LH and FSH deficiency. In clinical trials these patients were defined by an endogenous serum LH level < 1.2 IU/. Follitropin alfa is indicated for the stimulation of spermatogenesis in men who have congenital or acquired hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism with concomitant human Chorionic Gonadotrophin (hCG) therapy. Treatment with Bemfola should be initiated under the supervision of a physician experienced in the treatment of fertility disorders. Patients must be provided with the correct number of pens for their treatment course and educated to use the proper injection techniques. The dose recommendations given for follitropin alfa are those in use for urinary FSH. Clinical assessment of follitropin alfa indicates that its daily doses, regimens of administration and treatment monitoring procedures should not be different from those currently used for urinary FSH-containing medicinal products. It is advised to adhere to the recommended starting doses indicated below. Comparative clinical studies have shown that on average patients require a lower cumulative dose and shorter treatment duration with follitropin alfa compared with urinary FSH. Therefore, it is considered appropriate to give a lower total dose of follitropin alfa than generally used for urinary FSH, not only in order to optimise follicular development but also to minimise the risk of unwanted ovarian hyperstimulation (see section 5.1). Women with anovulation (including polycystic ovarian syndrome) Bemfola may be given as a course of daily injections. In menstruating women treatment should commence within the first 7 days of the menstrual cycle. A commonly used regimen commences at 75-150 IU FSH daily and is increased preferably by 37.5 or 75 IU at 7 or preferably 14 day intervals if necessary, to obtain an adequate, but not excessive, response. Treatment should be tailored to the individual patient’s response as assessed by measuring follicle size by ultrasound and/or oestrogen secretion. The maximal daily dose is usually not higher than 225 IU FSH. If a patient fails to respond adequately after 4 weeks of treatment, that cycle should be abandoned and the patient should undergo further evaluation after which she may recommence treatment at a higher starting dose than in the abandoned cycle. When an optimal response is obtained, a single injection of 250 micrograms r-hCG) or 5,000 IU up to 10,000 IU hCG should be administered 24‑48 hours after the last follitropin alfa injection. The patient is recommended to have coitus on the day of, and the day following, hCG administration. Alternatively intrauterine insemination (IUI) may be performed. If an excessive response is obtained, treatment should be stopped and hCG withheld (see section 4.4). Treatment should recommence in the next cycle at a dose lower than that of the previous cycle. Women undergoing ovarian stimulation for multiple follicular development prior to in vitro fertilisation or other assisted reproductive technologies A commonly used regimen for superovulation involves the administration of 150-225 IU of follitropin alfa daily commencing on days 2 or 3 of the cycle. Treatment is continued until adequate follicular development has been achieved (as assessed by monitoring of serum strogen concentrations and/or ultrasound examination), with the dose adjusted according to the patient's response, to usually not higher than 450 IU daily. In general adequate follicular development is achieved on average by the tenth day of treatment (range 5 to 20 days). A single injection of 250 micrograms r-hCG or 5,000 IU up to 10,000 IU hCG is administered 24‑48 hours after the last follitropin alfa injection to induce final follicular maturation. Down-regulation with a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist or antagonist is now commonly used in order to suppress the endogenous LH surge and to control tonic levels of LH. In a commonly used protocol, follitropin alfa is started approximately 2 weeks after the start of agonist treatment, both being continued until adequate follicular development is achieved. For example, following two weeks of treatment with an agonist, 150-225 IU follitropin alfa are administered for the first 7 days. The dose is then adjusted according to the ovarian response. Overall experience with IVF indicates that in general the treatment success rate remains stable during the first four attempts and gradually declines thereafter. Women with anovulation resulting from severe LH and FSH deficiency In LH and FSH deficient women (hypogonadotropic hypogonadism), the objective of Bemfola therapy in association with lutropin alfa is to develop a single mature Graafian follicle from which the oocyte will be liberated after the administration of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). Follitropin alfa should be given as a course of daily injections simultaneously with lutropin alfa. Since these patients are amenorrhoeic and have low endogenous strogen secretion, treatment can commence at any time. A recommended regimen commences at 75 IU of lutropin alfa daily with 75-150 IU FSH. Treatment should be tailored to the individual patient's response as assessed by measuring follicle size by ultrasound and oestrogen response. If an FSH dose increase is deemed appropriate, dose adaptation should preferably be after 7-14 day intervals and preferably by 37.5-75 IU increments. It may be acceptable to extend the duration of stimulation in any one cycle to up to 5 weeks. When an optimal response is obtained, a single injection of 250 micrograms r-hCG or 5,000 IU up to 10,000 IU hCG should be administered 24-48 hours after the last follitropin alfa and lutropin alfa injections. The patient is recommended to have coitus on the day of, and on the day following, hCG administration. Luteal phase support may be considered since lack of substances with luteotrophic activity (LH/hCG) after ovulation may lead to premature failure of the corpus luteum. If an excessive response is obtained, treatment should be stopped and hCG withheld. Treatment should recommence in the next cycle at a dose of FSH lower than that of the previous cycle. Bemfola should be given at a dose of 150 IU three times a week, concomitantly with hCG, for a minimum of 4 months. If after this period, the patient has not responded, the combination treatment may be continued; current clinical experience indicates that treatment for at least 18 months may be necessary to achieve spermatogenesis. There is no relevant use of follitropin alfa in the elderly population. Safety and effectiveness of follitropin alfa in elderly patients have not been established. Safety, efficacy and pharmacokinetics of follitropin alfa in patients with renal or hepatic impairment have not been established. There is no relevant use of follitropin alfa in the paediatric population. Bemfola is intended for subcutaneous administration. The first injection of Bemfola should be performed under direct medical supervision. Self-administration of Bemfola should only be performed by patients who are well motivated, adequately trained and have access to expert advice. single-dose cartridge is intended for only one injection, clear instructions should be provided to the patients to avoid misuse of the single dose presentation.

Gonadotropin therapy requires a certain time commitment by physicians and supportive health professionals, as well as the availability of appropriate monitoring facilities. In women, safe and effective use of follitropin alfa calls for monitoring of ovarian response with ultrasound, alone or preferably in combination with measurement of serum stradiol levels, on a regular basis. There may be a degree of interpatient variability in response to FSH administration, with a poor response to FSH in some patients . The lowest effective dose in relation to the treatment objective should be used in both men and women. Patients with porphyria or a family history of porphyria should be closely monitored during treatment with follitropin alfa. Deterioration or a first appearance of this condition may require cessation of treatment. Before starting treatment, the couple's infertility should be assessed as appropriate and putative contraindications for pregnancy evaluated. In particular, patients should be evaluated for hypothyroidism, adrenocortical deficiency, hyperprolactinemia and appropriate specific treatment given. Patients undergoing stimulation of follicular growth, whether as treatment for anovulatory infertility or ART procedures, may experience ovarian enlargement or develop hyperstimulation. Adherence to the recommended follitropin alfa dosage and regimen of administration, and careful monitoring of therapy will minimise the incidence of such events. For accurate interpretation of the indices of follicle development and maturation, the physician should be experienced in the interpretation of the relevant tests. In clinical trials, an increase of the ovarian sensitivity to follitropin alfa was shown when administered with lutropin alfa. If an FSH dose increase is deemed appropriate, dose adaptation should preferably be at 7-14 day intervals and preferably with 37.5-75 IU increments. No direct comparison of follitropin alfa/LH versus human menopausal gonadotropin (hMG) has been performed. Comparison with historical data suggests that the ovulation rate obtained with follitropin alfa/LH is similar to that obtained with hMG. A certain degree of ovarian enlargement is an expected effect of controlled ovarian stimulation. It is more commonly seen in women with polycystic ovarian syndrome and usually regresses without treatment. In distinction to uncomplicated ovarian enlargement, OHSS is a condition that can manifest itself with increasing degrees of severity. It comprises marked ovarian enlargement, high serum sex steroids, and an increase in vascular permeability which can result in an accumulation of fluid in the peritoneal, pleural and, rarely, in the pericardial cavities. The following symptomatology may be observed in severe cases of OHSS: abdominal pain, abdominal distension, severe ovarian enlargement, weight gain, dyspnoea, oliguria and gastrointestinal symptoms including nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea. Clinical evaluation may reveal hypovolaemia, haemoconcentration, electrolyte imbalances, ascites, haemoperitoneum, pleural effusions, hydrothorax, or acute pulmonary distress. Very rarely, severe OHSS may be complicated by ovarian torsion or thromboembolic events such as pulmonary embolism, ischaemic stroke or myocardial infarction. Independent risk factors for developing OHSS include polycystic ovarian syndrome high absolute or rapidly rising serum oestradiol levels (e.g. > 900 pg/ in ART) and large number of developing ovarian follicles (e.g. > 3 follicles of ≥ 14 mm in diameter in anovulation; ≥ 20 follicles of ≥ 12 mm in diameter in ART). regimen of administration can minimise the risk of ovarian hyperstimulation (see sections 4.2 and 4.8). Monitoring of stimulation cycles by ultrasound scans as well as stradiol measurements are recommended to early identify risk factors. There is evidence to suggest that hCG plays a key role in triggering OHSS and that the syndrome may be more severe and more protracted if pregnancy occurs. Therefore, if signs of ovarian hyperstimulation occur such as and/or ≥ 40 follicles in total, it is recommended that hCG be withheld and the patient be advised to refrain from coitus or to use barrier contraceptive methods for at least 4 days. OHSS may progress rapidly (within 24 hours) or over several days to become a serious medical event. It most often occurs after hormonal treatment has been discontinued and reaches its maximum at about seven to ten days following treatment. Therefore patients should be followed for at least two weeks after hCG administration. In ART, aspiration of all follicles prior to ovulation may reduce the occurrence of hyperstimulation. Mild or moderate OHSS usually resolves spontaneously. If severe OHSS occurs, it is recommended that gonadotropin treatment be stopped if still ongoing, and that the patient be hospitalised and appropriate therapy be started. In patients undergoing ovulation induction, the incidence of multiple pregnancy is increased compared with natural conception. The majority of multiple an increased risk of adverse maternal and perinatal outcomes. multiple pregnancy, careful monitoring of ovarian response is recommended. In patients undergoing ART procedures the risk of multiple pregnancy is related mainly to the number of embryos placed, their quality and the patient age. The patients should be advised of the potential risk of multiple before starting treatment. The incidence of pregnancy loss by miscarriage or abortion is higher in patients undergoing stimulation of follicular growth for ovulation induction or ART than following natural conception. Women with a history of tubal disease are at risk of ectopic pregnancy, whether the pregnancy is obtained by spontaneous conception or with fertility treatments. The prevalence of ectopic pregnancy after ART was reported to be higher than in the general population. There have been reports of ovarian and other reproductive system neoplasms, both benign and malignant, in women who have undergone multiple treatment regimens for infertility treatment. It is not yet established whether or not treatment with gonadotropins increases the risk of these tumours in infertile women. The prevalence of congenital malformations after ART may be slightly higher than after spontaneous conceptions. This is thought to be due to differences in parental characteristics (e.g. maternal age, sperm characteristics) and multiple pregnancies. In women with recent or ongoing thromboembolic disease or women with generally recognised risk factors for thromboembolic events, such as personal or family history, treatment with gonadotropins may further increase the risk for aggravation or occurrence of such events. In these women, the benefits of gonadotropin administration need to be weighed against the risks. It should be noted however that pregnancy itself as well as OHSS also carry an increased risk of thromboembolic events. Elevated endogenous FSH levels are indicative of primary testicular failure. Such patients are unresponsive to follitropin alfa/hCG therapy. Follitropin alfa should not be used when an effective response cannot be obtained. Semen analysis is recommended 4 to 6 months after the beginning of treatment as part of the assessment of the response. Bemfola contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i.e. essentially “sodium-free”. 4.5Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction Concomitant use of follitropin alfa with other medicinal products used to stimulate ovulation (e.g. hCG, clomiphene citrate) may potentiate the follicular response, whereas concurrent use of a GnRH agonist or antagonist to induce pituitary desensitisation may increase the dose of follitropin alfa needed to elicit an adequate ovarian response. No other clinically significant drug interaction has been reported during follitropin alfa therapy .

However, it should be taken into account that there are variations between LH measurements performed in different laboratories. In clinical studies comparing r-hFSH (follitropin alfa) and urinary FSH in ART (see table 1 below) and in ovulation induction, follitropin alfa was more potent than urinary FSH in terms of a lower total dose and a shorter treatment period needed to trigger follicular maturation. In ART, follitropin alfa at a lower total dose and shorter treatment period than urinary FSH, resulted in a higher number of oocytes retrieved when compared to urinary FSH. Table 1: Results of study GF 8407 (randomised parallel group study comparing efficacy and safety of follitropin alfa with urinary FSH in assisted reproduction technologies) Total dose of FSH required (number of FSH 75 IU ampoules) Differences between the 2 groups were statistically significant (p< 0.05) for all criteria listed.

Mauritian cynomolgus macaques (MCMs), with high degree of MHC allele sharing, are valuable models for HIV-1 research and stem cell therapies. To facilitate the generation of a CCR5-mutant MHC-defined MCM model, we explored editing the gene in MCM embryos via CRISPR-Cas9. We refined ovarian stimulation and in vitro fertilization (IVF) methods established for Chinese cynomolgus macaques to generate in vitro MCM embryos. Time-lapse embryo imaging was performed to assess the timing of MCM embryonic developmental events in control and CRISPR-Cas9 microinjected embryos. Using a dual-guide gene targeting approach, biallelic deletions in the gene were introduced into ~ 23–37% of MCM embryos. In addition, single blastomere PCR analysis revealed mosaicism in CCR5 editing within the same embryo. Successful development of IVF and editing protocols in MCM embryos lays a foundation for the creation of -mutant MCMs to assess novel stem cell-based HIV therapeutics. Resistance to human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) infection in humans has been associated with a homozygous 32 base-pair deletion in the chemokine (C–C) motif receptor 5 () gene. CCR5 is a co-receptor for macrophage- and dual-tropic HIV-1 isolates. Upon binding of the HIV-1 viral envelope protein to the CD4 receptor on the cell surface, the activation of the CCR5 co-receptor facilitates viral fusion to the cell plasma membrane allowing for entry of viral contents into the cell. The homozygous 32 base-pair deletion leads to a truncation of the CCR5 protein and ultimately the loss of expression on the cell’s surface. This deletion is reported to occur in < 1% of the population and in those individuals, HIV-1 resistance has been observed despite multiple instances of viral exposure. Hence, has become an attractive candidate for assessing mechanisms of HIV-1 infection and also for developing drug treatments and gene-based therapies. The cure of HIV by transplanting -mutant (-delta32) hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) demonstrated the feasibility and power of stem cell-based therapies for eliminating latent virus and controlling AIDS. However, to broaden and refine the application of this therapeutic approach in HIV-infected patients, it will be critical to define the spectrum of anti-viral protection, the engraftment threshold of CCR5-mutant HSCs required for protection, and the potential for depletion of the virus reservoir through “allo-effect” following allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) transplantation using a physiologically relevant animal model. Nonhuman primates, and more specifically macaques, serve as important model species to study HIV-1 through infection with simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV). SIV infected animals show similar elements of human HIV-1 infection including immune responses and pathogenesis, and additionally, tissues are more accessible for study compared to human studies. Mauritian cynomolgus macaques (MCMs) offer a distinct advantage over other macaque species as they have only seven major histocompatibility complex (MHC) haplotypes allowing for the study of defined immune responses and to control genetic factors in the setting of allogeneic bone marrow transplant. This provides a powerful means for quantifying the effect of MHC matching on the capacity of allogeneic cells to purge the SIV reservoir. Genome editing by way of CRISPR-Cas9 technology has proven successful for introducing gene disruptions in nonhuman primates (NHP) for the study of mutated gene function and the development of models of human diseases. Microinjection of CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing constructs into one-cell macaque embryos can be performed to introduce genetic mutations in target genes associated with human disease, where the edited offspring can be evaluated for phenotypic changes associated with mutated gene function and/or used as a source of mutated cells for transplantation studies. We have previously demonstrated targeting of in human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), where macrophages derived from -edited iPSCs were resistant to viral challenge. In the current study, to create a platform for generating -edited MHC defined NHP model, we established in vitro fertilization (IVF) procedures in MCMs, including ovarian stimulation and embryo culture protocols, along with procedures for the efficient editing of the  locus in MCM embryos. The methods for producing IVF embryos from Chinese cynomolgus macaques (CCMs) are well established, whereas there are no publications to date that specifically describe in vitro generation of MCM embryos. Applying an ovarian stimulation protocol for CCMs to MCM oocyte donors resulted in recovery of relatively few to no mature oocytes upon laparoscopic follicular aspiration. Twice daily treatment with recombinant human follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) for 7–9 days and performing the oocyte retrieval at 36–41 h post-recombinant human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) treatment resulted in a mean recovery of 13.4 (± 8.2 SD) oocytes of which 4.2 (± 6.1 SD) were mature, metaphase II (MII) oocytes (n=5 ovarian stimulations). Extending the FSH treatment from 8–10 to 11–12 days and performing the oocyte retrieval between 38–40 h post-hCG treatment resulted in the collection of a greater proportion of mature MCM oocytes (Fig. A). Using the ovarian stimulation protocol tailored to MCMs, a mean of 24.3 (± 20.7 SD) MCM oocytes were recovered from the follicular aspirate with approximately 56% of the total oocytes being mature MII oocytes (Fig. B). MCM oocyte donors could undergo up to four stimulations, however, there were no significant differences in the total oocytes or number of mature MII oocytes recovered between the first to fourth ovarian  stimulation events (Supplemental Table ). CRISPR-Cas9 delivery and in vitro development of MCM embryos After ~ 4–5 h of in vitro maturation (IVM), mature oocytes were obtained from both CCMs and MCMs that were fertilized by intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI). At ~ 5–7 h post-ICSI, embryos were either microinjected with Cas9 protein alone (no sgRNA), microinjected with a ribonucleoprotein (RNP) mixture comprised of Cas9 protein and dual-guide RNAs designed to target the gene, or cultured as control (Fig. A). Representative images of mature MII oocytes that underwent fertilization by ICSI are shown in Fig. B,C. A total of 240 MCM oocytes were fertilized by ICSI, where 72.7% of control, 49.2% of Cas9 alone microinjected and 45.8% of RNP microinjected oocytes cleaved (Table ). In comparison, a total of 162 CCM oocytes were fertilized by ICSI of which 78.4% of control, 52.5% of Cas9 alone microinjected and 37.6% of RNP microinjected cleaved (Table ). Cleavage rates were significantly reduced in MCM and CCM RNP injected oocytes compared to control oocytes with a trend towards a significant reduction (p = 0.053) in Cas9 alone MCM oocytes compared to control MCM oocytes (Table ). A subset of early cleavage stage embryos were transferred to recipient females, hence the blastocyst rate was only calculated in experiments where embryos were not removed for transfer and were instead monitored in terms of their development in vitro. Representative images of cleavage stage embryos for each experimental group are shown in Fig. C. Embryos were collected for molecular analysis of CRISPR-Cas9 editing when developmental arrest was observed or upon blastocyst hatching. The blastocyst rate for control MCM and CCM embryo development was 19.8% and 0%, respectively (Table ). Of note, the CCMs underwent the same extended ovarian stimulation regimen that was optimized for MCMs and the CCM oocytes were fertilized with MCM sperm. The reduced development rates in CCMs may be attributed to the extended ovarian stimulation regimen tailored to MCMs that could negatively impact oocyte age and quality. The ovarian stimulation protocols described for CCMs by others were not used in this study to have consistent treatment of CCMs and MCMs. While the blastocyst formation rate tended to be lower in either Cas9 alone or RNP microinjected MCM embryos compared to control MCM embryos, there were no statistically significant differences. Time-lapse embryo imaging was performed to assess the timing of developmental events in control and microinjected embryos. Control, unmanipulated embryos reached the 2-cell, 4-cell, 8-cell, morula and blastocyst stages at the following hours post-insemination, respectively: 33.6 h ± 12.1 SD, 47.7 h ± 29.7 SD, 58.0 h ± 20.5 SD, 106.0 h ± 26.9 SD, and 216.5 h ± 47.4 SD (Table ). Representative morphology at each developmental stage is shown in Fig. . The development of Cas9 alone and RNP-microinjected embryos tended to be delayed in comparison to control embryos. The difference in timing between control and RNP injected embryos approached significance for the timing of cleavage to 2-cells and development to 8-cells (p = 0.070 and p = 0.054, respectively), but were not statistically significantly different. Genome editing analysis of CCR5 in whole embryos and individual blastomeres To disrupt the gene, we used two gRNAs to target sequences within exon 2, including a 24 base-pair (bp) deletion region that was found to prevent functional expression in NHPs (Fig. A). Genome editing at the locus was evaluated by PCR and gel electrophoresis to determine if editing occurred with an expected excision of a 198 bp region between the two target sites. A schematic of the target sites and expected product sizes is shown Fig. A. A 613 bp PCR amplification product is expected for wild-type alleles, whereas a 415 bp product indicates editing of the 198 bp deletion. The presence of both 613 bp and 415 bp products suggests incomplete editing in the embryo and the creation of a heterozygote, and the presence of only the 415 bp product indicates biallelic (homozygous) editing. Both whole embryos and individual blastomeres were analyzed by PCR and gel electrophoresis with representative gel images displayed in Fig. B,C, respectively (original gel images are displayed in Supplementary Fig. ). A total of 73 whole embryos from nine oocyte donors were analyzed. A PCR amplification signal was detectable in 60 embryos, of which 53.3% contained the predicted 198 bp deletion in (Table ). Importantly, biallelic deletions were observed in 36.7% of embryos (Table ). Embryonic genome editing was also assessed in single blastomeres by PCR of 129 blastomeres from 18 developmentally arrested embryos (Table ). Of note, all blastomeres were dissociated from arrested cleavage-stage embryos and analyzed for the PCR amplification product to assess genome editing events and the degree of mosaicism within an individual embryo. No PCR signal was detected in 43 blastomeres or any cells from one embryo. Analysis of individual blastomeres revealed diversity in genotypes at the locus within an individual embryo, where either biallelic deletions, a combination of wild-type or deleted alleles or all wild-type alleles were present (Table ). Approximately 82% of the embryos assessed at the individual blastomere level contained deletions and 23.5% contained a biallelic deletion (Table ). Of note, mosaicism was observed in 52.9% of the -edited embryos. The differences in editing efficiency (~53% of whole embryos and ~82% of embryos with individual blastomere analysis) may be attributed to fewer embryos being analyzed at the individual cell level (blastomeres from 18 embryos versus 73 whole embryos). Regardless of analysis method, biallelic embryonic genome editing was observed in ~ 23–37% of embryos. Selection of embryo recipients and embryo transfer Circulating levels of progesterone, estradiol and in some cycles, luteinizing hormone (LH) were evaluated in potential embryo recipients from day 9–10 to 16 following the onset of menses. Ovarian cycles were analyzed for the decline in estradiol with a corresponding increase in progesterone indicative of ovulation. A total of 36 ovarian cycles were evaluated, where ovulation was observed in 14 cycles by a rise in progesterone and decline in estrogen (Supplementary Fig. A). The mean day of ovulation was 12.6 days post-onset of menses in 14 cycles analyzed. In five cycles where LH was assayed, the mean day of the LH peak was 12.6 days post-onset of menses (Supplementary Fig. B). In 22 cycles (~ 61% of cycles analyzed), ovulation was not observed, but rather the animal was either anovulatory (low progesterone, low estrogen; Supplementary Fig. C), in a persistent luteal phase with high progesterone (Supplementary Fig. D), or additional blood sampling outside the window of collection would have been needed for confirming the day of ovulation. Altogether, the evaluation of circulating hormone levels allows for identifying potential embryo recipients who have ovulated, although a large proportion of potential MCM embryo recipients were anovulatory or well into the luteal phase of their cycle. Embryos were transferred to embryo recipients with confirmed and unconfirmed timing of ovulation. A total of 26 surgical oviductal and 13 non-surgical trans-cervical cannulations were attempted, in which embryos were successfully transferred to the oviduct or uterus in 20 and 12 cannulations, respectively (Supplementary Table ). Pronuclear or 2-cell embryos were transferred to the oviduct and 4- to 16-cell embryos were transferred to the uterus. In three of each surgical and non-surgical cannulations, a confirmed ovulating female served as the embryo recipient. This is the first study in which cynomolgus macaque embryos were transferred at this research center, although rhesus macaque embryos have previously been successfully transferred using similar methodology. Despite the transfer of 222 embryos (50 embryos to confirmed ovulating females), no pregnancies were obtained. Human patients containing a homozygous 32 bp deletion in the gene have been shown to be resistant to HIV infection, thus targeting of has received great attention for developing drug and gene therapies for HIV. NHP, such as MCMs, share similar immune responses and genetics with humans making them suitable models for HIV infection. Mutating the locus in MCMs is particularly advantageous given the restricted MHC haplotypes of this sub-species. Prior to this report, however, there were no studies specifically describing IVF or manipulation of MCM embryos, and others have observed poor development in in vitro fertilized embryos from MCMs (Carol Hanna and Jon Hennebold, Oregon National Primate Research Center, pers. comm.). In this study, we report for the first time in vitro development and CRISPR-Cas9 targeting of MCM embryos. By refining ovarian stimulation and in vitro culture conditions established for Chinese cynomolgus macaques, a cohort of mature MCM oocytes could be obtained and fertilized in vitro. Introduction of dual-guide sgRNAs targeting resulted in > 50% of the embryos containing mutations in with a third of these embryos containing biallelic mutations. While reduced embryonic development rates were observed in CRISPR-Cas9 microinjected embryos, the establishment of in vitro production methods and the observed high targeting rate offers promise for utilizing CRISPR-Cas9 technology to assess mutated gene function in MCMs. In vitro embryo production methods have been established for cynomolgus macaques, however, previous reports do not specify the origin of the cynomolgus macaques when using assisted reproductive technologies. For this study, we applied methods of ovarian stimulation and IVF established for domestic (i.e., Chinese origin CMs obtained from domestic breeding programs) to MCMs. An ovarian stimulation protocol similar to that used for rhesus or domestic cynomolgus macaques of twice daily FSH treatment for 8–10 days followed by laparoscopic retrieval between 26–32 h post-hCG treatment resulted in low recovery yields of mature oocytes. A larger proportion of mature oocytes were recovered upon extending the FSH treatment to 11–11.5 days and retrieving the oocytes at 38–40 h post-hCG treatment. This suggests that MCMs require a longer duration of stimulation for optimal in vivo oocyte maturation. The MCM oocytes were then fertilized using a similar protocol and culture medium as described by Curnow and Hayes. Domestic cynomolgus macaque IVF rates range from ~ 49–69% for oocytes fertilized by ICSI with ~ 31–56% of those embryos developing to the blastocyst stage when cultured in vitro. In this report, a cleavage rate of 72.7% and a blastocyst rate of 19.8% was achieved for control MCM embryos. Notably, the culture medium used in this study was reported to support a > 50% blastocyst rate in domestic cynomolgus macaques. Hence, the reduced blastocyst rate in the present study suggests further optimization of culture conditions is needed to better support extended in vitro culture of MCM embryos. Despite relatively low embryonic development rates, successful CRISPR-Cas9 targeting of was achieved in MCM embryos. Our group has previously demonstrated successful targeting of the gene using CRISPR-Cas9 technology in human iPSCs, which resulted in a 27% editing efficiency with ~ 41% of the edited cells containing homozygous or biallelic deletions in . Applying a similar dual-guide approach to MCM embryos resulted in > 50% of the RNP microinjected embryos containing CCR5 deletions, and approximately a third of the CRISPR-Cas9 microinjected embryos containing biallelic deletions. This is one of few reports describing biallelic editing in NHP embryos. Wan et al. reported a 100% biallelic editing rate in 18 cynomolgus macaque embryos microinjected with CRISPR-Cas9 mRNAs targeting the gene. Similarly, Zhang et al. reported biallelic editing of within 15 tissues of 3 cynomolgus macaque infants born from CRISPR-Cas9 targeted embryos. In these two reports a 100% biallelic editing rate was observed, however, the genes of interest were targeted using Cas9 mRNA and sgRNA rather than a Cas9-sgRNA RNP complex in one-cell embryos. In the current study, a RNP was selected for microinjection as it was suggested by Midic et al. that CRISPR-Cas9 targeting occurred more rapidly with RNP versus mRNA microinjections in rhesus macaque embryos. Regardless of the CRISPR-Cas9 construct, mosaic genome editing has been observed in studies using CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing approaches in NHP embryos. A mosaic genome editing pattern was observed in the present study within ~ 50% of the -edited embryos. Notably, human patients with a naturally occurring, homozygous deletions in the gene show complete HIV resistance, whereas heterozygous individuals have delayed progression in HIV infection. Hence, the introduction of either homozygous or heterozygous mutations in MCMs would be biologically relevant for disease modeling. Decreased in vitro embryonic development and pregnancy rates have been observed in NHP embryos microinjected with higher concentrations and/or volumes of CRISPR-Cas9 mRNAs. Wan et al. showed that embryonic development was reduced by ~ 30% in cynomolgus macaque embryos microinjection with the highest concentration of 200 ng/μl Cas9 mRNA:10 ng/μl sgRNA compared to lower concentration of 100 ng/μl Cas9 mRNA:10 ng/μl sgRNA, while a 100% biallelic editing rate was observed for embryos microinjected with either concentration. Likewise, a study by Yao et al. reported that transfer of 27 cynomolgus macaque embryos microinjected with a volume of 4 pl of 100 ng/μl Cas9 and 50 ng/μl sgRNAs with 100 ng/μl donor plasmid produced no pregnancies following embryo transfer, whereas reducing the microinjection volume to 2 pl resulted in 5 pregnancies following the transfer of 42 embryos into 12 recipients. These studies collectively demonstrate a dose-dependent decrease in embryonic development upon microinjection with CRISPR-Cas9 constructs. In the present study, a RNP was used for CRISPR-Cas9 targeting in which a single concentration of 20 μM Cas9 protein was complexed with 50 mM of each sgRNA. Decreased cleavage and blastocyst rates were observed in Cas9 and RNP microinjected embryos compared to control. It is unclear whether reduced development is a result of the introduction of Cas9 or the microinjection process itself as sham injections were not performed in this study due to limited oocyte resources. Future studies are needed to further assess MCM embryonic development following sham microinjection and microinjection with differing concentrations and/or volumes of CRISPR-Cas9 constructs. The failure of control and microinjected MCM embryos to implant following embryo transfer may be due to the lack of recipient cycle synchronicity, embryonic toxicity of the CRISPR-Cas9 constructs or embryonic lethality incurred by the genetic mutation. Upon monitoring candidate embryo transfer recipient cycles, ovulation was not observed in a large proportion of the cycles monitored. Hence, the lack of synchronicity did not allow for optimal timing for delivery of embryos to the oviduct or uterus. A larger cohort of embryo recipients with rigorous sampling of hormone levels may be needed in future studies to optimize the timing of embryo transfer in MCMs. There is a lack of knowledge regarding the regularity of MCM ovarian cycles, and thus, it is unclear whether the observations in this study are reflective of all MCMs or the WNPRC colony animals in the current study. Of note, blastocyst hatching was observed in control and Cas9 alone microinjected MCM embryos with long term in vitro culture in this study. The rate of live births following embryo transfer of genome-edited cynomolgus macaque embryos remains low. For example, Tu et al. reported that the transfer of 178 CRISPR-Cas9 microinjected embryos to 47 recipients resulted in 11 pregnancies and 6 live births. Notably, about 1.67–7.1% of the transferred CRISPR-Cas9 targeted cynomolgus macaque embryos result in a live edited offspring. It is also possible that the CRISPR-Cas9-induced genetic mutations may contribute to embryonic lethality. A 39% reduction in live birth rate was observed following embryo transfer of edited cynomolgus macaque embryos compared to wild-type embryos, whereas pregnancy rates were similar between groups. The deletion in has been reported to occur at a frequency of < 1% in the human population. Therefore, it is plausible that the gene has an unknown role in pre- or peri-implantation stages of embryonic development, and further study is needed to ascertain whether this rare mutation hinders embryonic survival. In the present study, off-target effects were not evaluated as no off-target editing was observed in our cell based model. Unpublished studies that have been deposited recently in the BioRxiv database (; Alanis-Lobato et al. 2020, Zuccaro et al. 2020) report large scale deletions on the same chromosome as the CRISPR-Cas9 target site within human embryos. Hence, it is conceivable that in embryos lacking PCR signal that the gene region was not able to be amplified because the PCR primer sites were within a large-scale deletion. While whole-genome DNA sequencing of -edited embryos was not performed in the present study, the recent suggestion that CRISPR-Cas9 may introduce large scale deletions warrants further analysis of the impact of gene targeting by CRISPR-Cas9 technology in NHP embryos. In conclusion, the present study describes the establishment of methods for MCM in vitro embryo culture and the successful targeting of the gene in MCM embryos. Monitoring MCM ovarian cycles with daily blood draws revealed a large proportion of cycles to be irregular and this warrants further exploration to assess if this is intrinsic to this sub-species. This finding may also underlie the problems faced by our research group and others in obtaining good quality oocytes and development of IVF embryos. Future studies are needed to further optimize MCM embryo culture conditions to better support blastocyst formation in vitro. Moreover, the concentration and volume of CRISPR-Cas9 RNP should be refined to achieve high editing efficiency without compromising embryonic development rates. The successful introduction of deletions in MCM embryos establishes a platform for futures studies to create a NHP model of SIV resistance in monkeys containing the deletion. Ultimately, the generation of an SIV resistance model will aid in our understanding of HIV disease progression and resistance as well as provide a system to further develop curative treatments and therapeutics. Cynomolgus monkeys of () of Chinese (n = 5) and Mauritian (n = 31) origin were acquired from Alpha Genesis Inc (Yemassee, SC), Primate Products LLC (Miami, FL) (domestic CCMs) or Bioculture Ltd (Mauritius). A total of 32 females (5 Chinese and 27 Mauritian) were used in this study that were 4.3–12.1 years of age and weighed 3.28–6.7 kg. In addition, 4 MCM males served as semen donors that were 4.3–12.7 years of age and of a body weight ranging from 7.64 to 9.56 kg. All procedures were performed in accordance with the NIH Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and under the approval of the University of Wisconsin College of Letters and Sciences and Vice Chancellor Office for Research and Graduate Education Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Ovarian stimulation and in vitro maturation of oocytes Regularly cycling females underwent ovarian hyperstimulation beginning on days 1–4 of menses. Monkeys were administered 30 IU recombinant human follicle stimulating hormone (rhFSH) (IVF Prescription, Puregon) intramuscularly, twice-daily at twelve hour intervals for 11–11.5 days. An injection of 1000 IU recombinant human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG; IVF Prescription, Ovidrel) was administered in the evening on day 11 or 11.5. Laparoscopic oocyte aspirations were performed between 38–40 h post hCG injection in which the ovaries were manipulated to visualize and aspirate all visible follicles. Oocytes were aspirated into HTF-HEPES solution (Irvine Sci., cat no: 90126) supplemented with 3 mg/mL human albumin (MP Biomedicals, cat no: 823051), 0.28 mg/mL heparin (Sigma-Aldrich, cat no: H3149) and 0.28 mg/mL hyaluronidase (Sigma-Aldrich, cat no: H3884) and filtered through a 100 μM strainer (PluriSelect, cat no: 435010051) to remove blood clots and cumulus cells from oocytes. The oocytes were washed from the strainer and placed into maturation medium composed of CMRL 1066 medium (Thermo Fisher Scientific, cat no: 11530037) supplemented with 0.5 mM sodium pyruvate (Sigma-Aldrich, cat no: 2256), 2 mM Alanyl-glutamine (Sigma-Aldrich, cat no: G8541) and 20% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Peak Serum, cat no: PS-FB1, Wellington, CO, USA) as similarly described by Curnow and Hayes. Semen was collected from male MCMs by electroejaculation while under mild ketamine sedation. Following collection, semen was incubated at room temperature for 30 min to allow the coagulum to liquefy prior to processing. The coagulum was removed and sperm samples were washed twice in HEPES-TL (Caisson Laboratories, cat no: IVL01) supplemented with 0.1 mM sodium pyruvate and 3 mg/mL bovine serum albumin (Sigma-Aldrich, cat no: A8806), diluted as needed, and transferred into 7% polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) for ICSI. Prior to fertilization, oocyte maturation was evaluated for progression to the metaphase II stage, denoted by the presence of an extruded polar body. The duration of oocyte maturation was approximately 4–5 h. Mature MII oocytes were fertilized by ICSI and transferred into Global medium. ICSI was performed without exposure to fluorescent light, since we noted its negative effect on MCM embryo development. A deletion was introduced using two gRNAs designed to disrupt sequences within exon 2, including a 24-bp deletion region which was found to prevent functional expression in NHPs. sgRNA#1 (GCUGCUGCCCAGUGGGACUU) and sgRNA#2 (GCUGUGUUUGCCUCUCUCCC) were synthesized by Synthego Corporation (Menlo Park, CA, USA). To generate the  RNP complexes, 20 μM Cas9 protein containing two nuclear localization signals (2NLS) (PNA Bio, , Newbury Park, CA) and 50 mM of each sgRNA were dissolved in 10 mM Tris–HCl (pH 7.4) containing 0.1 mM EDTA and sterilized with a 0.2 mm filter. The mixture was kept at room temperature for 20–30 min and centrifuged for 1 min at 20,000×. The supernatant (~ 3 μL) was then loaded into a microinjection needle and ~ 10–15 pl of the CRISPR-Cas9 RNP solution was injected into the oocyte cytoplasm between 5–7 h post-ICSI. The microinjection pipette was calibrated prior to injection to ensure uniform delivery to the high viscosity of CRISPR/Cas9 solution. Calibration was performed by measurement of the size of the drop injected under mineral oil on plastic plate. Injected volume was verified after injection of 10 oocytes and corrected if needed. Following fertilization, embryos were cultured in Global Total medium (Cooper Surgical, cat no: LGGT-030). Embryos were either cultured in cohorts in a standard incubator or cultured individually for time-lapse embryo imaging to assess developmental morphokinetics. MCM embryos were cultured in cohorts of 5–10 embryos per 40 μL drop of Global Total medium supplemented with 1 mg/mL human albumin (MP Biomedicals, cat no: 823051) under light mineral oil (Irvine Sci., Cat#9305) at 37 °C in l ow oxygen (5% CO, 5% O). Alternatively, embryos were cultured in a MIRI TL Time-Lapse incubator (Esco Medical, Denmark) to monitor embryo development. Individual embryos were placed into a microwell of a CultureCoin MIRI-TL dish (Esco Medical, Denmark) containing 25 μL of Global media overlaid with 3 mL of mineral oil. The medium was equilibrated for 3–4 h at 37 °C in low oxygen (5% CO, 5% O) prior to embryo culture. Individual microwells were then imaged every five minutes across five focal planes. The time of ICSI was determined as 0 h and the time of cleavage to 2-cells, 4-cells, and 8-cells and the initial timing of morula and blastocyst formation were annotated for each embryo. PCR analysis of whole embryos and single blastomeres To isolate DNA from embryos, the zona pellucida was removed by treatment with 1 mg/mL of activated pronase E (Sigma-Aldrich, cat no: P2730) under mineral oil. The whole embryo was washed in calcium and magnesium free PBS with 0.2% EDTA and 1 mg/mL human albumin (MP Biomedicals, cat no: 823051). Single blastomeres could be obtained by gently pipetting the embryo. DNA was extracted and amplified from single blastomeres or whole embryos using a REPLI-G single cell kit (Qiagen, cat no: 150343). Quality control analysis of amplified DNA was performed using an Agilent Femto Pulse system (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA) to confirm a uniform yield of DNA product with the average product length of more than 9.4 kb. PCR was performed using primers that annealed to sequences upstream and downstream of the CCR5 target region: forward primer 612 (5′-TCAATGTGAAACAAATCGCAGC) and reverse primer 613 (5′-TCGTTTCGACACCGAAGCAG). The temperature profile was 98 °C for 2 min followed by 32 cycles of 98 °C for 30 s, 58 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 40 s and a final extension step at 72 °C for 10 min. The PCR products were them run on a 1% agarose gel. The expected size of the unmodified (wild-type) PCR amplicon is 613 base pairs. Embryo recipient hormone analysis and embryo transfer Blood samples were drawn from potential embryo recipients from day 9 to 16 post-onset of menses. Blood tubes were centrifuged at 1300 ×  for 10 min at room temperature and isolated serum was stored at – 80 °C. Steroid hormones were extracted from a 400 μL aliquot of serum and evaluated for progesterone and estradiol levels using the protocol previously described with minor modifications to the LC method. The inter-assay coefficient of variation (CV) was determined by pools of human and macaque serum and ranged from 6.09 to 14.65%. To evaluate luteinizing hormone (LH) levels, a radioimmunoassay (RIA) was performed as previously described. Briefly, LH concentrations in serum samples were measured by RIA in duplicate using the recombinant cynomolgus LH kit from the Hormone and Peptide Program (Torrance, CA, USA). All samples were run in two assays; one assay was run using the rapid (2-day method) and another with the regular (3-day method). The sensitivity of the assay was 0.01 ng/tube. The intra-assay CV for the rapid assay was 2.21% and the regular was 3.76%. Embryos were either transferred surgically by laparoscopic cannulation of the oviduct or non-surgically by trans-cervical cannulation using methods previously described for rhesus macaques. Up to ten embryos were transferred to an individual recipient, where one to two-cell embryos were placed in the oviduct and 4- to 16-cell embryos were placed into the uterus. Statistical analysis was performed using either RStudio () or Graphpad Prism (https://www.graphpad.com/scientific-software/prism/) software. The statistical method used for each comparison is described in the table legend. Embryo development rates within MCM or CCM were compared using the fmsb package in RStudio to perform pairwise Fisher’s Exact tests with a post-hoc Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons. For all other analyses, Graphpad Prism software was used.
