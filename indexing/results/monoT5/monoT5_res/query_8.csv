You've asked and we've answered your questions about managing diabetes in the following categories: I have been trying to eat better to manage my diabetes. Now that I know my risk for cardiovascular disease, I realize I have to eat better for my heart, too. As a person with diabetes, am I supposed to watch my calories, fat or carbohydrates? Lori Wolf, R.D./L.D., patient education advisor for the American Heart Association in Dallas, Texas, explains: Diabetes increases the risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD), and dietary intervention has been proven to help lower that risk. Following recommendations from the American Heart Association is heart healthy. Since diabetes is a major risk factor for CVD, you should protect your heart with diet and physical activity (as your healthcare provider allows). To manage your diabetes, it's important to monitor calories, fat and carbohydrates. On a diabetic meal plan, your caloric intake should remain about the same from day to day. That's because the meal plan is designed around a total caloric level. Your healthcare provider set your level to support optimal blood sugar control and to allow gradual weight loss or weight maintenance, depending on your need. That's why it's imperative that you comply with the recommended calorie levels. Fat is an important nutrient in the diet, so don't exclude it. To manage your diabetes to protect your heart, it helps to know about saturated, unsaturated and trans fats. - Saturated fats are usually solid at room temperature and come from animal products such as meats, cheese, eggs, milk products and butter. They are also found in tropical oils such as coconut and palm oils. Saturated fats increase CVD risk by increasing the bad cholesterol (LDL). To protect against CVD, you should limit these fats to less than 5-6 percent of calories in your diet. - Unsaturated fats are liquid at room temperature and come from vegetable sources such as canola oil and olive oil. They also can be found in soft tub or liquid margarine. These fats protect your heart's health by lowering the bad cholesterol, so most of your daily fat should come from unsaturated fats. And you should use these oils to substitute for saturated fat choices, not in addition to them. - Trans fats are created in an industrial process that adds hydrogen to liquid vegetable oils to make them more solid. Another name for fats is ""partially hydrogenated oils."" Look for them on the ingredient list on food packages. fats raise your bad (LDL) cholesterol levels and lower your good (HDL) cholesterol levels. You should limit your diet to less than 1 percent of your total daily calories. To manage diabetes and decrease CVD risk, it's best to increase unsaturated fats and decrease saturated fat and trans fat. Carbohydrates should be the main focus of your daily efforts to control your blood sugar and thus your diabetes. Carbohydrates are completely digested and put into your bloodstream in the form of sugar within two hours of eating them. (This is one of the reasons it's important to test your blood sugar two hours after a meal to monitor how your body handled the amount of carbohydrates you just ate and to design the perfect plan for your body.) To successfully manage diabetes, consistency is the key with carbohydrates. Typically, eating the same amount of carbohydrates at each meal at the same time every day is a great formula for stabilizing blood sugar levels according to the caloric level of your meal plan. Some people are more sensitive because of medications and/or activity levels. They will need more specific monitoring of their meals and carbohydrate intake with a dietitian's help. First, there was the South Beach Diet, then the Grapefruit Diet, then the Atkins Diet. Do any of these — and other fad diets — work for someone with diabetes? What's the best way to lose weight? First, I do not like the word ""diet"" as it is commonly used. Instead, think ""lifestyle change,"" because when you stop using a diet, you go back to where you were before you began the diet. There's nothing magical about any of these fad diets. They're quick fixes. All of them will help you lose weight as long as you eat fewer calories than you expend. A lot of these diets replace something you eat with something else. So, going on these diets is the wrong approach to take. If, as a person with diabetes, you want to get your weight under control, make major behavior changes. I recommend you join Weight Watchers because it will put you into a lifestyle change mode. Think of diet in the context of ""eat less, move more."" You must work on both sides of the equation: how many calories you consume (diet) and how many calories you expend (exercise). There's a difference between diets that help you lose weight and diets that can help you lower both blood cholesterol and body weight. For example, the diet that lowers blood cholesterol is low in saturated fat and cholesterol and has the right amount of calories for you. A diet that fosters weight loss only, such as some of the fad diets, can cause weight loss temporarily but may not help with glucose control or maintaining weight loss. In fact, a good diet — that is, a healthy lifestyle — causes weight loss and will improve blood sugar control, lower blood pressure and lower blood cholesterol. So remember, it's not about diet — it's about behavior change. I have heard that drinking a glass of wine a day is good for the heart. Is this true if you have diabetes? Are the benefits of alcohol limited to wine, or can I drink other types of alcohol? Can alcohol have an adverse effect on my blood sugar levels? Prakash Deedwania, chief of the cardiology division and professor of medicine at the University of California School of Medicine in San Francisco, Calif., explains: Drinking a glass of wine is good for the heart in the sense that the main mechanism by which alcohol protects the heart is increasing good cholesterol (HDL). The grape skin provides flavonoids and other antioxidant substances that protect the heart and vessels from the damaging effects of free oxygen radicals produced by our body. This is particularly true for diabetics because they have been shown to have a high production of free oxygen radicals. But we don't have any evidence specifically related to diabetes patients. A glass of wine can also help individuals relax. The strongest evidence is in favor of wine, but some evidence recently showed beer and other types of alcohol may provide the same benefits related to increasing good cholesterol (HDL). In general, alcohol does not seem to have an adverse effect, unless excessive amount is used — and it increases calories, among other things. For example, excessive amounts of alcohol consumption could be harmful by increasing the risk of high blood pressure, for which diabetic patients are already at high risk. My healthcare provider told me that if I lose some weight, my diabetes will be better controlled. I have been incorporating physical activity into my everyday life and have lost a little weight. But the last couple of weeks, I feel like I have hit a plateau — nothing's happening anymore and I still have some weight to go! What's going on? First, congratulations on your weight loss! Losing even 10 pounds will improve your blood sugar readings and HbA1c. It also will help lower your blood pressure and LDL (""bad"") cholesterol and raise your HDL (""good"") cholesterol. It's hard for most people to get enough physical activity to substantially reduce their weight. Regular physical activity must be combined with sensible eating — and, most importantly, portion control. Even when physical activity and reducing calories are used together, people often reach a plateau. The number of calories that your body needs depends on your body weight. The heavier you are, the more calories you can eat to maintain your body weight. As you lose weight, though, you may need to adjust your calorie intake downward to keep losing weight. Sometimes if people have been severely restricting their calorie intake, they may lower their metabolic rate. Then they may need to add 100 to 200 calories per day of healthy foods to rev up their metabolism. When people have been working at weight loss for a long time and feel that they've hit a plateau, it's often a good idea to take a break from actively trying to lose more and spend some time maintaining this new weight. Also, varying the type of physical activity can be helpful. By doing this you will not only use different muscle groups, but you will be less likely to become bored. In addition, you may want to assess how much and what types of food you are eating. It is easy to believe you are eating less when in fact you are taking in more calories than is necessary. Remember to drink enough water, too — it helps your metabolism and cellular function. Losing weight is hard work. The people who are most successful in the long-term are those who have lost weight slowly and steadily and who have learned to incorporate sound eating habits and moderate levels of physical activity into their everyday life. I've started working some physical activity into my daily routine. But my blood sugar seems a little more out of control. How does my becoming more active affect my blood sugar? Alain Bertoni, M.D., M.P.H., assistant professor in Public Health Sciences and Internal Medicine at Wake Forest University School of Medicine in Winston-Salem, N.C., explains: Becoming more physically active is a great way to help control your diabetes. When you walk or do other moderate-intensity physical activities such as biking, swimming or dancing, you burn more calories than when you're sitting still. Your now-active muscles take up sugar from the blood to use as energy. This tends to lower your blood sugar levels, which is generally good. Many people with diabetes can exercise safely. Before beginning any exercise program, consult with your healthcare provider to help choose the safest activities for you, given your age and medical history. Once your healthcare provider has given you the green light, increase your physical activity. By doing regular physical activity, you will probably lower your blood sugar levels (as measured by the HbA1c test) and may make it easier to reach your diabetes treatment goals. However, be aware that the change in blood sugar levels during a particular exercise session may cause blood sugar to drop so low that it could cause hypoglycemia (extremely low blood sugar levels). This may be more likely to happen if you use insulin or oral drugs in the sulfonylurea family. To guard against this, you should know your usual symptoms of hypoglycemia and carry a source of sugar with you such as tablets, hard candy or juice (with real sugar, not artificial sweetener). If you experience hypoglycemic symptoms, stop exercising and eat or drink the source of sugar. Other general precautions include: don't take your medications just before exercise, and If you have experienced hypoglycemia during exercise, especially if severe passing out or if milder cases have occurred several times, consult with your healthcare provider or diabetes educator before continuing your exercise program. You may need to coordinate your eating, exercise and medication times, test your blood sugar levels before exercising, or eat a heart-healthy snack (like a piece of fruit) just before exercising. Finally, pay close attention to your eyes, feet and joints. Wearing shoes that don't fit properly or doing more demanding exercises (like jogging) may cause injuries. Lower-impact sports and good socks/athletic shoes may help guard against this. Report blisters or ulcers to your healthcare provider immediately. Certain strenuous activities (like racket sports) may cause problems with your eyes if you already have significant retinopathy. I am eating right, and increasing my activity, but my waist size is still big. Is this okay, or am I still at risk? Dr. Lori Mosca, an American Heart Association volunteer and director of preventive cardiology at New York-Presbyterian Hospital explains: Waist size is a very important predictor of having unhealthy levels of blood cholesterol, high blood pressure, and prediabetes. For men, if the number is over 40, or for women if the number is over 35, risk increases. The research is beginning to tell us that it's not IF you're fat that matters, but WHERE you're fat. It seems the belly is not just a simple storage depot for fat but is a pretty active place in the body that leads to a lot of metabolic abnormalities that increase the risk for cardiovascular disease, such as heart attack or stroke. At this point we can't fully explain why, but we do know that an oversized waist is a red flag. I have heard that if I have type 2 diabetes, my risk for heart attack is the same as that of someone who has already had a heart attack. Is this true? Can you help me understand the relationship between type 2 diabetes and heart disease? Dr. Lori Mosca, an American Heart Association volunteer and director of preventive cardiology at New York-Presbyterian Hospital explains: Type 2 diabetes is the type that often develops in adulthood, though more and more children and adolescents are also developing it. It's often associated with being overweight and leading a not-so-healthy lifestyle. We've learned in our research that people with diabetes have almost the same risk of having a future heart attack as people who already have heart disease or other vascular disease. So diabetes is really one of the strongest risk factors we have. Some of us feel so strongly about diabetes that we call it a risk equivalent, which means it's equivalent to having heart disease already. We are extremely aggressive with this risk factor, because we know that if you have diabetes, you are at substantially higher risk for future heart disease. We also know that diabetes is associated with unhealthy levels of different types of blood cholesterol. So, people with diabetes tend to have an increased level of the bad cholesterol (LDL) and of triglycerides, and they tend to have reduced levels of the good cholesterol (HDL). This may be one of the explanations for why people with diabetes are at such high risk for heart attacks. Learn how to better manage your . My healthcare provider told me I have type 2 diabetes. He also told me that my risk for cardiovascular disease, such as heart attack or stroke, is very high. Why is the risk so much higher for me? Wahida Karmally, Dr.Ph., R.D., associate research scientist and director of nutrition of the Irving Center for Clinical Research in the Columbia University Medical Center in New York, explains: Even when blood sugar levels are under control, diabetes increases the risk of heart disease and stroke. The risks are even greater if blood sugar is not well controlled. This occurs because diabetes causes damage to the blood vessels and arteries throughout the body including the ones that supply blood to your heart and brain. As this damage occurs, it becomes easier for plaque to form in the arteries. This buildup (atherosclerosis) is what can increase your blood pressure. When high blood pressure exists with obesity, smoking, high blood cholesterol or diabetes, the risk of heart attack or stroke increases several times. It's very important to control your weight and blood cholesterol with a low-saturated-fat, low-cholesterol, plant-based diet and regular exercise. It's also important to lower high blood pressure and not to smoke. Diabetes is a coronary heart disease risk equivalent. This means the risk for major coronary events is equal to that in established coronary heart disease. The risk for cardiovascular disease, such as heart attack and stroke, is higher because most people with diabetes have other health problems such as high blood pressure and blood cholesterol. If you have diabetes, you can reduce your risk for cardiovascular disease and stroke by controlling your Blood cholesterol — Get your cholesterol checked and talk to your doctor about your numbers and how they impact your overall risk. Managing your weight, eating a plant-based healthy diet, engaging in regular physical activity and taking medications (if prescribed by your healthcare provider) can also help you reach your treatment goals. I was recently diagnosed with type 2 diabetes and I am concerned about my children's risk for diabetes. What steps can I take to help them lead a healthy lifestyle and avoid diabetes? Many parents who are diabetic worry about their child’s risk for diabetes. It is true that having a family member with diabetes measurably increases the risk that a child may develop diabetes. Fortunately, with some knowledge and with help from your health care providers, there are things you can do to keep your children healthy. Having a parent with type 2 diabetes increases a child’s risk for developing diabetes. This is related in part to genetics and in part to learned habits around exercise and eating. One way of thinking about it is that genes lay the groundwork, and the lifestyle allows for or protects against a diabetic predisposition. So, having a healthy lifestyle is extremely important. The risk that your child will develop type 2 diabetes depends on the parent’s gender and how old they were when they were diagnosed; children of mothers diagnosed before the age of 50 years have significant risk, 1 in 7. No medication has yet been shown to slow the progression to type 2 diabetes in children, although some medications may be useful in adults, and research is ongoing. Fortunately, lifestyle change can prevent diabetes in adults, and this is likely to be true in children as well. Weight loss, regular moderate-intensity, aerobic physical exercise such as 30 minutes of brisk walking 5 times per week and healthy eating habits, decrease the risk of diabetes in adults. Research in children shows that having a healthy lifestyle can improve factors associated with diabetes, including weight, cholesterol and blood pressure. Some specific things you can do to improve your child’s health are: Limit screen time: Keeping screen time to 2 hours or less per day may reduce rates of obesity, an important risk factor for diabetes type 2 Encourage a healthy diet: Serve lots of fruits and vegetables, unsalted nuts, low-fat (1%) or fat free dairy, fiber-rich, whole grain foods, fish twice per week, and limit intake of saturated fat, trans fat, and cholesterol. Choose healthy, monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats and avoid highly processed foods that can be high in sodium. Limit added sugars in beverages and foods such as sodas, fruit drinks, sucrose, fructose, maltose, honey, high-fructose corn syrup, concentrated fruit juice, corn syrup, cane juice, sweets (examples: candy, cookies, cake, etc.). Aim for a healthy weight: helping your child work towards a healthy weight is an important way to reduce your child’s risk of diabetes. Children and adolescents should do 60 minutes or more of physical activity per day. Model good habits: Positive role modeling is important. Show your children that physical activity is important and can be fun by spending time playing actively. Keep in mind that if you don’t take care of yourself, it will be hard for your children to follow a healthy lifestyle. For parents with the more rare type of diabetes mellitus, Type 1, the risk that your child will develop the disease depends in part on your gender and also the age you were diagnosed. Children of male type 1 diabetics have a 1 in 17 risk of contracting diabetes, while children of very early onset diabetics, those with two affected parents, and with multiple endocrine problems are at much greater risk (1 in 2-10). Breastfeeding may offer some protection from Type 1 diabetes. Some research has evaluated blood tests that may be available for siblings of children with type 1 diabetes; speak to your child’s doctor about this. So far, no medication has been shown to prevent type 1 diabetes in children, although research studies are ongoing. You and your doctor can better understand your child’s individual risk for diabetes using blood testing. A fasting glucose test should be done in overweight children with 2 of the following risk factors: family history of Type 2 diabetes including gestational diabetes in the child’s mother, at risk racial/ethnic background, high risk medical conditions such as insulin resistance, PCOS or metabolic syndrome. Screening should be done at least every 3 years using either a fasting glucose or a glycosylated hemoglobin (hemoglobin A1C). A more specialized test (oral glucose tolerance test) can tell how the body responds to glucose and can help your provider evaluate your child more closely. Talk to your child’s doctor about these tests.

cd0dbfd4-fc67-4f6b-95af-71bbf893db0d,"Role of Physical Activity for Weight Loss and Weight Maintenance Providence Medical Group/Endocrinology, Diabetes and Nutrition, Missoula, MT Corresponding author: Carla E. Cox, This article reviews the impact of exercise on weight loss and weight maintenance and the possible reasons that weight loss outcomes resulting from exercise are not consistently realized. Energy balance is a process through which the body attempts to establish homeostasis. Most individuals spend much of their lives in the same weight range without daily focus on caloric intake and output. The two parts of the equation for weight maintenance are energy intake (eating and drinking) versus energy output (nonexercise thermogenesis + exercise). To achieve weight loss, the American Diabetes Association (ADA) (), American Academy of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE) (), and National Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics () all recommend exercise as an integral part of any weight loss program. Physical activity and exercise are often used interchangeably. However, correctly defined, physical activity is all movement that creates energy expenditure, whereas exercise is planned, structured physical activity (). Research supports the importance of exercise in relationship to improved cardiovascular fitness, insulin sensitivity, glycemic control of type 2 diabetes, blood pressure, and depression scores (), but does exercise itself contribute to weight loss and maintenance efforts? The questions addressed in this article are: Does exercise in and of itself improve weight loss efforts outside of dietary restriction? Is there a difference between aerobic training and resistance training in achieving weight loss or weight maintenance? What are the potential explanations for less weight loss than predicted with exercise? When weight loss is achieved through any weight loss intervention program, does exercise contribute to the maintenance of that weight loss? Does Exercise in and of Itself Improve Weight Loss Efforts? Many outcomes data have been reported from research studies that have examined exercise alone, exercise plus dietary restriction, or dietary restriction alone to determine strategies for weight loss. The challenge over time is to accurately monitor both sides of the equation as individuals interact in their daily lives. A systematic review of studies with a minimum of 1-year follow-up () suggested that subjects who used exercise alone for weight reduction experienced minimal weight loss. There are two questions that need clarification: ) Does the drive for homeostasis require greater bouts of exercise than previously recommended to contribute to weight loss? ) Do individuals compensate for exercise by either eating more or reducing their nonexercise activity thermogenesis? Thirty-six overweight participants were assigned to either exercise plus calorie restriction or calorie restriction alone to determine whether exercise enhanced weight loss efforts. The calorie deficit remained constant during the 6-month trial. Ten percent weight loss was achieved over 6 months in both interventions without a statistically significant difference in the percentage loss of body fat. However, the exercise group had the added benefit of improved aerobic fitness (). In a randomized, controlled trial of 52 obese men (BMI 31.3 ± 2.0 kg/m), Ross et al. () demonstrated a body weight decrease of 7.5 kg over 3 months in the exercise-only group (16 men) that was comparable to that of the calorie-restricted group. Duration of exercise was based on the goal of a daily 700-calorie energy expenditure (∼60 min/day), suggesting that performing exercise greater than the minimum national recommendations for health of 150 min/week may be required to achieve clinically meaningful weight loss. Donnelly et al. () demonstrated weight loss with exercise alone in a group of 141 overweight or obese (BMI 31 kg/m) men and women in the Midwest Exercise Trial 2. Exercise was supervised for 10 months with an exercise calorie-equivalent reduction of either 400 or 600 calories 5 days per week and a completion rate of 65%. In the completion group, weight losses were 3.9 ± 4.9 and 5.2 ± 5.6 kg, respectively. This demonstrated a clinically significant weight loss for both men and women. However, the amount of activity to achieve this weight loss was again greater than the general exercise recommendations for health. Weiss et al. () demonstrated not only effective weight loss (7% over 16.8 weeks) with exercise alone, but also preservation of lean body mass (LBM) and improvement of maximal oxygen consumption (VO) when compared to weight loss with a comparable energy deficit through calorie restriction alone; the latter resulted in both a loss of LBM and a decrease in VO. In addition, as with other studies that have demonstrated weight loss with exercise, the amount of exercise was substantial at 7.4 ± 0.5 hours/week. Longer bouts of exercise have demonstrated a greater contribution to weight loss, both in controlled research trials and through self-reported information collected by the National Weight Control Registry (NWCR) (–). The NWCR has reported that 94% of individuals in the registry reported including exercise in their weight loss program (); weight loss was greater in the group with the greatest physical activity, but this group also reported more dietary restraint (), and only 1% of participants reported exercise alone for weight loss (). Most, but not all, study data indicate that exercise alone plays a very small role in weight loss. A joint position statement of the American College of Sports Medicine and the ADA () states that the “recommended levels of PA [physical activity] may help produce weight loss. However, up to 60 min/day may be required when relying on exercise alone for weight loss.” The 2016 AACE and the AmericanCollege of Endocrinology comprehensive clinical practice guidelines for medical care of patients with obesity () include an evidence recommendation for “aerobic training of ≥150 min/week of moderate intensity, with better outcomes with increasing amounts and intensity of exercise.” Is There a Difference Between Aerobic Training and Resistance Training or the Intensity of Activity in Achieving Weight Loss or Weight Maintenance? Willis et al. () compared aerobic exercise (calorie equivalent to 12 miles/week), resistance exercise (3 days/week), and a combination of the two to determine changes in body mass with a consistent program of exercise and without alternations in reported energy intake in a group of individuals who were previously sedentary and without diabetes (BMI 25–35 kg/m). Weight loss and fat mass reduction occurred with aerobic training to a more significant degree than with resistance training after the 8-month trial (1.76 vs. 0.83 kg for the aerobic and resistance groups, respectively). Adding resistance training did not enhance the change in total body mass compared to aerobic training alone. Over the 8-month study period, there was minimum weight change, suggesting the need for greater energy expenditure to contribute to major weight loss. Exercise regimens of varying intensities and durations were added to a calorie- and fat-restricted food plan in a randomized, controlled trial by Jakicic et al. (). Although not statistically significant, an absolute difference in weight loss of 1.7 kg was achieved with more vigorous and higher-duration exercise at 12 months. What Are Potential Explanations for Less Weight Loss Than Predicted From Exercise? The amount of weight loss predicted based on calculated energy expenditure often does not reflect the actual weight lost during research trials. Possible explanations include physiological compensation (less nonexercise activity) and limited control of food intake day by day for the duration of the trial, with the potential for compensatory food intake. Thomas et al. () suggested in their review of 15 studies that the small amount of weight loss observed is the result of a combination of the low level of prescribed exercise and a subsequent increase in calorie intake. A recent meta-analysis of 51 trials () suggested that in the short term, energy intake does not compensate for energy expenditure. Two to 14 hours after exercise bouts of 30–120 min at 36–81% VO, the difference in absolute energy intake between exercise and control groups was small; however, a reduction in relative energy intake of >119 calories was noted in 25 of 29 studies within the 51 trials. Blundell et al. () suggested a considerable individual variability with regard to exercise and appetite/food intake. Influences on intake include fat and fat-free mass, resting metabolic rate, and hormonal responses, which vary from person to person, making the individual response to exercise and weight loss difficult to predict. The article by Caudwell et al. () is in agreement with this assessment. These researchers developed an approach to assessing adaptive regulatory biological systems to determine the impact of physical activity on appetite and its contribution in turn to the impact on weight. There appeared to be a large difference in individual responses to physical activity. Neither nonexercise activity nor resting metabolic rate changed significantly. Nonresponders to weight loss strategies demonstrated a much greater degree of hunger and subsequent food intake, which was sufficient in quantity to explain the weight differences. Research findings suggest that there are responders and nonresponders to exercise as a weight loss tool. Energy intake compensation over the long term may partly explain this variability. When Weight Loss Is Achieved, Does Exercise Contribute to the Maintenance of That Weight Loss? Physical activity may be an important component of weight maintenance after weight loss. An excellent study that measured total energy expenditure with the doubly labeled water method suggested that physical activity in the range of 11–12 kcal/kg/day (900 calories/day for an 81-kg woman) may be important to prevent weight regain (). In the NWCR, 90% of participants reported exercise to achieve long-term weight loss maintenance, with an average 383-calorieenergy expenditure 7 days/week (). In addition, a systematic review of the literature by Fogelholm and Kukkonen-Harjula () suggested that an increase in energy expenditure of 1,500–2,000 calories/week is associated with weight maintenance. In a 33-year follow-up study, men who maintained activity >150 min/weekgained 5.6 kg compared to 9.1 kg in less active men, with an even more significant trend (3.8 vs. 9.5 kg) among women (). Tate et al. () reported that, in a 30-month study of 202 overweight adults, those whose exercise expenditure was >2,500 calories/week had less than half the weight regain of those whose exercise expenditure was <2,500 calories/week (2.9 vs. >6 kg). There is also evidence to support the notion that individuals who are less physically active are more likely to gain weight over time than those who exercise between 150 and 300 min/week (). Recent research based on the NWCR showed that both high- and low-exercise groups were able to maintain weight loss for 3 years. This suggests that there is a great deal of variability in individual responses to the ability to maintain weight loss over time (). Strategies to Promote Physical Activity in Practice Although exercise contributes to multiple health benefits, and most of the research suggests that it can play a role in both short- and long-term weight loss and weight maintenance, patients often have a difficult time engaging in a regular exercise program and continuing that program as a lifestyle modification. Thirty-six percent of people >18 years of age with diabetes reported no physical activity in the previous 30 days (). Only 30% of patients are counseled about exercise during an appointment with their primary care physician (). Starting with the first encounter, physicians and other health professionals should engage patients in a discussion of the importance of daily exercise, which may promote weight loss in overweight people, but also reduce weight gain over time, contributing to overall health. A recent article addressing strategies for promoting physical activity in clinical practice () provided excellent suggestions for engaging patients in physical activity. These include lifestyle modification suggestions such as getting up out of a chair and walking for 2 min every 30–60 min, connecting patients with physical activity professionals to create individualized programs that work for them, using mobile technology applications, and creating a “Walk with a Doc” program in the local community. The evidence that exercise contributes significantly to weight loss and weight maintenance is not firmly established. It is important to recognize the challenge of monitoring dietary intake and exercise intensity and duration over the long term. Overreporting of actual exercise and underreporting of food intake by individuals could be a contributing factor to the mixed results found to date. In addition, individual differences may play a role (responders vs. nonresponders). Variability in sex, BMI, exercise intensity and duration, and type of exercise in research studies make conclusive recommendations more difficult. Minimal research has been focused specifically on the weight loss effects of exercise alone in individuals with type 2 diabetes, who may have a different response to exercise than the population without diabetes. Consistently performing exercise of a duration greater than the basic recommendations for health (150 min/week of moderate-intensity exercise) does appear to be more likely to contribute to weight loss and weight maintenance efforts over the long term. Physical activity of all types, including aerobic, resistance, flexibility exercises, and reduced sedentary time clearly results in multiple health benefits for individuals with type 2 diabetes and should be included in any lifestyle recommendations for individuals with diabetes (). Encouraging individuals to exercise for longer periods of time each day may help to enhance weight loss. However, it is challenging for some patients to consistently achieve even small bouts of exercise daily. In counseling patients, it is important not to focus on the potential for weight loss as the sole outcome from exercise, but rather to suggest that exercise may contribute to weight loss efforts and does result in a myriad of other health-related benefits. This focus will reduce the likelihood of patients using the lack of weight loss as a reason to discontinue their exercise program.

Metabolic Syndrome: Proven Diet & Natural Treatment Plan Any guess at what disorder affects 40 percent of people over the age of 60? It’s called metabolic syndrome, which unfortunately does not simply mean that your metabolism is slow or out of whack. Metabolic syndrome is a metabolic disorder that involves not one, but a combination of three or more of the following health issues: abdominal obesity, high blood sugar, high levels, high blood pressure or low HDL (“good”) cholesterol. The term “metabolic” refers to the biochemical processes involved in the body’s normal functioning. When you have metabolic syndrome, your body is in a state of serious malfunction. Metabolic syndrome increases your risk for some very concerning and possibly deadly health issues, including heart disease, stroke and diabetes. But there’s good news. There’s hope for getting your body metabolically back on track as well as keeping it on track throughout your entire life. Some of the best ways to avoid metabolic syndrome include maintaining a healthy weight, regularly exercising and eating a plant-centric diet while avoiding . In fact, a loss of just 3 percent to 5 percent of your current body weight can lower your triglycerides, blood glucose and the risk of developing type 2 diabetes. Greater amounts of weight loss can also improve blood pressure readings, lower LDL (“bad”) cholesterol and increase HDL cholesterol. () Thankfully, there’s a proven metabolic syndrome diet and natural treatment plan to get your metabolic function back in proper working order. Avoid fake and  as much as possible. These frozen, bagged and boxed items are typically devoid of nutrients and loaded with unhealthy additives and preservatives that do nothing good for your health. In fact, a 2015 study found that fast food consumption, some of the most unhealthy processed food on the planet, increases the incidence of metabolic syndrome in both children and adults. () In addition, researchers in Brazil found that high consumption of ultra-processed foods was associated with metabolic syndrome in adolescents. () like  have been directly linked with the occurrence of diabetes and metabolic syndrome. Accumulating evidence suggests that frequent consumers of sugar substitutes containing ,  and  may also be at an increased risk of excessive weight gain as well as development of metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. () Since contain artificial sweeteners as well as other unhealthy ingredients, you don’t want to touch these lethal soft drinks. Studies show that the consumption of diet soda is associated with significantly greater risks of select incident metabolic syndrome components and type 2 diabetes. According to one 2009 study, daily consumption of diet soda was associated with a 36 percent greater risk of metabolic syndrome and a 67 percent greater risk of having type 2 diabetes! () are found in foods made with hydrogenated oils and fats, such as margarine; baked goods like cookies, cakes and pies; crackers; frostings; and coffee creamers. They raise LDL cholesterol and triglyceride levels, which is bad news for your waistline, heart health and metabolic disorders. () Consumption of these two are major culprits when it comes to high blood sugar levels, insulin resistance, and the development of diabetes and metabolic syndrome. Sugar, especially when used to sweeten beverages, is a major culprit, as are refined carbs. () A recent study conducted in Korea, where metabolic syndrome incidence is high, looked at the effects of on this metabolic disorder. What the researchers found was that “the percentage of energy from carbohydrates in men and intake of refined grains, including white rice, in women were associated with metabolic syndrome.” () Limit alcohol intake is key to metabolic syndrome and good health in general. Too much alcohol can raise your blood pressure and triglyceride levels. Alcohol also adds extra calories to your diet, which can cause weight gain. However, limited consumption of , as a meta-analysis published in  found that while heavy alcohol consumption indeed increases the risk of metabolic syndrome, “very light alcohol consumption seemed to be associated with a reduced risk of metabolic syndrome.” () Men should have no more than two drinks containing alcohol a day, while women should have no more than one drink containing alcohol a day. One drink is: When it comes to metabolic syndrome and encouraging good health in general, you want to focus on consuming whole, real, high-quality food and drinks. Some of the top foods to heal and prevent metabolic syndrome include: The omega-3 found in wild-caught, cold-water fish have been found to help regulate heartbeat, reduce blood pressure, decrease blood clot formation and reduce overall inflammation, all of which decrease the risk for heart attacks and strokes. () Omega-3 foods are also that help reduce triglycerides and LDL cholesterol. Other include walnuts, flaxseeds, natto and grass-fed beef. Dark leafy greens like kale and spinach, avocado, broccoli, cabbage, and carrots are a just a few of the many options when it comes to your daily intake of vegetables, which are loaded with disease-fighting and anti-inflammatory antioxidants and . Eating avocados in particular has been found to be clinically associated with lower metabolic syndrome in U.S. adults because your gut. () Think of a rainbow as you make your daily vegetable choices (red bell peppers to pumpkin to yellow squash to arugula to purple eggplant). This way, not only do you keep your meals interesting, but you obtain all of the great vitamins and nutrients vegetables can offer you! Similar to vegetables, there are so many options that not only taste good, but help you ward off metabolic syndrome. You can opt for apples, bananas, oranges, pears or prunes if you need some ideas that are easy to consume quickly or on the go. In moderation (so you don’t overdo it on natural sugar), daily fruit consumption is an easy and therapeutic habit to develop if you haven’t already. Pomegranate and in particular have been shown to help ameliorate metabolic syndrome. Research published in  concluded that pomegranate “exerts hypoglycaemic effects, including increased insulin sensitivity, inhibition of α-glucosidase, and impact on glucose transporter type 4 function, but is also responsible for a reduction of total cholesterol, and the improvement of blood lipid profiles, as well as anti-inflammatory effects through the modulation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor pathways. These effects may also explain how pomegranate-derived compounds function in the amelioration of adverse health effects caused by metabolic syndrome.” () Some delicious and tasty legumes to try include kidney beans, lentils, chickpeas, black-eyed peas and lima beans. Rich in fiber and protein, legumes are an excellent daily choice for keeping blood sugar stable and your waistline trim. And they’re particularly useful in preventing metabolic syndrome. A 2014 study examined the effects of legumes on metabolic syndrome. A validated 48-item food frequency questionnaire was used to assess dietary behaviors of 2,027 individuals pulled from the Isfahan Healthy Heart Program. Researchers found that “all MetS components were less prevalent among subjects with regular legume intake.” () , like quality whole grains including oatmeal and brown rice, not only have proven benefits for diabetes and heart health, but they also help keep your waistline in check. As such, whole grains are a part of a balanced, healthy metabolic syndrome diet treatment plan. () Research published in 2009 showed that ginseng, and , which are commonly used in Chinese medicine, are potent natural remedies when it comes to metabolic syndrome. They help regulate glucose and lipid metabolism, which directly and positively affect weight management. () When researchers from the Department of Home Science at Azad University of Agriculture and Technology in India investigated the effects of leaves on blood glucose and serum cholesterol levels in humans through double-blind clinical trials, the outcomes showed that holy basil caused significant improvements in blood glucose control and mild improvements in cholesterol levels. This suggests that basil supplementation can be a useful and safe way to help control diabetes and complications that result from the disease like metabolic syndrome. ()  contains phycocyanin, a pigment that scientists have discovered possesses antihypertensive effects, meaning it lowers blood pressure). Japanese researchers claim that this is because consuming the blue-green algae reverses endothelial dysfunction in metabolic syndrome. () increases the levels in the body, which not only improves your immune system and disease resistance, but also helps balance proper levels of cholesterol in the body. In addition, it significantly improves glucose tolerance by lowering levels of glucose in the blood, which improves heart health and conditions like diabetes or metabolic syndrome. () Three awesome  are grapefruit, cinnamon and ginger. Grapefruit essential oil actually works with your body in activating enzymes that help your body break down brown body fat. Cinnamon oil has been shown time and time again to help regulate and something in your body called GTF, glucose tolerance factor. For that reason, cinnamon oil is also fantastic for anybody with diabetes. (, ) Ginger oil reduces sugar cravings and helps reduce inflammation in the body. If you’re going to lose weight, it’s key that you also reduce inflammation and support digestion and absorption of nutrients, which ginger oil helps you to do. () is key when it comes to treating metabolic syndrome.  helps your body become a fat-burning machine. It consists of exercising at 90 percent to 100 percent of your maximum effort for 30 to 60 seconds, slowing it down to low-impact for a recovery period of just 30 to 60 seconds, and then bumping it back up again. If you’ve been spending hours on the treadmill without results, it’s because long-distance cardiovascular exercise can decrease testosterone and raise cortisol, the stress hormone. Increased levels of cortisol stimulate the appetite, increase fat storing, and slow down or inhibit exercise recovery. If burst training isn’t for you, then aim for at least 30 minutes per day of moderate-intensity exercise, such as brisk walking. () Through diet and exercise, losing weight can reduce insulin resistance and blood pressure, helping to get your metabolic syndrome under control. () Smoking cigarettes can lead to and worsen the health consequences of metabolic syndrome as well as increase your likelihood for heart problems and stroke, among other major health concerns. () Metabolic syndrome is also sometimes called dysmetabolic syndrome syndrome X, metabolic disease or insulin resistance syndrome. What is metabolic syndrome exactly? It’s actually the term for a cluster of conditions, including abdominal obesity, high triglyceride levels, high fasting blood sugar levels, high blood pressure or low HDL cholesterol. When a person has three or more of these metabolic risk factors occurring together, then he or she is diagnosed as having metabolic syndrome. About 85 percent of people who have type 2 diabetes also have metabolic syndrome. These individuals have a much higher risk for heart disease than the 15 percent of people who have type 2 diabetes without metabolic syndrome. () Thus, natural also are used to treat metabolic syndrome. I’m happy to say that aggressive and heart-healthy lifestyle changes are typically the main treatment for metabolic syndrome, which I fully support since lifestyle changes are the natural approach and get to the root causes of the disorder. Recommended lifestyle changes typically include heart-healthy eating, good stress management, losing and maintaining a healthy weight, more physical activity, and quitting smoking. If lifestyle changes aren’t effective, then your doctor will likely prescribe medications to treat and control your risk factors, such as high blood pressure, high triglycerides, low HDL (“good”) cholesterol and high blood sugar. A doctor’s main goal when treating metabolic syndrome is to reduce the risk of . The second goal of treatment is to prevent the onset of type 2 diabetes, if it hasn’t already developed. It’s scary but true that most of the disorders associated with metabolic syndrome are symptomless. However, one very common visible sign of metabolic syndrome is a large waist circumference: at least 40 inches for men and 35 inches for women. If most of your fat is around your waist rather than at your hips, you’re at a higher risk for heart disease and type 2 diabetes. () If you have very high blood sugar, then you might experience the signs and symptoms of diabetes like increased thirst, increased urination, fatigue and blurred vision. A normal fasting blood sugar level is less than 100 mg/dL. A fasting blood sugar level between 100–125 mg/dL is considered . A fasting blood sugar level of 126 mg/dL or higher is considered diabetes. A fasting blood sugar level of 100 mg/dL or higher (or being on medicine to treat high blood sugar) is considered a metabolic risk factor. is another symptom and risk factor for metabolic syndrome, which can go unnoticed unless you check your blood pressure regularly. A blood pressure of 130/85 mmHg or higher (or being on medicine to treat high blood pressure) is considered a metabolic risk factor. Another possible sign of metabolic syndrome is a high triglyceride level. Triglycerides are a type of fat or lipid found in your blood. When you eat, your body converts any calories it doesn’t need to use right away into triglycerides. A triglyceride level of 150 mg/dL or higher (or being on medicine to treat high triglycerides) is a metabolic risk factor for metabolic syndrome. HDL cholesterol is often referred to as “good” cholesterol because it helps remove cholesterol from your arteries. An HDL cholesterol level of less than 50 mg/dL for women and less than 40 mg/dL for men (or being on medicine to treat low HDL cholesterol) is risk factor for metabolic syndrome. A doctor can diagnose metabolic syndrome based on the results of a physical exam and blood tests. The two main causes of metabolic syndrome are being overweight or obese and a lack of physical activity.A 2017 study highlighted that an hour of weekly resistance exercise was associated with 29 percent lower risk of developing metabolic syndrome, compared to no resistance exercising. Participants who coupled aerobic exercise with their resistance exercise showcased a 25 percent lower risk. () Metabolic syndrome is a metabolic disease that’s directly linked with insulin resistance, which is more common in obese and inactive people. Let me explain what I mean by insulin resistance. A healthy digestive system breaks down food into glucose. Next, insulin, a hormone made by the pancreas, helps the glucose enter your cells to be used as fuel. However, if you experience , your cells won’t respond in a typical fashion to insulin, and hence, the glucose cannot enter your cells as easily. This phenomenon results in increased glucose levels in your bloodstream despite your body’s efforts to manage the glucose by producing more and more insulin. If this goes on long enough, then your body is unable to make enough insulin to maintain normal blood glucose levels and you can develop diabetes. Since bout 85 percent of people who have type 2 diabetes also have metabolic syndrome, if you develop diabetes then your likelihood of having metabolic syndrome is increased by a very large margin. Additional risk factors, most of which are unfortunately out of your control, that increase your chances of having metabolic syndrome include: () Age Your risk of metabolic syndrome increases with age, affecting 40 percent of people over the age of 60. Race Hispanics and Asians seem to be at greater risk of metabolic syndrome than are people of other races. Family history of diabetesYou’re more likely to have metabolic syndrome if you have a family history of type 2 diabetes or if you had diabetes during pregnancy (gestational diabetes). Other diseasesYour risk of metabolic syndrome is higher if you’ve ever had cardiovascular disease, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease or . In addition, researchers continue to study other health conditions that may play a role in metabolic syndrome, including: Breathing problems during sleep (such as sleep apnea) Metabolic syndrome is becoming more and more prevalent due to a rise in obesity rates among children and adults. In the not so distant future, metabolic syndrome may even overtake smoking as the leading risk factor for heart disease. Thankfully, there is realistic hope for naturally preventing metabolic disorders in the body. You can prevent or delay metabolic syndrome mainly with something that is very much in your control — lifestyle changes. A daily and long-term effort to maintain a healthy lifestyle is no doubt your surest and best bet to avoid metabolic syndrome and all the complications that can arise from this multidimensional health struggle! So keep the following in mind: Metabolic syndrome is a metabolic disorder that involves not one, but a combination of three or more of the following health issues: abdominal obesity, high blood sugar, high triglyceride levels, high blood pressure or low HDL (“good”) cholesterol. On a metabolic syndrome diet treatment plan, you should avoid fake and processed foods, artificial sweeteners, diet sodas, trans fats, refined carbohydrates and sugar, and alcohol. Foods to eat include fish and omega-3 foods, vegetables, fruits, legumes, and whole grains. In addition, the following supplements are beneficial for metabolic health: ginseng, berberine, bitter melon, holy basil, spirulina and maca root. Other natural remedies include essential oils, burst training, losing weight and not smoking. About 85 percent of people who have type 2 diabetes also have metabolic syndrome. Symptoms and risk factors for metabolic disease include large waist circumference, high fasting blood sugar, high blood pressure, high triglycerides and low HDL cholesterol. The two main causes of metabolic syndrome are being overweight or obese and a lack of physical activity.

KEVIN PETERSON, MD, MPH, University of Minnesota Medical School, Minneapolis, Minnesota JANET SILVERSTEIN, MD, University of Florida College of Medicine, Gainesville, Florida FRANCINE KAUFMAN, MD, Childrens Hospital Los Angeles and Keck School of Medicine of the University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California ELIZABETH WARREN-BOULTON, RN, MSN, Hager Sharp, Washington, D.C.   Related Editorial   See related handout on , written by the authors of this article.   This article exemplifies the AAFP 2007 Annual Clinical Focus on management of chronic illness. Abstract Abstract Although type 1 diabetes historically has been more common in patients eight to 19 years of age, type 2 diabetes is emerging as an important disease in this group. Type 2 diabetes accounts for 8 to 45 percent of new childhood diabetes. This article is an update from the National Diabetes Education Program on the management of type 2 diabetes in youth. High-risk youths older than 10 years have a body mass index greater than the 85th percentile for age and sex plus two additional risk factors (i.e., family history, high-risk ethnicity, acanthosis nigricans, polycystic ovary syndrome, hypertension, or dyslipidemia). Reducing overweight and impaired glucose tolerance with increased physical activity and healthier eating habits may help prevent or delay the development of type 2 diabetes in high-risk youths. The American Academy of Pediatrics does not recommend population-based screening of high-risk youths; however, physicians should closely monitor these patients because early diagnosis may be beneficial. The American Diabetes Association recommends screening high-risk youths every two years with a fasting plasma glucose test. Patients diagnosed with diabetes should receive self-management education, behavior interventions to promote healthy eating and physical activity, appropriate therapy for hyperglycemia (usually metformin and insulin), and treatment of comorbidities. More than 13,000 youths are diagnosed with diabetes every year, making it one of the most common chronic childhood diseases in the United States. The prevalence of childhood type 2 diabetes has increased by 33 percent in the past 15 years, mirroring the increasing rates of overweight in this population. In response to this emerging problem, the American Diabetes Association (ADA) developed a consensus statement in 2000 to guide primary care physicians on the prevention, screening, and treatment of type 2 diabetes in youth. In 2003, the ADA developed an additional consensus guideline for the management of dyslipidemia, and the American Heart Association developed a guideline on the primary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease in youth. Fasting plasma glucose levels should be checked every two years in high-risk children and adolescents, beginning at 10 years of age. All aspects of the diabetes management regimen should be individualized to the patient. The blood glucose level should be maintained as close to the normal range as possible without hypoglycemia. Primary prevention of cardiovascular disease should begin in childhood. Youths with type 2 diabetes and those with a body mass index greater than the 85th percentile for age should be counseled to increase physical activity and reduce body weight gain. Comorbidities such as hypertension and hyperlipidemia should be controlled.

For information about the SORT evidence rating system, see page612 or. Abstract Glucose intolerance is part of a continuum that ranges from normal blood glucose levels to clinically evident type 2 diabetes. Children at risk of type 2 diabetes often are overweight and insulin resistant. Together, these metabolic risk factors substantially increase the risk of atherosclerosis. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) concludes that there is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against routine screening for overweight in youth to prevent adverse health outcomes; however, American Academy of Family Physicians policy states that “optimal weight management in children and adolescents is desirable. The effectiveness of screening and counseling for overweight is uncertain.” The American Academy of Pediatrics endorses universal screening using body mass index (BMI) and growth curves to identify overweight children (i.e., those with a BMI greater than the 95th percentile for sex and age). Clinical growth charts are available athttp://www.cdc.gov/nchs/about/major/nhanes/growthcharts/clinical_charts.htm. presents ADA recommendations for diabetes screening in youth. The USPSTF has not addressed screening youths for diabetes. ADA Guidelines for Screening Youths for Type 2 Diabetes The rightsholder did not grant rights to reproduce this item in electronic media. For the missing item, see the original print version of this publication. Distinguishing between type 1 and 2 diabetes can be difficult in a child or adolescent with new-onset diabetes. Youths with type 1 diabetes often have antibodies against islet cell antigens (i.e., glutamic acid decarboxylase or insulin autoantibodies), whereas children with type 2 diabetes are overweight and usually do not have autoantibodies. The clinical distinction between the types of diabetes can be blurred because ketosis may be present in patients with type 2 diabetes, and patients with type 1 diabetes may be overweight and have acanthosis nigricans. Insulin and C-peptide levels are usually low at diagnosis in patients with either type of diabetes; furthermore, some patients have elements of both types. Youths with insulin resistance, overweight, and type 2 diabetes may have the pancreatic islet cell antibodies that are typically associated with type 1 diabetes; this is sometimes called “hybrid,” “mixed,” or “double” diabetes. If the diagnosis is unclear, it may be helpful to measure islet cell antibodies and C-peptide levels one year or more after the diagnosis. Abstract The treatment of children and adolescents with type 2 diabetes differs from that of adults because treatment in youths is focused on decreased insulin sensitivity with advancing sexual maturity, physical growth, ability to provide self-management, and neurologic vulnerability to hypoglycemia (in children younger than five years). The diabetes management regimen should be individualized to the patient.  includes resources for more information about the treatment of youths with type 2 diabetes.

Education about healthy eating, daily physical activity, insulin and medication administration, and self-monitoring of blood glucose levels is essential. Families should be encouraged to share with team members their concerns about day-to-day management tasks. Diet and exercise alone are effective for metabolic control in less than 10 percent of youths with type 2 diabetes, and an oral medication or insulin is usually required. Metformin (Glucophage) is an oral medication approved for use in some children. Because metformin's onset of action is delayed about four weeks, patients with substantial ketosis, ketoacidosis, or markedly elevated blood glucose levels initially should be treated with insulin. Metformin may be added after blood glucose levels are controlled and symptoms subside. The insulin may be tapered to discontinuation if metabolic control is maintained. Basal-bolus therapy using a combination of long- or intermediate-acting and short-acting insulin provides flexibility and can improve A1C levels. Insulin pumps can provide even greater flexibility, but they cost more and require more education for accurate use. Fixed-dose regimens provide little flexibility and may not fit the lifestyle of adolescents. A preprandial insulin bolus is based on an insulin:carbohydrate ratio, and an insulin-correction dose should be administered for hyperglycemia. Further adjustment of insulin or food intake may be needed in anticipation of special circumstances such as increased exercise. Patients should self-monitor their blood glucose level before meals and at bedtime. Treatment regimens (e.g., blood glucose goals, frequency of self-monitoring, type of insulin, dose and frequency of insulin administration, use of injections or a pump, nutritional management, physical activity levels) vary among patients. The diabetes care team should determine the regimen that best suits the patient's individual characteristics and circumstances. Because a safe lower-than-normal range for blood glucose has not been identified, the ADA recommends that blood glucose levels be maintained as close to the normal range as possible without serious hypoglycemia.  The ADA provides blood glucose goals only for young persons with type 1 diabetes ; however, because vascular damage may be mediated by glycated end products, it appears reasonable to use these goals in the management of type 2 diabetes.

Recommendations for Managing Body Weight in Youths with or at Risk of Type 2 Diabetes Food modification (for weight control and blood glucose control) Individualize calorie and food intake based on age, sex, and physical activity; go to for more information Limit consumption of snacks that have high levels of fat, sugar, or salt (e.g., potato chips, fast food, soda, desserts) Provide a meal plan developed by a registered dietitian, diabetes educator, or physician that includes low-fat and high-fiber foods, small portion sizes, and fewer beverages with high sugar content (e.g., soda, juice) Teach the patient and family how carbohydrates (e.g., breads, pasta, rice) can affect blood glucose levels Physical activity (for weight control and improvement in insulin sensitivity) Prescribe 30 to 60 minutes of physical activity per day Limit television and video game time to one or two hours per day Encourage peer support via youth camps and support groups Involve the patient's family in using the meal plan and in eating at regular mealtimes, especially if the youth is taking insulin Recommendations for Managing Body Weight in Youths with or at Risk of Type 2 Diabetes Food modification (for weight control and blood glucose control) Individualize calorie and food intake based on age, sex, and physical activity; go to for more information Limit consumption of snacks that have high levels of fat, sugar, or salt (e.g., potato chips, fast food, soda, desserts) Provide a meal plan developed by a registered dietitian, diabetes educator, or physician that includes low-fat and high-fiber foods, small portion sizes, and fewer beverages with high sugar content (e.g., soda, juice) Teach the patient and family how carbohydrates (e.g., breads, pasta, rice) can affect blood glucose levels Physical activity (for weight control and improvement in insulin sensitivity) Prescribe 30 to 60 minutes of physical activity per day Limit television and video game time to one or two hours per day Encourage peer support via youth camps and support groups Involve the patient's family in using the meal plan and in eating at regular mealtimes, especially if the youth is taking insulin Performing diabetes management tasks can make school-age youths, particularly adolescents, feel different from their classmates. Learning to cope with the disease may lead to depression or an eating disorder. A social worker or psychologist can help patients and their families adjust to lifestyle changes and can provide resources for health education; financial, social, and mental health services; transportation; and home visits. It is important that parents talk to their children about avoiding tobacco, alcohol, and drug use. Smoking and diabetes independently increase the risk of cardiovascular disease, and persons with diabetes who smoke have a greatly increased risk of heart disease and circulatory problems. Binge drinking can be associated with acute hyperglycemia or severe hypoglycemia. Because intoxication symptoms are similar to those of hypoglycemia, treatment of hypoglycemia may be delayed in patients who are intoxicated. Assess baseline A1C level; lipid profile (if normal, repeat every three to five years); and ophthalmologic status Conduct a psychosocial assessment to identify emotional and behavioral disorders Establish the goals of care and required treatment Provide nutrition therapy to meet growth needs and prevent excess weight gain Refer for dietary, behavioral, family, or community support as necessary Assess psychosocial adjustment?adherence, self-management skills, dietary needs, and physical activity level Assess physical status (e.g., skin, acanthosis nigricans, signs of polycystic ovary syndrome, liver enlargement) Perform ophthalmologic examination (may be performed less often on the advice of an ophthalmologist) Assess baseline A1C level; lipid profile (if normal, repeat every three to five years); and ophthalmologic status Conduct a psychosocial assessment to identify emotional and behavioral disorders Establish the goals of care and required treatment Provide nutrition therapy to meet growth needs and prevent excess weight gain Refer for dietary, behavioral, family, or community support as necessary Assess psychosocial adjustment?adherence, self-management skills, dietary needs, and physical activity level Assess physical status (e.g., skin, acanthosis nigricans, signs of polycystic ovary syndrome, liver enlargement) Perform ophthalmologic examination (may be performed less often on the advice of an ophthalmologist) Youths should self-manage their diabetes to the extent that is appropriate for their age and maturity level. By six or seven years of age, most children can recognize symptoms of hypoglycemia, perform blood glucose measurements, administer insulin injections, and participate in nutritional decisions. However, children should be supervised until they are able to accurately perform diabetes management tasks independently (e.g., measuring an insulin dose). Adolescents usually have the motor and cognitive skills to perform all diabetes-related tasks, including determining insulin doses based on blood glucose levels and food intake. Adolescence, however, is a time when peer acceptance is important and risk-taking behaviors and rebellion are common. Thus, diabetes management should be supervised in adolescents, and gradual independence should be allowed based on adherence to the regimen and reasonable metabolic control. During midadolescence, the diabetes care team should stress the importance of checking blood glucose levels before driving to avoid hypoglycemia while driving. Accommodations may be needed to manage diabetes at school (e.g., in the classroom, during physical education, field trips, and after-school activities). A written plan outlining the student's diabetes management tasks is helpful. A guide for effective diabetes management at school is available at. Abstract Diabetes microvascular complications and cardiovascular risk factors, including dyslipidemia and hypertension, have been observed among teenage Pima Indians and in other youths in the United States and may be present at diabetes diagnosis. Monitoring for hypertension and early treatment can slow the progression of retinopathy, nephropathy, and possibly neuropathy that can occur in adulthood. Evidence indicates that primary prevention of cardiovascular disease should begin in childhood.  presents consensus-based recommendations for monitoring lipid levels and blood pressure in youths. Recommendations for Monitoring Blood Pressure and Lipid Levels in Youth Hypertension is defined as an average systolic or diastolic blood pressure greater than the 95th percentile for age, sex, and height measured on at least three separate days Normal blood pressure levels for age, sex, and height; appropriate methods for measurement; and treatment recommendations are available atwww.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/prof/heart/hbp/hbp_ped.pdf Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors are preferred in children with microalbuminuria Optimal levels are: LDL cholesterol less than 100 mg per dL (2.60 mmol per L); high-density lipoprotein cholesterol greater than 35 mg per dL (0.90 mmol per L); and triglycerides less than 150 mg per dL (1.70 mmol per L) A lipid profile should be obtained at diagnosis, after glucose control is established; if lipids are at optimal levels, repeat lipid profile every three to five years If the LDL cholesterol level is greater than 100 mg per dL, prescribe an exercise plan and healthy diet; if goals are not reached after six months of diet and exercise, consider statin* therapy for patients with an LDL cholesterol level of 130 to 159 mg per dL (3.35 to 4.10 mmol per L), and begin medications for patients with an LDL cholesterol level of 160 mg per dL (4.15 mmol per L) or greater Weight loss, increased physical activity, and improved glycemic control often lead to improved lipid levels Recommendations for Monitoring Blood Pressure and Lipid Levels in Youth Hypertension is defined as an average systolic or diastolic blood pressure greater than the 95th percentile for age, sex, and height measured on at least three separate days Normal blood pressure levels for age, sex, and height; appropriate methods for measurement; and treatment recommendations are available atwww.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/prof/heart/hbp/hbp_ped.pdf Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors are preferred in children with microalbuminuria Optimal levels are: LDL cholesterol less than 100 mg per dL (2.60 mmol per L); high-density lipoprotein cholesterol greater than 35 mg per dL (0.90 mmol per L); and triglycerides less than 150 mg per dL (1.70 mmol per L) A lipid profile should be obtained at diagnosis, after glucose control is established; if lipids are at optimal levels, repeat lipid profile every three to five years If the LDL cholesterol level is greater than 100 mg per dL, prescribe an exercise plan and healthy diet; if goals are not reached after six months of diet and exercise, consider statin* therapy for patients with an LDL cholesterol level of 130 to 159 mg per dL (3.35 to 4.10 mmol per L), and begin medications for patients with an LDL cholesterol level of 160 mg per dL (4.15 mmol per L) or greater Weight loss, increased physical activity, and improved glycemic control often lead to improved lipid levels Abstract There are ongoing studies of youths with diabetes.

bfb3ea88-8779-4e56-961e-002d07c93e48,"Natural options against weight gain, sugar cravings, and insulin resistance The holidays have come and gone, but many of us may still be battling intense sweet cravings leftover from the season's festivities. Excessive sugar cravings can be a sign that your blood glucose levels are out of balance which, if left unchecked, can lead to insulin resistance and Metabolic Syndrome, also known as ""Pre-Diabetes."" ""The good news is that there are natural solutions to help balance blood glucose, improve metabolism and reduce sugar cravings, while supporting overall health,"" says Dr. Isaac Eliaz M.D., L.Ac. Metabolic Syndrome is characterized by a set of conditions that also mark the development of , giving it the name ""Pre-Diabetes."" Excessive fat around the abdomen (>40 inches for men and >35 inches for women) Low HDL (""good"" cholesterol) and high LDL (""bad"" cholesterol) Hyper-viscous coagulation marked by high fibrinogen - a sticky fibrous coagulant in blood Insulin resistance (your body isn't using insulin or blood sugar properly) The most dominant risk factors are obesity and accompanying insulin resistance, marked by elevated fasting blood glucose levels. Factors contributing to Metabolic Syndrome are poor diet, lack of exercise and chronic stress. Eating foods that are high in sugar and fat causes our insulin levels to spike. Dr. Eliaz says, ""Over time, our cells become less sensitive to insulin and our blood glucose levels rise. This increase in circulating blood glucose causes numerous inflammatory and degenerative conditions. The solution is to focus on foods that are low on the glycemic index."" Emphasize fiber and protein-rich foods, and limit simple carbohydrates and sugars to prevent glucose and insulin levels from spiking - causing insulin resistance - the hallmark of Metabolic Syndrome and Diabetes II. According to Dr. Eliaz, regular exercise is also an important component in the prevention of Metabolic Syndrome and Diabetes II, as it allows our cells to be more receptive to circulating blood glucose. Healthy stress relief is also critical since stress hormones such as cortisol cause cells and tissues to release extra glucose into the blood stream. Specific botanicals and nutrients can help control Metabolic Syndrome and Diabetes II by balancing blood sugar, improving insulin sensitivity, boosting metabolism and curbing sugar cravings: If you're struggling with weight gain, sugar cravings, insulin resistance or any metabolic health issues, these natural options can help protect against and even reverse such concerns over time.

e7bfeac4-f43c-4fbb-a745-b4838bd36a3a,"Smartphone fitness apps and wearable activity trackers boost physical activity levels A new study supports smartphone fitness apps and wearable activity trackers at elevating levels of physical activity. In a review that combined data from 35 studies, published this month in the , researchers conclude that the technologies are successful at inducing a small to moderate change in activity levels. The study’s findings suggest that offering wearables and apps on prescription could be beneficial to those at risk of the negative health implications of inactivity, such as cardiovascular disease, certain types of cancer, and more. Fitness Trackers. Image Credit: Syda Productions/Shutterstock.com Around the world, around 1.4 billion adults (over 25% of the adult population) fail to meet daily recommended physical activity levels. These figures are concerning, given that physical inactivity is considered to be a leading cause of death globally, costing health services billions each year. Various studies have linked physical inactivity with numerous serious health implications, including coronary heart disease, depression, types of cancer (such as breast and colon), high blood pressure, stroke, type two diabetes, and obesity. Physical inactivity is also associated with a greater risk of death of any cause. Strategies that aim to target and change behaviors are considered to be among the most effective techniques at increasing physical activity. Smartphone apps and wearable activity trackers incorporate self-monitoring and feedback that are designed to encourage users to be more active. Given the widespread use of smartphones, with roughly half of the word estimated to own one, and activity trackers and fitness apps used by roughly a third of adults in the US and the UK, apps, and fitness trackers offer an opportunity to target a wide segment of the population. However, until now, studies reviewing the efficacy of these apps and trackers at increasing activity levels had produced inconsistent results, nor had they investigated the impact of these strategies on healthy adults. Physical activity in the morning could have a beneficial effect against cancer Physical activity could mitigate some of the menopause symptoms Facemasks do not diminish lung function during physical activity, shows study The new study aimed to fill these gaps in knowledge. To achieve this, a team of researchers reviewed relevant studies published between January 2007 and January 2020 that involved healthy participants aged 18-65 who had no long-term health conditions. A total of 28 studies were selected and included in the meta-analysis, which pooled and analyzed the data of over 7,000 people. The results revealed that use smartphone apps or activity trackers were successful at increasing a person’s average daily step count by 1,850 steps. Further analysis reversed that smartphone apps and activity trackers significantly increased users' general physical activity levels. The results also concluded that certain features were more effective at increasing levels of physical activity, such a text-message prompts tailored features, goal setting, planning, and tasks differentiated by their level of difficulty. The researchers highlight that the data included in their analyses was mainly collected from men, and, therefore, the results may not apply to both genders. In addition, they emphasize that the efficacy of the different techniques ranged from low to moderate, with not all techniques effective at increasing activity to the same level. Using smartphones and fitness trackers to reduce risk of health implications The study’s researchers describe the significance of their findings, “given the wide and increasing reach of smartphones, even modest improvements in physical activity can produce large effects at the population level.” The team also concludes that the results of their study will likely be useful in guiding clinicians treating those with high levels of inactivity. They suggest that prescribing apps and trackers may be beneficial in helping people make necessary behavioral changes to increase their activity level. The impact could be significant in reducing the prevalence of health risks associated with low physical activity levels.

In adults, damaging effects of excess weight are seen when the body mass index exceeds 25 kg/m. A person 5′7″ tall and weighing more than 191 lb would be obese by this standard. SYN: SEE: ; SEE: ; SEE: ; SEE: ; SEE: Obesity is the most common metabolic/nutritional disease in the U.S., with more than 65% of the adult population being overweight. Obesity is more common in women, minorities, and the poor. The obese have an increased risk of developing diabetes mellitus, hypertension, heart disease, stroke, fatal cancers, and other illnesses. Obese people may also suffer psychologically and socially.Obesity is the end result of an imbalance between food eaten and energy expended, but the underlying causes are more complex. Genetic, hormonal, and neurological influences all contribute to weight gain and loss. In addition, some medications (such as tricyclic antidepressants, insulin, and sulfonylurea agents) may cause patients to gain weight.Attempts to lose weight are often unsuccessful, but mild caloric restriction, an increase in physical activity, and supportive therapies all have a role. Medications to enhance weight loss can sometimes produce weight losses of several kilograms. However, some weight loss agents (such as amphetamines or amphetamine-like agents) have unacceptable side effects (such as cardiac valvular injuries with fenfluramine/phentermine, addiction with other anorexiants). Surgical remedies (bariatric surgery) are available for some patients and can result in sustained weight loss, but such surgery involves significant morbidity and a 1% to 2% risk of death in the perioperative period.Caloric intake should be less than maintenance requirements, but all essential nutrients must be included in any weight-loss regimen. Severe caloric restriction is unhealthy and should be avoided unless undertaken under strict supervision. For many patients of average size and activity, consumption of 1200 to 1600 calories a day will result in gradual loss of weight. Most fad diets provide temporary results at best.Dietary changes should be accompanied by a complementary program of regular exercise. Exercise improves adherence to weight loss diets and consumes stored fat. For many people 35 minutes of low-level exercise performed daily (either in one long workout session or in several shorter intermittent sessions) will aid weight loss and improve other cardiovascular risk factors. Exercise programs may be hazardous for some patients; professional supervision may be recommended for some people who start an exercise program, e.g., people with a history of heart or lung disease, arthritis, or diabetes mellitus.The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force and other promoters of public health recommend that clinicians screen all adults for obesity and offer incentive behavioral counseling to obese adults. Patients who are overweight should be screened for conditions worsened by obesity, e.g., hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia. Health care professionals can aid patients in making permanent life-style changes by discussing diet and exercise, being familiar with various eating plans, and by providing patients with a list of local weight loss centers. The patient's feelings about weight and body image should be explored to understand the individual's motivations. People who diet and exercise for health reasons tend to be the most successful. Family support is also important.2. A condition in which an individual accumulates abnormal or excessive fat for age and gender that exceeds overweight.

In adults, damaging effects of excess weight are seen when the body mass index exceeds 25 kg/m. A person 5′7″ tall and weighing more than 191 lb would be obese by this standard. SYN: SEE: ; SEE: ; SEE: ; SEE: ; SEE: Obesity is the most common metabolic/nutritional disease in the U.S., with more than 65% of the adult population being overweight. Obesity is more common in women, minorities, and the poor. The obese have an increased risk of developing diabetes mellitus, hypertension, heart disease, stroke, fatal cancers, and other illnesses. Obese people may also suffer psychologically and socially.Obesity is the end result of an imbalance between food eaten and energy expended, but the underlying causes are more complex. Genetic, hormonal, and neurological influences all contribute to weight gain and loss. In addition, some medications (such as tricyclic antidepressants, insulin, and sulfonylurea agents) may cause patients to gain weight.Attempts to lose weight are often unsuccessful, but mild caloric restriction, an increase in physical activity, and supportive therapies all have a role. Medications to enhance weight loss can sometimes produce weight losses of several kilograms. However, some weight loss agents (such as amphetamines or amphetamine-like agents) have unacceptable side effects (such as cardiac valvular injuries with fenfluramine/phentermine, addiction with other anorexiants). Surgical remedies (bariatric surgery) are available for some patients and can result in sustained weight loss, but such surgery involves significant morbidity and a 1% to 2% risk of death in the perioperative period.Caloric intake should be less than maintenance requirements, but all essential nutrients must be included in any weight-loss regimen. Severe caloric restriction is unhealthy and should be avoided unless undertaken under strict supervision. For many patients of average size and activity, consumption of 1200 to 1600 calories a day will result in gradual loss of weight. Most fad diets provide temporary results at best.Dietary changes should be accompanied by a complementary program of regular exercise. Exercise improves adherence to weight loss diets and consumes stored fat. For many people 35 minutes of low-level exercise performed daily (either in one long workout session or in several shorter intermittent sessions) will aid weight loss and improve other cardiovascular risk factors. Exercise programs may be hazardous for some patients; professional supervision may be recommended for some people who start an exercise program, e.g., people with a history of heart or lung disease, arthritis, or diabetes mellitus.The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force and other promoters of public health recommend that clinicians screen all adults for obesity and offer incentive behavioral counseling to obese adults. Patients who are overweight should be screened for conditions worsened by obesity, e.g., hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia. Health care professionals can aid patients in making permanent life-style changes by discussing diet and exercise, being familiar with various eating plans, and by providing patients with a list of local weight loss centers. The patient's feelings about weight and body image should be explored to understand the individual's motivations. People who diet and exercise for health reasons tend to be the most successful. Family support is also important.2. A condition in which an individual accumulates abnormal or excessive fat for age and gender that exceeds overweight.

5108beb9-9cd5-4c58-b525-10a5cfe14f5d,"1. An agitated, confused female client arrives in the emergency department. Her history includes type 1 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and angina pectoris. Assessment reveals pallor, diaphoresis, headache, and intense hunger. A stat blood glucose sample measures 42 mg/dl, and the client is treated for an acute hypoglycemic reaction. After recovery, nurse Lily teaches the client to treat hypoglycemia by ingesting:a. 2 to 5 g of a simple carbohydrate.b. 10 to 15 g of a simple carbohydrate.c. 18 to 20 g of a simple carbohydrate.d. 25 to 30 g of a simple carbohydrate. B. To reverse hypoglycemia, the American Diabetes Association recommends ingesting 10 to 15 g of a simple carbohydrate, such as three to five pieces of hard candy, two to three packets of sugar (4 to 6 tsp), or 4 oz of fruit juice. If necessary, this treatment can be repeated in 15 minutes. Ingesting only 2 to 5 g of a simple carbohydrate may not raise the blood glucose level sufficiently. Ingesting more than 15 g may raise it above normal, causing hyperglycemia. 2. A female adult client with a history of chronic hyperparathyroidism admits to being noncompliant. Based on initial assessment findings, nurse Julia formulates the nursing diagnosis of Risk for injury. To complete the nursing diagnosis statement for this client, which ""related-to"" phrase should the nurse add?a. Related to bone demineralization resulting in pathologic fracturesb. Related to exhaustion secondary to an accelerated metabolic ratec. Related to edema and dry skin secondary to fluid infiltration into the interstitial spacesd. Related to tetany secondary to a decreased serum calcium level A. Poorly controlled hyperparathyroidism may cause an elevated serum calcium level. This, in turn, may diminish calcium stores in the bone, causing bone demineralization and setting the stage for pathologic fractures and a risk for injury. Hyperparathyroidism doesn't accelerate the metabolic rate. A decreased thyroid hormone level, not an increased parathyroid hormone level, may cause edema and dry skin secondary to fluid infiltration into the interstitial spaces. Hyperparathyroidism causes hypercalcemia, not hypocalcemia; therefore, it isn't associated with tetany. 3. Nurse John is assigned to care for a postoperative male client who has diabetes mellitus. During the assessment interview, the client reports that he's impotent and says he's concerned about its effect on his marriage. In planning this client's care, the most appropriate intervention would be to:a. Encourage the client to ask questions about personal sexuality.b. Provide time for privacy.c. Provide support for the spouse or significant other.d. Suggest referral to a sex counselor or other appropriate professional. D. The nurse should refer this client to a sex counselor or other professional. Making appropriate referrals is a valid part of planning the client's care. The nurse doesn't normally provide sex counseling. 4. During a class on exercise for diabetic clients, a female client asks the nurse educator how often to exercise. The nurse educator advises the clients to exercise how often to meet the goals of planned exercise?a. At least once a weekb. At least three times a weekc. At least five times a weekd. Every day B. Diabetic clients must exercise at least three times a week to meet the goals of planned exercise — lowering the blood glucose level, reducing or maintaining the proper weight, increasing the serum high-density lipoprotein level, decreasing serum triglyceride levels, reducing blood pressure, and minimizing stress. Exercising once a week wouldn't achieve these goals. Exercising more than three times a week, although beneficial, would exceed the minimum requirement. 5. Nurse Oliver should expect a client with hypothyroidism to report which health concerns?a. Increased appetite and weight lossb. Puffiness of the face and handsc. Nervousness and tremorsd. Thyroid gland swelling B. Hypothyroidism (myxedema) causes facial puffiness, extremity edema, and weight gain. Signs and symptoms of hyperthyroidism (Graves' disease) include an increased appetite, weight loss, nervousness, tremors, and thyroid gland enlargement (goiter). 6. A female client with hypothyroidism (myxedema) is receiving levothyroxine (Synthroid), 25 mcg P.O. daily. Which finding should nurse Hans recognize as an adverse drug effect?a. Dysuriab. Leg crampsc. Tachycardiad. Blurred vision C. Levothyroxine, a synthetic thyroid hormone, is given to a client with hypothyroidism to simulate the effects of thyroxine. Adverse effects of this agent include tachycardia. The other options aren't associated with levothyroxine. 7. A 67-year-old male client has been complaining of sleeping more, increased urination, anorexia, weakness, irritability, depression, and bone pain that interferes with her going outdoors. Based on these assessment findings, nurse Richard would suspect which of the following disorders?a. Diabetes mellitusb. Diabetes insipidusc. Hypoparathyroidismd. Hyperparathyroidism D. Hyperparathyroidism is most common in older women and is characterized by bone pain and weakness from excess parathyroid hormone (PTH). Clients also exhibit hypercaliuria-causing polyuria. While clients with diabetes mellitus and diabetes insipidus also have polyuria, they don't have bone pain and increased sleeping. Hypoparathyroidism is characterized by urinary frequency rather than polyuria. 8. When caring for a male client with diabetes insipidus, nurse Juliet expects to administer:a. vasopressin (Pitressin Synthetic).b. furosemide (Lasix).c. regular insulin.d. 10% dextrose. A. Because diabetes insipidus results from decreased antidiuretic hormone (vasopressin) production, the nurse should expect to administer synthetic vasopressin for hormone replacement therapy. Furosemide, a diuretic, is contraindicated because a client with diabetes insipidus experiences polyuria. Insulin and dextrose are used to treat diabetes mellitus and its complications, not diabetes insipidus. 9. The nurse is aware that the following is the most common cause of hyperaldosteronism?a. Excessive sodium intakeb. A pituitary adenomac. Deficient potassium intaked. An adrenal adenoma D. An autonomous aldosterone-producing adenoma is the most common cause of hyperaldosteronism. Hyperplasia is the second most frequent cause. Aldosterone secretion is independent of sodium and potassium intake as well as of pituitary stimulation. 10. A male client with type 1 diabetes mellitus has a highly elevated glycosylated hemoglobin (Hb) test result. In discussing the result with the client, nurse Sharmaine would be most accurate in stating:a. ""The test needs to be repeated following a 12-hour fast.""b. ""It looks like you aren't following the prescribed diabetic diet.""c. ""It tells us about your sugar control for the last 3 months.""d. ""Your insulin regimen needs to be altered significantly."" C. The glycosylated Hb test provides an objective measure of glycemic control over a 3-month period. The test helps identify trends or practices that impair glycemic control, and it doesn't require a fasting period before blood is drawn. The nurse can't conclude that the result occurs from poor dietary management or inadequate insulin coverage. 11. Following a unilateral adrenalectomy, nurse Betty would assess for hyperkalemia shown by which of the following?a. Muscle weaknessb. Tremorsc. Diaphoresisd. Constipation A. Muscle weakness, bradycardia, nausea, diarrhea, and paresthesia of the hands, feet, tongue, and face are findings associated with hyperkalemia, which is transient and occurs from transient hypoaldosteronism when the adenoma is removed. Tremors, diaphoresis, and constipation aren't seen in hyperkalemia. 12. Nurse Louie is developing a teaching plan for a male client diagnosed with diabetes insipidus. The nurse should include information about which hormone lacking in clients with diabetes insipidus?a. antidiuretic hormone (ADH).b. thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH).c. follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH).d. luteinizing hormone (LH). A. ADH is the hormone clients with diabetes insipidus lack. The client's TSH, FSH, and LH levels won't be affected. 13. Early this morning, a female client had a subtotal thyroidectomy. During evening rounds, nurse Tina assesses the client, who now has nausea, a temperature of 105° F (40.5° C), tachycardia, and extreme restlessness. What is the most likely cause of these signs?a. Diabetic ketoacidosisb. Thyroid crisisc. Hypoglycemiad. Tetany B. Thyroid crisis usually occurs in the first 12 hours after thyroidectomy and causes exaggerated signs of hyperthyroidism, such as high fever, tachycardia, and extreme restlessness. Diabetic ketoacidosis is more likely to produce polyuria, polydipsia, and polyphagia; hypoglycemia, to produce weakness, tremors, profuse perspiration, and hunger. Tetany typically causes uncontrollable muscle spasms, stridor, cyanosis, and possibly asphyxia. 14. For a male client with hyperglycemia, which assessment finding best supports a nursing diagnosis of Deficient fluid volume?a. Cool, clammy skinb. Distended neck veinsc. Increased urine osmolarityd. Decreased serum sodium level C. In hyperglycemia, urine osmolarity (the measurement of dissolved particles in the urine) increases as glucose particles move into the urine. The client experiences glucosuria and polyuria, losing body fluids and experiencing fluid volume deficit. Cool, clammy skin; distended neck veins; and a decreased serum sodium level are signs of fluid volume excess, the opposite imbalance. 15. When assessing a male client with pheochromocytoma, a tumor of the adrenal medulla that secretes excessive catecholamine, nurse April is most likely to detect:a. a blood pressure of 130/70 mm Hg.b. a blood glucose level of 130 mg/dl.c. bradycardia.d. a blood pressure of 176/88 mm Hg. D. Pheochromocytoma, a tumor of the adrenal medulla that secretes excessive catecholamine, causes hypertension, tachycardia, hyperglycemia, hypermetabolism, and weight loss. It isn't associated with the other options. 16. A male client is admitted for treatment of the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH). Which nursing intervention is appropriate?a. Infusing I.V. fluids rapidly as orderedb. Encouraging increased oral intakec. Restricting fluidsd. Administering glucose-containing I.V. fluids as ordered C. To reduce water retention in a client with the SIADH, the nurse should restrict fluids. Administering fluids by any route would further increase the client's already heightened fluid load. 17. A female client has a serum calcium level of 7.2 mg/dl. During the physical examination, nurse Noah expects to assess:a. Trousseau's sign.b. Homans' sign.c. Hegar's sign.d. Goodell's sign. A. This client's serum calcium level indicates hypocalcemia, an electrolyte imbalance that causes Trousseau's sign (carpopedal spasm induced by inflating the blood pressure cuff above systolic pressure). Homans' sign (pain on dorsiflexion of the foot) indicates deep vein thrombosis. Hegar's sign (softening of the uterine isthmus) and Goodell's sign (cervical softening) are probable signs of pregnancy. 18. Which outcome indicates that treatment of a male client with diabetes insipidus has been effective?a. Fluid intake is less than 2,500 ml/day.b. Urine output measures more than 200 ml/hour.c. Blood pressure is 90/50 mm Hg.d. The heart rate is 126 beats/minute. A. Diabetes insipidus is characterized by polyuria (up to 8 L/day), constant thirst, and an unusually high oral intake of fluids. Treatment with the appropriate drug should decrease both oral fluid intake and urine output. A urine output of 200 ml/hour indicates continuing polyuria. A blood pressure of 90/50 mm Hg and a heart rate of 126 beats/minute indicate compensation for the continued fluid deficit, suggesting that treatment hasn't been effective. 19. Jemma, who weighs 210 lb (95 kg) and has been diagnosed with hyperglycemia tells the nurse that her husband sleeps in another room because her snoring keeps him awake. The nurse notices that she has large hands and a hoarse voice. Which of the following would the nurse suspect as a possible cause of the client's hyperglycemia?a. Acromegalyb. Type 1 diabetes mellitusc. Hypothyroidismd. Deficient growth hormone A. Acromegaly, which is caused by a pituitary tumor that releases excessive growth hormone, is associated with hyperglycemia, hypertension, diaphoresis, peripheral neuropathy, and joint pain. Enlarged hands and feet are related to lateral bone growth, which is seen in adults with this disorder. The accompanying soft tissue swelling causes hoarseness and often sleep apnea. Type 1 diabetes is usually seen in children, and newly diagnosed persons are usually very ill and thin. Hypothyroidism isn't associated with hyperglycemia, nor is growth hormone deficiency. 20. Nurse Kate is providing dietary instructions to a male client with hypoglycemia. To control hypoglycemic episodes, the nurse should recommend:a. Increasing saturated fat intake and fasting in the afternoon.b. Increasing intake of vitamins B and D and taking iron supplements.c. Eating a candy bar if light-headedness occurs.d. Consuming a low-carbohydrate, high-protein diet and avoiding fasting. D. To control hypoglycemic episodes, the nurse should instruct the client to consume a low-carbohydrate, high-protein diet, avoid fasting, and avoid simple sugars. Increasing saturated fat intake and increasing vitamin supplementation wouldn't help control hypoglycemia. 21. An incoherent female client with a history of hypothyroidism is brought to the emergency department by the rescue squad. Physical and laboratory findings reveal hypothermia, hypoventilation, respiratory acidosis, bradycardia, hypotension, and nonpitting edema of the face and pretibial area. Knowing that these findings suggest severe hypothyroidism, nurse Libby prepares to take emergency action to prevent the potential complication of:a. Thyroid storm.b. Cretinism.c. myxedema coma.d. Hashimoto's thyroiditis. C. Severe hypothyroidism may result in myxedema coma, in which a drastic drop in the metabolic rate causes decreased vital signs, hypoventilation (possibly leading to respiratory acidosis), and nonpitting edema. Thyroid storm is an acute complication of hyperthyroidism. Cretinism is a form of hypothyroidism that occurs in infants. Hashimoto's thyroiditis is a common chronic inflammatory disease of the thyroid gland in which autoimmune factors play a prominent role. 22. A male client with type 1 diabetes mellitus asks the nurse about taking an oral antidiabetic agent. Nurse Jack explains that these medications are only effective if the client:a. prefers to take insulin orally.b. has type 2 diabetes.c. has type 1 diabetes.d. is pregnant and has type 2 diabetes. B. Oral antidiabetic agents are only effective in adult clients with type 2 diabetes. Oral antidiabetic agents aren't effective in type 1 diabetes. Pregnant and lactating women aren't prescribed oral antidiabetic agents because the effect on the fetus is uncertain. 23. When caring for a female client with a history of hypoglycemia, nurse Ruby should avoid administering a drug that may potentiate hypoglycemia. Which drug fits this description?a. sulfisoxazole (Gantrisin)b. mexiletine (Mexitil)c. prednisone (Orasone)d. lithium carbonate (Lithobid) A. Sulfisoxazole and other sulfonamides are chemically related to oral antidiabetic agents and may precipitate hypoglycemia. Mexiletine, an antiarrhythmic, is used to treat refractory ventricular arrhythmias; it doesn't cause hypoglycemia. Prednisone, a corticosteroid, is associated with hyperglycemia. Lithium may cause transient hyperglycemia, not hypoglycemia. 24. After taking glipizide (Glucotrol) for 9 months, a male client experiences secondary failure. Which of the following would the nurse expect the physician to do?a. Initiate insulin therapy.b. Switch the client to a different oral antidiabetic agent.c. Prescribe an additional oral antidiabetic agent.d. Restrict carbohydrate intake to less than 30% of the total caloric intake. B. Many clients (25% to 60%) with secondary failure respond to a different oral antidiabetic agent. Therefore, it wouldn't be appropriate to initiate insulin therapy at this time. However, if a new oral antidiabetic agent is unsuccessful in keeping glucose levels at an acceptable level, insulin may be used in addition to the antidiabetic agent. 25. During preoperative teaching for a female client who will undergo subtotal thyroidectomy, the nurse should include which statement?a. ""The head of your bed must remain flat for 24 hours after surgery.""b. ""You should avoid deep breathing and coughing after surgery.""c. ""You won't be able to swallow for the first day or two.""d. ""You must avoid hyperextending your neck after surgery."" D.To prevent undue pressure on the surgical incision after subtotal thyroidectomy, the nurse should advise the client to avoid hyperextending the neck. The client may elevate the head of the bed as desired and should perform deep breathing and coughing to help prevent pneumonia. Subtotal thyroidectomy doesn't affect swallowing. What is a hormone secreted from the posterior lobe of the pituitary gland? Answers:A. LH B. MSH C. ADH D. GnRH . CADH is secreted from the posterior pituitary. LH comes from the anterior pituitary, MSH from the intermediate. GnRH is released from the hypothalamus. An indication of Chvostek' sign is: Answers:A. Twitching of the lips after tapping the face B. Elevated blood sugar after glucose infusion C. Inability to hold one's arms straight D. Spasms of the hand after blood circulation is cut off . ATwitching of the lips after tapping the face in the right place is an indication of Chvostek's sign and a sign of hypocalcaemia. Spasms of the hand are associated with Trousseau's sign. A 26 year old female client presents with the symptom of unwanted facial hair. What of the following conditions is most likely? Answers:A. Graves' disease B. PCOS C. Hyperthyroidism D. Addison's disease BPCOS is well known to cause hormonal irregularities in women which can result in hair growth. In explaining the condition to a client, a nurse would say that Cushing's syndrome is caused primarily by: Answers:A. Low levels of glucocorticoidsB. Excess secretion of sodium C. Autoimmunity in the pancreasD. Elevated levels of cortisol DCushing's syndrome is caused by elevated levels of cortisol. Glucocorticoids tend to cause this. Which of the following symptoms is not typical of Cushing's syndrome? Answers:A. Osteoporosis B. Weight loss C. Diabetes D. Mood instability BCushing's syndrome tends to produce rapid weight gain, not weight loss. Which of the following would be an indication of Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome? Answers:A. A 33 year old woman with a karyotype of XY B. A 16 year old male with reduced kidney functionC. Failure to respond to cortisol therapyD. Several pregnancies all of which ended in miscarriages AAndrogen Insensitivity Syndrome is when the body does not respond to androgens such as testosterone. This can result in genetic males being born with the appearance of women. A client presents with hypocalcemia, hyperphosphatemia, muscle cramps, and positive Trosseau's sign. What diagnosis does this support? Answers:A. Diabetes insipidus B. Conn's syndrome C. Hypoparathyroidism D. Acromegaly CHypoparathyroidism often leads to the symptoms mentioned. Conn's syndrome is an aldosterone-producing adenoma. A client with Graves' disease experiences a thyroid storm and has tachycardia and hypertension. What medication is most likely to be used? Answers:A. Levofloxcin B. Chlorothiazide C. Percocet D. Propylthiouracil . DPropylthiouracil is a commonly used medication for treating hyperthyroidism. Levofloxacin is an antibiotic, chlorothiazide is a diuretic, and Percocet a painkiller. Which of the following statements by a client with Type II Diabetes indicates the need for further education? Answers:A. I should avoid hot tubs B. I should aim for an HbA1C level of 5.5% C. I may need insulin at times D. My life expectancy is likely reduced by 10 years . BWhile an HbA1C level of 5.5% would be below the threshold for diabetes, it is an unrealistic target. Data has shown that trying to lower the HbA1C level too much can lead to an increase in complications. In educating a client, the nurse is likely to explain the following is the cause of Hashimoto's disease: Answers:A. Antibodies attacking the thyroid gland B. Inflammation in the kidneys C. An adenocarcinoma in the brain D. Overactivation of the pituitary gland AHashimoto's disease is caused by autoimmunity to the thyroid gland, often involving antibodies. Acromegaly is most frequently diagnosed in: a. Middle-aged adultsb. Newbornsc. Children ages 2 to 5d. Adults age 65 and older . A: Acromegaly results from benign tumors on the pituitary gland that produce excessive amounts of growth hormone. Although symptoms may present at any age, the diagnosis generally occurs in middle-aged persons. Untreated, the consequences of acromegaly include 2. Grave's disease is: a. The most common cause of hypothyroidismb. The most common cause of hyperparathyroidismc. The most common cause of hyperthyroidismd. The most common cause of adrenal insufficiency type 2 diabetes, hypertension and increased risk of cardiovascular disease, arthritis and colon polyps. 2. C: Grave's disease is an autoimmune disorder characterized by an enlarged thyroid gland and overproduction of thyroid hormones producing symptoms of hyperthyroidism such as rapid heartbeat, heat intolerance, agitation or irritability, weight loss, and trouble sleeping. It usually presents in persons age 20 to 40 and it is much more common in women than in men. 3. Symptoms of Grave's ophthalmopathy include all of the following except: a. Bulging eyeballsb. Dry, irritated eyes and puffy eyelidsc. Cataracts d. Light sensitivity 3. C: Grave's ophthalmopathy is an inflammation of tissue behind the eye causing the eyeballs to bulge. In addition to the above-mentioned symptoms, Grave's ophthalmopathy may cause pressure or pain in the eyes, double vision, and trouble moving the eyes. About one-quarter of persons with Grave's disease develop Grave's ophthalmopathy. The condition is frequently self-limiting, resolving without treatment over the course of a year or two. 4. An ACTH stimulation test is commonly used to diagnose: a. Grave's diseaseb. Adrenal insufficiency and Addison's diseasec. Cystic fibrosisd. Hashimoto's disease 4. B: The ACTH stimulation test measures blood and urine cortisol before and after injection of ACTH. Persons with chronic adrenal insufficiency or Addison's disease generally do not respond with the expected increase in cortisol levels. An abnormal ACTH stimulation test may be followed with a CRH stimulation test to pinpoint the cause of adrenal insufficiency. 5. All of the following are symptoms of Cushing's syndrome except: a. Severe fatigue and weaknessb. Hypertension and elevated blood glucosec. A protruding hump between the shouldersd. Hair loss 5. D: Cushing's syndrome also may cause fragile, thin skin prone to bruises and stretch marks on the abdomen and thighs as well as excessive thirst and urination and mood changes such as depression and anxiety. Women who suffer from high levels of cortisol often have irregular menstrual cycles or amenorrhea and present with hair on their faces, necks, chests, abdomens, and thighs. 6. Which of the following conditions is caused by long-term exposure to high levels of cortisol? a. Addison's diseaseb. Crohn's diseasec. Adrenal insufficiencyd. Cushing's syndrome 6. D: Cushing's syndrome is a form of hypercortisolism. Risk factors for Cushing's syndrome are obesity, diabetes, and hypertension. Cushing's syndrome is most frequently diagnosed in persons ages 20 to 50 who have characteristic round faces, upper body obesity, large necks, and relatively thin limbs. 7. A ""sweat test"" or newborn screening may be used to detect: a. Cystic fibrosisb. Adrenal insufficiencyc. Grave's diseased. Hypothyroidism 7. A: Cystic fibrosis is the most common inherited fatal disease of children and young adults in the United States. Cystic fibrosis is usually diagnosed by the time an affected child is three years old. Often, the only signs are a persistent cough, a large appetite but poor weight gain, an extremely salty taste to the skin, and large, foul-smelling bowel movements. A simple sweat test is currently the standard diagnostic test. The test measures the amount of salt in the sweat; abnormally high levels are the hallmark of the disorder. 8. Hashimoto's disease is: a. Chronic inflammation of the thyroid glandb. Diagnosed most frequently in Asian-Americans and Pacific Islandersc. A form of hyperthyroidismd. A rare form of hypothyroidism 8. A: Hashimoto's disease is the most common cause of hypothyroidism. It is an autoimmune disease that produces chronic inflammation of the thyroid gland. More women are affected than men and it is generally diagnosed in persons ages 40 to 60. When treatment is indicated, synthetic T4 is administered. 9. Persons at increased risk of developing Hashimoto's disease include all of the following except: a. Persons with vitiligob. Asian-Americansc. Persons with rheumatoid arthritisd. Persons with Addison's disease 9. B: Along with the above-mentioned groups, persons with type 1 diabetes and persons suffering from pernicious anemia (insufficient vitamin b12) are at increased risk of developing Hashimoto's disease. Because it tends to run in families, there is likely a genetic susceptibility as well. Environmental factors such as excessive iodine consumption and selected drugs also have been implicated as potential risk factors. 10. All of the following statements about Hashimoto's disease are true except: a. Many patients are entirely asymptomaticb. Not all patients become hypothyroidc. Most cases of obesity are attributable to Hashimoto's diseased. Hypothyroidism may be subclinical 10. C: Although weight gain may be a symptom of Hashimoto's disease, the majority of obese people have normal thyroid function; rarely is thyroid disorder the sole cause of obesity. Other symptoms of Hashimoto's disease include fatigue, cold intolerance, joint pain, myalgias, constipation, dry hair, skin and nails, impaired fertility, slow heart rate, and depression. 11. The most common benign tumor of the pituitary gland is a: a. Gliomab Prolactinomac. Carcinoid tumord. Islet cell tumor 11. B: Prolactinomas can cause symptoms by releasing excessive amounts of prolactin into the blood or mechanically by pressing on surrounding tissues. In women, symptoms may include menstrual irregularities and infertility; in men erectile dysfunction and libido may be impaired. 12. Symptoms of polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) may include all of the following except: a. Pelvic painb. Acne, oily skin, and dandruffc. Infertilityd. Weight Loss 12. D: In addition to the above-mentioned symptoms, PCOS may cause menstrual irregularities, thinning hair or male-pattern baldness, thick skin or dark patches of skin and excessive hair growth on the face, chest, abdomen, thumbs and toes. 13. Women with PCOS are at increased risk for all of the following except: a. Pregnancy b. Diabetesc. Cardiovascular diseased. Metabolic syndrome 13. A: Women with PCOS produce excessive amounts of androgens and do not release ova during ovulation, which seriously compromises their ability to conceive. Although women with PCOS can become pregnant, often by using assistive reproductive technology, they are at increased risk for miscarriage. 14. All of the following organs may be affected by multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 except: a. Parathyroid glandsb. Kidneysc. Pancreas and Duodenumd. Pituitary gland 14. B: Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1, also known as Werner's syndrome, is a heritable disorder that causes tumors in endocrine glands and the duodenum. Although the tumors associated with multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 are generally benign, they can produce symptoms chemically by releasing excessive amounts of hormones or mechanically by pressing on adjacent tissue. 15. What is the treatment for hyperparathyroidism? a. Synthetic thyroid hormoneb. Desiccated thyroid hormonec. Surgical removal of the glandsd. Calcium and phosphate 15. C: When hyperparathyroidism requires treatment, surgery is the treatment of choice and is considered curative for 95% of cases. Because untreated hyperparathyroidism may elevate blood and urine levels of calcium and deplete phosphorus, bones and teeth may lose the minerals needed to remain strong. 16. The most common causes of death in people with cystic fibrosis is: a. Dehydrationb. Opportunistic infectionc. Lung cancerd. Respiratory failure 16. D: Declining pulmonary function is a hallmark of cystic fibrosis. Drugs such as Pulmozyme (dornase alfa) and Zithromax (azithromycin) can slow the progression of lung disease and mechanical physical therapy devices help CF patients to breathe more easily by loosening and dislodging mucus. For some patients with severe lung damage, lung transplantation is a treatment option. 17. Untreated hyperthyroidism during pregnancy may result in all of the following except: a. Premature birth and miscarriageb. Low birthweightc. Autismd. Preeclampsia 17. C: In addition to the above-mentioned complications of uncontrolled hyperthyroidism in pregnancy, expectant mothers may suffer congestive heart failure and thyroid storm, which is life-threatening thyrotoxicosis with symptoms that include agitation, confusion, tachycardia, shaking, sweating, diarrhea, fever, and restlessness. 18. Short stature and undeveloped ovaries suggest which of the following disorders: a. Polycystic ovarian syndromeb. Prolactinomac. Grave's diseased. Turner syndrome 18. D: Turner syndrome results from a chromosomal abnormality and occurs in an estimated 1 in 2,500 female births. It occurs more frequently in preterm pregnancies. Affected women are shorter than average and are infertile because they lack ovarian function. They also may have webbed necks, broad chests, arms that turn out from the elbow, lymphedema of the hands and feet and skeletal, cardiac, and renal problems. 19. Endocrine disorders may be triggered by all of the following except: a. Stressb. Infectionc. Chemicals in the food chain and environmentd. Cell phone use 19. D: Endocrine function may be influenced by myriad factors. In addition to the above-mentioned, there is evidence that exposure to naturally occurring and man-made endocrine disruptors such as tributyltin, certain bioaccumulating chlorinated compounds, and phytoestrogens is widespread and in susceptible individuals, may trigger endocrine disorders. 20. An analysis of data from the Women's Health Initiative questioned the use of which therapy to prevent heart disease? a. Synthetic thyroid hormoneb. Oral contraceptivesc. Weight-loss drugsd. Postmenopausal hormone replacement therapy 20. D: The results of the Women's Health Initiative study prompted the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to advise against using hormone therapy (estrogen-alone or estrogen-plus-progestin) to prevent heart disease. When hormone replacement therapy is used to treat moderate to severe hot flashes and symptoms of vulvar and vaginal atrophy it should used at the lowest doses for the shortest duration needed to achieve treatment objectives. The parathyroid glands play a major role in regulating which substances?A. Calcium and PhosphorusB. Cholride and potassiumC. Potassium and calciumD. Sodium and potassium a. Calcium and Phosphorus The primary function of insuln is to:A. Lower blood glucose levelsB. Produce melaninC. regulate the bodys metabolic rateD. stimulate release of digestive enzymes a client is admitted to the hospital with a medical DX of hyerthyroidism. When taking a history which information would be most significant?A. edema, intolerance to cold, lethargyb. peri-orbital edema, lethargy mask like facec. weight loss, intolerance to cold, muscle wastingd. weight loss, intolerance to heat, exophthalmos Which nursing action is most appropriate for a client in ketoacidosis?a. admin of carbsb. admin of IV fluidsc. applying cold compressd. giving glucagon IV The nurse smells a sweet fruity odor on the breath of a client admitted with DM. This odor may be associated with?a. alcohol intoxicationb. insulin shockc. ketoacidosis A client asks what the purpose of the Hb A1c test is. The nurses best explanation would be that the test measures the average:a. blood sugar lvl's over a 6-10 week periodb. hemoglobin lvl's over a 6 - 10 week periodc. protien lvl over a 3 month periodd. vanillylmandelic acid lvl's which of the following would be a nursing priority for a client just DX with Addison's disease?a. avioding unnecessary activityb. encouraging client to wear a med alert tagc. ensuring the client is adequatly hydratedd. explaining that the client will need life long hormone therapy A nurse is caring for a client in the late stage of Ketoacidosis. The nurse notices that the clients breath has a characteristic fruity odor. Which of the following substances is responsible for the fruity smell in the breath?a. iodineb. acetonec.alcohold. glucose A nurse is caring for a client with Addison's disease. Which of the following mursing considerations shoul dbe employed when caring for this client?a. avoid sodium in the clients dietb. monitor and protect skin integrityc. document the specific gravity of urined. monitor increases in blood pressure A nurse is assigned to care for and monitor any complications in a 40 yr client with chronic diabetes. Which of the following is a macrovascular complication of diabetes.a. neuropathyb. retinopathyc. nephropathyd. Arteriosclerosis A nurse is instructing a 50yr diabetic client about the steps to be followed for self admin of insulin. Which of the following instructions should be included in te client teaching?a. instruct client to aviod injections to the abdomenb. encourage client to always inject insulin in the same sitec. inform client about the type of syringe to used. encourage client to do active exercise after injection A nurse is preparing a diet plan for a 50yr with simple goiter. Which of the following should be included in teh clients diet to decrease the enlargement of he thyroid gland?a. iodineb. sodiumc. potassiumd. calcium A nurse is caring for a 60yr client affected with hypoparathyroidism. When checking the lab report, the nurse finds tht the clients calcium lvl was very low. Which of the following vitamins regulates teh calcium lvl in the body?a. Ab. Dc. Ed. K A client presents to the emergency room with a history of Graves' disease. The client reports having symptoms for a few days, but has not previously sought or received any additional treatment. The client also reports having had a cold a few days back. Which of the following interventions would be appropriate to implement for this client, based on the history and current symptoms? Select all that apply. Administer aspirin Replace intravenous fluids Induce shivering Relieve respiratory distress Administer a cooling blanket Replace intravenous fluids Induce shivering Relieve respiratory distress Administer a cooling blanket Rationale: Thyroid storm (also called thyroid crisis) is an extreme state of hyperthyroidism that is rare today because of improved diagnosis and treatment methods (Porth, 2005). When it does occur, those affected are usually people with untreated hyperthyroidism (most often Graves' disease) and people with hyperthyroidism who have experienced a stressor, such as an infection, trauma. The rapid increase in metabolic rate that results from the excessive TH causes the manifestations of thyroid storm. The manifestations include hyperthermia, with body temperatures ranging from 102°F (39°C) to 106°F (41°C); tachycardia; systolic hypertension; and gastrointestinal symptoms (abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea). Agitation, restlessness, and tremors are common, progressing to confusion, psychosis, delirium, and seizures. The mortality rate is high. Rapid treatment of thyroid storm is essential to preserve life. Treatment includes cooling without aspirin (which increases free TH) or inducing shivering, replacing fluids, glucose, and electrolytes, relieving respiratory distress, stabilizing cardiovascular function, and reducing TH synthesis and secretion. #1 is incorrect because cooling happens without the use of aspirin. All of the other choices are correct. A nursing student is studying for a test on care of the client with endocrine disorders. Which of the following statements demonstrates an understanding of the difference between hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism? ""Deficient amounts of TH cause abnormalities in lipid metabolism, with decreased serum cholesterol and triglyceride levels."" ""Graves' disease is the most common cause of hypothyroidism."" ""Decreased renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate reduces the kidney's ability to excrete water, which may cause hyponatremia."" ""Increased amounts of TH cause a decrease in cardiac output and peripheral blood flow."" Correct Answer: ""Decreased renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate reduces the kidney's ability to excrete water, which may cause hyponatremia."" Rationale: # 1 is incorrect because deficient amounts of TH cause abnormalities in lipid metabolism with elevated serum cholesterol and triglyceride levels. # 2 is incorrect because Graves' disease is the most common cause of hyperthyroidism, not hypothyroidism. # 4 is incorrect because increased amounts of TH cause an increase in cardiac output and peripheral blood flow. A Clinical Instructor is questioning a student nurse about disorders of the parathyroid glands. Which statement by the nursing student, would indicate the need for further teaching? ""Hyperparathyroidism results in an increased release of calcium and phosphorus by bones, with resultant bone decalcification."" ""Hyperparathyroidism results in deposits in soft tissues and the formation of renal calculi."" ""Hypoparathyroidism results in impaired renal tubular regulation of calcium and phosphate."" ""Hypoparathyroidism results in decreased activation of vitamin D which then results in decreased absorption of calcium by the pancreas."" ""Hypoparathyroidism results in decreased activation of vitamin D which then results in decreased absorption of calcium by the pancreas."" Rationale: Choices 1, 2, and 3 are all correct statements. # 4 demonstrates a need for further teaching because hypoparathyroidism results in decreased activation of vitamin D which then results in decreased absorption of calcium by the intestines, not the pancreas. A nurse on a general medical-surgical unit is caring for a client with Cushing's syndrome. Which of the following statements is correct about the medication regimen for Cushing's syndrome? Mitotane is used to treat metastatic adrenal cancer. Aminogluthimide may be administered to clients with ectopic ACTH-secreting tumors before surgery is performed. Ketoconazole increases cortisol synthesis by the adrenal cortex. Somatostatin analog increases ACTH secretion in some clients. Mitotane is used to treat metastatic adrenal cancer. Rationale: Mitotane directly suppresses activity of the adrenal cortex and decreases peripheral metabolism of corticosteroids. It is used to treat metastatic adrenal cancer. # 2 is incorrect because aminogluthimide may be administered to clients with ectopic ACTH-secreting tumors that cannot be surgically removed. # 3 is incorrect because ketoconazole inhibits, not increases, cortisol synthesis by the adrenal cortex. # 4 is incorrect because somatostatin suppresses, not increases, ACTH secretion. Which of the following nursing implications is most important in a client being medicated for Addison's disease? Administer oral forms of the drug with food to minimize its ulcerogenic effect. Monitor capillary blood glucose for hypoglycemia in the diabetic client. Instruct the client to never abruptly discontinue the medication. Teach the client to consume a diet that is high in potassium, low in sodium, and high in protein. Instruct the client to never abruptly discontinue the medication. Rationale: The primary medical treatment of Addison's disease is replacement of corticosteroids and mineralcorticoids, accompanied by increased sodium in the diet. The client needs to know the importance of maintaining a diet high is sodium and low in potassium. Medications should never be discontinued abruptly because crisis can ensue. Oral forms of the drug are given with food in Cushing's disease. A nurse on a surgical floor is caring for a post-operative client who has just had a subtotal thyroidectomy. Which of the following assessments should be completed first on the client? Assess for signs of tetany by checking for Chvostek's and Trousseau's signs Assess dressing (if present) and the area under the client's neck and shoulders for drainage. Administer analgesic pain medications as ordered, and monitor their effectiveness. Assess respiratory rate, rhythm, depth, and effort. Assess respiratory rate, rhythm, depth, and effort. Rationale: All of the above assessments have importance, but airway and breathing in a client should always be addressed first when prioritizing care. Assess for signs of latent tetany due to calcium deficiency, including tingling of toes, fingers, and lips; muscular twitches; positive Chvostek's and Trousseau's signs; and decreased serum calcium levels. However, tetany may occur in 1 to 7 days after thyroidectomy so # 1 is not the highest priority. Assessing for hemorrhage is always important, but the danger of hemorrhage is greatest in the first 12 to 24 hours after surgery, and as this client is immediately post operative it is not the main concern at this time. Pain medication is important but according to Maslow, pain is a psychosocial need to be addressed after a physiologic need. The nurse is caring for a client who is about to undergo an adrenalectomy. Which of the following Preoperative interventions is most appropriate for this client? Maintain careful use of medical and surgical asepsis when providing care and treatments. Teach the client about a diet high in sodium to correct any potential sodium imbalances preoperatively. Explain to the client that electrolytes and glucose levels will be measured postoperatively. Teach the client how to effectively cough and deep breathe once surgery is complete. Maintain careful use of medical and surgical asepsis when providing care and treatments. Rationale: Use careful medical and surgical asepsis when providing care and treatments since Cortisol excess increases the risk of infection. # 2 is incorrect. Nutrition should be addressed preoperatively. Request a dietary consultation to discuss with the client about a diet high in vitamins and proteins. If hypokalemia exists, include foods high in potassium. Glucocorticoid excess increases catabolism. Vitamins and proteins are necessary for tissue repair and wound healing following surgery. # 3 is incorrect. Monitor the results of laboratory tests of electrolytes and glucose levels. Electrolyte and glucose imbalances are corrected The nurse is caring for a client with pheochromocytoma. Which of the following must be included in planning the nursing care for this client ? Monitor blood pressure frequently, assessing for hypertension. Assess only for physical stressors present. Collect a random urine sample. Prepare the client for chemotherapy to shrink the tumor. Monitor blood pressure frequently, assessing for hypertension. Rationale: Pheochromocytomas are tumors of chromaffin tissues in the adrenal medulla. These tumors which are usually benign produce catecholamines (epinephrine or norepinephrine) that stimulate the sympathetic nervous system. Although many organs are affected, the most dangerous effects are peripheral vasoconstriction and increased cardiac rate and contractility with resultant paroxysmal hypertension. Systolic blood pressure may rise to 200 to 300 mmHg, the diastolic to 150 to 175 mmHg. # 1 is correct because the careful monitoring of blood pressure is essential. Attacks are often precipitated by physical, emotional, or environmental stimuli, so # 2 is incorrect because more than physical stressors are considered. This condition is life threatening and is usually treated with surgery as the preferred treatment. # 3 is incorrect because it is a random sample and not a 24 hour urine collection. Because catecholamine secretion is episodic, a 24-hour urine is a better surveillance method than serum catecholamines. (Pagana & Pagana, 2002). Surgical removal of the tumor(s) by adrenalectomy is the treatment of choice. # 4 is incorrect because surgery would be the treatment usually completed. A client newly diagnosed with Addison's disease is giving a return explanation of teaching done by the primary nurse. Which of the following statements indicates that further teaching is necessary? ""I need to increase how much I drink each day."" ""I need to weigh myself if I think I am losing or gaining weight."" ""I need to maintain a diet high in sodium and low in potassium."" ""I need to take my medications each day."" ""I need to weigh myself if I think I am losing or gaining weight."" The client is at risk for ineffective therapeutic regimen management. Clients with Addison's disease must learn to provide lifelong self-care that involves varied components: medications, diet, and recognizing and responding to stress. Changes in lifestyle are difficult to maintain permanently. The client needs to take the medications on a daily basis. The client needs to perform daily weights to monitor for signs of dehydration. The client needs to maintain a diet high in sodium and low in potassium, as well as maintain an increased fluid intake. # 2 is incorrect because daily weights need to be performed instead of weighing when a problem is suspected. . The nurse assessing a female client with Cushing's syndrome would expect to note which of the following?a) hirsutismb) hypotensionc) hypoglycemiad) pallor 1) A- An increased production of androgens that accompanies a rise in cortisol levels with Cushing's syndrome produces hirsutism and acne in women. Other clinical findings of Cushing's syndrome include hypertension caused by sodium retention, impaired glucose tolerance or diabetes mellitus caused by cortisol's anti-insulin effect and ability to enhance gluconeogenesis, and skin changes including bruising and purplish red striae caused by protein catabolism. 2. A nurse is admitting a client with a diagnosis of Addison's disease to the hospital. On assessment, the nurse would expect to note which finding that is a manifestation of this disorder?a) peripheral edemab) excessive facial hairc) lower than normal blood glucose leveld) high blood pressure 2) C- Blood glucose levels are low in Addison's disease as a result of decreased secretion of glucocorticoids (cortisol). Edema is absent, and aldosterone secretion is decreased so the client develops a deficient fluid volume. Facial hair increases with adrenocortical hyperfunction. Clients with Addison's disease develop hypotension as a result of deficient fluid volume. Options A, B and D are unrelated to Addison's disease. 3. A nurse is preparing to perform an assessment on a client being admitted to the hospital with a diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome. When performing the assessment, the nurse checks for which significant manifestation of the disorder?a) fluid retentionb) stretch marksc) goiterd) melanosis 3) A- Excessive secretion of adrenocortical hormones results in water and sodium reabsorption, causing fluid retention. Stretch marks (striae) are a common feature and can result in a disturbed body image, but are not significant and do not represent a life-threatening situation. Goiter is not a manifestation of Cushing's syndrome. Melanosis is a common manifestation associated with Addison's disease. 4. A clinic nurse is performing an assessment on a client who has hypothyroidism. The nurse would expect to note which clinical manifestation?a) complaints of difficulty sleepingb) complaints of diarrheac) significant weight loss since the last clinic visitd) complaints of intolerance to cold weather 4) D- An insufficient level of thyroid hormone causes a decrease in metabolic rate and heat production. Intolerance to cold would be noted. Options A, B and C are clinical manifestations of hyperthyroidism. 5. A clinic nurse is performing an assessment on a client recently diagnosed with diabetes mellitus. Which assessment question is appropriate when assessing the client's degree of adaptation to this disorder?a) you really don't think you caused your disorder, do you?b) your family is helping you stick to your diet, aren't they?c) how do you feel about your progress?d) are you feeling anxious? 5) COpen-ended questions allow the client to take the lead in the conversation. Options A and B denote judgment and may block communication. Option D allows the client to answer with a yes or no response and does not provide the client an opportunity to share feelings. Option C is open-ended and focuses on the subject of the question, the client's degree of adaptation to the disorder. . A client has been diagnosed with goiter. The nurse looks for documentation of which of the following in the client's medical record?a) decreased wound healingb) chronic fatiguec) enlarged thyroid glandd) heart damage 6) C- An enlarged thyroid gland occurs in goiter. Decreased wound healing, chronic fatigue, and heart damage are not specifically associated with this condition. 7. A nurse is assessing a lethargic client who was brought to the emergency department by emergency medical services and notes a fruity odor to the client's breath. The nurse immediately suspects that the client has: a) hyperglycemic hyperosmolar nonketotic syndrome (HHNS)b) diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA)c) ethanol oxide intoxicationd) hypoglycemia 7) B- Clients with DKA accumulate large amounts of ketone bodies in extracellular fluids. A fruity odor to the breath develops due to the volatile nature of acetone. A fruity odor is not a manifestation associated with the conditions noted in options A, C, and D. 8. A nurse is caring for a client following thyroidectomy and is monitoring for complications. Which of the following if noted in the client, would indicate a need for physician notification? a) surgical pain in the neck areab) voice hoarsenessc) numbness and tingling around the mouthd) weakness of the voice 8) C- Hypocalcemia can develop after thyroidectomy if the parathyroid glands are accidentally removed or traumatized during surgery. If the client develops numbness and tingling around the mouth or in the fingertips or toes, muscle spasms, or twitching, the physician should be called immediately. A hoarse or weak voice may occur temporarily if there has been unilateral injury to the laryngeal nerve during surgery. Pain is expected in the postoperative period. Calcium gluconate ampules should be available at the bedside, and the client should have a patent intravenous (IV) line in the event that hypocalcemic tetany occurs 9. A nurse is monitoring a client for complications following thyroidectomy. The nurse notes that the client's voice is very hoarse, and the client is concerned about the hoarseness and asks the nurse about it. The nurse makes which response to alleviate the client's concern?a) hoarseness and weak voice indicate permanent damage to the nervesb) this complication is expectedc) this problem is temporary and will probably subside in a few daysd) it is best that you not talk at all until the problem is further evaluated 9) CTemporary hoarseness and a weak voice may occur if there has been unilateral injury to the laryngeal nerve during surgery. If hoarseness or a weak voice is present, the client is reassured that the problem will probably subside in a few days. Unnecessary talking is discouraged to minimize hoarseness. The statements in options A, B, and D will not alleviate the client's concern. 10. A nurse provides dietary instructions to a client with a diagnosis of hyperparathyroidism. Which statement by the client indicates the need for further instructions?a) I need to drink 3000 ml of fluid per dayb) I should drink cranberry juice dailyc) I should eat foods high in calciumd) I should eat foods high in fiber 10) C- The client with hyperparathyroidism should consume at least 3000 mL of fluid per day. Measures to prevent dehydration are necessary because dehydration increases serum calcium levels and promotes the formation of renal stones. Cranberry juice and prune juice help make the urine more acidic. A high urinary acidity helps prevent renal stone formation because calcium is more soluble in acidic urine than in alkaline urine. Clients should be on a low-calcium, low-vitamin D diet. High-fiber foods are important to prevent constipation and fecal impaction resulting from the hypercalcemia that occurs with this disorder. 16. A nurse is caring for a client with hyperthyroidism and is instructing the client about dietary measures. The nurse tells the client that it is important to eat foods that are:a) high in bulk and fiberb) low in caloriesc) low in carbohydrates and fatsd) high in calories 16) D- The client with hyperthyroidism is usually extremely hungry because of increased metabolism. The client should be instructed to consume a high-calorie diet with six full meals a day. The client should be instructed to eat foods that are nutritious and contain ample amounts of protein, carbohydrates, fats, and minerals. Clients should be discouraged from eating foods that increase peristalsis and thus result in diarrhea, such as highly seasoned, bulky, and fibrous foods. 17. A client with type 1 diabetes mellitus tells the nurse that mealtimes are not important and that she eats whenever it is convenient. It is important for the nurse to explain that mealtimes:a) must be approximately the same time each day to maintain a stable blood glucoseb) can be varied as long as the time of insulin administration is also variedc) are not important as long as the client monitors the blood glucose regularlyd) are not important as long as snack foods are readily available 17) A- It is important for clients with type 1 diabetes mellitus to correlate eating with insulin administration to prevent hypoglycemia. Insulin should be given at approximately the same time each day, and meals should be eaten at approximately the same time each day. This will establish regular patterns of glucose availability that approximate glucose availability in a nondiabetic body. Options B, C, and D are incorrect because they infer that mealtimes are not important. 18. A client with type 1 diabetes mellitus tells the nurse, ""I usually begin to feel sick late in the afternoon; is there something wrong with me?"" The appropriate response by the nurse is which of the following?a) don't worry about that. Most diabetics feel that wayb) can you describe what you mean by feeling sick?c) let me know if that happens todayd) most people feel tired late in the afternoon 18) B- An excess of insulin relative to the amount of blood glucose induces hypoglycemia. Depending on the length of action of the insulin administered, the risk of hypoglycemia may be greatest in the late afternoon. The nurse needs to collect more data to determine if the client is actually experiencing hypoglycemia. Asking the client to describe the sick feeling provides the nurse with more data. Options A, C, and D are nontherapeutic communication statements. 19. A nurse is gathering data from a client newly diagnosed with diabetes mellitus concerning events leading to the client's seeking medical attention. The nurse identifies which of the following as the major symptoms of diabetes mellitus?a) polydipsia, polyuria, and polyphagiab) dyspepsia, polyuria, and polyphagiac) hypoglycemia, polyuria, and dysphagiad) hypoglycemia, polyuria, and dysphasia 19) A- Polydipsia, polyuria, and polyphagia are the classic signs and symptoms of diabetes mellitus. Dyspepsia, dysphagia, and dysphasia are associated with other body systems (gastric and neurological). Hyperglycemia also occurs. 20. A husband of a client with graves' disease expresses concern regarding his wife's health because during the past 3 months she has been experiencing nervousness, inability to concentrate even on trivial tasks, and outbursts of temper. On the basis of this information, which nursing diagnosis would the nurse identify as appropriate for the client?a) ineffective copingb) disturbed sensory perceptionc) social isolationd) grieving 20) A- Frequently, family and friends may report that the client with Graves' disease has become more irritable or depressed. The signs and symptoms in the question are supporting data for the nursing diagnosis of Ineffective coping and are not related to options B, C, and D. The question does not provide data to support options B, C, and D. 21. A nurse is caring for a client with hypoparathyroidism. In planning for discharge from the hospital, the nurse identifies which of the following as a potential psychosocial nursing diagnosis?a) impaired comfort related to cold intolerance secondary to decreased metabolic rateb) constipation related to decreased peristaltic action secondary to decreased metabolic ratec) high risk for impaired skin integrity related to edemad) anxiety related to the need for lifelong dietary interventions to control the disease 21) D- Medical management of hypoparathyroidism is aimed at correcting the hypocalcemia. This is accomplished with prescribed medications as well as lifelong compliance to dietary guidelines, which include consumption of foods high in calcium but low in phosphorus. Knowing that the interventions are lifelong can create some anxiety for the client, and this problem needs to be addressed before hospital discharge. The other options are unrelated to this condition and to a psychosocial concern. 22. A nurse is caring for a hospitalized older client with a diagnosis of dehydration who also has diabetes mellitus. The client is alert but disoriented, pale, and slightly diaphoretic, and the nurse suspects that the client is hypoglycemic. The initial nursing intervention would be to:a) administer oral glucoseb) assist the client to bed, put the side rails up, and call the physicianc) seat the client at the nurse's desk while checking the physician's orderd) obtain a fingerstick blood specimen and test the glucose level 22) D- The nurse should confirm that the client is hypoglycemic by checking the blood glucose. Option A is incorrect because hypoglycemia has not been determined. More information should be gathered before calling the physician, so option B is incorrect. Option C does not meet the client's immediate needs. 23. An adult client with diabetes mellitus reports to the health care clinic for a glycosylated hemoglobin A (HgbA1c) level. Which laboratory result indicates client compliance with the prescribed diabetic regimen?a) 5%b) 8%c) 10%d) 15% 23) A- The normal level for HgbA1C is 4.5% to 7.5%. This test measures the amount of glucose that has become permanently bound to the red blood cells from circulating glucose. Elevations in blood glucose will cause elevations in the amount of glycosylation. Elevations indicate continued need for teaching related to prevention of hyperglycemic episodes. 24. A client is diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus and is started on glyburide (Micronase) 2.5 mg orally. The client smiles and says, ""Oh, good, as long as I take this pill I can eat whatever I want."" In this situation, the nurse's intervention is focused on addressing which coping mechanism?a) denialb) angerc) depressiond) acceptance 24) A- The client is denying the experience of a chronic illness that will require her to make lifestyle changes. There is no evidence of anger or depression in the statement made by the client. The client has not accepted the disease if expectations are unrealistic. 25. A client newly diagnosed with diabetes mellitus is admitted to the hospital for evaluation and control of the disease. When analyzing the assessment data, which of the following would the nurse likely expect to find?a) hyperglycemiab) hypoglycemiac) weight gaind) hematuria 25) A- Hyperglycemia is characteristic of newly diagnosed diabetes mellitus. Newly diagnosed diabetic clients present a variety of symptoms, which may include polydipsia, polyuria, polyphagia, weakness, weight loss, and dehydration. 26. A client with diabetes mellitus says that it is very difficult to adhere to the diabetic treatment plan. The nurse interprets the client's concern and determines that the appropriate response is:a) if you don't take your insulin you will develop diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA)b) let's go over your diet again to be sure it contains foods you likec) do you understand what noncompliance can mean to your future health?d) let's check your blood glucose now 26) B- It is important to determine and deal with a client's concerns and to identify measures that will assist the client to comply with the diabetic regimen. The nurse should determine if a knowledge deficit exists and if the client's treatment plan maintains normalcy as much as is possible with the lifestyle. Scare tactics as described in options A and C should not be used. Positive reinforcement is necessary instead of focusing on negative behaviors. Option D does not address the subject of the question. 27. A nurse provides instructions to a client who is scheduled for a radioactive iodine uptake test. Which statement by the client indicates a need for further instructions?a) the test measures the rate of iodine uptake by my thyroid glandb) I will need to drink a small dose of radioactive iodine before the testc) a 24 hour urine specimen will need to be collected to measure iodine excretiond) I need to minimize close contact with others in my family for a period of 48 hours after the test because of the radioactivity in my system 27) D- The client undergoing a radioactive iodine uptake test needs to be reassured that the amount of radioactive iodine used is very small, that it is not harmful to the client, and that the client will not be radioactive. The other options are correct regarding this diagnostic test. 28. A nurse receives a report that an adult client with delirium has a blood glucose level of 33 mg/dL. The nurse analyzes this report as:a) higher than normal, indicating a cause of the deliriumb) a normal reading for this clientc) a lower than normal reading, indicating a cause for the deliriumd) insignificant and unrelated to the delirium 28) C- Blood glucose levels for an adult normally range between 60 and 120 mg/dL. A level of 33 mg/dL indicates hypoglycemia. Metabolic disorders can be an etiological factor of delirium. 29. A nurse is caring for a client with Cushing's syndrome who demonstrates withdrawn behavior. The nurse recognizes that this client's behavior is likely related to which nursing diagnosis? a) deficient diversional activityb) powerlessnessc) hopelessnessd) disturbed body image 29) D- Physical changes in the client's appearance can occur with Cushing's syndrome. Such changes include hirsutism, moon face, buffalo hump, acne, and striae. These changes cause a body image disturbance. Options A, B, and C are not commonly associated with Cushing's syndrome. 30. A client with Addison's disease makes all of the following statements. Which one does the nurse analyze as requiring further discussion?a) I wear a Medic-Alert bracelet at all timesb) I need to weigh myself daily and record itc) It is important that I drink enough fluids and increase my salt intaked) my medication doses will not need to be adjusted for any reason 30) D- The client with Addison's disease is experiencing deficits of mineralocorticoids, glucocorticoids, and androgens. Aldosterone deficiency affects the ability of the nephrons to conserve sodium, so the client experiences sodium and fluid volume deficit. The client needs to manage this problem with daily hormone replacement and increased fluid and sodium intake. Clients are instructed to weigh themselves daily as a means of monitoring fluid volume balance. Glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoids are essential components of the stress response. Additional doses of hormone replacement therapy are needed with any type of physical or psychological stressor. This information needs to be conveyed to the client and requires that the client wear a Medic-Alert bracelet so that health care professionals are aware of this problem if the client were to experience a medical emergency. A client is admitted for removal of a goiter. Which nursing intervention should receive priority during the post-operative period? A. Maintaining fluid and electrolyte balance B. Assessing the client's airway C. Providing needed nutrition and fluids D. Providing pain relief with narcotic analgesics Answer B is correct. A goiter is hyperplasia of the thyroid gland. Removal of a goiter can result in laryngeal spasms and airway occlusion. The other answers are lesser in priority. A client is admitted for treatment of hypoparathyroidism. Based on the client's diagnosis, the nurse would anticipate an order for: A. Potassium B. Magnesium C. Calcium D. Iron Answer C is correct. The parathyroid is responsible for calcium and phosphorus absorption. Clients with hypoparathyroidism have hypocalcemia. Answers A, B, and D are not associated with hypoparathyroidism therefore they are incorrect. A client with Addison's disease will most likely exhibit which symptom? A. Hypertension B. Bronze pigmentation C. Hirsutism D. Purple striae Answer B is correct. Answer B is correct because a bronze pigmentation is a sign of Addison's disease. Answers A, C, and D are symptoms of Cushing's syndrome, making them incorrect. A client with Cushing's syndrome should be instructed to: A. Avoid alcoholic beverages B. Limit the sodium in her diet C. Increase servings of dark green vegetables D. Limit the amount of protein in her diet Answer B is correct. A client with Cushing's syndrome has adrenocortical hypersecretion, so she retains sodium and water. The client may drink alcohol in moderation, so answer A is incorrect, and there is no need to eat more green vegetables or limit protein, so answers C and D are incorrect. The client with a suspected pituitary tumor will most likely exhibit symptoms of: A. Alteration in visual acuity B. Frequent diarrhea C. Alterations in blood glucose D. Urticaria Answer A is correct. The pituitary is located in the middle of the skull adjacent to the optic nerve and brain. Pressure on the optic nerve can cause an increase in intracranial pressure. Clients frequently complain of headache, nausea, vomiting, and decreasing visual acuity as the intracranial pressure increases. B, C, and D are incorrect because they are not associated with a pituitary tumor. A diabetic client has been maintained on Glucophage (metformin) for regulation of his blood glucose levels. Which teaching should be included in the plan of care? A. Report changes in urinary pattern. B. Allow six weeks for optimal effects. C. Increase the amount of carbohydrates in your diet. D. Use lotions to treat itching. Answer A is correct. Glucophage (metformin) can cause renal complications. The client should be monitored for changes in renal function. In answer B, the medication begins working immediately, so it is incorrect. In answer C, the amount of carbohydrates should be regulated with a diabetic diet, so it is incorrect. The use of lotions in answer D is unnecessary, so it is incorrect. A client with diabetes experiences Somogyi's effect. To prevent this complication, the nurse should instruct the client to: A. Take his insulin each day at 1400 hours B. Engage in physical activity daily C. Increase the amount of regular insulin D. Eat a protein and carbohydrate snack at bedtime Answer D is correct. Somogyi's is characterized by a drop in glucose levels at approximately 2 a.m. or 3 a.m. followed by a false elevation. Eating a protein and carbohydrate snack before retiring prevents the hypoglycemia and rebound elevation. Answers A, B, and C are incorrect because they do not prevent Somogyi's effect. Which item should be kept at the bedside of a client who has just returned from having a thyroidectomy? A. A padded tongue B. An endotracheal tube C. An airway D. A tracheostomy set Answer D is correct. Laryngeal swelling is not uncommon in clients following a thyroidectomy. A tracheostomy tray should be kept available. The ventilator is not necessary, so answer A is incorrect. The endotracheal tube is very difficult, if not impossible, to intubate if swelling has already occurred, so answer B is incorrect. The airway will do no good because the swelling is in the trachea, so answer C is incorrect. Which vitamin is directly involved in the metabolism of the hormones secreted by the parathyroid? A. Vitamin C B. Vitamin D C. Vitamin K D. Vitamin B9 Answer B is correct. Vitamin D is related to absorption of calcium and phosphorus. A, C, and D are incorrect because they are not related to the absorption of calcium and phosphorus. A client with acromegaly will most likely experience which symptom? A. Bone pain B. Frequent infections C. Fatigue D. Weight loss Answer A is correct. Acromegaly is an increase in secretion of growth hormone. The growth hormones cause expansion and elongation of the bones. Answers B, C, and D are not directly associated with acromegaly, so they are incorrect. A diabetic client is taking Lantus insulin for regulation of his blood glucose levels. The nurse should know that this insulin will most likely be administered: A. Prior to each meal B. At night C. Midday D. Prior to the evening meal Answer B is correct. This insulin, unlike others, is most frequently administered at night. Its duration is 24-36 hours. A, C, and D are incorrect they are incorrect times to administer Lantus insulin. A client with polyuria, polydipsia, and polyphagia is diagnosed with diabetes mellitus. The nurse would expect that these symptoms are related to A. Hypoglycemia B. Hyperglycemia C. Hyperparathyroidism D. Hyperthyroidism Answer B is correct. The client with hyperglycemia will exhibit polyuria, polydipsia, or increased thirst, and polyphagia, or increased hunger. A, C, and D are incorrect because they are not signs of hypoglycemia. Which laboratory test conducted on the client with diabetes mellitus indicates compliance? A. Fasting blood glucose B. Two-hour post-prandial C. Hgb A-1C D. Dextrostix Answer C is correct. The Hgb A-1C indicates that the client has been compliant for approximately three months. Answers A, B, and D tell the nurse the client's blood glucose at the time of the test, so they are incorrect. Acromegaly is most frequently diagnosed in: a. Middle-aged adultsb. Newbornsc. Children ages 2 to 5d. Adults age 65 and older 1. A: Acromegaly results from benign tumors on the pituitary gland that produce excessive amounts of growth hormone. Although symptoms may present at any age, the diagnosis generally occurs in middle-aged persons. Untreated, the consequences of acromegaly include type 2 diabetes, hypertension and increased risk of cardiovascular disease, arthritis and colon polyps. 8. Hashimoto's disease is: a. Chronic inflammation of the thyroid glandb. Diagnosed most frequently in Asian-Americans and Pacific Islandersc. A form of hyperthyroidismd. A rare form of hypothyroidism 8. A: Hashimoto's disease is the most common cause of hypothyroidism. It is an autoimmune disease that produces chronic inflammation of the thyroid gland. More women are affected than men and it is generally diagnosed in persons ages 40 to 60. When treatment is indicated, synthetic T4 is administered. 9. Persons at increased risk of developing Hashimoto's disease include all of the following except: a. Persons with vitiligob. Asian-Americansc. Persons with rheumatoid arthritisd. Persons with Addison's disease 9. B: Along with the above-mentioned groups, persons with type 1 diabetes and persons suffering from pernicious anemia (insufficient vitamin b12) are at increased risk of developing Hashimoto's disease. Because it tends to run in families, there is likely a genetic susceptibility as well. Environmental factors such as excessive iodine consumption and selected drugs also have been implicated as potential risk factors. 10. All of the following statements about Hashimoto's disease are true except: a. Many patients are entirely asymptomaticb. Not all patients become hypothyroidc. Most cases of obesity are attributable to Hashimoto's diseased. Hypothyroidism may be subclinical 10. C: Although weight gain may be a symptom of Hashimoto's disease, the majority of obese people have normal thyroid function; rarely is thyroid disorder the sole cause of obesity. Other symptoms of Hashimoto's disease include fatigue, cold intolerance, joint pain, myalgias, constipation, dry hair, skin and nails, impaired fertility, slow heart rate, and depression. 17. Untreated hyperthyroidism during pregnancy may result in all of the following except: a. Premature birth and miscarriageb. Low birthweightc. Autismd. Preeclampsia 17. C: In addition to the above-mentioned complications of uncontrolled hyperthyroidism in pregnancy, expectant mothers may suffer congestive heart failure and thyroid storm, which is life-threatening thyrotoxicosis with symptoms that include agitation, confusion, tachycardia, shaking, sweating, diarrhea, fever, and restlessness. 19. Endocrine disorders may be triggered by all of the following except: a. Stressb. Infectionc. Chemicals in the food chain and environmentd. Cell phone use 19. D: Endocrine function may be influenced by myriad factors. In addition to the above-mentioned, there is evidence that exposure to naturally occurring and man-made endocrine disruptors such as tributyltin, certain bioaccumulating chlorinated compounds, and phytoestrogens is widespread and in susceptible individuals, may trigger endocrine disorders.",8,best apps daily activity exercise diabetes,-14.066713333129883,232

Medical Author: Medical Editor: When to Seek Medical Care for High Blood Sugar (Hyperglycemia) Questions to Ask Your Doctor about High Blood Sugar (Hyperglycemia) Self-Care at Home for High Blood Sugar (Hyperglycemia) Support Groups and Counseling for High Blood Sugar (Hyperglycemia) Doctor's Notes on High Blood Sugar (Hyperglycemia) Symptoms High blood sugar needs to be monitored through blood tests. Whenever the glucose () level in one's blood rises high temporarily, this condition is known as hyperglycemia. The opposite condition, , is called . Glucose comes from most foods, and the body uses other chemicals to create glucose in the and muscles. The blood carries glucose () to all the cells in the body. To carry glucose into the cells as an energy supply, cells need help from insulin. Insulin is a hormone made by the pancreas, an organ near the stomach. The pancreas releases insulin into the blood, based upon the blood level. Insulin helps move glucose from digested food into cells. Sometimes, the body stops making insulin (as in ), or the insulin does not work properly (as in ). In diabetic patients, glucose does not enter the cells sufficiently, thus staying in the blood and creating high blood sugar levels. Blood sugar levels can be measured in seconds by using a blood glucose meter, also known as a glucometer. A tiny drop of blood from the finger or forearm is placed on a test strip and inserted into the glucometer. The blood sugar (or glucose) level is displayed digitally within seconds. Blood glucose levels vary widely throughout the day and night in people with . Ideally, blood glucose levels range from 90 to 130 mg/dL before meals, and below 180 mg/dL within 1 to 2 hours after a meal. Adolescents and adults with strive to keep their blood sugar levels within a controlled range, usually 80-150 mg/dL before meals. Doctors and health educators guide each patient to determine their optimal range of blood glucose control. When blood sugar levels remain high for several hours, and more serious complications can develop. Moreover, even mild hyperglycemia (a fasting blood sugar over 109 mg/dL in adolescents/adults or over 100 mg/dL in children before ) - when unrecognized or inadequately treated for several years - can damage multiple tissues in the brain, kidneys, and arteries. When hyperglycemia is associated with the presence of ketones in the urine, this state demands immediate medical attention. When blood sugar levels rise and stay high (over 165 mg/dL consistently) for days to weeks, diabetes should be suspected and treatment initiated. High blood sugar level fluctations occur daily in people with diabetes. It is important to control blood sugar levels through , , and medication (if prescribed), to know the symptoms of elevated blood sugar, and to seek treatment, when necessary. is one of several persistent conditions causing high blood sugar levels. For someone with diabetes, hyperglycemia has many possible causes: Eating food containing too many carbohydrates, a form of sugar. The body of a person with diabetes cannot process high levels of carbohydrates fast enough to convert it into energy. Blood sugar levels in patients with diabetes can rise within hours after eating. Not producing enough insulin action (either by injection of insulin or taking medicine which stimulates the pancreas to make more insulin). People with diabetes must control blood sugar by a combination of dietary discretion, taking medication, and physical activity. When food, , and insulin are not balanced, blood sugar levels rise. Emotions can play a role in causing hyperglycemia, but should not be used as an excuse for poor control of diabetes. Daily exercise is a critical contributor to regulating blood sugar levels. With illness, blood sugar levels tend to rise quickly over several hours. Certain drugs, especially , can affect blood sugar levels. ______________ is another term for type 2 diabetes. A high blood sugar level itself is a symptom of diabetes. However, an individual experiencing hyperglycemia may have no symptoms at all. If hyperglycemia persists for several hours and leads to , other symptoms may develop, such as: Left untreated, hyperglycemia can lead to a condition called ketoacidosis, also known as (DKA) or diabetic coma. This occurs because the body has insufficient insulin to process glucose into fuel, so the body breaks down to use for energy. When the body breaks down fat, ketones are produced as by-products. Some ketones are eliminated via the urine, but not all. Until the patient is rehydrated, and adequate insulin action is restored, ketones remain in the blood. Ketones in the blood cause , , , or . Ketoacidosis is life-threatening and demands immediate treatment. When to Seek Medical Care for High Blood Sugar (Hyperglycemia) If hyperglycemia persists for at least two or three days, or if ketones appear in the urine, call a doctor. Generally, people with diabetes should test their blood sugar levels at least four times a day: before meals and at bedtime (or following the schedule advised by the prescribed individual diabetes care plan). The urine should be checked for ketones any time the blood sugar level is over 250 mg/dL. When blood sugar stays high despite following a diabetic diet and plan of care, call the nurse, diabetes health educator, or physician for adjustments in the diet. If blood sugars are high because of illness, check for ketones and contact a health professional. Blood sugar levels that stay above 160 mg/dL for longer than a week Ketoacidosis or diabetic coma is a medical emergency. Call 911 for emergency transport to a hospital or similar emergency center. Questions to Ask Your Doctor about High Blood Sugar (Hyperglycemia) Please ask your health care professional about the following: How to treat a high blood sugar level when it occurs in you, a family member, or coworkers How to prevent the blood sugar level from becoming too high How to contact the medical staff during an emergency What emergency supplies to carry to treat high blood sugar Additional educational materials regarding high blood sugar Self-Care at Home for High Blood Sugar (Hyperglycemia) Check blood sugar levels with a blood glucose meter. If blood sugar level is higher than normal, but there are no symptoms, continue routine care such as: Take a blood sugar reading every four hours (write it down) until levels are back to normal. Check urine for ketones (all patients with diabetes) and write down the readings. Follow sick day rules as defined in your diabetes care plan until ketones disappear from urine. A simple way to lower high blood sugar is to exercise. But if blood glucose levels are higher than 240 mg/dL, first check the urine for ketones. If ketones are present, do not exercise. The risk is that blood sugar levels will rise even higher. Talk with the doctor about a safe way to lower blood glucose levels in this situation. Work with a diabetes health educator or registered dietitian to develop a workable diet plan to manage diabetes. If diet and exercise are not keeping blood sugar levels in the normal range, the doctor may adjust the amount, timing, or type of medications or insulin. High blood sugars may be a sign that the person with diabetes needs to take medication, to change medications, or to change the way it is given (for example, additional insulin would be given, or a switch might be made from oral medication to injected medication). Other illnesses need to be diagnosed and treated if an illness is causing high blood sugar levels. Infection or illness may need to be treated in the hospital, where health professionals can adjust the plan of care. A number of medications are available to help control blood sugar levels for people with . Insulin is also prescribed  for people with diabetes (all with and many with type 2 diabetes). Patients with diabetes should have a performed every three months. Similar to a report card, this test provides feedback about the overall sugar levels for the past three months. People with diabetes should have a level less than 7% at each clinical visit. Levels above 7% usually result from a person's consistent failure to: Work with a certified diabetes educator. This person will have a CDE certification and may work in a diabetes education center or hospital. Check blood sugar as directed by a CDE and doctor or nurse. Know the symptoms and act quickly before blood sugars get out of control. Follow a diabetes diet plan. Adjust the plan as needed. Take as directed by your healthcare professional. Support Groups and Counseling for High Blood Sugar (Hyperglycemia) You or family members may wish to join a support group with other people to share your experiences. The American Diabetes Association and the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation are both excellent resources. Your health care provider will have information about local groups in your area.

Diabetes: What Raises and Lowers Your Blood Sugar Level? Reviewed By: There are many different ways that blood sugar (glucose levels in the blood) can be affected and may cause problems with sugar control in people with diabetes. Each person reacts differently to a variety of things that influence blood sugar. People with diabetes should be aware of certain compounds and activities that influence blood sugar levels. One of these compounds is caffeine. Blood sugar levels can rise after drinking coffee, black tea, and caffeinated energy because of their caffeine content. Read on to learn more compounds that may alter blood glucose levels, along with methods people with diabetes can use to see what substances and behaviors influence their own blood sugar levels. A number of foods claim to be ""sugar-free."" But these foods may still raise blood sugar levels because many contain carbohydrates in the form of starch or fiber. Sugar alcohols such as sorbitol and xylitol add sweetness to foods but still may have enough associated carbohydrates to raise blood sugar levels. Foods with high levels of carbohydrates are likely to raise blood sugar levels very high, and eventually high blood sugar levels may cause organ damage over time in people with diabetes. Foods high in fat can cause your blood sugar to stay higher for longer. Pizza, French fries, and most fried foods are high in carbohydrates and fat. So are many Chinese food favorites like egg rolls and the breaded chicken found in sweet and sour chicken. It's a good idea to monitor your blood sugar about two hours after you eat such foods to see how your blood sugar levels are affected. Dehydration can elevate your blood sugar so it is wise to stay well-hydrated. If you are sick, have diarrhea and vomiting for more than two hours, or a prolonged illness lasting more than a few days, the illness may alter your blood sugar. Moreover, blood sugar rises as your body tries to fight any type of illness. Medications such as antibiotics and decongestants may alter your blood sugar. Check your blood sugar levels during these intermittent special situations so you can help determine how your body will react to these illnesses and treatments. Stress may cause your body to release hormones that can make your blood sugar rise. This is more common in people with type 2 diabetes. Practice relaxation techniques with deep breathing and exercise, if you can, to reduce stress. Are bagels better than bread? Well, bagels are better at increasing sugar levels in the blood than bread because bagels are packed with carbohydrates and calories. If you've just got to have a bagel, choose a mini bagel, or a thin bagel. If you love your morning bagel, try and find healthy alternatives by discussing your diet preferences with a health care professional or dietician. Although the main design for sports drinks is to help individuals replenish fluids quickly, many of them contain lots of sugar. For moderate workouts of less than an hour, plain water should replenish your fluids. For more intense workouts, a sports drink may be appropriate, but people with diabetes should check with their doctor to see which sports drinks is best for them. Although fruit is a healthy choice for most of us, people with diabetes should be aware dried fruits contain a large amount of carbohydrates in a small serving size. For example, two tablespoons of dried raisins, cranberries, or cherries have the same amount of carbohydrates as a small piece of fresh fruit. Three dried dates contain 15 g of carbohydrates so eating a handful or two of dried fruits may cause high spikes in blood glucose levels in many people. Steroids, commonly used to treat rashes, arthritis, asthma, and other medical conditions, can cause blood sugar levels to rise. Corticosteroids such as prednisone may trigger the development of diabetes in people with a tendency toward diabetes. Diuretics (water pills) may raise blood sugar levels, while antidepressants may either raise or lower them. If you need to take these medications and have diabetes, carefully monitor your blood glucose levels to see how these medications affect you. Cold medicines often contain the decongestants pseudoephedrine or phenylephrine; they also may contain sugar and/or alcohol. These components may raise your blood sugar levels. However, antihistamines don't cause a problem with blood sugar levels. If you decide to purchase over-the-counter cold medicines, ask the pharmacist about the possible effects it may have on your blood glucose levels. A leisurely day in the sun can have consequences for your blood sugar. Even after you cool down, if you acquired a sunburn you could be raising your glucose levels in the shade. The CDC explains that the lasting pain of a sunburn can cause stress, and that stress can increase your blood sugar. Gum disease (periodontitis) is extremely common. The CDC estimates that half of all American adults over age 30 have it. This gum infection may cause serious glucose changes in your blood, too. It raises blood sugar, and it may leave you more vulnerable to developing type 2 diabetes. Estrogen in birth control pills can affect the way a person with diabetes may respond to insulin. The American Diabetes Association (ADA) advises women with diabetes to use a birth control pill containing norgestimate and a synthetic estrogen. The ADA also says birth control injections and implants are safe for women with diabetes, but suggests they still have some effect on blood sugars. If women elect to use these birth control methods, they should monitor their blood sugar levels, especially for several weeks when these agents are first administered. Women with diabetes should discuss their birth control options with their doctor. Normal activities such as mowing the lawn or cleaning the house count as moderate physical activity for a person with diabetes (and for other people, too!). This type of activity may help lower the blood sugar in a person with diabetes. People with diabetes should participate in mild to moderate physical activity because the activity may lower blood glucose and increase overall fitness. Probiotic foods may help people with diabetes by improving digestion. Yogurt, for example, is reported to contain ""healthy"" bacteria that may help protect against gastrointestinal problems. The best yogurt choice is plain yogurt or ""light yogurt"" with no added sugar or fruit. People with diabetes who switched to a vegan diet (no meat or animal products such as dairy or egg consumed) or entirely plant–based diet, according to some researchers, had a much better blood sugar control and required less insulin. Although the mechanism is not entirely clear, whole grains, fiber, and beans may function by slowing down carbohydrate digestion, thereby producing sugars at a lower rate. People with diabetes should check with their doctor before they make any major changes to their diet. Some studies suggest sprinkling your food with cinnamon may lower blood sugar in individuals with type II diabetes. Study investigators suggest cinnamon can add flavor without adding salt, carbohydrates, or calories. Moreover, cinnamon may improve the body's ability to use insulin. People with diabetes should discuss use of cinnamon with their health care professional before making any dietary changes. To determine how blood sugar fluctuates during a typical 24-hour period it is important to test it regularly. Blood sugar can fall low during sleep for some people with type I diabetes; these people may benefit from a small snack just before bedtime. For other people, blood sugar can rise in the morning even before eating breakfast – this is due in part to changes in hormones or a drop in insulin levels. A good way to determine how your body utilizes glucose is to use a continuous blood glucose monitor on occasion. It can help you determine the blood glucose fluctuations that are normal for you. Most clinicians agree that physical activity almost always can improve an individual's health, whether they have diabetes or have normal blood glucose levels. Unfortunately, when people with diabetes do intense or endurance types of exercise, their blood sugars may spike up and then drop for as long as 24 hours. People with diabetes should check their blood sugar before, during, and after exercises to be sure their blood sugar levels don't go too high or too low. Good blood glucose monitoring, coupled with appropriate treatments, can avoid this blood glucose roller coaster effect of highs and lows. The same roller coaster effect of high and low blood sugar that occurs with exercise can occur when people with diabetes drink alcohol. At first, glucose levels may rise, but then they can fall and remain low as long as 12 hours after drinking. The roller coaster effect can be reduced if the person eats food when drinking alcohol. Alcoholic drinks can also contain a lot of carbohydrates. The American Diabetes Association (ADA) suggests a woman should drink only one alcoholic beverage per day, and they suggest no more than two per day for men. One alcoholic drink is equal to 5 ounces of wine, 12 ounces of beer, or 1.5 ounces of liquor (whiskey or vodka). Being overly hot and sweating makes your blood sugar more difficult to control. Going in and out of air conditioning can have a roller coaster-like effect on your blood glucose levels. Staying in air-conditioned environments during the heat of the day and drinking plenty of water to avoid dehydration is a good way to avoid heat–related problems in controlling your blood sugar. In addition, people with diabetes should know that their medications, the glucose meter, and test strips could be affected by high heat such as the type of heat that can occur in a hot car or on a windowsill in the sun. Keep these items at room temperature. Another roller coaster effect of high and low blood sugar occurs due to hormone changes. Women's blood glucose levels fluctuate during the menstrual cycle and during menopause. Frequent blood sugar level tests can help people with diabetes manage this roller coaster effect due to hormonal changes. Your physician may provide hormone replacement therapy, but should discuss with you the risks and benefits of this therapy and how it may interact with your blood sugar levels. If you are a chocoholic and/or have a huge sweet tooth and have diabetes, you do not have to give these items up forever. The key is to understand that sugar compounds will increase your blood sugar levels more quickly than other carbohydrates, but the total amount of carbohydrate intake is most important. Consequently, if people with diabetes can , they can enjoy their favorite foods as long as they take into account that the overall total carbohydrate intake and calories do not exceed their usual dietary levels. This means a small serving of sweets should be offset by eating other foods that contain no ""sweets."" The glycemic index (GI) of foods is a rating of how individual foods raise blood sugar. The daily carbohydrate total is one way to manage blood glucose levels. Consequently, eating beans and whole grains that have a lower glycemic index than white bread or pasta can help keep blood sugars lower. So, if you want a small amount of high glycemic index foods (a small piece of pie, for example), it would be better to have the rest of the daily carbohydrate total made from low glycemic index foods. The ADA has glycemic index ratings and offers diet suggestions for people with diabetes. Diabetes: What Raises and Lowers Your Blood Sugar Level?

Medical Editor: When Should I Seek Medical Care for Metabolic Syndrome? What Are the Exams and Tests for Metabolic Syndrome? What Is the Medical Treatment for Metabolic Syndrome? What Medications Are Used to Treat Metabolic Syndrome? The term is well recognized in the medical literature and in the lay press as well. Metabolic syndrome (also referred to as syndrome X or dysmetabolic syndrome) refers to an association between certain metabolic disorders and cardiovascular disease. While the criteria for the diagnosis vary, the concept of a clustering of risks factors that lead to cardiovascular disease is well accepted. The main characteristics of metabolic syndrome include: Most people with metabolic syndrome are or . Insulin resistance (IR) is a condition in which the cells of the body become resistant to the effects of insulin. Because of the central role that insulin resistance plays in metabolic syndrome, a separate article is devoted to insulin resistance. The most widely accepted definition of metabolic syndrome is based on the guidelines from the 2001 National Education Program Adult Treatment Panel (ATP III). Any three of the following traits in the same individual meet the criteria for the metabolic syndrome: Abdominal : a waist circumference over 102 cm (40 in) in men and over 88 cm (35 inches) in women. 40mg/dl or lower in men and 50mg/dl or lower in women. Fasting blood glucose of 110 mg/dl or above. (Some groups say 100mg/dl) Weight is a significant influence on the development of metabolic syndrome. Metabolic syndrome is present in a small percentage of people with normal body weight, while it is present in a significant percentage of individuals who are overweight, and a majority of individuals considered obese. Adults who continue to gain five or more pounds per year raise their risk of developing metabolic syndrome. As is true with many medical conditions, genetics and the environment both play important roles in the development of the metabolic syndrome. Genetic factors influence each individual component of the syndrome, and the syndrome itself. A family history that includes , , and early greatly increases the chance that an individual will develop the metabolic syndrome. Environmental issues such as low activity level, sedentary lifestyle, and progressive weight gain also contribute significantly to the risk of developing the metabolic syndrome. Obesity is likely the greatest risk factor for metabolic syndrome; however other risk factors of concern include: Symptoms depend on which components of the syndrome are present. typically produces no symptoms but may present with blurred vision and . Insulin resistance may be associated with difficulty losing weight and a sense of (feeling of ). In its extreme, metabolic syndrome can present with symptoms related to or . When Should I Seek Medical Care for Metabolic Syndrome? If you have any of the risk factors associated with metabolic syndrome, or if you are at risk for any of the components of metabolic syndrome, you should discuss this with your health care practitioner. Similarly, if you have a strong family history of , , early cardiac death, obesity and/or , you should seek medical advice. What Are the Exams and Tests for Metabolic Syndrome? A detailed history and physical examination should be performed. Each individual component of the syndrome should be evaluated distinctly. All of the following exams or tests may be warranted: assessment by fasting , insulin level, and oral glucose tolerance testing Cardiac risk factors can be assessed to estimate cardiovascular risk. These may include lipid levels, electrocardiograms, testing, angiograms, and more detailed assessments if necessary. Metabolic syndrome increases a person's risk of heart disease and diabetes. Treatment for metabolic syndrome ranges from changes in diet and lifestyle to adminstering -lowering and medications. Goals are to lower blood pressure and control body weight. Lifestyle modification is the preferred treatment of metabolic syndrome. Weight reduction usually requires a specifically tailored multifaceted program for the patient that includes diet and . Medications may be useful in some instances. As noted above, most people who have metabolic syndrome are overweight and lead a sedentary lifestyle. A detailed discussion of therapeutic diets and the pros and cons of each diet is beyond the scope of this article. However, one diet that is palatable and easily sustained and has shown benefit is the . The Mediterranean diet is rich in olive oil (a ""good fat"") and contains a reasonable and sustainable amount of protein and carbohydrates. Some studies have suggested that when compared to a low fat diet, people on the Mediterranean diet have had a greater decrease in body weight, greater improvements in and levels, and improvement in other markers of heart disease; all of which are important in evaluating and treating metabolic syndrome. A regular and consistent program is also an important lifestyle modification that can be accomplished at home or a gym. Thirty minutes of exercise five days a week is a reasonable start, providing there are no medical contraindications to exercise. (It is prudent to consult your physician prior to starting any exercise program.) Lowering blood pressure and cholesterol levels, along with increasing insulin sensitivity, are beneficial effects of a regular consistent exercise program, regardless of whether is achieved. Thus, exercise in still a helpful tool in treating metabolic syndrome. What Is the Medical Treatment for Metabolic Syndrome? Medical management should be aimed at targeting the components of metabolic syndrome that are present. If a patient with metabolic syndrome has already had a , their LDL (""bad"") cholesterol should be reduced to a level below 70mg/dl. Lifestyle modifications and medications may both be necessary to achieve this desired reduction. A person with diabetes has a heart attack risk equivalent to that of someone who has already a heart attack, and should be treated the same as a patient who has had a heart attack. What remains controversial is whether metabolic syndrome should be considered sufficient to raise the risk to this degree. If a patient has metabolic syndrome, a detailed discussion about therapy to reduce blood lipid levels is necessary between the patient and the doctor, as each individual case is unique. Goals for lowering blood pressure are generally set lower than 130/80. In addition to lowering blood pressure, some blood pressure medications have other effects on the body. For example, ACE inhibitors (a class of blood pressure drugs) has been found to reduce the levels of insulin resistance and thus may slow the development of . This is an important consideration when discussing the choice of blood pressure drugs for a patient with metabolic syndrome. While a healthy body weight should also be a goal of treatment, it is important to remember that a reduction in weight can have a dramatic benefit on lowering blood pressure and cholesterol levels and increasing insulin sensitivity. What Medications Are Used to Treat Metabolic Syndrome? Medications should be tailored to target the specific components of the metabolic syndrome that are present in the patient. Cholesterol-lowering drug classes include and fibrates. Blood pressure medications of various classes can be used, with consideration of coexisting diseases or conditions. may be considered to reduce cardiac risk, along with such as fish oils. (), usually used to treat type 2 diabetes, also has been found to help prevent the onset of diabetes in people with metabolic syndrome. Many patients who have insulin resistance associated with metabolic syndrome opt for metformin therapy. However, there are currently no established guidelines on treating metabolic syndrome patients with metformin if they do not have overt diabetes. Routine follow-up is recommended for patients with metabolic syndrome, both to address the treatment of the components present, as well as to monitor for the development of heart disease or associated problems. Prevention of metabolic syndrome in its entirety may not be possible in all cases, given the genetic contribution. However, there are ways to prevent worsening of the individual components. A consistent exercise routine: , bicycling, swimming, , etc. Find an exercise buddy if you can't seem to be consistent with the routine. Take a walk during your work break, even if it is just around the building. Evaluate what you feed your children. Are they eating healthy as well? is rising dramatically in the United States. Urge children to go outside and play to get some exercise. It all adds up. Preventing metabolic syndrome really means having a healthy sustainable lifestyle. While these treatment options can be addressed at a doctor's office, implementation really has to occur in the real world. In addition to medications, an active attempt to choose healthier foods and exercising regularly is necessary. With sincere effort, we can alter the course of the syndrome in a positive way. Metabolic syndrome is a group of risk factors that come together in a single individual. Specifically, metabolic syndrome is a cluster of the following: high blood pressure, high blood sugar, high cholesterol levels, and belly fat - all of which increase the risk of heart disease and diabetes. Obviously, having any one of these risk factors isn't good. But when they're combined, they set the stage for grave problems. These risk factors double your risk of blood vessel disease and heart disease, which can lead to heart attacks and strokes. These risk factors increase your risk of diabetes by 5 times.

Medical Author: Medical Editor: What Is a Nocturnal (While Asleep) Insulin Reaction? What Is the Medical Treatment for Insulin Reaction? What is the medical definition of insulin reaction? An insulin reaction occurs when a person with becomes confused or even unconscious because of (hypo=low + glycol = + emia = in the blood) caused by insulin or oral diabetic medications. (Please note that for this article and blood glucose mean the same thing and the terms may be used interchangeably.) The terms insulin reaction, insulin , and hypoglycemia (when associated with a person with ) are often used interchangeably. What happens if you have too much insulin in your body? In normal physiology, the body is able to balance the glucose ( levels) in the bloodstream. When a person eats, and glucose levels start to rise, the body signals the pancreas to secrete insulin. Insulin ""unlocks the door"" to cells in the body so that the glucose can be used for energy. When blood sugar levels drop, insulin production decreases and the begins producing glucose. In people with , the pancreas is unable to produce enough insulin to meet the body's demand. Treatment may include medications taken by mouth (oral hypoglycemics), insulin, or both. The balance of food intake and medication is not automatic, and a person with diabetes needs to be aware that too much medication or too little food may cause blood sugar levels to drop. Interestingly, brain cells do not need insulin to access the glucose in the bloodstream. Brain cells also cannot store excess glucose, so when blood sugar levels drop, brain function is one of the first parts of the body to become affected. In an insulin reaction, the blood sugar levels are usually below 50 mg/dL (or 2.78 mmol/L in SI units). Insulin reactions occur when there is an imbalance of food intake and the amount of insulin in the body. Oral medications can remain active in the body for more than 24 hours. The effects of Injectable insulin can be short or very long depending upon the type. Even in individuals whose diabetes is well controlled and regulated with medication, a variety of factors can cause the insulin/glucose levels to fluctuate from the normal range. Also, plays a role in causing hypoglycemia? People who have had diabetes for 10-20 years and/or have been on long term or large doses of insulin are more prone to ""insulin unawareness"". They can suddenly become hypoglycemic without any warning and should check sugar before driving. They should consider Continuous Glucose Monitoring or a handheld reader with a 14-day patch that lets them read blood sugar at any time. Perhaps the most common cause of an insulin reaction or hypoglycemia is a missed meal. Once insulin is injected or a diabetes medication is taken, its effect needs to be balanced by caloric intake from food (providing glucose to bind with the insulin). If the number of calories eaten decreases, blood glucose levels drop and the insulin acts unopposed, which causes the characteristic symptoms of an insulin reaction. An insulin reaction can also occur with . When a person exercises the muscle cells need extra energy (glucose), and if food intake is decreased, the blood sugar levels will drop. Another common cause of insulin reaction is medication error. If a person with diabetes injects too much insulin or takes too many diabetic drugs, the insulin levels in the blood rise because there is not enough glucose in the blood to bind to the insulin, and an insulin reaction occurs. Disorders of these endocrine glands can also affect the balance between insulin and glucose in the body. Diabetes: What Raises and Lowers Your Blood Sugar Level? The symptoms of an insulin reaction are due to decreased brain cell function because of lack of glucose within the bloodstream. The longer the hypoglycemia persists, the more severe the symptoms. (low body temperature) may occur if the hypoglycemia persists for a prolonged period of time What Is a Nocturnal (While Asleep) Insulin Reaction? Some people with diabetes experience nighttime (nocturnal) hypoglycemia. Signs and symptoms of nocturnal hypoglycemia include: In nocturnal hypoglycemia, the blood sugar level upon awaking may be elevated as a result of the body's attempt to compensate for the level several hours before. This is sometimes called the Somogyi phenomenon. Attempts to lower the morning blood sugar level by adjusting mediation or insulin dosing may result in a paradoxical worsening of the problem. Onset of signs and symptoms is generally sudden and within a few hours after injection of short-acting insulin. The onset may occur many hours after injection of long-acting insulin preparations or with oral medications. In this case it may be more difficult to appreciate the symptoms as being related to hypoglycemia. Most people with diabetes have experienced an insulin reaction early after their initial diagnosis as and medication or insulin dosing is being adjusted to fit into their lifestyle. Whenever a person is unconscious, regardless of the cause, call 911 or your local emergency telephone number to activate emergency medical service responses. If the affected individual remains confused, even after eating or drinking to correct a low blood sugar, he or she should receive medical care. People with diabetes who take sulfonylurea oral hypoglycemic medications, like (, , ), (, , ), or (), should contact their health care practitioner or seek urgent medical care if they experience an insulin reaction. These medications can remain active in the body for a prolonged period of time, and observation in a hospital setting may be necessary. Insulin reactions, especially those that occur at night or early morning should be reported to your health care practitioner. People with diabetes should keep a record of their blood sugar readings as it is an important tool to help keep blood sugars under good control and decrease the risk of long-term complications of diabetes. A low blood sugar associated with symptoms of hypoglycemia confirms an insulin reaction. The next step is to find out why the insulin reaction occurred. The history taken by the health care practitioner from the patient, bystanders, and family. Often those people that were around the affected individual can assist in defining the reason for the reaction. Further testing and follow-up will depend upon the situation. A person who wakens immediately and returns to normal function with correction of the blood sugar may need no further testing. An individual who continues to have mental status changes like confusion, lethargy, coma, or -like symptoms will likely require further care and testing. Most people with diabetes or their family members can recognize the early symptoms of an insulin reaction and can self-treat the situation. Ideally, a fingerstick blood test will be taken to confirm the diagnosis, but it is also reasonable to immediately drink something with sugar (for example, fruit juice, regular soda, or water with table sugar). Glucose tablets and sugar wafers are also easily digested and can provide instant glucose into the bloodstream. Emergency medical services (call 911 or your local emergency number) should be activated if the affected person is unconscious or has difficulty staying awake. Do NOT try to put food or drink into an unconscious person's mouth because there is a risk that it will be aspirated into the causing . It is reasonable to try to rub sugar or another sweet substance inside the cheek or along the gum line. Sugar is quickly absorbed through these sites, and this may be enough to waken the patient. is an injectable medication that can raise blood sugar levels. Many people with diabetes carry an injectable glucagon pen to use in emergencies, and often their family members also are trained in how to give an injection to treat low blood sugar levels. The patient cannot always realize that the reaction is happening and his/her relatives should be taught when and how to inject Glucagon. After a Glucagon injection, people are subject to an even worse reaction and they should try to ingest sugar as soon as they come out of the initial reaction. Should the affected individual return to normal, fingerstick blood sugar tests should be checked regularly (every 15-20 minutes) to make certain that the levels do not start to drop again. The person should not be left alone in case hypoglycemia recurs. What Is the Medical Treatment for Insulin Reaction? Increasing blood sugar levels is the treatment of an insulin reaction. Emergency personnel may start an intravenous line and inject an ampule of D50W, a highly concentrated glucose solution. If the patient takes a long-acting insulin or oral hypoglycemic medication, the IV line may be left in place and a dextrose (a type of sugar) solution may be continually infused. Patients who are elderly, have an underlying illness that caused the hypoglycemia, or are taking long-acting medication may need further observation, additional treatment, and admission to the hospital. Patients who are (hypothermic) because of a prolonged insulin reaction may require rewarming. Most patients are able to be discharged home after a short observation period. When EMS is involved at home, if the patient wakens and returns to normal with glucose treatment, there may be no need to transport them to hospital if there is a responsible adult who can care for them at home. People with diabetes need to be vigilant to maintain their blood sugar levels within the normal range. Diet, , and proper insulin dosing need to be continually monitored to prevent hypoglycemia and insulin reactions. Insulin reactions are a common situation and are usually easily treated with little consequence. If the episode occurs when the patient is driving, using heavy machinery, or otherwise engaged in a potential risky situation, injury may occur. Patients may develop significant organ damage if blood sugars remain low for a prolonged a period of time. Medically reviewed by John A.

Type 2 diabetes symptoms include excessive thirst and urination, and dehydration. Type 2 diabetes causes and risk factors include older age, obesity, lack of exercise, family history, and excess fat around waistline. Treatments for type 2 diabetes are weight loss, a healthy diet, exercise, and medications if necessary. Anal itching is a common problem experienced by both men and women. Examples of causes of anal itching include irritants such as perfumes, chemicals, or dyes in toilet paper, food irritants, infections, and hemorrhoids. There are risk factors for anal itching such as diseases, profuse sweating, fecal soilage, and more. Anal itching in general can be treated at home with OTC medications if necessary. Obesity means an excess amount of body fat. No general agreement exists on the definition of obesity in children as it does adults. Some define pediatric obesity as body weight at least 20% higher than the healthy weight range for a child or adolescent of that height, or as a body fat percentage above 25% in boys or above 32% in girls. What causes diabetes, what tests diagnose it, and what is a good diabetic diet? Learn the signs of being diabetic, the treatments, and the differences between type 1 vs. type 2 diabetes. Type 1 diabetes (insulin dependent) can be caused by heredity, environmental factors, or ethnicity. Type 2 diabetes (non-insulin dependent) can be caused by high blood pressure, high lipid levels, high-fat diet, high alcohol intake, sedentary lifestyle, obesity, ethnicity, or age. People with diabetes rely on their insulin injections, insulin pumps, and other diabetes equipment and medications to keep them healthy. Transportation Security Agents should be notified of these items during travel. Also, food should be kept available to avoid hypoglycemia, and diabetic people should always stay hydrated. Be prepared to manage your diabetes, and control blood sugar and symptoms when you're sick, when you're at work or school, when traveling, during pregnancy, or during an emergency or natural disaster. Diabetes is one of the leading causes of blindness in the US and worldwide. Diabetic eye disease is a complication from diabetes. Types of diabetic eye disease include blindness, background diabetic retinopathy, nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy, diabetic macular edema, proliferative diabetic retinopathy, cataracts, and glaucoma. Symptoms of diabetic retinopathy includes blurry or hazy vision, difficulty focusing, and night glare from oncoming lights. Causes of diabetic eye disease occur over time due to hypoglycemia (high blood sugar) and other abnormalities in metabolism found in people with diabetes. Treatment for diabetes eye problems depends on the type of eye problem. Medication and surgery for diabetes eye problems may be necessary in addition to lifestyle changes such as eating a healthy diet, exercise, quitting smoking. Read about diabetic foot care. Causes of foot problems in people with diabetes include footwear, nerve damage, poor circulation, trauma, infections, and smoking. Symptoms of foot problems in persons with diabetes include persistent pain, redness of the skin, leg or feet swelling, claudication, hard shiny skin on the legs, localized warmth around the wound, drainage or pus from the would, difficulty walking, fever, red streaking away from the wound, new or lasting numbness in the legs or feet. Any break in the skin can result in serious infection. Treatment depends upon the location and severity of the wound or problem. Amputation of the leg or foot is sometimes necessary. Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) occurs when a person with diabetes becomes dehydrated. Causes of diabetic ketoacidosis include infection, missed insulin, or newly diagnosed diabetes. Some signs and symptoms of diabetic ketoacidosis include excessive thirst, vomiting, confusion, dry skin or mouth, shortness of breath, and abdominal pain. Diabetic ketoacidosis is a medical emergency and if you think you or someone you know may be suffering from diabetic ketoacidosis call 911 or go to the nearest urgent care facility or emergency department. There are two types of diabetes, type 1 and type 2. There are two types of diabetic reactions; low blood sugar (hypoglycemia) and high blood sugar (hyperglycemia). Symptoms of hypoglycemia include: dizziness; headache; rapid onset of cool, pale, moist, and clammy skin; rapid pulse; and shallow breathing. Treatment is to have the person with diabetes suffering the reaction eat or drink something with sugar such as juice, candy, or another sweet substance. Hyperglycemia is less common and the symptoms can occur over several days. Medical treatment is generally needed. Nutrition and diet is needed for health. Read dietary guidelines, dietary reference intakes, food guide pyramid, calories, carbohydrates, protein, fats, vitamins, minerals, and phytochemicals. A healthy variety of food provides nutrients for health and weight management and weight loss. Hemoglobin A1c (hemoglobin A1c) is a test used at times to monitor blood glucose in people with diabetes. HbA1c is a long-term indicator of blood glucose control. This test also monitors the effects of diet, exercise, and drug therapy on the patient's blood glucose. The normal range for hemoglobin A1c is less than 6%. HbA1c cannot be used to monitor day-to-day blood glucose levels. High blood sugar (hyperglycemia) is when the body's blood sugar rises. Blood sugar levels can be measured using a blood glucose meter. Diabetes mellitus is a common cause of high blood sugar. Symptoms include dry mouth, thirst, frequent urination, and fatigue. Treatment includes diet, exercise, and medications Hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) is caused by overmedication, use of certain medications, use of alcohol, missed meals, kidney or liver infection, and more. Common symptoms of hypoglycemia include: trembling, clammy skin, palpitations, anxiety, sweating, hunger, and irritability. Treatment of hypoglycemia in a person with diabetes is glucose (sugar). If the cause is another disease or condition, treatment will depend on the cause of the hypoglycemia. An insulin reaction occurs when an individual with diabetes experiences hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) and becomes confused or unconscious. Causes of insulin reaction include improper medication dosing, exercise, or skipping meals. Common symptoms of a mild insulin reaction include dizziness, irritability, hunger, shakiness, rapid heart beat, and sweating. Treatment is generally sugar drinks, tablets, or wafers and monitoring insulin levels. Insulin resistance is a condition associated with several other conditions as well as a genetic component. Some of the conditions associated with insulin resistance include: the metabolic syndrome, stress, obesity, steroid use, or infection. Treatment of insulin resistance include lifestyle modifications (diet and exercise) and if necessary, medications. Metabolic syndrome refers to combination of metabolic disorders and cardiovascular disease that occur together, including: insulin resistance, high blood pressure, abnormal cholesterol levels, and increased risk of blood clots. Causes include obesity, genetic factors, and smoking. Symptoms depend on factors present, but usually include large waistline. Treatment includes diet and exercise and medication. Neuropathy is a term that refers to malfunctions or diseases of the nerves. Types of neuropathy include diabetic neuropathy, autonomic neuropathy, ulnar neuropathy, optic neuropathy, peripheral neuropathy, alcoholic neuropathy, proximal neuropathy, cranial neuropathy, auditory neuropathy, and focal neuropathy. Causes of neuropathy can be disease, injury, infections, or vitamin deficiencies. Symptoms of neuropathy depend on the nerves involved. Treatment is generally medication and lifestyle changes to prevent further nerve damage. More than two-thirds of Americans are overweight, including at least one in five children. Nearly one-third are obese. Obesity is on the rise in our society because food is abundant and physical activity is optional. The safest way to lose weight is to eat less and exercise more. Treatment may also include medications, surgery, and behavior modification. Peripheral vascular disease (PVD or peripheral artery disease) refers to any disease or disorder of the circulatory system outside of the brain and heart. Common causes of peripheral vascular disease include blood clots, diabetes, inflammation of the arteries, infection, structural defects, and injury. Symptoms of peripheral artery disease include buttock pain, numbness, tingling, or weakness in the legs, burning or aching pain in the feet or toes while resting, a sore on a leg or a foot that will not heal, one or both legs or feet feel cold or change color (pale, bluish, dark reddish), loss of hair on the legs, and impotence. Tests are used to diagnose peripheral vascular disease. Treatment guidelines include medication, lifestyle changes, and if necessary, surgical intervention. SIBO (small intestinal bacterial overgrowth) refers to a condition in which abnormally large numbers of bacteria (at least 100,000 bacteria per ml of fluid) are present in the small intestine, but they are more like the bacteria that are found in the colon. There are many conditions associated with SIBO, including:  Diabetes Scleroderma Crohn's disease Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) It has been theorized that SIBO may be responsible for the symptoms of at least some patients with irritable bowel syndrome. Symptoms of SIBO include: Excess gas Abdominal bloating Abdominal pain Treatment for SIBO can include: Antibiotics Probiotics Low FODMAP Diet Obesity is simply the accumulation of excess body fat. It is much more than that, however. Obesity is a chronic (long-term) disease that is very difficult to treat. It takes 3,500 extra calories to gain 1 pound. To lose weight, you must eat 3,500 calories less than you need, say 500 calories per day for one week, to lose 1 pound. What causes diabetes, what tests diagnose it, and what is a good diabetic diet? Learn the signs of being diabetic, the treatments, and the differences between type 1 vs. type 2 diabetes. Type 1 diabetes (insulin dependent) can be caused by heredity, environmental factors, or ethnicity. Type 2 diabetes (non-insulin dependent) can be caused by high blood pressure, high lipid levels, high-fat diet, high alcohol intake, sedentary lifestyle, obesity, ethnicity, or age.

Reviewed By: Type 1 diabetes is a chronic condition that usually starts in childhood, but can occur in adults (30 to 40-year-olds). In type 1 diabetes, the pancreas produces very little insulin. Insulin helps cells in the body convert sugar into energy. When the pancreas cannot make enough insulin, sugar starts to build up in the blood, causing life-threatening complications. Individuals with type 1 diabetes must take some form of insulin for the rest of their lives. Unusual thirst is a very common symptom of type 1 diabetes. This condition causes the kidneys to remove excess sugar in the blood by getting rid of more water. The water is removed through urinating, causing dehydration and dehydration causes you to drink more water. Patient with type 1 diabetes develop unintentional weight loss and an increase in appetite because blood sugar levels remain high and the body metabolizes fat for energy. Disrupted glucose metabolism also causes patient to feel a lack of energy and drowsy for extended periods Excess urination also cause weight loss because many calories are leaving the body in urine. The disruption in glucose metabolism in patient with type 1 diabetes causes skin changes. Type 1 diabetics are at a higher risk for bacterial infections and fungal infections. Poor blood circulation in the skin may also occur. Patient with type 1 diabetes are often infected with fungal infections caused by the yeast Candida albicans. Common fungal infections include athlete's foot, vaginal yeast infection in women, jock itch, ringworm, and diaper rashes in babies. Diaper rash caused by the yeast Candida albicans can spread to other areas of the body such as the stomach and legs. Patient with untreated type 1 diabetes can experience serious symptoms such as blurry vision, numbness or tingling in the extremities (especially the feet), loss of consciousness, fatigue, fruity breath, dry mouth, and diabetic coma. In contrast to high sugars in the blood, occasionally patient with type 1 diabetes can get low blood sugars (hypoglycemia) when their blood glucose level falls suddenly. In patient with type 1 diabetes, loss of consciousness, diabetic coma, and in some cases hypoglycemia, are medical emergencies. Some people who are undiagnosed may have no warning signs, yet still can develop diabetic coma or hypoglycemia. The problem with type 1 diabetes is that the person's cells are deprived of the sugar they need for energy. Without the insulin produced by the pancreas, sugar has difficulty entering the body's cells. Consequently, the body cells start burning fat for energy, which causes ketones to build up in the blood. These acids can change the person's blood pH level and can trigger a life-threatening coma. This is termed diabetic ketoacidosis. Diabetic ketoacidosis is a medical emergency that needs to be treated quickly, usually in a hospital setting. Symptoms of diabetic ketoacidosis include the following: What is the Difference Between Type 1 and Type 2 Diabetes? Type 1 diabetes usually starts in childhood or young adulthood, whereas type 2 diabetes usually starts in adulthood. In patient with type 1 diabetes, the body's immune system attacks and destroys pancreatic cells (Beta cells) that produce insulin. In patient with type 2 diabetes, the pancreas is not attacked and usually produces insulin. However, patient with type 2 diabetes, for numerous reasons, cannot use the available insulin effectively. Patient with type 2 diabetes can have the same symptoms as patient with type 1 diabetes, but patient with type 1 diabetes usually have symptoms occur more rapidly. Type 1 diabetes cannot be prevented, but type 2 diabetes can be prevented or delayed with a healthy lifestyle. When the body’s immune system destroys beta cells in part of the pancreas, type 1 diabetes develops. Beta cells in the pancreas produce insulin. Researchers are not sure why a person's immune system attacks its own insulin producing cells. However, researchers and clinicians suspect that genetic susceptibility and environmental factors raise the risk for developing type 1 diabetes. Scientists have identified genes and gene regions that raise the risk of developing type 1 diabetes, but they are not the only factors that cause the disease. Researchers suggest that environmental triggers such as a viral infection or perhaps dietary or pregnancy-related factors may also play a role in developing type 1 diabetes. Although type 1 diabetes can develop at any age, about two-thirds of new cases are diagnosed in individuals under the age of 19. Researchers have noted two peak times for development of type 1 diabetes; the first is in early childhood and the second occurs at puberty. Type 1 diabetes affects males and females equally, and is more common in Caucasians than in other ethnic groups. A family history of type 1 diabetes also increases one’s risk for developing type 1 diabetes. Simple blood tests can indicate the presence of abnormal sugar levels in the blood. If a person has any symptoms of diabetes, a fasting blood sugar test or even a random blood sugar test is usually the first step in diagnosis. A hemoglobin A1c test can reveal average blood sugar levels for the past 2 to 3 months. In most cases these tests are repeated on at least two separate days. Other tests used are the glucose tolerance test or testing for specific antibodies in the blood. Type 1 diabetes damages arteries and makes them susceptible to hardening (atherosclerosis), which can lead to high blood pressure and other heart and circulation problems. Unfortunately, undiagnosed or prolonged high blood sugar levels can result in damage to organ systems in the body over time. Patient with type 1 diabetes have a high risk of vision problems, heart disease, stroke, kidney failure, gum disease, tooth loss, and nerve damage (especially in the hands and feet). Other organs may also be damaged. For patient with diabetes, complications that can damage organs can be prevented or reduced by regulating their blood sugar level. This is done by pricking the finger and putting a drop of blood on a test strip. The strip is then placed in a monitor that reads the glucose level. Close monitoring of glucose levels allows the individual to regulate their blood sugar by either medication if the sugar is high, or taking in sugar if the level is low. If a person with diabetes is able to keep blood sugar levels in or near the normal range, they will decrease the likelihood of developing complications and have more energy and fewer problems related to diabetes. Another device that measures glucose is termed a continuous glucose monitoring system (CGM). This system consists of a tiny sensor under the skin to check blood sugar levels. It send the information to a cell phone sized device that records an average glucose value every five minutes for about 72 hours. CGM is now accepted for long term use in some patients with models that turn off insulin infusion when sugars start to drop. Every person with type 1 diabetes needs to take insulin to help their body process sugar in the blood. Most people with type 1 diabetes take insulin in the injectable form and require several shots per day. There are different types of insulin available. Rapid-acting insulin starts to work within a few minutes and lasts for a couple of hours. Regular or short-acting insulin takes about 30 minutes to work and lasts 3-6 hours. Intermediate-acting insulin takes 2-4 hours to work and lasts up to 18 hours. You and your doctor can adjust your insulin shots based on results of blood sugar testing. As previously stated, the goal is to keep glucose levels in the blood within normal range as often as possible. Insulin can be injected using a needle and syringe, a cartridge system, or a pre-filled pen system. Inhaled insulin, insulin pumps, and a quick-acting insulin device can also be used. If injecting insulin into your body the best place is the abdomen, but the arms, thighs, and buttocks are also effective. Insulin is a hormone from the pancreas that allows sugar to enter the cells. Insulin also lowers the amount of sugar in the bloodstream. Without insulin, sugar is unable to enter the cells. This means that cells that make up muscles and other tissues will not be able to receive their main source of energy. Patient with type 1 diabetes will have a buildup of sugar in the bloodstream, causing life-threatening conditions. Although insulin is a wonderful drug that helps people with diabetes, it needs to be used carefully. If a person takes too much insulin it is possible the blood sugar level will lower into dangerous levels. This situation is termed an insulin reaction (low blood sugar due to excessive insulin). Too much insulin can result in symptoms that may be mild, moderate, or severe, depending on how low and how long the low blood sugar levels exist in a person's blood. Some signs and symptoms of low blood sugar include fatigue, excessive yawning, mild confusion, decreased coordination, sweating, muscle twitching, and pale skin. As these symptoms get progressively worse, seizures, loss of consciousness, and even death may occur. People with diabetes, especially type 1 diabetes, are advised to carry about 15 grams of a quick-acting carbohydrate at all times. Quick-acting carbohydrates are foods or drinks containing glucose that is rapidly absorbed into the body and the blood. Examples include a half-cup of fruit juice or a non-diet soda, five Life Savers (small hard candies), two tablespoons of raisins, one cup of milk, or three glucose tablets. These carbohydrates may resolve mild to moderate insulin reactions. For severe reactions, a drug called glucagon should be injected under the skin by a family member or friend familiar with treating severe insulin reactions and the person should be seen by a medical health care professional. Although many people administer insulin through several shots per day, some people may be able to utilize an insulin pump. This pump delivers insulin around-the-clock by pushing insulin through a thin tube inserted into the person's skin. The insulin pump can be programmed to deliver exact amounts of insulin in a continuous dose as well as deliver extra doses certain times, typically when eating. People with diabetes are encouraged to discuss the advantages and disadvantages of this insulin delivery system with their doctor. There is a test called the hemoglobin A1c blood test that is used to help determine how well a person is managing their blood glucose levels. This test is taken at the doctor's office and measures how well the blood sugar has been controlled over a 2 to 3 month span. If the results show poor blood sugar control (high A1c levels), it suggests that the person's insulin therapy, dietary habits, and/or physical activity be modified to lower blood sugar levels into a more normal range. Some people with diabetes fail insulin therapy and may have reactions to the insulin that is injected. These people may be candidates for a procedure that some clinicians consider experimental. The procedure is a transfer of healthy insulin-producing cells from a donor into the pancreas of the patient with type 1 diabetes. Although there are benefits to this procedure, there are also drawbacks including medications with serious side effects that must be used to prevent rejection of the donor cells, and the probability that the transplanted cells may only function for a few years. People with type 1 diabetes benefit from exercise, but they need to take precautions to prevent sudden drops in blood glucose levels. Diabetics should check their blood sugars before exercising and may require eating a snack before or during exercise. They may need to adjust their insulin dosage before exercising to ensure they stay within normal ranges of blood glucose. People with type 1 diabetes may also need to check their urine for ketones – ketones suggest that your blood sugar is too high. Strenuous activity needs to be avoided if ketones are detected or if your blood sugar level is either high or low before exercise. People with type 1 diabetes, like everyone else, need to eat a well-balanced diet. This will help their insulin therapy and reduce the chance of diabetic complications. There is no “diabetes diet”. Even a person with type 1 diabetes can eat sweets as long as it is part of a well-balanced diet. That is not to say they can eat anything all the time, but they need to consider how sweets can fit into their well-balanced diet. Type 1 diabetics should also consider the fact that carbohydrates raise blood sugar levels faster than any other food. Food low in carbs, but high in calcium, potassium, fiber, magnesium, and other vitamins are excellent food choices for diabetics. Consider the following guidelines when planning your meals: Healthcare workers such as dietitians can help people with diabetes plan a well-balanced and varied diet. Women with type 1 diabetes need to let their doctors know if they plan to become pregnant. Poor control of their blood sugars may cause complications such as birth defects. Planning ahead, even before conception, to control blood sugar levels can lower the risk of miscarriage and birth defects. During pregnancy, it is important to test blood glucose often and keep your A1c below 7%. Good blood sugar control can reduce other complications during pregnancy such as high blood pressure or retinal damage in the mother. Preeclampsia is a condition that 18%-30% of pregnant women with diabetes develop. Preeclampsia develops after the 20-week mark and is characterized by high blood pressure and proteins in the urine. It is important to treat preeclampsia, if untreated it may harm the baby and put the mother at risk for stroke and seizures. Once the baby is born and if the mother is breastfeeding, it is important for her to check her glucose levels frequently. In the United States, 13,000 children are diagnosed with type 1 diabetes each year. Diagnosis of diabetes in children is a life-changing situation because it affects the whole family. Parents must help children monitor blood sugar and plan family meals that are appropriate for the child with diabetes and other family members. Insulin dosages must be monitored and blood sugar levels need to be checked by the child’s caregivers. Diabetes in children is a 24-hour-a-day problem that needs to be considered when a child is attending school and participating in extracurricular activities. Parents and their children need to make arrangements to follow through with insulin treatments even while the child is at school. These arrangements need to be planned in advance, as not every state or school may participate in the child’s care the same way. Researchers are attempting to develop an artificial pancreas. This device is a combination of an insulin pump and continuous glucose monitoring system controlled by a computer program. The goal for the system is to release insulin in response to blood sugar levels and to reduce the release of insulin if blood sugar levels drop. The goal is to have a device that mimics the function of a normal pancreas. Some early trials of experimental devices suggest this device may be available in the future.

Are There Home Remedies (, Exercise, and Glucose Monitoring) for Diabetes? What Types of Health Care Professionals Treat Diabetes? Are There Support Groups and Counseling for People With Diabetes? Doctor's Notes on Diabetes (Mellitus, Type 1 and Type 2) Symptoms Learn the signs of diabetes and how it can be managed with diet and lifestyle changes. is a condition characterized by the body's inability to regulate glucose () levels in blood. In , the body does not produce enough insulin. People with can produce insulin, but the body is not able to use the insulin effectively. Symptoms of both type 1 and include The cause of type 1 is an autoimmune disorder in which the immune system slowly destroys the insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas. Combinations of genetic factors and unhealthy lifestyle choices cause type 2 diabetes. The main diagnostic test for diabetes is measurement of the blood glucose level. Changes in lifestyle and may be adequate to control type 2 diabetes in some people. Other people with type 2 diabetes require medications. Insulin is essential treatment for type 1 diabetes. To date, only the drug teplizumab has proven effective to slow progression to type 1 diabetes in some early cases detected before clinical onset. No approach has yet proven effective to prevent type 1 diabetes. Prevention of type 2 diabetes can be accomplished in some cases by: sustaining a healthy lifestyle, such as abstinence. Prediabetes is a condition that can occur before development of type 2 diabetes. Any type of over time can damage blood vessels and nerves. Damage to blood vessels can lead to , , and vision problems including . can result in . Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a set of related diseases in which the body cannot regulate the amount of (specifically, glucose) in the blood. The blood delivers glucose to provide the body with energy for all daily activities. The converts the food a person eats into glucose (simple sugar) and stores this glucose as starch (called glycogen). The liver releases stored glucose into the bloodstream between meals. In a healthy person, several hormones tightly regulate the blood glucose level, primarily insulin. Insulin is produced by the pancreas, a small organ located in the upper belly between the stomach and liver. The pancreas also releases other important enzymes directly into the gut to help digest food. Insulin allows glucose to move out of the blood into cells throughout the body, where it is used for fuel. People with diabetes mellitus either do not produce enough insulin (type 1 diabetes), cannot use insulin properly (type 2 diabetes), or both (various forms of diabetes). In diabetic patients, glucose cannot move efficiently from the blood into cells, so blood glucose levels remain high. This not only starves all the cells, which need the glucose for fuel, but over time also harms certain organs and tissues exposed to high glucose levels. The body produces little or no insulin to regulate blood glucose level. T1D affects about 10% of all people with diabetes in the United States. T1D is typically diagnosed during childhood or adolescence. In the past T1D was called juvenile-onset diabetes or insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. Insulin deficiency can occur at any age due to destruction of the pancreas by , disease, or removal by surgery. T1D results from progressive destruction by the immune system of the pancreatic beta cells, the only cell type that produces significant amounts of insulin. People with T1D require daily insulin treatment to sustain life. Although the pancreas still secretes insulin in someone with T2D, the body’s tissues are partially or completely incapable of responding to insulin. This is often referred to as . The pancreas tries to overcome this resistance by secreting more and more insulin. People with insulin resistance develop T2D when they fail to secrete enough insulin to cope with their body's demands. At least 90% of adult individuals with diabetes have T2D. T2D is typically diagnosed during adulthood, usually after age 45 years. It was once called adult-onset diabetes mellitus, or mellitus. These names are no longer used, because T2D can occur in young people, and some people with T2D require insulin therapy. T2D is usually controlled with diet, , , and/or oral medications. However, more than half of all people with T2D require insulin to control their levels at some point during the course of their disease. Gestational diabetes (GDM) is a form of diabetes that occurs during the second half of . Although gestational diabetes typically resolves after , a woman who develops gestational diabetes is more likely than other women to develop T2D later in life. Women with gestational diabetes are more likely to have large , complicated pregnancies, and complicated deliveries. (also referred to as ) is a set of abnormalities in which insulin resistance or T2D is almost always present along with (), high fat levels in the blood (increased serum , predominant elevation of , decreased , and ), central , and abnormalities in blood clotting and inflammatory responses. A high rate of cardiovascular disease is associated with . Prediabetes is a common condition related to diabetes. In people with prediabetes, the blood sugar level is higher than normal but not yet high enough to be considered diagnostic of diabetes mellitus. Prediabetes increases a person's risk of developing T2D, , or . Prediabetes can typically be reversed (without insulin or medication) by sustained lifestyle changes, such as losing a modest amount of weight and increasing physical activity levels. Weight loss can prevent, or at least delay, the onset of T2D. An international expert committee of the American Diabetes Association redefined the criteria for prediabetes, lowering the blood sugar level cut-off point for prediabetes in adults. Approximately 20% more adults are now believed to have this condition and may develop diabetes within 10 years unless they change to healthier lifestyles, such as exercising more and maintaining a healthy weight. About 17 million Americans (6.2% of adults in North America) are believed to have diabetes mellitus. Some experts estimate that about one-third of adults with diabetes do not know they have diabetes mellitus. About 1 million new cases of diabetes mellitus are diagnosed each year. Diabetes mellitus directly or indirectly causes at least 200,000 deaths each year. The rates of people affected by T1D and T2D are increasing rapidly. These increases are due to many factors. The most significant reason for T2D is the increasing number of people due to sedentary lifestyles. T1D is an autoimmune disease. The body's immune system specifically destroys the cells in the pancreas that produce insulin. A predisposition to develop T1D may run in families. However, genetic causes (i.e., a positive family history) are much more common for T2D. Common and unavoidable viral infections are among the environmental factors which contribute to T1D by triggering autoimmunity. T1D is most common among people of non-Hispanic, Northern European descent (especially Finland and Sardinia), followed by African Americans, and Hispanic Americans. It is relatively rare among Asian Americans. T1D most often presents before age 21 but can occur at any age. T2D is strongly linked to genetics, so T2D tends to run in families. Several genes have been linked to T2D, and many more are under study. Risk factors for developing T2D include: Gestational diabetes or giving birth to a baby weighing more than 9 pounds Ethnicity, particularly when a close relative had T2D or gestational diabetes. African Americans, Native Americans, Hispanic Americans, and Japanese Americans display greater risks of developing T2D than non-Hispanic white Americans. : Increasing age is a significant risk factor for T2D. Risk begins to rise significantly at about age 45 years, and rises considerably after age 65 years. Symptoms of type 1 diabetes are often dramatic and come on very suddenly. T1D is usually recognized in childhood or early adolescence, often in association with an injury or illness (such as a virus or ). The extra can cause (DKA). Symptoms of ketoacidosis include and . and often serious disturbances in blood levels of potassium and other factors follow. Without treatment, ketoacidosis can lead to and death. Symptoms of type 2 diabetes are often subtle and may be attributed to or obesity. A person may have T2D for many years without knowing it. People with T2D can develop the hyperglycemic hyperosmolar nonketotic (“HONK”) syndrome. If not properly treated, T2D can lead to complications such as blindness, , , and nerve damage. Common symptoms of both type 1 and type 2 diabetes include: With diabetes, the body’s metabolism is inefficient and sometimes unable to use glucose for fuel. The body switches over to metabolizing fat, partially or completely, as a fuel source. This process requires the body to use more energy. The end result is feeling fatigued or constantly tired. People with diabetes mellitus are unable to metabolize food. They may even though they appear to eat appropriate or even excessive amounts of food. Losing sugar and water in the urine can lead to and unintentional weight loss. A person with diabetes mellitus develops levels. When kidneys filter this blood, the high sugar content overwhelms the kidney's ability to control sugar filtering. The kidney spill excess sugar into the urine, resulting in large amounts of urine. The body tries to counteract this by sending a signal to the brain to dilute the blood, which translates into thirst. Thirst encourages more drinking (i.e., water consumption) to dilute the high blood sugar down to normal levels and to compensate for water lost by excessive urination. Typically, people with undiagnosed diabetes will drink more sugary , not just water, which drives the blood sugar higher. The body tries to rid itself of extra sugar in the blood by dumping it via urine. Excessive urination can cause dehydration because a large amount of water is necessary to excrete high amounts of blood sugar. If able, the pancreas will secrete more insulin to control high blood sugar levels. With T2D, the body resists actions of insulin. One action of insulin is to stimulate hunger. Therefore, higher insulin levels can increase hunger. Despite eating more, the person with diabetes may gain very little weight and may even lose weight. White blood cells are critical to defend the body against infection and also to clean up dead tissue. High blood sugar levels prevent white blood cells from functioning normally. When white blood cells do not function properly, wounds take much longer to heal and become infected more frequently. Long-standing diabetes is also associated with thickening of blood vessels, which prevents good circulation needed to deliver oxygen and other nutrients throughout the body. Diabetes can suppress the immune system. Certain infections may indicate poor blood sugar control and can occur more often in a person with diabetes. These include frequent yeast infections of the genitals, dental infections, skin infections, and frequent . Agitation, unexplained irritability, inattention, extreme lethargy, or confusion can all be signs of high blood sugar, or ketoacidosis, or hyperosmolar nonketotic syndrome (“HONK” syndrome), or (). Thus, any of these in a diabetic person merit immediate medical assessment of blood glucose. Call your health care professional or 911 for immediate attention by a medical professional. Though not specific for diabetes, blurry vision frequently occurs with high blood sugar levels. When Should Someone Seek Medical Care for Type 1 or Type 2 Diabetes? If a person has diabetes and experiences any of the following, contact a health care professional. Experiencing diabetes symptoms. This may indicate an uncontrolled blood sugar level despite treatment. Blood sugar levels are consistently high (more than 200 mg/dL). Chronically high blood sugar level is the root cause of all complications from diabetes. Blood sugar level is often low (less than 70 mg/dL), called hypoglycemia. This may indicate that the strategy is too aggressive. Hypoglycemia could also indicate infection or other stress on the body's organs, such as kidney failure, liver failure, adrenal gland failure, other conditions, or the concomitant use of certain medications. Injury to the foot or leg, no matter how minor. Even the tiniest cut or blister can become seriously infected in a person with diabetes. Early diagnosis and treatment of problems affecting the and lower extremities, along with regular , are critical to preserve function of the legs and to prevent amputation. Each person with long-standing diabetes must perform self-care by examining their feet daily for wounds. A person can use a mirror or smartphone on a selfie stick to inspect or document the bottoms of his or her own feet. Low-grade (below 101.5 F or 38.6 C). Fever can be one sign of infection. Many common infections can potentially be more dangerous for diabetic people than non-diabetic people. Note symptoms may indicate where the infection is located, such as , redness or swelling of skin, , , or . Nausea or vomiting despite keeping liquids down. The health care professional may adjust medications while the patient is sick. The health care professional will probably recommend an urgent office visit or a visit to the emergency department. Persistent nausea and vomiting can be a sign of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) or other serious illnesses. DKA can threaten life. Small sore(s) or ulcer on the foot or leg. Any non-healing sore or ulcer on the feet or legs of a diabetic person must be evaluated by a medical professional. Even a sore less than 1 inch wide, not draining pus, and not exposing deep tissue or bone should be evaluated by a health care professional. When you contact a health care professional, tell the person you are concerned because you or someone you know has diabetes. The patient will probably be referred to a nurse who will ask questions and initially recommend what to do. Be prepared for this conversation. Have handy by the phone a list of all medications and nutritional , medical problems, to medicines, and a blood sugar diary. The nurse may need any or all of this information to decide both the urgency of the patient's condition and how best to treat the problem. The following situations can become medical emergencies (call 911) and warrant an immediate visit to a hospital emergency department. Anyone with a severe diabetic complication should travel to an emergency department by car or ambulance. If the person is unable to speak for himself or herself, a companion should accompany him or her to speak with the health care professional. Always bring a complete and current list of medical problems, medications, nutritional , to medications, and the person's blood sugar diary to the emergency department. This information will help the health care professional diagnose the problem and treat it appropriately. Signs and symptoms of diabetic complications that warrant emergency care Lethargy, agitation, forgetfulness, or just strange behavior can be a sign of low or high blood sugar levels. If a person with diabetes has an altered mental status, then try giving him or her some fruit juice (about 6 ounces) or cake icing if the person is awake enough to swallow normally without . Avoid giving things that can lodge in the throat, such as hard candy. The health care professional can prescribe glucose wafers or gels that melt under the tongue or (a medication given into the nose or by injection). If a diabetic person does not wake up within about 5 minutes and behave normally within about 15 minutes, call 911. If the person is not known to have diabetes, these symptoms can be signs of , drug intoxication, , oxygen starvation, and other serious medical conditions. Call 911 immediately. If a diabetic person cannot keep down food, medications, or fluids at all, he or she may have diabetic ketoacidosis, hyperosmolar hyperglycemic nonketotic (HONK) syndrome, or another complication of diabetes. If he or she has not already taken his or her latest insulin dose or oral diabetes medicine, then contact a medical professional. If he or she already has low blood sugar levels, taking additional insulin or medication may drive the blood sugar level down even further, possibly to dangerous levels. If the primary health care professional cannot see the patient right away, seek emergency care for a person with diabetes and high fever. Note any other symptoms such as , painful urination, , or chest pain. If the person’s blood sugar level is above 400 mg/dL, and the primary health care professional cannot see him or her right away, go to the closest emergency department. High blood sugar levels can be a sign of DKA or HONK syndrome. Both conditions can be fatal if not treated promptly. For a diabetic person, a nonhealing sore larger than 1 inch in diameter can be a sign of a potentially limb-threatening infection. Other signs and symptoms that merit immediate care are exposed bone or deep tissue , large areas of surrounding redness and warmth, swelling, and severe pain in the foot or leg. Left untreated, such a sore may ultimately require amputation of the limb. Any cut penetrating all the layers of skin, especially on the legs, is a potential danger to a person with diabetes. Although important to anyone's recovery, proper is critical in diabetic people to assure proper wound healing. Take seriously any or arms (particularly in the middle of the chest or along the left side), and immediately seek medical attention. Diabetic people are more likely than nondiabetic people to have a , with or without experiencing chest pain. Irregular heartbeats and unexplained shortness of breath may also be signs of heart attack. Depending on the location, this can be a sign of heart attack, (dangerous widening of the large artery in the abdomen), DKA, or interrupted blood flow to the bowels. All these are more common in people with diabetes than in the general population. All are potentially life-threatening. People with diabetes also get other common causes of severe abdominal pain, such as , perforated ulcer, inflammation and infection of the gallbladder, , and bowel obstruction. Severe pain anywhere in the body is a signal for timely medical attention. Diabetes: What Raises and Lowers Your Blood Sugar Level? What Tests Do Health Care Professionals Use to Diagnose Diabetes? Doctors use common tests to diagnose diabetes and monitor blood sugar control. The health care professional will take a history including information about the patient's symptoms, risk factors for diabetes, past medical problems, current medications, allergies to medications, family history of diabetes, or other medical problems (such as or heart disease), and personal habits and lifestyle. Various laboratory tests can confirm the diagnosis of diabetes. This rapid test may be performed anywhere, including community-based screening programs. Although not as accurate as testing blood in a hospital laboratory, a fingerstick blood glucose test is easy to perform, and the adequate result is available quickly. The test involves sticking the patient's finger for a tiny blood sample. The blood drop is placed on a strip to be inserted into a machine that reports the blood sugar level. These portable machines are accurate to within about 10%-20% of true laboratory values. Fingerstick blood glucose values tend to be most inaccurate at very high or very low levels. Abnormally low or high results should be confirmed by repeat testing. Point-of-care testing is how most people with diabetes monitor their blood sugar levels at home. The patient will be asked to eat or drink nothing for eight hours before having blood drawn, usually first thing in the morning. If the blood glucose level is greater than or equal to 126 mg/dL (without eating anything) at any age, the person probably has diabetes. If the result is unclear, further testing may be performed to confirm diabetes. Such testing can be a fasting plasma glucose repeated on a different day, an oral glucose tolerance test (described below), or a fingerstick (called """" and described below). If fasting plasma glucose level is greater than 100 mg/dL but less than 126 mg/dL, then the patient has impaired fasting glucose, or IFG. IFG is prediabetes. Though patients with IFG do not yet have diabetes, they carry high risk of developing diabetes in the near future. After fasting for at least six hours, the health care professional draws blood to measure plasma glucose before and at two hours after drinking a specific sweet drink (which contains up to 75 grams of sugar). If the blood sugar level rises to 200 mg/dL or higher, the patient has diabetes. If the blood glucose level rises to between 140 and 199 mg/dL after the sugary drink, then the patient has impaired glucose tolerance (IGT). IGT is also a prediabetic condition. This test measures how high the blood sugar levels have been over approximately the last 120 days, which is the average life span of the red blood cells on which this test is based. Glucose attaches naturally on hemoglobin in red blood cells and stays there for the remaining life of the red blood cell. The percentage of hemoglobin with attached sugar can be measured in a small blood drop, obtained by fingerstick or blood draw. The is a practical measure of blood sugar control in most people with diabetes. The normal hemoglobin A1c value is under 6%. Hemoglobin A1c levels at or below 7% indicate good glucose control. Results at or above 8% indicate blood sugar levels are high too often. The hemoglobin A1c test is most useful for diabetes follow-up care. Though occasionally suboptimal for diagnosing diabetes, hemoglobin A1c above 6% is highly suggestive of diabetes. Often another test will support the diagnosis of diabetes. The hemoglobin A1c is usually measured about every three to six months in people with diabetes. It may be done more frequently for people with difficulty achieving and maintaining good blood sugar control. This test is rarely used to document chronic hypoglycemia in nondiabetic patients. Normal values may vary from laboratory to laboratory. Various treatments exist for diabetes. T1D requires insulin (by multiple daily injections or a pump), diabetic diet, and other lifestyle modifications. T2D is generally treated with diabetic diet, lifestyle changes (such as moderate to vigorous exercise), and medication(s). Are There Home Remedies (, Exercise, and Glucose Monitoring) for Diabetes? If a person has diabetes, healthful lifestyle choices in diet, exercise, , and other habits will help improve glycemic (blood sugar) control and prevent or minimize complications from diabetes. A healthy diet is key to controlling blood sugar levels and preventing . Patients who are obese and have had difficulty losing weight on their own should talk to a health care professional. He or she can recommend a dietitian, help set feasible goals, or supervise a weight-modification program. Eat a consistent, well-balanced diet high in fiber, low in saturated fat, low in concentrated sweets, and eliminate excess calories. A consistent diet includes roughly the same number of calories at predictably similar times of day. Such a disciplined diet helps match the correct dose of insulin or other medications. A healthy diet helps keep the blood sugar level relatively even. A healthy, predictable diet avoids excessively low or high blood sugar levels, which can be dangerous and even life-threatening. In any form, regular exercise helps reduce the risk of developing diabetes. Activity can reduce the risk of developing diabetes-related complications such as heart disease, , kidney failure, blindness, and leg ulcers. As little as 20 minutes of three times a week has proven beneficial. Any exercise is beneficial. No matter how easy or how long, some exercise is better than no exercise. Reducing the time spent sitting is helpful. Patients who have diabetes-related complications (such as eye, kidney, or nerve problems) may be limited in both the type of exercise and the amount of exercise they can safely perform. Consult your health care professional before starting any exercise program. Moderate or eliminate alcohol consumption. One drink is considered 1.5 ounces of liquor, 6 ounces of wine, or 12 ounces of beer. Adult men should not consume more than seven alcoholic in a week, and never more than two drinks in an evening. Adult women should not consume more than three alcoholic drinks in a week, and never more than one drink in an evening. Excessive alcohol use is a known risk factor for T2D. Alcohol consumption can cause low or high blood sugar levels, cause (neuritis), and increase . If a diabetic person smokes cigarettes or uses any other form of , he or she dramatically raises his or her risks for nearly all diabetes-related complications. damages blood vessels. contributes to heart disease, stroke, and poor circulation in the limbs. People who need help to quit tobacco use should talk to a health care professional. Check blood sugar levels frequently, then record the results in a logbook or digital record. At a minimum, check blood sugar before meals and at bedtime. The glucose log should include the doses and times of administration for insulin or oral medications, when and what the person ate, when and for how long the person exercised, and any significant events of the day (such as high or low blood sugar levels and how the person treated the problem). Many mobile applications (""apps"") exist to help log and share data. Simple equipment exists to test sugar levels less painfully and more conveniently. The daily sugar diary is invaluable both to self-management and to professional evaluation of responses to medications, diet, and exercise. Medicare pays for diabetic testing supplies, as do many private insurers and Medicaid. Continuous glucose monitors (CGMs) are useful devices that measure and log glucose levels under the skin. CGMs and their logs can be highly helpful tools for managing diabetes. CGMs must be calibrated carefully with blood glucose monitoring. Treatment of diabetes is highly individualized. Treatment depends on the specific type of diabetes, co-existing medical problems, presence of diabetes-related complications, and the physical and mental skills of the affected person. A health care team helps set healthy and feasible goals for lifestyle changes, blood sugar control, and treatment. Together, the affected person and his or her health care team formulate a plan to help meet these goals. Education about diabetes and its treatment is essential. At the initial diagnosis of diabetes, the health care team will spend much time educating the patient about the condition, treatment, and practical skills for daily self-care. The diabetes care team includes the health care professional and support staff. A professional dietitian and a diabetes educator are usually part of the team. The team may include specialists in hormone health (endocrinology), foot care (podiatry), , kidney diseases (nephrology), eye diseases (ophthalmology), and behavioral health (psychology or psychiatry). Among reputable sources, the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Disease (NIDDK) provides information on diabetes and related research including clinical trials. The health care team will encounter the patient at appropriate intervals to monitor progress and evaluate goals. Treatment of T1D involves multiple daily injections of insulin or continuous insulin delivery by a pump. Daily injections usually combine short-acting insulin (e.g., lispro [], aspart [ or Fiasp], regular) and a long-acting insulin (e.g., NPH, lente, glargine [ or Basaglar], detemir []). Insulin must be given as an injection just under the skin. If taken by mouth, insulin would be destroyed in the stomach before it could get into the blood where it is needed. Most people with T1D inject themselves. Even if someone else usually injects the insulin, every person taking insulin must know how to inject insulin in case the other person is unavailable. A trained professional will show the patient how to store and inject insulin. Usually this is a nurse or a diabetes educator. Fast-acting insulin is usually injected three or four times each day, generally around mealtimes. Dosage is individualized and tailored to the patient's specific needs. Long-acting insulin formulations are typically administered once or twice each day. Some people prefer to receive fast-acting insulin continuously by infusion pumps. Supplemental mealtime insulin is programmed into the pump by the individual in consultation with his or her health care team. It is important to match food intake with insulin dosing, because insulin lowers blood sugar regardless of whether a person eats or not. If excessive insulin is received relative to food intake, the result may be hypoglycemia. This is called an . During the adjustment period after initial diagnosis, the individual learns how insulin affects him or her. He or she learns how to time meals and exercise with insulin injections to keep blood sugar levels as even as possible. Many people with diabetes struggle with adjustment to their condition, especially maintaining high motivation and resilience after many years coping with diabetes. Keeping accurate records of sugar levels and insulin dosages is crucial for diabetes management. Eating a consistent, healthy diet appropriate for the patient's diagnosis and weight is essential to control sugar levels and to prevent diabetes-related complications. Depending on several factors upon diagnosis of T2D, the person may be able to control blood sugar through lifestyle changes, without medication. Such factors include but are not limited to the patient’s age, motivation, self-discipline with diet and exercise, duration of T2D prior to clinical diagnosis, and co-existing conditions. For obese people with T2D, the best initial approach includes dietary restrictions and an exercise program under the supervision of a physician with the aim of weight loss. This course will generally be tried for three to six months. If blood sugar and glycosylated hemoglobin remain high, then the person will receive oral medication, usually a sulfonylurea or biguanide ( []). Even on medication, a healthy diet and physical activity are essential to lose weight or to maintain a healthy weight. People should perform moderate to vigorous physical activity as often as possible. The health care professional will carefully monitor the patient's progress on medication. The therapeutic goals are the right dose(s) of the right medication(s) at the right time(s) to control blood sugar levels with few side effects. Over time, people with T2D often require insulin injections to control their sugar levels. People with T2D commonly take a combination of oral medication and insulin injections to control sugar levels. Many different types of medications are available to help lower blood sugar levels in people with T2D. Each medication works in a different way. Combining two or more medications commonly gets better outcomes. These stimulate the pancreas to release more insulin. Sometimes, the pancreas lacks enough stored insulin to respond adequately to sulfonylurea. These decrease the amount of glucose produced by the liver by improving its sensitivity to insulin. These slow absorption of starch as a person eats, which slows down the rise of blood glucose level during and after meals. These increase tissue sensitivity to insulin but are restricted in the U.S. market. These stimulate the pancreas to release more insulin. These stimulate the pancreas to release more insulin more quickly. Sodium-glucose co-transporter 1 (SGLT2) inhibitors: These block reabsorption of glucose by the kidney, leading to increased glucose excretion and reduction of blood sugar levels. are more common with SGLT2 inhibitors due to higher sugar levels in the urine. Amylin is a naturally occurring hormone secreted by the pancreas along with insulin. Amylin derivatives, such as (), help lower blood sugar levels after meals when insulin alone does not. Pramlintide is injected subcutaneously along with insulin. These promote insulin release by the pancreas. They mimic other natural actions that lower blood sugar level. () was the first incretin mimetic agent approved in the U.S. It is indicated for T2D in addition to metformin (Glucophage) or a sulfonylurea, when these agents alone cannot control the sugar level. Only synthetic types of human insulin are available in the U.S., since they are less likely to cause allergic reactions than the animal-derived insulin used in the past. Different formulations of insulin are categorized according to action onset and duration. Commercial mixtures of insulin sometimes provide constant (basal) control and immediate control. Rapid-acting insulin formulations: Prompt insulin zinc (Semilente, slightly slower acting) Intermediate-acting insulin formulations: Isophane insulin, neutral protamine Hagedorn (NPH) (, ) Long-acting insulin formulations: Both T1D and T2D create high blood sugar levels, called hyperglycemia. Over years, hyperglycemia damages the of the eye, blood vessels of the kidneys and other organs, and the nerves. Damage to the retina from diabetes () is the leading cause of acquired blindness. Damage to the kidneys from diabetes () is the leading cause of acquired kidney failure. Damage to the nerves from diabetes () is a major cause of foot wounds and ulcers. It remains the leading cause of nontraumatic amputations of feet and legs. Damage to the nerves in the autonomic can lead to paralysis of the stomach (gastroparesis), , and an inability to control heart rate and during postural changes (dysautonomia). Diabetes accelerates , (the formation of fatty plaques inside the arteries), which can lead to blockages or a clot (thrombus). Such changes can then lead to heart attack, stroke, and decreased circulation in the arms and legs (). Diabetes predisposes people to elevated blood pressure (), high levels of and . Both independently and together with hyperglycemia, these conditions increase the risk of heart disease, , and other blood vessel complications. Diabetes can contribute to a number of acute medical problems. Acute means coming on suddenly rather than developing slowly over time (chronic). Many are associated with diabetes. Infections are frequently more dangerous in someone with diabetes because the body's normal ability to fight infections is impaired. Infections may worsen glucose control, which further delays recovery from infections. or low blood sugar occurs intermittently in most people with diabetes. It can result from receiving too much diabetes medication or insulin (an insulin reaction), missing a meal, exercising more than usual, drinking too much alcohol, or taking certain medications for other conditions. You should recognize hypoglycemia and must be prepared to treat it at any time. , feeling dizzy, poor concentration, tremor of the hands, and are common symptoms of hypoglycemia. A person can faint or lose consciousness with a if blood sugar level becomes too low. DKA is a serious condition in which uncontrolled hyperglycemia causes dehydration and inadequate insulin allows buildup of blood ketones (acidic waste products). High acid and altered salt levels in the blood can threaten life. DKA typically occurs at the initial diagnosis of T1D and in people with poor glucose control. DKA can be precipitated by infection, stress, , missing medications like insulin, or medical emergencies such as a stroke or heart attack. Hyperosmolar hyperglycemic nonketotic (HONK) syndrome is a serious condition in which high blood sugar level leads to severe dehydration. When the body tries to rid its excess sugar via the urine, this can cause severe dehydration leading to , coma, and even death. HONK syndrome typically occurs in people with T2D who are not controlling their sugar levels, who have become dehydrated, or who have stress, injury, stroke, or are taking certain medications, like steroids. A person with diabetes should be checked regularly for early signs of diabetic complications. A primary health care professional can order some tests. Other tests require referral to a specialist. People with diabetes who have entered or passed should have their eyes checked at least once a year by an eye specialist (ophthalmologist) to screen for , a leading cause of acquired blindness. The urine should be checked for protein (microalbumin) on a regular basis, at least once annually. Urinary protein is an early sign of diabetic nephropathy, a leading cause of acquired kidney failure. Sensation in the legs should be checked regularly using a tuning fork or a monofilament device. is a leading cause of lower extremity ulcers in individuals with diabetes and the leading contributor to nontraumatic amputations of the feet or legs. The health care professional should check the feet and lower legs of adult diabetic patients at every visit for cuts, scrapes, , or other lesions that could become infected. Adults with diabetes should check the soles of their feet and their legs daily with a hand-held mirror or camera, either themselves or with the assistance of a relative or caretaker. The adult patient should be screened regularly for conditions that may contribute to heart disease, such as and . Follow treatment recommendations of your health care team. Keep records of blood sugar levels or CGM results as often as recommended by your health care team, including times when levels were checked, when and how much insulin or medication was taken, when and what was eaten, and when and for how long the patient exercised. Contact your health care professional if you have issues with treatment or symptoms suggesting poor glucose control. Fast-acting glucose should always be available for emergency use in case of hypoglycemia. Glucagon should always be available for emergency use by the patient or patient's support in case of seizure or unconsciousness suspected to be due to hypoglycemia. People with diabetes should always wear a medical identification tag that identifies their diagnosis and shows contact information for their healthcare provider. For children with diabetes, it is appropriate to show contact information for the parent(s). Attend diabetes education classes at the local hospital. The more educated you and your family are about your diabetes, the better your health is likely to be. If taking insulin, you should see your health care professional about every three months at a minimum. Every three to six months is generally adequate for those with uncomplicated diabetes and not taking insulin. Become educated to recognize the signs and symptoms of low blood sugar levels. Have a clear plan for treating low blood sugar levels, and know when to call 911. Mild symptoms include confusion and . These symptoms can progress to lethargy, agitation (sometimes with violent, jerking motions), or . No approach has yet been approved by the FDA to prevent T1D, though recent research showed promising results for teplizumab for some at highest risk of developing T1D. Control weight to normal or near-normal levels by eating a healthy low-fat, high-fiber diet with appropriate content of calories. Regular physical activity is essential to prevent T2D. To control high blood fat levels (e.g., high total ) or high blood pressure, take medications as directed. Lifestyle modifications and/or certain medications can sometimes prevent progression of prediabetes to T2D. Prediabetes can be diagnosed by checking fasting glucose or two hours after ingesting up to 75 grams of glucose (dose based on patient’s weight). If you or someone you know has any type of diabetes, focus on preventing diabetes-related complications. Complications can cause serious disabilities, such as blindness, kidney failure requiring dialysis, amputation, or even death. Tight glucose control! The single best thing people with diabetes can do is to keep their blood sugar level within the suggested range every day. The only way to accomplish this goal is the combination of glucose monitoring, appropriate diet, high personal motivation sustained over time, and appropriate medical treatment. Consult a nutritionist or your health care professional regarding diet. Quit smoking and stop use of other tobacco products. Increase physical activity. Adults should aim for moderate to vigorous physical activity lasting at least 30 minutes every day. Drink adequate amounts of water, and avoid consuming excessive salt. Take care of your skin. Keep it supple and hydrated to avoid sores and cracks that can become infected. Brush and floss your at least twice every day. Encounter your dentist and dental hygienist regularly to prevent tooth decay and . Wash and examine your feet daily. Including the soles, look for small cuts, sores, or blisters that may worsen. File toenails to avoid damaging the surrounding skin, rather than cutting them. A specialist in foot care (podiatrist) may be necessary to help care for your feet. Diabetes is a leading cause of death in all industrialized nations. Overall, the risk of premature death of people with diabetes is twice that of people without diabetes. Prognosis depends on the duration of diabetes, degree of blood sugar control, and development of complications. About 15% of people with T1D die before age 40 years, which is about 20 times the rate of this age group in the general population. Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), kidney failure, and heart disease compose the most common causes of death related to T1D. The good news is prognosis improves with good sugar control. Maintaining tight blood (or CGM) sugar control prevents, slows the progression of, and can improve established complications of T1D. The life expectancy of people who are diagnosed with T2D during their 40s decreases by five to 10 years because of the disease. Heart disease leads the causes of death related to T2D. Aim for excellent glycemic control, tight blood pressure control, keeping the ""bad"" (LDL) level at the recommended level below 100 mg/dL (or even lower, particularly if other risk factors for cardiovascular disease are present), and keeping the ""good"" () cholesterol as high as possible. When indicated, can prevent, slow the progression of, and improve established complications related to diabetes. What Types of Health Care Professionals Treat Diabetes? Most primary care providers have experience managing diabetes, including internists, gynecologists, and family practitioners. Specialists in diabetes care are called endocrinologists or diabetologists. You can locate endocrinologists using the ""Find an Endocrinologist"" search engine online at the . You can locate a pediatric endocrinologist for diabetic youth using the ""Find a Doctor"" search engine of the . Are There Support Groups and Counseling for People With Diabetes? Consider joining a support group to share your experiences and learn from others. The , Hormone Health Network, and local chapters of Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation International are excellent resources. Your health care team will have information about local groups in your area.

An individual nutrition plan will depend on many things, including underlying health and level of physical activity, the types of medication(s) being taken, and personal preference. Most people with type 2 diabetes find that having a fairly regular schedule for meals and snacks is helpful. Eating a variety of foods and watching portion sizes is also recommended.

c4b77cf6-abaa-4104-ab37-ebcdd1a8dcd5,"When blood sugar levels are over 400 mg/dl, it’s no joke. There are many serious risks associated with blood sugar levels this high, but the good news is there are ways to prevent such high levels. Normal blood sugar levels range from 70 mg/dl to 120 mg/dl. High blood sugar levels may cause you to feel tired, thirsty and feel the urge to urinate frequently. Other side effects include increased susceptibility to infections and blurry vision.For diabetics who are in the later stages in life, a high blood sugar level can result in dehydration and electrolyte imbalance. While the symptoms discussed above are associated with high blood sugar levels in general, there are two main dangers that are specifically linked to blood sugar levels over 400. The first is hyperosmolar hyperglycemic nonketotic syndrome (HHNS). HHNS occurs when the body’s blood sugar levels rise to unsafe levels. As a result, the body tries to get rid of the excess sugar by passing it into the urine. Eventually this could result in severe dehydration which in turn can lead to seizures, coma and even death. There are several reasons why HHNS can occur: illness, infection, skipping doses of medicine or not adhering to one’s prescribed meal plan. Symptoms of HHNS include extreme thirst, dry skin, high fever, sleepiness, loss of vision, hallucinations and weakness on one side of the body. If you are experiencing the following symptoms, call your doctor immediately. In the meantime, drink plenty of fluids to prevent dehydration and test your sugar so that you can report your findings to the doctor. The other danger that is associated with high blood sugar levels is diabetic ketoacidosis. This condition occurs when there are high levels of ketones (acids that build up in the blood) in the body from excess blood sugar. Symptoms of diabetic ketoacidosis include thirst, frequent urination, sleepiness, dry skin, nausea, trouble breathing, confusion and high blood sugar levels. Should you experience any of these symptoms, call your doctor immediately as diabetic ketoacidosis can result in coma or death. Be sure to check your urine for ketones every 4 to 6 hours so that you can monitor the situation and keep your doctor updated. Although these short-term effects of blood sugar levels over 400 can be frightening, the long-term effects are also to be concerned with. Persistent high blood sugar levels can result in eye disease, also known as retinopathy, which can lead to blindness. Another complication is kidney disease, known as nephropathy, which can lead to kidney failure. Neuropathy which is a nerve disease that commonly leads to amputations. There are a host of other issues that can occur as a result of unchecked sugar levels including, heart disease. There is no doubt that having a blood sugar level over 400 is a dangerous thing, but the question is, what can you do to lower these risks? Proper diet is key to lowering the risks associated with high blood sugar. Since carbohydrates are the body’s main source of blood sugar, diabetics need to eat carbohydrates that the body will break down very slowly to avoid large upswings in blood sugar levels. The glycemic index rates carbohydrates according to how long it takes the body to absorb them and how severely they impact blood sugar levels. Diabetics should try to stick with carbohydrates rated 55 or less on the glycemic index. Carbohydrates rated between 56 and 69 should be consumed in moderation, and those with a glycemic-index rating of 70 and higher should be avoided. In addition to eating right, make sure you follow your doctor’s guidelines for taking your diabetes medication and checking your sugar. Set a specific time for these activities so that you do not forget. Diabetes does not have to be a life changing condition. With hard work and consistency, you can stay healthy for many years to come. ABCNews.com: What Causes High Blood Sugar And What Harm Can It Do To My Body?

2b545365-c075-48e5-86e6-bedc55c97dc6,"Some people believe that ketosis and ketoacidosis are the same condition, but these are two different conditions related to the body’s metabolism. Learning the differences between ketosis vs ketoacidosis will help to dispel myths surrounding their cause and diagnosis. is a state in which the body starts burning fat for energy due to lack of new glucose in the diet. Althugh ketosis is commonly seen in individuals participating in a low-carb diet, it is also seen in people suffering from a lack of insulin as well as prolonged periods of fasting or starvation. Carbohydrates provide the body with glucose. The pancreas secretes a hormone called insulin that works with the glucose in the bloodstream to provide energy to the body’s organs and cells. When the glucose supply is exhausted, it begins to break down stored fat to meet its energy needs for normal functioning. The accumulation of ketone molecules in the blood make it extremely acidic. This irritates the kidneys, which flush out ketones through urine. Ketosis gets its name from the ketones that are produced in the process of breaking down the fat. In a healthy person, the amount of fat that is burned and ketones that are produced is tightly controlled, causing no harmful side effects. Dietary ketosis seen in those participating in low-carbohydrate diets can be quite helpful in losing weight, as fat is burned in the entire process to gain energy. As ketosis is usually a diet-induced process, it isn’t harmful, unlike ketoacidosis, which is a life-threatening condition. Diabetic ketoacidosis is a condition afflicting mainly type 1 diabetes patients who suffer from hyperglycemia as a result of lack of insulin. Inadequate insulin levels result in the failure of the body to utilize blood glucose as a fuel source; rather, to compensate the decreased energy levels, the body starts breaking down fat, resulting in ketones. Without insulin to control the amount of ketones produced during this process, an excessive amount is produced. The high concentration of ketones coupled with heightened blood glucose levels causes the blood to become significantly acidic. As a result of high blood sugar levels and inadequate insulin, acidic ketones create chemical imbalance in the body and produce life-threatening symptoms and can even cause death. Diabetic ketoacidosis in children might be the result of undiagnosed diabetic mellitus. Symptoms of diabetic ketoacidosis in children are: Fruity-scented breath, primarily because of ketones In the case of adults, common diabetic ketoacidosis symptoms are: Though type 1 diabetes patients are more vulnerable to developing diabetic ketoacidosis, in some cases, type 2 diabetes patients, too, can develop this condition due to prolonged illness. Now that we have understood both Ketosis and Ketoacidosis, it is clear how both terms differ. Ketosis, in most cases, is a diet-induced condition that results in the body breaking down fat and fatty acid to create energy because of inadequate glucose supply in the diet, normally from a low-carbohydrate diet, a prolonged fast or starvation. Diabetic ketoacidosis is a condition when the body cannot use blood glucose to produce energy due to lack of insulin and thus uses its muscle mass, fat, and fatty acid. In ketosis, do not cause harm to the body because insulin keeps a check on their production. In diabetic ketoacidosis, the blood becomes extremely acidic because of high sugar levels, inadequate insulin and an excess of ketones, resulting in chemical imbalance in the body. Remain strict with your diabetes management by taking daily doses of insulin, following a heart-healthy diet and adding physical activity to your daily routine. This would keep diabetic ketoacidosis at bay to a great extent. 3.

2843d668-b278-42c5-a442-72899a4731f6,"is a medical condition where the body either produces an insufficient supply of insulin or is unable to utilize insulin efficiently. Insulin is a hormone that helps convert carbohydrates into energy to fuel the body. Without insulin, sugar levels skyrocket which may lead to other health problems such as blindness, heart disease, neuropathy, limb amputations, kidney failures and stroke. There is no cure for diabetes, but it can be managed by avoiding bad foods for diabetes, participating in a regular regimen of physical activity and possibly medication. To know more about proper diabetes diet plan, please see . is already stripped of their fiber, magnesium and other nutrients. The process of turning the rice white increases the end-products’ glycemic index, resulting in spikes in blood sugar after consuming it. As reported by the Scientific American website, eating of brown rice instead of white can lower the risk of type II diabetes by 16 percent and eating of barley or whole wheat instead of white rice can lower the risk by 36 percent. uses regular flour that has been processed and stripped of its fiber and other nutrients. This favorite has a high glycemic index. Instead of going for white pasta, choose protein-enriched or whole wheat pasta. contains alloxan, a chemical that destroys the beta cell of the pancreas, which can have a harmful affect on patients with type 2 diabetes. Alloxan induces uric acid, which destroys the pancreas’ beta cells’ DNA. As a result, the beta cell may function abnormally after a time and cease adequate insulin secretion. Alloxan is the common cause for the early onset of type 2 diabetes in adults. is also called sucrose, which is a chemically processed food product. The problem with white sugar is that when it gets into the body, it is quickly absorbed and flows into the blood stream, which causes high blood glucose level (hyperglycemia). White sugar can also lead to obesity, kidney stones, hypertension, candidaiasis, reduced immunity and menstrual disorders. should not exceed more than 7 percent of calories, according to ADA (American Diabetes Association), since diabetics are at high risk of heart disease. High levels of trans-fat and saturated fats can increase the danger of diseases like stroke and heart related ailments. Reduce intake of egg yolks, whole milk and meat products. Instead, go for skinless chicken, seafood and lean meat. Stay away from foods that have high-hydrogenated oil content such as butter, oil and animal fat. Do not be scammed by products claiming zero-trans fats; this label is misleading, as it doesn’t mean that they are totally without trans-fats. such as tea and coffee can contains glucagons and adrenaline hormones that stimulate the release of the liver’s stored sugar that may result in elevated blood sugar levels.

It can damage nerve cells and increase the numbness, pain, burning and tingling sensations that are symptoms of diabetic nerve damage. Especially to those who are suffering from eye disease and high blood pressure, alcohol can worsen the condition. It can also cause low blood sugar levels in diabetics, possibly leading to hypoglycemia.

Moderate exercise during the day can help people sleep better, while not getting enough sleep may lead to lower levels of daily physical activity. Some types of exercise promote than others. Understanding which exercises are best for sleep – and when you should – can help ensure you get enough rest on a nightly basis. promotes more rapid breathing and faster heartbeats. This type of exercise can and reduce your risk of heart disease. Aerobic exercise is measured in intensity. Moderate-intensity activities will increase your heart rate and cause you to perspire. Examples include brisk walking, water aerobics, and semi-hilly bike rides. Vigorous-intensity aerobics, which can raise your heart rate to a much greater extent, include running or jogging, lap-swimming, intense bike rides, and physically demanding sports like basketball or singles tennis. An informal way of measuring the intensity of aerobic activities is known as the Talk Test. During moderate-intensity exercises, you can talk at a normal rate but most won’t be able to sing. For vigorous-intensity activities, most people can’t speak more than a few words before they need to catch their breath. Studies have found that regular aerobic exercise for prolonged periods can improve sleep quality and reduce excessive daytime sleepiness for people with insomnia. Research also shows moderate-intensity aerobic activities can decrease the severity of sleep-disordered breathing conditions like obstructive sleep apnea. Interestingly, some studies suggest moderate-intensity aerobic exercise may improve sleep quality more than vigorous-intensity activities. Traditionally, sleep experts have advised against exercising at night because physical activities can increase the heart rate and make falling asleep more difficult. However, some studies have noted that moderate or vigorous workouts before bed have on sleep onset or sleep quality. Resistance exercise, also known as strength training, focuses on building muscle strength throughout the body. Health experts recommend a mix of aerobic and resistance exercise in order to improve different aspects of your physiological health. Examples of resistance exercise include: The key to effective strength training is repetition. You should perform sets of resistance exercises that include up to 12 repetitions apiece. Strength training can initially be very difficult, so first-timers may begin with one set of each activity per workout and gradually increase to multiple sets once they are comfortable. Like aerobic activities, regular can improve sleep quality and other aspects of your nightly rest. Strength training can also lower your risk for anxiety and depression, two for sleep disorders like insomnia. However, the effects of resistance training on sleep quality and architecture have not been extensively studied. Yoga is a specific type of resistance training that focuses on posture improvement, breathing exercises, and meditation. Yoga has been shown to alleviate stress, help people lose weight, and reduce pain in the neck and lower back. Practicing yoga may also . While the link between yoga and better sleep has not been extensively evaluated in terms of the overall population, some studies have noted sleep improvements for certain individuals. These include , , and . The best exercises for sleep vary from person to person. Below, we offer some recommendations for finding the best workout routines to improve your sleep. Historically, intense or late-night workouts have been discouraged due to the negative effects these activities could pose on sleep quality. However, some contemporary studies argue workouts before bed do not affect sleep to a significant extent. Try exercising during the day, in the afternoon, and within a few hours of bedtime to see which routine improves your sleep the most. The same goes for moderate- and vigorous-intensity workouts. Getting better sleep can help you exercise more often: Due to the bidirectional relationship between exercise and sleep, you may be less inclined to engage in physical activities after a poor night’s rest. Getting enough high-quality sleep before days when you plan to exercise is an effective way to commit to your workout regimen. While longer or more vigorous workouts can lead to more physical improvements, just per day can alleviate anxiety and help you sleep better at night. Rather than focusing on daily allotments, you should commit to daily exercise for longer periods. One study found that moderate aerobic exercise in length can be highly effective at improving sleep as well as mood and overall quality of life. Kline C. E. (2014).

09003643-c655-4733-ad15-1078525b7e89,"Diabetes affects more than in the U.S. and is the seventh leading. The most common form of diabetes, , is a chronic disease that develops due to insulin resistance. Insulin is a hormone that helps transfer glucose from the blood to the muscles, fat, and liver, and other cells, where it can be used for energy. Insulin resistance occurs when the body has trouble producing insulin, or when the insulin fails to transfer glucose into these cells. This leads to a build-up of glucose in the blood, otherwise known as high blood sugar, which is the hallmark symptom of diabetes. If not properly managed, this can have for the heart, kidneys, and other organs. Diabetes and sleep are intricately connected, and many people with type 2 diabetes experience poor sleep quality or. The good news is that careful attention to diet, exercise, and blood sugar levels can make a world of difference to sleep quality and, in turn, to overall health. It’s estimated that with type 2 diabetes have sleep problems due to unstable blood sugar levels and accompanying diabetes-related symptoms, High blood sugar (hyperglycemia) and low blood sugar (hypoglycemia) during the night can lead to and next-day fatigue. As with many chronic conditions, feelings of depression or stress about the disease itself may also keep you awake at night. When blood sugar levels are , the kidneys overcompensate by causing you to urinate more often. During the night, these frequent trips to the bathroom lead to disrupted sleep. High blood sugar may also cause headaches, increased thirst, and tiredness that can interfere with falling asleep. By contrast, going too many hours without eating or taking the wrong balance of diabetes medication can also lead to at night. You may have nightmares, break out into a sweat, or feel irritated or confused when you wake up. Talk to your healthcare provider if you are experiencing fatigue, trouble sleeping, or any other worrying symptoms. They can help analyze the reason and work with you to keep your blood sugar levels more stable. Just as diabetes can cause sleep problems, sleep problems also appear to play a role in diabetes. Getting poor sleep or less has been linked to high blood sugar levels in people with diabetes and . However, it’s not entirely clear whether one causes the other or whether more variables are at work. Researchers believe that sleep restriction may affect blood sugar levels due to its effects on insulin, cortisol, and . One-quarter of people with diabetes report sleeping less than six hours or more than eight hours a night, which puts them at a higher risk of having . In addition to raising blood sugar levels in people who already have diabetes, sleep deprivation also raises the risk of developing insulin resistance in the first place. This link becomes apparent as early as. Studies have also found that or are correlated with higher blood sugar, even in non-diabetic people. However, there may be other variables that explain this, such as the fact that people with irregular sleeping schedules are more likely to follow an erratic diet. Sleep deprivation raises levels of ghrelin, the hunger hormone, and decreases levels of leptin, the hormone that makes us feel full. To compensate for lower energy levels, people who sleep poorly may be more likely to seek relief in foods that raise blood sugar and put them at risk of , which is a risk factor for diabetes. Adults with type 2 diabetes who experience disturbed sleep or frequent nighttime awakenings may also be less likely to follow other standards for diabetes self-care, such as getting enough exercise and closely monitoring blood glucose levels. In addition to its immediate effects on blood sugar levels, poor sleep can take a long-term toll on individuals with type 2 diabetes. Those who resort to sleep medication or who have trouble staying asleep are more likely to report feeling serious psychological distress. There is also tentative evidence to suggest that people with diabetes who do not get enough sleep may be at a higher risk for later in life. What Sleep Disorders Are Common in People with Diabetes? Individuals with type 2 diabetes have a higher chance of developing accompanying , the most common being restless legs syndrome and obstructive sleep apnea. Approximately one in five people with type 2 diabetes have, marked by tingling or other irritating sensations in the legs that can interfere with getting to sleep. People with diabetes are also at risk for another condition called peripheral neuropathy. Caused by nerve damage, the symptoms of peripheral neuropathy are very similar to RLS and include numbness, tingling, and pain in the extremities. People who experience these symptoms should consult a healthcare provider, as peripheral neuropathy requires treatment to reduce long-term nerve damage. Obstructive sleep apnea is a sleep disorder in which a person momentarily stops breathing at recurring intervals throughout the night. In most cases, the person is not aware this is happening, though a bed partner may observe snoring and gasping. These lapses in breathing cause micro-arousals (very brief awakenings) that interfere with the natural progression of the sleep stages and impair sleep quality. OSA typically occurs in people who are overweight or obese, as they often have a thicker neck circumference that interferes with the airway. The condition can be treated with a continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) device that keeps the airway open to restore normal breathing and reduce interruptions to sleep. What Is the Connection Between Sleep Apnea and Diabetes? Though does not directly cause diabetes, it is a risk factor for type 2 diabetes and has been shown to increase insulin resistance, even in non-diabetic and people. The estimates that up to one in four people with type 2 diabetes also suffers from OSA, and a further quarter of type 2 diabetics suffer from another sleep-related breathing disorder. Both OSA and type 2 diabetes are more common in people who are overweight and obese. However, OSA appears to affect insulin resistance and glucose control. Not only does OSA cause sleep fragmentation that interferes with slow-wave sleep, but it also periodically cuts off the body’s oxygen supply. Together, these effects lead to insulin resistance and . In many studies, short-term sleep apnea treatment appears to improve , while improves blood sugar and insulin resistance. However, other studies have in blood glucose levels after treating OSA, leading some researchers to believe the connection could be due to other variables such as. More research is needed to further characterize the nature of the connection, but it is clear that plays an important role in sleep apnea and diabetes. A combination of and CPAP treatment may be the most effective way to treat sleep apnea in people with type 2 diabetes. How Can People with Diabetes Cope with Sleep Issues? Careful management of blood sugar levels can help improve sleep for people with type 2 diabetes. Additionally, given the close relationship between diabetes and sleep, good habits are particularly important. These include both daytime and nighttime habits, such as: Adhering to a diet plan that works for you and helps keep blood sugar controlled Avoiding stimulants like caffeine or nicotine before bed Based on your personal situation, your doctor may be able to recommend sleep aids for diabetics or additional ways to get better sleep. They may choose to conduct a polysomnogram, or sleep study, to see if a sleep disorder is to blame for your sleep problems. Secondary sleep disorders can then be treated with targeted therapies such as a CPAP machine. National Diabetes Statistics Report 2020: Estimates of Diabetes and its Burden in the United States.

With the in full swing, it's important that those who are at of having adverse complications with the disease remain as healthy as possible during this time. Those who have diabetes are thought to be at higher risk, but the reason why may be a misconception. If someone has type 1 diabetes are they considered immunocompromised? How about people with type 2 diabetes? Technically, no. While is an autoimmune disease and though some studies suggest that as well, both conditions (as of right now) don't appear to impair the immune system so long as proper measures are taken to manage symptoms. This can be achieved, for example, through diet, exercise, and managing blood glucose (sugar levels). ""While current research supports the fact that those with type 1 and type 2 diabetes are more prone to bacterial and viral infections, we are still waiting for a better understanding of the exact physiology of it to better create a solution,"" says Certified Diabetes Educator MFN, RD, CDE. ""What we do know is that there is an inflammatory response that occurs as a result of the immune system responding to high blood glucose levels."" In other words, if blood sugar levels become too high, living cells in the body can become damaged, which then causes the body to release a signal back to the immune system, letting it know something's wrong. According to a , when someone with diabetes experiences hyperglycemia (the state in which blood sugar levels are too high) it's believed to the body's immune response, ""which results in preventing it from being able to adequately control the spread of invading pathogens such as bacterium or viruses that can cause disease,"" says Walsh. So, having diabetes doesn't automatically make someone immunocompromised. But, if the condition isn't managed correctly, other complications can arise as a result that could then pose a threat to the immune system. ""According to , a person with type 1 diabetes who has their condition well managed and under control is not at any increased risk compared to someone without type 1 diabetes. It is when blood glucose levels are not well controlled that there is a concern in becoming more susceptible,"" says Walsh. To ensure that no one with diabetes is at high risk of contracting any illness this spring, we made a list of seven things everyone with diabetes should be mindful of amid the pandemic. First, if you have type 1 diabetes you should know to… Continue to monitor your blood glucose levels regularly This step is imperative for someone with type 1 diabetes to take to maintain good health, no matter if there is a pandemic or not. ""Keep a close eye on your blood sugar levels through a continuous glucose monitoring system or from frequent checks with a blood glucose meter,"" says Toby Smithson, MS, RDN, CDCES, founder of and author of . ""Constant high blood glucose levels can decrease your immune system responsiveness."" ""Experts are recommending that persons with type 1 diabetes should make sure to maintain a 30 to 90 day supply of their insulin and medications as well as food and snacks for correcting blood glucose 'lows' and if there is concern about going to a pharmacy or grocery store, utilizing delivery services can be helpful, says Walsh. ""Also, many medical practices are utilizing telehealth technology, so communicate regularly with your physician or health care provider if you need prescription refills."" ""As mentioned, elevated blood glucose levels may impair the immune system's ability to effectively protect the body from pathogens, so taking extra precautions to manage blood sugar is very important right now,"" says Walsh. ""Many are concerned about overeating due to being home more and having a stock of food and snacks on hand, so utilizing a food tracking app like MyFitnessPal may help persons with type 2 diabetes to better keep track of food intake each day, especially carbohydrate and sugar intake."" Smithson points out that a person who has diabetes in addition to other underlying health conditions are more likely to have weakened immunity and as a result are at higher risk of becoming sick. ""For instance, two out of every three people with diabetes [also] have high blood pressure. Adding physical activity in any form, can help reduce stress and keep blood glucose as well as blood pressure levels on target,"" she says. ""Start with ten minutes of walking in or around the outside of your house or apartment or using canned vegetables as hand weights.""  5 Ways to Boost Your Immune System Naturally, According to Health Professionals. People with type 2 diabetes aren't to self monitor their blood sugar levels—something that's vital for those with type 1 diabetes to do. However, amid the coronavirus pandemic Walsh recommends that people with type 2 diabetes begin checking their blood glucose levels at least once a day if they don't already. ""People with type 2 diabetes should be extra diligent at this time about monitoring blood glucose levels daily and also doing daily skin and feet checks to catch any issues that may lead to infections before they become serious or require hospitalization. Regular communication with your physician should be occurring if any issues are in place,"" she says. If you have either type 1 or type 2 diabetes you should know to… ""Whether you have type 1 or type 2 diabetes, a healthy eating plan is critical to diabetes management. And, during this high-stress time, emotional or stress-eating can push your blood glucose out of target,"" says Smithson. ""Stock your kitchen with healthy food options like almonds, fruits and vegetables."" Smithson also says that some studies have indicated that after consumption, which can quell hunger pangs and keep you feeling satisfied, longer. Finally, if you are a pregnant woman with gestational diabetes you should know to… is characterized as having high blood glucose levels during pregnancy. ""Just like people living with type 2 diabetes, women with gestational diabetes will want to exercise extra precaution when it comes to managing blood glucose levels to prevent any complications that require hospitalization,"" says Walsh. ""Regular blood glucose monitoring, consistency with insulin regimens, if she is on insulin, and tracking carbohydrate and overall food intake can be helpful for blood glucose management."" is constantly monitoring the latest food news as it relates to COVID-19 in order to keep you healthy, safe, and informed (and answer ).

Here we show how to determine your risk for metabolic syndrome, and how to guard against this deadly condition. Scientifically reviewed by: Dr. Gary Gonzalez, MD, on January 2021. Written By Steven V. Joyal, MD. Dropping dead from a heart attack, being crippled by a catastrophic stroke, having limbs amputated as a result of peripheral vascular disease—these are among the frightening consequences of vascular disease, the number-one killer of Americans. Metabolic syndrome and its associated condition of insulin resistance pose a major threat to cardiovascular health that most health care practitioners do not even discuss with their patients. Remarkably, the public knows very little about this silent but deadly condition, and many affected individuals are not even aware that metabolic syndrome is inflicting severe damage to their arteries and brain cells. The news media and health care providers pay almost no attention to the epidemic of insulin resistance, the fundamental cause of metabolic syndrome. To avoid the potentially disastrous cardiovascular consequences of metabolic syndrome, you need to understand: What metabolic syndrome is and how to determine whether you meet its diagnostic criteria (a tape measure, a blood pressure cuff, and some simple blood tests are all you need). How to identify the risk of insulin resistance through simple blood tests. Why body weight is not very important for metabolic health, but body composition is critical. How a simple but very effective program—and not the latest fad diet—can dramatically reduce your risk for insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome. Which nutritional supplements can help reduce your risk of insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome. (These include two promising supplements derived from water-soluble extracts of cinnamon and coffee—one of which targets the same hormone that multibillion-dollar pharmaceutical companies tout as key to the next breakthrough therapy for metabolic disease.) Gauging Your Risk for Insulin Resistance Metabolic syndrome is characterized by insulin resistance. Before explaining insulin resistance, we need to understand what insulin is and how it acts in the body. A hormone produced in the pancreas, insulin’s major function is to regulate blood sugar, or glucose, levels. Insulin helps to shuttle glucose molecules from the blood into the cells of the body. When blood sugar levels increase, insulin output increases. Insulin resistance means that insulin does not work optimally at its target tissue—such as muscle, fat, or liver tissue—to drive glucose into cells. This has numerous adverse consequences, including glucose and insulin levels that are much higher than normal. As the body attempts to overcompensate for poor insulin action by pumping out more insulin from the pancreas, insulin levels rise. Eventually, over time, the pancreas can “burn out” and no longer produce enough insulin to control blood sugar. When insulin levels are not sufficient to bring blood sugar levels down to the normal range, type II diabetes mellitus can result. The gold standard for measuring insulin resistance is a very complex procedure called a “hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp” that is offered at specialized academic medical research centers. In this two-hour procedure, insulin is infused intravenously at a constant rate according to body weight. At the same time, glucose is infused intravenously at a variable rate to balance out the insulin infusion. The rate of glucose infusion into blood during the last 30 minutes of the test determines insulin sensitivity. Fortunately, to help determine your risk of insulin resistance, you do not have to travel to an academic medical center to have the “hyper-insulinemic euglycemic clamp” performed; instead, you need only undergo some simple blood tests. Certain blood tests such as fasting insulin can serve as surrogate markers for insulin resistance. Excess insulin (fasting hyperinsulinemia) is defined when levels equal to or greater than 15 µU/mL are found. These higher fasting insulin levels are associated with insulin resistance.1 Other blood tests that are very useful in evaluating the risk of insulin resistance include serum triglycerides and high-density lipoprotein (HDL). Triglycerides equal to or greater than 130 mg/dL and a triglyceride:HDL ratio equal to or above 3.0 suggest a high risk of insulin resistance.1 In fact, the Life Extension Foundation has consistently advocated even lower levels of triglycerides (less than 100 mg/dL) as being optimal. ARE YOU AT RISK FOR METABOLIC SYNDROME? Having your fasting insulin, triglycerides, and HDL checked can help you determine whether you are at risk for insulin resistance. The following values indicate that you are at risk for insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome:1 Fasting insulin >= 15 µU/mL Triglycerides >= 130 mg/dL Triglycerides:HDL ratio >= 3.0. Age-Adjusted Prevalence of Metabolic Syndrome. Source: Ford ES, Giles WH, Dietz WH. Prevalence of the metabolic syndrome among US adults: findings from the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. JAMA. 2002 Jan 16; 287(3):356-9. Do You Have Metabolic Syndrome? Afflicting one of every five Americans (with even higher rates in certain ethnic populations), metabolic syndrome has ominous implications for cardiovascular disease risk.2 More than 20 years ago, scientists identified the constellation of conditions that characterizes metabolic syndrome in a group of patients with a drastically elevated risk of heart disease and stroke. Initially called “Syndrome X” by scientists, it is now known as metabolic syndrome. This dangerous condition is characterized by insulin resistance, which leads to abnormally high serum lipids and cholesterol, high blood pressure, abnormally high blood sugar, and increased blood-clotting tendencies.3 Metabolic syndrome dramatically increases cardiovascular disease risk.4 Recent trial results in more than 1,200 men followed for 11 years found that those with metabolic syndrome were up to 360% more likely to die from coronary heart disease.5 The diagnostic criteria for metabolic syndrome can differ slightly depending on the medical experts consulted. A standard, accepted definition was established by the Third Report of the National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) Expert Panel on Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Cholesterol in Adults (Adult Treatment Panel III).6 According to its definition, you have metabolic syndrome if you have three or more of the following criteria: Central obesity as measured by waist circumference: Men: > 40 inches. Women: > 35 inches. Fasting blood triglycerides: > 150 mg/dL. Blood HDL: Men: < 40 mg/dL. Women: < 50 mg/dL. Blood pressure: >= 130/85 mmHg. Fasting glucose: >= 100 mg/dL (recently changed from >= 110 mg/dL to reflect the revised American Diabetes Association criterion for impaired fasting glucose). A Program for Averting Metabolic Syndrome The following step-by-step program can help you avert the potentially deadly consequences of metabolic syndrome. Taking these simple steps can help you lead a long, healthy life and avoid succumbing to a multitude of life-threatening diseases. Step 1: Assess Your Body Composition. The first step involves knowing and understanding your body composition and its importance in helping to prevent metabolic syndrome. Surprisingly, stepping on a scale and seeing what you weigh does not tell very much about your risk of developing metabolic disease. Body mass index (BMI) is a standard measure of overweight and obesity. BMI is obtained by dividing your body weight in kilograms by your height in meters squared (kg/m2). However, BMI fails to account for body composition. Your body composition is a measure of how much lean body mass (muscle) and adipose tissue (body fat) you have. Compare two 40-year-old men, both of whom stand six feet tall and weigh 200 pounds. One man is very muscular (about 7% body fat) and has a waist circumference of 32 inches. By contrast, the other man is out of shape (about 30% body fat) and has a waist circumference of 40 inches. The key point is, both men have the same BMI. Does this mean that both men have the same risk of developing insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome? No! DETECTING METABOLIC SYNDROME To determine whether you have metabolic syndrome, ask your doctor to measure your waist circumference, blood pressure, fasting glucose, serum triglycerides, and HDL. By Adult Treatment Panel III criteria, you have metabolic syndrome if you have three or more of the following criteria: Central obesity as measured by waist circumference: Men: > 40 inches. Women: > 35 inches. Fasting blood triglycerides: > 150 mg/dL. Blood HDL: Men: < 40 mg/dL. Women: < 50 mg/dL. Blood pressure: > or = 130/85 mmHg. Fasting glucose: > or = 100 mg/dL. The man who has poor body composition (low level of lean body mass, high level of fat mass) and carries his body fat around his waist (central obesity) is at risk of developing insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome. The physically fit man with a low amount of body fat and a slim waist is at very, very low risk of insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome. Unfortunately, many individuals pay more attention to body weight than to body composition. Scientists, however, know better. The easiest surrogate assessment of body composition is central obesity, and the easiest way to determine central obesity is to measure waist circumference—if you have a big waist, your risk of metabolic disease is increased. Step 2: Maintain Good Body Composition. How do you obtain and maintain good body composition? Maintaining lean body mass and decreasing body fat is easier than you think. First, do not fall for the latest fad diet. Maintaining a stable body weight is not magic. Ignore any diet “guru” who promises “magical” weight loss, vilifies “forbidden foods,” and promotes excluding certain food “types” based on the latest round of misunderstood and misinterpreted science. Do not buy into it! Instead, simply eat more whole foods and fewer processed foods. Prioritize eating high-quality foods like salmon, vegetables, wild rice, berries, and citrus fruits. De-emphasize eating foods that are highly processed or of low nutritional value, such as cakes, cookies, bagels, fried chicken, and American cheese. In fact, studies show that diets that emphasize whole foods, such as the Mediterranean diet, help maintain lean body mass while also improving metabolic markers like insulin, cholesterol, fibrinogen, and uric acid.7 Other studies of people eating Mediterranean-type diets show a strong reduction in cholesterol levels, increased psychological and physical well-being, and a trend towards weight loss even without trying to diet.8 A great-tasting, healthy diet is abundant in whole foods, much like the traditional diets of Africa, Asia, and the Mediterranean. This style of eating is rich in whole grains, whole fruits, and green vegetables, incorporates low to modest amounts of protein, and is high in “good fats” from sources such as sesame seeds, walnuts, almonds, and olives. Moderate amounts of high-fiber carbohydrates and “good fats” predominate in traditional diets of the Mediterranean, Asia, and Africa. Randomized clinical trials have shown that this type of diet may be best for people at risk for metabolic disease. For example, a trial in patients with type II diabetes mellitus showed better blood sugar control and cholesterol levels in people consuming a diet comprising 40% carbohydrates, 45% fat, and 15% protein compared to those who consumed a diet consisting of 55% carbohydrates, 30% fat, and 15% protein.9 In other studies, a diet moderate in carbohydrates and relatively high in monounsaturated fat from olive oil and polyunsaturated fat from fish—such as the Mediterranean diet—actually decreased insulin resistance and inflammation.10 Furthermore, this diet is better than the step I National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) diet in preventing heart disease and stroke.11 Second, if you are not physically active, start moving your body! Simply walking at a brisk pace three to five days each week for at least 20 minutes will help. If and when you get more ambitious, you can engage in more demanding physical activities at a higher level of exertion. In addition, consider weight training to build more muscle mass and to stimulate your metabolism. Step 3: Improve Metabolic Function with Nutritional Supplements. Smart supplementation can have a significant impact on metabolic health. A number of nutritional supplements hold great promise for normalizing blood sugar and metabolic control. Chromium. Chromium is a critically essential cofactor for glucose control. Chromium helps insulin shuttle blood sugar (glucose) into cells. In fact, without chromium, insulin cannot work properly. Unfortunately, most Americans are deficient in this critical nutrient. Some experts believe that Americans ingest less than half the recom-mended daily amount of chromium.12 This may be partly due to the nation’s over-reliance on processed foods, which are generally rich in calories but poor in nutrients. Another factor contributing to widespread chromium deficiency is food grown in soil containing a low content of minerals such as chromium. In fact, the 1992 Earth Summit report showed that North American soils have been depleted of 85% of their mineral content in the past 100 years—the highest rate of mineral depletion in the world.13 Thus, it should come as no surprise that the foods we consume are deficient in trace minerals such as chromium. Some scientists have postulated that rising rates of metabolic syndrome and diabetes in the US may result in part from declining levels of chromium in American soil and diets. Many clinical studies of patients with and without metabolic disease have shown metabolic benefits—including improved blood sugar control, cholesterol, and insulin—with supplemental chromium doses from 200 to 1000 mcg daily.14-17 Recently, a bioavailable and biologically safe form of chromium called chromium 454™ has attracted the attention of nutritional scientists seeking ways to promote metabolic health. Derived from plant and biological extracts, this distinct form of chromium is water soluble, allowing for outstanding absorption. Insulin-deficient diabetic rats that received chromium 454™ for three weeks demonstrated an impressive 38% reduction in blood glucose levels. These findings led scientists to suggest that chromium may provide metabolic support for individuals seeking to optimize their blood glucose levels.18 DHEA. In both middle-aged and older men and women, suboptimal hormone profiles are not unusual. Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) is a critical hormone that is involved in many metabolic processes, both directly and indirectly (through its conversion to testosterone and estrogen). Low levels of DHEA are associated with an increased risk of developing metabolic syndrome. For example, a cross-sectional study of 400 men, aged 40-80, showed that the lower the DHEA level, the greater the risk of insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome.19 DHEA dosing should be individualized based on blood testing. A simple blood test known as DHEA-sulfate (DHEA-S) will provide important information about your DHEA levels. However, even relatively low doses can provide benefit. A study of elderly men and women showed that a daily dose of as little as 50 mg of DHEA for six months was associated with significant fat loss and improvements in insulin sensitivity.20 DHA/EPA. The long-chain omega-3 fatty acids docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) have a multitude of health benefits, including increased fat burning and improved glucose metabolism.21 In addition, EPA and DHA decrease the expression of genes involved in fat storage,22 down-regulate genes involved in inflammation,23 and lower levels of C-reactive protein, a marker of inflammation.24 Be careful, however, if you consume large amounts of fish, as you may be unwittingly ingesting large amounts of mercury, a kidney toxin that is found in high amounts in fish such as swordfish, shark, and even tuna.25,26 Supplementing with a high-quality omega-3 fatty acid product that has been tested and found to be free of contaminants and pollutants is a smart alternative to eating mercury-contaminated fish. Bioflavonoids. Inflammation is an important factor in the development of insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome.27,28 Bioflavonoids like quercetin, resveratrol, and olive polyphenols have natural anti-inflammatory properties and may offer protection against metabolic syndrome. Quercetin, a potent bioflavonoid found in vegetables, inhibits pro-inflammatory cytokines (proteins involved in immunity and inflammation).29 Resveratrol, found in the skin of red fruits like grapes, has been shown to inhibit the expression of genes involved in inflammation better than the potent prescription corticosteroid dexamethasone.30 GREEN TEA’S REMARKABLE METABOLIC BENEFITS Green tea is a super-nutrient. Life Extension members have long known about the anti-cancer benefits of green tea rich in epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG). Green tea also has valuable metabolic advantages. Green tea promotes healthy blood sugar (glucose) metabolism in humans and obese, diabetic mice without increasing insulin levels.32 Life Extension has long warned about the dangers of excess insulin levels. Green tea rich in EGCG enhances insulin action instead of promoting insulin release.33 Furthermore, green tea and EGCG reduce fat cell creation and growth, as well as blood levels of triglycerides and cholesterol.34 As an added bonus, green tea protects against protein oxidation and glycation (the process by which tissues become damaged by high levels of circulating blood glucose).35 In addition to having potent anti-inflammatory effects,31 olive polyphenols have beneficial benefits on the cardiovascular system. Studies show that olive polyphenols dramatically increase the resistance of cholesterol to oxidation.36 This is very important, as oxidized cholesterol serves as a trigger for atherosclerosis (hardening of the arteries).37 Olive polyphenols also benefit the vascular endothelium, the lining of blood vessel walls. Hydroxytyrosol, a principal polyphenol in olives, reduces the “stickiness” of cells in the vascular endothelium.38 Cell “stickiness” may increase the tendency to form blood clots in the arteries. Carotenoids and retinoids. Carotenoids (found in foods like carrots, squash, and tomatoes) and retinoids, which are beneficial to eye health, also play an important role in preventing metabolic disease. Interestingly, experiments in early growth and development show that low vitamin A intake decreases insulin-producing cells,39 pointing to the importance of adequate vitamin A intake for development of the insulin-producing cells of the pancreas. The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey found that even after adjusting for confounding factors like age, sex, ethnicity, education, smoking status, and physical activity, people with metabolic syndrome had significantly lower concentrations of carotenoids and retinyl esters (a type of vitamin A).40 Evidence suggests that there may be a threshold for vitamin A consumption in terms of metabolic benefit. In one study, daily vitamin A intake of more than 10,000 IU significantly lowered blood sugar and insulin levels in healthy human volunteers, while daily intake of less than 8000 IU was associated with higher blood sugar levels.41 Water-soluble cinnamon extracts. Exciting data show that a special extract from cinnamon holds tremendous promise for normalizing blood sugar levels naturally. A 2003 study of patients with type II diabetes examined the effects of cinnamon on blood sugar. Participants received one, three, or six grams per day of cinnamon or placebo. After 40 days, the three groups receiving cinnamon demonstrated significant reductions in blood sugar of up to 29%, in triglycerides of up to 30%, and in cholesterol of up to 26%.42 So, all you need to do to prevent metabolic disease is consume large amounts of cinnamon, right? Wrong! Whole cinnamon contains volatile oils, which are well-known irritants that may trigger allergic reactions. Even more worrisome is that toxicology studies in mice show that consuming raw cinnamon rich in these oils can cause tumors, including squamous cell papillomas.43 Therefore, the best strategy is to avoid the danger of cinnamon’s volatile oils while still obtaining the remarkable benefits of cinnamon. Fortunately, these oils are not responsible for cinnamon’s impressive effects in stabilizing blood sugar. Instead, cinnamon’s water- soluble polyphenol polymers are the key components responsible for its beneficial metabolic effects.44 The polyphenol type-A polymers from cinnamon up-regulate genes involved in blood sugar control.45 Other cinnamon polyphenol polymers such as methylhydroxychalcone have additional beneficial effects on blood sugar control.46 Recent studies consistently show the anti-diabetic effects of cinnamon extracts in validated animal models of metabolic disease.47,48 Cinnamon extract not only supports healthy blood sugar levels, but also has excellent antioxidant properties. The natural water-soluble cinnamon extract inhibits oxidation even better than the powerful synthetic antioxidant butylated hydroxytoluene, or BHT.49 Coffee polyphenols. Who would have ever thought that a water-soluble extract of coffee acts to boost the key target hormone that multi-billion-dollar pharmaceutical companies are targeting as the next breakthrough treatment for metabolic disease? A very large study (14,629 men and women) published in the Journal of the American Medical Association in 2004 showed that the greater your coffee consumption, the lower your risk of metabolic disease, including type II diabetes mellitus.50 Another very large study that followed 41,934 men showed a similarly powerful association between increased coffee intake and decreased risk of type II diabetes, even after adjusting for age, body mass index, and other risk factors.53 BANABA LEAF OFFERS BLOOD SUGAR SUPPORT A traditional folk remedy from Southeast Asia, banaba leaf extract may offer powerful support for people seeking to maintain healthy blood sugar levels. Banaba (Lagerstroemia speciosa L.) contains an active ingredient called corosolic acid. Laboratory, animal, and human studies show that corosolic acid effectively helps to support optimal glucose metabolism.51 Adults with diabetes or impaired glucose metabolism who received corosolic acid prior to an oral glucose tolerance test demonstrated significantly lower post-challenge glucose levels than people who did not take corosolic acid.51 A randomized clinical trial showed that banaba leaf extract rich in corosolic acid benefited adults with type II diabetes. When the diabetic individuals took a standardized corosolic acid supplement each day for two weeks, their blood glucose levels decreased by 20-30%.52 These findings suggest that banaba leaf extract standardized for corosolic acid content may benefit the millions of Americans who seek support for optimal blood sugar levels. Before you decide to drink a pot of coffee a day or open your own Starbucks, be advised that drinking large amounts of coffee is not the best strategy for preventing metabolic disease. Coffee can cause insomnia and may induce high blood pressure in some people, largely due to its caffeine content. Moreover, results of the 2004 ATTICA study showed that coffee consumption dramatically increases markers of inflammation like C-reactive protein, interleukin-6, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha.54 A smart strategy is to identify and isolate the components of coffee that are responsible for its beneficial effects on metabolism, including blood sugar control. Scientists have found that water extracts of roasted coffee residues, including the primary coffee polyphenols caffeic acid and chlorogenic acid, are key components responsible for coffee’s beneficial metabolic effects. Preclinical studies show that chlorogenic acid improves blood sugar control and decreases cholesterol and triglycerides.55 In human studies, chlorogenic acid, a major polyphenol in water extracts of coffee, has improved the release of hormones critical to blood sugar control. For example, in healthy human volunteers, consuming coffee polyphenols like chlorogenic acid dramatically increased glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) secretion.56 This finding is remarkable because several GLP-1-related pharmaceutical agents are targeting this hormone as a treatment for metabolic disease, including the recently FDA-approved GLP-1 analog BYETTA™ (exenatide). Chlorogenic acid acts to increase GLP-1.57 Coffee extracts offer other benefits as well. Water-soluble coffee polyphenols like chlorogenic acid scavenge free radicals and provide powerful protection against lipid peroxidation and oxidative damage by proteins.58 SEVERAL SUPPLEMENTS FOR SUPPORTING OPTIMAL BLOOD SUGAR (GLUCOSE) LEVELS DHEA: 10-50 mg daily to start (men); 10-30 mg daily to start (women). Assess the effects of supplementation via repeat blood tests. EPA: 1400 mg daily; DHA: 1,000 mg daily. Take with meals. Double these doses to combat high triglyceride levels. Mixed bioflavonoids: 1400 mg twice daily. Vitamin A: 4000 IU daily; mixed carotenoids (for example, lutein: 15-20 mg daily; lycopene: 3-30 mg daily; zeaxanthin: 3-10 mg daily) Water-soluble cinnamon extract: 125 mg three times daily, 30 minutes before meals. Chromium: 400-800 mcg daily. Conclusion With so much focus on cholesterol, little attention has been paid to the critical role of insulin resistance in the development of cardiovascular disease. Insulin resistance is the root cause of metabolic syndrome, a serious risk factor for heart disease and stroke that has received little attention until recently. Identifying your risk for metabolic syndrome involves only a series of very simple tests. If you are found to be at risk, decreasing your body fat—particularly around your waist—is critically important. Avoid fad diets, eat a whole-food diet like those consumed by Mediterranean cultures, and get some physical exercise—your body will thank you for it! Nutritional supplements can help improve blood sugar control and metabolic health naturally, without danger or stress to your body. Particularly compelling are polyphenol-rich, water-soluble extracts of cinnamon and coffee, along with green tea extract, chromium, and banaba leaf-derived corosolic acid. Documented evidence demonstrates the ability of these agents to help normalize blood sugar levels. Avoiding the perils of metabolic syndrome is simple. First, get tested to see whether you are at risk. If laboratory testing and a physical examination reveal that you are at risk, immediately take the necessary steps—including exercise, a healthy diet, and targeted nutritional strategies—to prevent the dire cardiovascular consequences of insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome. PHARMACEUTICAL OPTIONS FOR METABOLIC SYNDROME Drug companies are keenly interested in developing new drug treatments for people with metabolic syndrome. Unfortunately, due to the overwhelming drive by multibillion-dollar pharmaceutical companies to continually make profits, one of the very best drugs to help increase insulin sensitivity and improve blood sugar control (without promoting weight gain) is rarely mentioned. This drug, metformin, is currently off patent and very cost-effective. Metformin, which belongs to a class of drugs called biguanides, works in several different ways to improve insulin’s ability to work at the cellular level in tissues such as muscle and the liver. Metformin is not associated with weight gain—a major advantage over all other drugs used to treat diabetes. Of additional interest is that gene-chip research funded by Life Extension showed that metformin influences gene expression in ways similar to those of caloric restriction. This suggests that metformin may have potential anti-aging benefits in addition to its documented effects on blood sugar control. Other currently available drugs that may be useful in treating metabolic syndrome include the thiazolidinediones, a class of drugs approved for the treatment of diabetes. Thiazolidinediones include GlaxoSmithKline’s rosiglitazone (Avandia®) and Takeda/Eli Lilly’s pioglitazone (Actos®). Thiazolidinediones work by targeting PPARs (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors), which are attractive drug targets for treating metabolic disease. PPARs help regulate the expression of genes involved in the storage and use of dietary fats. Two subtypes, PPAR alpha and PPAR gamma, have insulin-sensitizing effects. Among the new drugs in development for metabolic syndrome are AstraZeneca’s tesaglitazar, and Bristol-Myers Squibb’s muraglitazar. Individuals with kidney disease should not use metformin. Rosiglitazone (Avandia®) and pioglitazone (Actos®) should not be used by people with a history of congestive heart failure or liver disease. Please consult your doctor before using any pharmaceutical drug to treat metabolic syndrome. References 1. McLaughlin T, Abbasi F, Cheal K, et al.

Causes of hypoglycemia include blood-sugar-lowering medications and large post-meal fluctuations in glucose. Severe hypoglycemia, defined by blood sugar below 40 mg/dL, requires immediate treatment. In this protocol you will learn about the causes and symptoms of hypoglycemia, as well as the natural strategies for maintaining blood sugar levels within a normal, healthy range. When coupled with conventional treatment and at-home blood sugar monitoring, a healthy diet along with the supplements outlined in this protocol may help stabilize blood sugar levels in a healthy range. Fructooligosaccharides (FOS) have been shown to significantly improve glucose profiles and may help manage post-meal glucose levels. What is Hypoglycemia? Hypoglycemia, or low blood sugar, can cause significant and life-threatening consequences if not treated immediately. Hypoglycemia is often caused by overly aggressive treatment with glucose-lowering drugs in diabetic patients—glucose levels drop too low, causing an episode of hypoglycemia. Hypoglycemia can also be reactive; if glucose is absorbed too rapidly after eating, it can cause sudden spikes in insulin levels in people with diabetes or prediabetes, which then cause glucose levels to plummet. For patients with diabetes, proper dosing of medications is essential to avoid hypoglycemic episodes. Also, maintaining healthy glucose levels is a proactive step that is important for everyone. Natural interventions such as fructooligosaccharides and Irvingia gabonensis can help slow glucose absorption to prevent the sudden spikes and dips associated with hypoglycemic episodes. What Causes Hypoglycemia? Iatrogenic hypoglycemia: caused by diabetes medications that reduce blood glucose levels Reactive hypoglycemia: insulin hypersecretion after meals (common in people who have undergone gastric bypass) Other causes such as fluoroquinolone use, Addison’s disease, polycystic ovary syndrome, and advanced liver or kidney disease What are the Signs and Symptoms of Hypoglycemia? Shaking or tremors Pounding heart Anxiety Sweating Tingling If insufficient glucose is available in the brain, warmth, confusion, or drowsiness may occur. Prolonged hypoglycemia can lead to coma and/or death. Note: Symptoms of hypoglycemia do not always manifest; some people may be unaware they are hypoglycemic until glucose levels drop dangerously low. Proper glucose level monitoring is essential in those with diabetes or prediabetes. What are the Conventional Medical Treatments for Hypoglycemia? Immediately restoring normal blood glucose levels by administering glucose Long-term management to prevent future episodes, such as changing medications or dosing What Novel Therapies Exist for Hypoglycemia? Implantable continuous glucose monitoring devices Improving patients’ awareness of hypoglycemia with medications such as naltrexone or fluoxetine Treatment with acarbose to slow the breakdown of carbohydrates into glucose What Dietary and Lifestyle Changes Can Help Manage Hypoglycemia? Increase intake of dietary fiber to slow the rate of carbohydrate absorption Eat less refined carbohydrate-rich foods Eat several small meals and snacks throughout the day Do not drink alcohol without eating What Natural Interventions Can Help Manage Hypoglycemia? Fructooligosaccharides. Fructooligosaccharides are prebiotic fibers found in many plant foods that can help stabilize post-meal glucose levels. One study demonstrated that supplementation with fructooligosaccharides significantly improved glucose profiles and reduced episodes of hypoglycemia. Chromium. Chromium supplementation can help control blood glucose levels and improve the metabolism of carbohydrates. Green coffee bean extract. The extract from unroasted coffee beans and a derived compound, chlorogenic acid, have been shown to temper post-meal glucose spikes, reduce glucose absorption, and inhibit the intestinal enzyme alpha-glucosidase. White bean extract. White bean extract blocks alpha-amylase, an enzyme responsible for breaking down sugars. Blocking this enzyme slows the rate of glucose absorption. Irvingia gabonensis. African mango tree extract ( Irvingia gabonensis ) also blocks alpha-amylase . This extract may also help with weight loss. Seaweed extracts. Extracts from kelp and bladderwrack inhibit alpha-amylase and alpha-glucosidase, the enzymes that help with breaking down dietary starches. L-arabinose. An indigestible plant compound, L-arabinose inhibits the enzymatic activity of sucrase, the enzyme that breaks down sucrose. L-arabinose can therefore prevent the spike in blood sugar that follows sugar-rich meals. 2 Introduction Glucose is a chief energy source for cells throughout the body. However, too much or too little of it can cause serious adverse consequences (Berber 2013; Shrayyef 2010). Despite the rampant, interrelated epidemic of obesity and type 2 diabetes, most Americans remain regrettably unaware of the long-term damage from chronically elevated glucose levels, also called hyperglycemia. Conditions like kidney damage, nerve damage, and often irreparable damage to the eyes that result from continuously elevated glucose take time to manifest (Campos 2012). However, even less well-appreciated than the long-term risks due to chronically elevated blood sugar is that very low blood sugar, termed hypoglycemia, can cause significant, acute,  life-threatening consequences if not treated immediately (Berber 2013). Blood sugar levels at or below 40 mg/dL characterize severe hypoglycemia (Desouza 2010; Tsai 2011; Carey 2013; Lacherade 2009). Low blood sugar levels in this range can cause a variety of symptoms ranging from weakness, sweating, fast heart rate, and tremors to confusion, irritability, or in severe cases, even coma and death (Sprague 2011; Berber 2013; McCrimmon 2012). With overly aggressive pharmaceutical treatment, patients with diabetes, both type 1 and type 2, are at risk for episodes of severe hypoglycemia. For type 1 diabetics, hypoglycemia can result from overtreatment with injectable insulin (Cryer 2010). In fact, hypoglycemia represents a serious barrier to successful management of type 1 diabetes; about 2-4% of acute death among type 1 diabetics are likely caused by hypoglycemia (Briscoe 2006; Cryer 2008). Type 2 diabetics can also develop hypoglycemia as a result of overtreatment with glucose-lowering drugs, in particular the class of drugs known as sulfonylureas (Kalra 2013; Bodmer 2008). In contrast to the potentially devastating consequences of over-aggressive drug treatment of hyperglycemia in diabetes patients with insulin and/or sulfonylureas, reactive hypoglycemia (or postprandial hypoglycemia) is a phenomenon in which blood sugar levels drop a few hours after eating (UW Health 2013). Typically, reactive hypoglycemia strikes people who are not diabetic but nevertheless manifest less than optimal glucose control (eg, individuals with prediabetes). These individuals are more prone to reactive hypoglycemia than healthy people. Reactive hypoglycemia is also more common in people who have undergone gastric bypass surgery for severe obesity. The drop in blood sugar level (or “crash”) observed in reactive hypoglycemia is the result of an overly exaggerated insulin spike following ingestion of carbohydrate, with a subsequent reactive plunge in blood sugar level due to the exaggerated spike in insulin (Brun 2000; Roslin 2011; Middleton 2012; Bell 1985). There are other, less common causes of hypoglycemia as well. For example, pancreatic tumors that result in excess insulin being released into circulation or inherited genetic defects in metabolism. In addition, excess alcohol, if consumed while fasting, can cause hypoglycemia, as can several medications (Berber 2013). Proactively taking steps to maintain glucose levels within a healthy range is an important long-term strategy. For diabetics, this includes ensuring medications are dosed appropriately and combined with careful monitoring of glucose levels. Among people who experience reactive hypoglycemia, effective prevention hinges upon avoidance of post-meal surges in glucose concentrations through diet modulation and a variety of natural interventions. For example, the rate of carbohydrate absorption can be slowed by inhibiting the alpha-glucosidase and alpha-amylase enzymes via supplementation with green coffee extract and Irvingia gabonensis (Ishikawa 2007; Oben 2008). Moreover, the prescription anti-diabetic drug acarbose also inhibits the alpha-glucosidase enzyme and slows the absorption of glucose. Unfortunately, many physicians overlook the potential of this well-studied drug to stabilize post-meal glucose levels and mitigate the exaggerated insulin spike that leads to hypoglycemia (Bavenholm 2006; Hanefeld 2007; Ozgen 1998). In this protocol you will learn about the physiology of glucose control and how the body orchestrates a complex system of checks and balances to keep blood sugar levels in a healthy range. You will also learn about some of the ways these regulatory mechanisms can fail and lead to hypoglycemia and what kind of symptoms this can cause. Hypoglycemia management strategies will be outlined along with integrative approaches and dietary considerations to help stabilize glucose levels and avert episodes of low blood sugar. 3 Understanding Glycemic Control Maintaining glucose balance is critical. When blood sugar is too high for too long (chronic hyperglycemia), irreversible damage can be done to various tissues. On the other hand, severe hypoglycemia may cause a person to become comatose or even die. To prevent these complications, the body has adopted a variety of mechanisms to maintain plasma glucose levels within certain values, a process known as homeostasis, which is controlled by a symphony of interrelated checks and balances within the body, including neurotransmitters, hormones, and organ systems  (Klement 2012).  Blood glucose is mainly derived from two sources: diet and synthesis in the liver via a process known as hepatic blood sugar production (Boden 2004). Excess dietary glucose can be stored in the liver as glycogen. Glucose can be released from glycogen in a process known as glycogenolysis. Another critical mechanism for glucose production in the liver is when glucose is newly synthesized from precursors; this process is known as hepatic gluconeogenesis (Cersosimo 2011). During gluconeogenesis, the liver converts certain amino acids or metabolites, such as alanine, glycerol, and lactate into glucose (Watford 2006).  Hormonal Regulation Islets are specialized clusters of hormone-secreting cells in the pancreas. Within the islets are alpha cells that secrete glucagon and beta cells that secrete insulin. The major effect of glucagon is to stimulate glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis in the liver, which results in an increase in the blood levels of glucose (Lee 2012). During carbohydrate ingestion, insulin inhibits glucagon and stimulates glucose uptake primarily in skeletal muscle, effectively lowering the blood glucose concentration (Lee 2011; Roth 2007).  Glucagon, as well as growth hormone, cortisol, and epinephrine all oppose the action of insulin and are known as “counter-regulatory hormones” (Lager 1991). In the absence of dietary carbohydrate, (eg, during starvation) hepatic glucose production by gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis guards against hypoglycemia (Rothman 1991; Cahill 2006). Upon carbohydrate ingestion, hepatic glucose production is reduced and blood glucose levels are maintained by dietary glucose absorbed through the gastrointestinal tract.  Dietary Contribution to Glucose Levels The contribution of diet to glucose levels is relatively straightforward: dietary carbohydrates are broken down into glucose and absorbed through the gastrointestinal tract after ingestion. Thus, eating a meal containing large amounts of carbohydrate contributes to a rapid elevation of blood glucose levels. Ingestion of a pure glucose solution causes detectable elevations in blood glucose levels in as little as 15 minutes (Shrayyef 2010). On the other hand, the more complex or “fibrous” the carbohydrates ingested are, the slower the subsequent glucose elevations. Moreover, the addition of fats and proteins to a meal can also slow glucose absorption (Gemen 2011; Bajorek 2010; Riccardi 1991). This is why a high-fiber diet with moderate amounts of slowly-digested carbohydrate, good quality protein, and healthy fats (eg omega-3 fatty acids from fish) is recommended for people with impaired glucose control, such as those with type 2 diabetes. With regard to hypoglycemia, the contribution of diet is somewhat counterintuitive. If too much rapidly-digested carbohydrate is consumed and absorbed quickly, an ensuing hypoglycemic episode can follow if the body generates an exaggerated insulin response to bring post-meal glucose levels back down (Kuipers 1999). This is called reactive hypoglycemia (Bell 1985). Thus, interventions aimed at reducing the rapid absorption of dietary carbohydrate can help avoid the reactive drop in blood sugar following an overly exaggerated insulin spike. Regulation of Glucose Levels Following a Meal Once glucose is absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract into the bloodstream, the body must keep blood sugar from rising to levels above normal since too much glucose in the blood can damage tissues and contribute to inflammation and vascular stress (Averill 2009). The process of controlling after-meal glucose levels is a complex interplay of several organs, hormones, and neurotransmitters (Shrayyef 2010). When glucose levels rise following a meal, the pancreas releases the hormone insulin. Insulin triggers numerous tissues throughout the body to initiate the breakdown and/or storage of glucose, thus bringing blood glucose levels back down. Insulin stimulates the uptake of glucose from the blood into muscle and fat tissue, where it can either be stored or broken down and used to meet cellular energy demands. Insulin also suppresses the release of glucose from the liver, a significant source of glucose between meals (Shrayyef 2010). 4 Causes of Hypoglycemia Causes of hypoglycemia can broadly be classified as reactive or fasting, insulin-mediated or non-insulin-mediated, and drug-induced or non drug-induced (Merck 2012). Drug-Induced Hypoglycemia Iatrogenic (treatment-related) hypoglycemia. Hypoglycemia is most commonly associated with the treatment of diabetes, either with insulin or oral drugs that reduce blood sugar levels (Merck 2006; Cryer 2009). This is known as “iatrogenic hypoglycemia,” meaning it occurs as an adverse effect of treatment. In addition to glucose-lowering drugs, other drugs such as pentamidine (Nebupent®) or quinine may cause hypoglycemia (Merck 2006). Insulin injections, which are the staple treatment for type 1 diabetes and are also used in type 2 diabetes, contribute to hypoglycemia directly by causing glucose disposal into peripheral tissues such as fat and skeletal muscle. Several reviews of published studies reveal that attempts to aggressively lower blood glucose levels with intensive insulin therapy are associated with a 2-2.5-fold higher risk of severe hypoglycemia (Bloomfield 2012). One study found that the incidence of severe hypoglycemia was 3-fold higher among type 2 diabetic patients receiving insulin compared to those not receiving insulin (Samann 2012). The severity of this is evidenced by the ACCORD trial, wherein type 2 diabetics assigned to the intensive glucose-lowering treatment group experienced significantly more hypoglycemia and an increase in all-cause mortality (Gerstein 2008). In fact, for the group receiving the intensive treatment approach, the clinical trial was stopped after a 3.4-year follow-up period because the investigators noted a 22% higher all-cause mortality (Riddle 2010). Another type of drug often used to treat type 2 diabetes, sulfonylureas, are well-known causes of hypoglycemia (Holstein 2010). These drugs work by increasing pancreatic insulin secretion without regards to glucose level. Although the risk of hypoglycemia associated with sulfonylurea drugs is well known, studies suggest that this risk may be underappreciated, especially in patients who are older or have reduced kidney function (Holstein 2010). Metformin, an anti-diabetic drug that works by suppressing gluconeogenesis, is effective at controlling glucose levels in type 2 diabetic patients and has been shown to be far less likely to cause hypoglycemia. In fact, one study involving more than 50 000 subjects showed that the risk for developing hypoglycemia was 179% greater among diabetics receiving sulfonylureas compared to those taking metformin (Bodmer 2008). Antibiotics. Certain antibiotics are known to cause hypoglycemia. For example, the fluoroquinolone levofloxacin (Levaquin®) enhances insulin secretion by a mechanism similar to sulfonylureas and induces hypoglycemia, which sometimes may be life-threatening (Kelesidis 2009). Hypoglycemia has also been observed after the administration of norfloxacin (Noroxin®), another fluoroquinolone drug (Mishra 2012). Non Drug-Induced Hypoglycemia Reactive hypoglycemia. Reactive hypoglycemia occurs after eating, usually 2-5 hours after food intake, and is caused by insulin hypersecretion (McCool 1977; Hofeldt 1989; Altuntas 2005; Meier 2006; Bell 1985). This form of hypoglycemia is also more prevalent in people who have undergone Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery; it was reported to occur as a late complication in about 72% of the patients who underwent gastric bypass surgery (Meier 2006; Mingrone 2012). This is thought to occur, at least in part, as a result of nesidioblastosis, excessive function of the cells of the pancreas that produce insulin (Rabiee 2011). Reactive hypoglycemia may also occur in people who have not had gastric bypass surgery (Mayo Clinic 2012a). In some cases, individuals have symptoms similar to reactive hypoglycemia without the corresponding low blood sugar levels. Nevertheless, these patients often reduce their risk of this condition by avoiding rapidly-absorbed carbohydrates and eating a high-fiber diet with moderate amounts of quality protein and fat (eg, omega-3 fatty acids) (Gaby 2011; Bell 1985). Reactive hypoglycemia is more common in overweight and obese individuals, people that are insulin-resistant as well as those with a family history of type 2 diabetes (Hamdy 2013). Glucagon deficiency. Glucagon deficiency can cause hypoglycemia, and together with other hormones such as epinephrine, glucagon represents a primary defense against hypoglycemia (Hussain 2005). One of the challenges in treating iatrogenic hypoglycemia is that in some diabetic patients with more pronounced damage to the pancreas, their glucagon response to hypoglycemia is defective, which can make their hypoglycemic episodes more severe and prolonged (Cryer 1983; Cryer 2009; Taborsky 2012). Addison’s disease. Cortisol is an anti-inflammatory hormone produced by the adrenal glands that also helps sustain glucose levels. Addison’s disease is a condition of adrenal insufficiency wherein the production of cortisol is impaired (MedlinePlus 2011). Addison’s patients often develop hypoglycemia, among other symptoms (Meyer 2012).   Fasting-induced hypoglycemia. Fasting-induced hypoglycemia is usually associated with either an insulin-secreting tumor, known as insulinoma, or with genetic mutations. Alternatively, excess alcohol consumption after a period of fasting could also trigger a bout of hypoglycemia. This is because alcohol cannot be excreted from the body as is, but it first needs to be metabolized in the liver (Berg 2002). Alcohol metabolism prevents the production of pyruvate, which is an important building block of gluconeogenesis (Berg 2002; Devenyi 1982; Watford 2006). Alcohol alone does not necessarily cause hypoglycemia, but it does when combined with the additional insult of fasting-induced depletion of liver glycogen reserves. Something similar is seen when fasting and alcohol ingestion are combined with sulfonylureas, drugs which enhance the secretion of insulin. In elderly individuals with type 2 diabetes, even a small amount of alcohol during a short-term fast were shown to lower blood glucose levels. In this case, the effect is compounded by sulfonylureas (Burge 1999). Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). PCOS is associated with obesity and an exaggerated insulin response, and reactive hypoglycemia is significantly more prevalent in PCOS sufferers than the general population (Kasim-Karakas 2007).  Congenital/genetic causes. Fasting-induced hypoglycemia is associated with a number of congenital disorders, many of which are diagnosed in childhood and persist in adulthood. Some examples of conditions in this group are glycogen storage or fatty acid metabolism diseases and gluconeogenesis disorders (Douillard 2012).  Exercise-induced hypoglycemia. Exercise-induced hypoglycemia may be caused by pyruvate-related mutations that result in a massive insulin hypersecretion in response to anaerobic exercise (Meissner 2005). It causes hypoglycemia specifically during anaerobic exercise because pyruvate in the blood is increased by the high intensity activity. Another cause of exercise-induced hypoglycemia is hypoglycemia-associated autonomic failure (HAAF), which may be mediated by an exaggerated endorphin response to exercise. Other Causes Additional causes of hypoglycemia include (Toth 2013): Advanced liver or kidney disease Autoimmune disease Sepsis Hypopituitarism 5 Symptoms Symptoms of hypoglycemia can be organized into 2 primary categories: neurogenic and neuroglycopenic. Neurogenic symptoms are the result of activation of the sympathetic nervous system when glucose levels drop too low. These include shaking or tremors, a pounding heart, nervousness or anxiety, sweating, and tingling. Neuroglycopenic symptoms arise when insufficient glucose is available to fuel the brain. These include warmth, confusion, and drowsiness. During prolonged, severe hypoglycemia dramatic brain dysfunction can occur, potentially leading to coma and death (Towler 1993; MedlinePlus 2012). Hypoglycemic symptoms including anxiety, sweating, tremors, and fatigue do not always correlate with glucose levels (Nippoldt 2013). Individuals with low glucose levels may be asymptomatic or unaware of their hypoglycemia, and others with normal glucose levels may display hypoglycemic symptoms (Bakatselos 2011; Alken 2008; Palardy 1989).  6 Diagnosis and Conventional Treatment   Diagnosis A set of diagnostic criteria called Whipple’s Triad are used to establish a diagnosis of hypoglycemia. Whipple’s Triad includes 1) clinical symptoms/signs consistent with hypoglycemia; 2) low blood glucose levels at the time of the symptoms; and 3) relief of symptoms after the administration of glucose (Ng 2010; Bjelakovic 2011; Cryer 2009; Mayo Clinic 2012b). If onset is associated with a drug known to lower blood glucose, such as insulin, then the cause is deemed to be iatrogenic (treatment related) (Cryer 1992; Martorella 2011). If the underlying cause of hypoglycemia is not immediately obvious, several tests can be conducted to help determine the cause. Laboratory tests that may be helpful include: fasting glucose and insulin, an oral glucose tolerance test (which measures the body’s ability to react to ingestion of sugar), C-peptide levels (which may be elevated with use of sulfonylureas), cortisol (which can measure adrenal insufficiency), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (which can help identify an insulin-secreting tumor), and other blood tests (Cryer 2009; MedlinePlus 2013; Toth 2013; Hamdy 2013). Conventional Treatment Management of hypoglycemia includes two priorities: 1) immediately restoring glucose levels in a patient who presents with severe hypoglycemia, and 2) taking steps to help stabilize long-term glucose control and prevent additional episodes of hypoglycemia. Immediate treatment of hypoglycemia involves the administration of glucose (Merck 2007). Another option, in some cases, is to administer glucagon. However, this is ineffective in people who have been fasting or have experienced prolonged hypoglycemia. This is because glucagon stimulates glycogenolysis to restore blood glucose levels, but in fasting or prolonged hypoglycemic patients, liver glycogen stores have already been used up (Merck 2007; Roach 2012; Dohm 1986; Butler 1989; Koubi 1991; Kimmig 1983; Castle 2010). From a long-term management perspective, prevention of hypoglycemia encompasses treatment of the underlying cause. Since hypoglycemia most often occurs in diabetics being treated with glucose-lowering therapy, modification of dose or switching to a different drug is typically considered. For example, use of sulfonylureas for glucose management in type 2 diabetics is associated with increased frequency of hypoglycemia compared to metformin (Bodmer 2008). 7 Novel and Emerging Therapies   Implantable Continuous Glucose Monitoring Devices Many type 1 diabetics who use insulin have made the transition from self-injections and adjustable glucose infusion pumps to continuous glucose monitoring systems, also known as “closed-loops,” in which an implantable device measures blood glucose and constantly adjusts the insulin infusion rate. These systems allow for continual monitoring and adjustment of the insulin infusion rate without the need for patient predictions (Hovorka 2011). In one study, type 1 diabetics on implantable insulin pumps were randomly assigned in crossover fashion to their standard therapy or a closed-loop system. The closed-loop system achieved better overnight control of insulin and reduced the risk of hypoglycemia (Hovorka 2011). The use of integrated closed-loop control has been shown to reduce hypoglycemic episodes 2.7-fold over traditional insulin therapy. Moreover, it provided a 6-fold reduction in overnight hypoglycemia. This represents an important step toward improving patient safety and decreasing the risk of complications (Breton 2012). In another study, a closed-loop delivery system combining glucose monitoring with insulin and glucagon infusions dramatically reduced the number of participants who developed at least one hypoglycemic episode from 53% to 7% (Haidar 2013). Improving Hypoglycemia Awareness A major problem in the treatment of type 1 diabetes is patient unawareness of hypoglycemia. This occurs due to defects in the neural response that normally accompanies low blood glucose levels. The result is that individuals with type 1 diabetes may not be aware their glucose levels are falling too low (Cryer 2008). This phenomenon is called hypoglycemia-associated autonomic failure (Vele 2011). Some evidence suggests that naltrexone (Revia®), a drug used in the management of addictive disorders, may help improve hypoglycemia awareness (Feeney 2001; Blasio 2013). It works by blocking opioid receptor signaling. Studies show that blocking opioid receptor signaling helps improve the perceptibility of hypoglycemia (Vele 2011). As of the time of this writing, naltrexone, at a 25-50 mg/day dose, is being tested in type 1 diabetics to determine whether it can prevent hypoglycemia unawareness (Kumar 2012). Fluoxetine (Prozac®), the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor used as an antidepressant, may also be useful for increasing hypoglycemia awareness. In one study, 20 healthy patients were subjected to an experimentally controlled bout of hypoglycemia, treated with 40-80 mg/day fluoxetine for 6 weeks, and then re-tested. The study found that this treatment increased several categories of counter-regulatory responses to hypoglycemia and resulted in an increase in endogenous glucose production (Briscoe 2008). The increased counter-regulatory response may allow patients to be more aware of an impending hypoglycemic episode. The Overlooked Potential of Acarbose in the Management of Reactive Hypoglycemia Individuals who suffer from reactive hypoglycemia may not realize that glucose levels going too high after a meal may be the culprit driving their symptoms. This seemingly counterintuitive phenomenon is the result of ingesting large amounts of carbohydrate, which are then quickly broken down to glucose by enzymes in the gastrointestinal tract before being absorbed. The subsequent spike in blood glucose levels triggers an exaggerated release of insulin from the pancreas, which then causes glucose levels to plummet to a hypoglycemic state (Brun 2000). One way of avoiding post-meal hypoglycemia is reducing carbohydrate consumption. However, this can be difficult in modern society where so many starchy foods are readily available. Fortunately, there is another method that most people who suffer from hypoglycemia are probably unaware of, and which is overlooked by many physicians: the anti-diabetic drug acarbose (Bavenholm 2006; Hanefeld 2007; Gerard 1984; Hasegawa 1998; Ozgen 1998; Derosa 2012). One of the key enzymes that break down carbohydrate into glucose is alpha-glucosidase. Acarbose inhibits alpha-glucosidase, thereby slowing the rate of glucose absorption into the bloodstream. This drug is typically used to help type 2 diabetics keep their blood sugar from going too high, but it may also benefit those who suffer from reactive hypoglycemia by suppressing the post-meal glucose surge that triggers excess insulin release and subsequent hypoglycemia (Bavenholm 2006; Hanefeld 2007; Derosa 2012). Several studies have investigated the efficacy of acarbose in managing reactive hypoglycemia. In one study, 21 subjects with reactive hypoglycemia were treated for 3 months with acarbose. Before the treatment, the subjects’ lowest glucose level 3 hours after an oral glucose challenge was 39 mg/dL. After 3 months of treatment with acarbose, the lowest glucose level 3 hours after the glucose load was 67 mg/dL. Moreover, the subjects’ insulin levels were reduced within the first few hours following a meal after treatment with acarbose. The researchers concluded “These results confirm that acarbose may be of value in preventing reactive hypoglycemia by reducing the early hyperglycemic stimulus to insulin secretion…” (Ozgen 1998). Another study demonstrated the immediate benefit of acarbose. Twenty-four subjects with postprandial hypoglycemia symptoms were given an oral sucrose challenge. Along with the sucrose solution, participants were given either 100 mg acarbose or a placebo. Compared to subjects who received placebo, those who took acarbose experienced significantly less reactive hypoglycemia after the sucrose challenge. Also, in some of the subjects who took acarbose, the post-challenge glucose level variance was attenuated: both the highest and lowest glucose levels were closer to baseline than in those who took the placebo. This indicates that acarbose blunted the post-challenge spike in glucose levels and the subsequent drop that characterizes reactive hypoglycemia. Insulin levels were also reduced in subjects who took acarbose (Gerard 1984). Additional evidence comes from a small study in which subjects with type 2 diabetes and symptoms of reactive hypoglycemia were treated with acarbose for one month. In this study, each subject took either 50 or 100 mg of acarbose 3 times daily before meals. Before treatment, all the subjects in the study experienced symptoms such as weakness, palpitation, and dizziness after meals. After one month of treatment with acarbose, these symptoms subsided and subjects’ post-meal glucose and insulin levels stabilized (Hasegawa 1998). For those who want to avoid prescription drugs, there are nutrients described later in this chapter that suppress alpha-glucosidase and other functions in the digestive tract that can cause too much glucose to be rapidly absorbed. 8 Dietary and Lifestyle Considerations   Life Extension® suggests that most healthy people strive to maintain fasting glucose levels between 70 and 85 mg/dL and 2-hour post-meal glucose levels no more than 40 mg/dL above fasting levels, or a maximum of 125 mg/dL. Adjustment of dietary habits can help stabilize glucose levels and achieve these goals for many people. In addition to the strategies outlined in this protocol, readers are encouraged to review the protocol on Diabetes. One dietary strategy for avoiding a rapid spike in blood sugar levels after a meal is increasing intake of dietary fiber, which slows the rate of carbohydrate absorption. For example, a study on 63 patients with type 1 diabetes assessed the effect of 24 weeks of a high- or low-fiber diet. Compared to 15 g of fiber daily, those who ate 39.1 g on average exhibited half as many episodes of hypoglycemia (Giaco 2000). The increased fiber intake in this study was accomplished by eating more fruits and vegetables. A more direct way to reduce the glycemic impact of the diet is to consume fewer carbohydrates. This was tested in a group of subjects with severe reactive hypoglycemia who had recently undergone Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery for weight loss (Kellogg 2008). In this study, the high-carbohydrate meal contained 79% carbohydrates, 11% fat, and 10% protein, and the low-carbohydrate meal contained 2% carbohydrates, 74% fat, and 24% protein.  Of 12 participants, 10 (83%) showed improvement in their symptoms, and of these, 3 (25%) had complete resolution of their symptoms (Kellogg 2008). These findings suggest that a low-carbohydrate diet attenuates pathological glycemic excursions in this population (Cui 2011). Typical dietary suggestions for reactive hypoglycemia include (Gaby 2011; Hamdy 2013; Nippoldt 2013): Avoid refined carbohydrates (eg, white rice, white flour). Eat several small meals and snacks throughout the day (6 small meals or in-between meal snacks). Avoid excess alcohol while fasting (or at least consume food while drinking alcohol). Eat foods with a lower glycemic index. These are foods that raise blood sugar levels more slowly (eg, lean protein, high-fiber foods). 9 Targeted Natural Interventions   Stabilization of glucose levels following a meal may help avert reactive hypoglycemia. Several natural interventions may help reduce post-meal glycemic variability. Fiber Supplementation of the diet with fiber such as fructooligosaccharides (FOS) may help stabilize post-meal glucose levels by prolonging carbohydrate absorption (Wursch 1997; Sabater-Molina 2009; Gietl 2012). This may be beneficial for people prone to reactive hypoglycemia. Fructooligosaccharides (FOS) are fermentable prebiotic fibers found in plant foods such as onion, garlic, chicory, asparagus, artichokes, and bananas (Sabater-Molina 2009; Gietl 2012). A study found that supplementation with 20 g of FOS daily for two weeks in people with reactive hypoglycemia resulted in significantly improved blood glucose profiles and fewer episodes of hypoglycemia (Sorensen 2010). Chromium Chromium is an essential trace mineral that plays a significant role in sugar metabolism. Chromium supplementation helps control blood sugar levels in type 2 diabetes and improves metabolism of carbohydrates (Ghosh 2002; Jovanovic 1999). A small, double-blind, crossover trial assessed the effects of chromium on 8 women with symptoms of reactive hypoglycemia. Supplemental chromium, at a daily dose of 200 mcg for 3 months, led to improvements in both blood sugar metabolism parameters and hypoglycemic symptoms such as sweating, trembling, and blurred vision (Anderson 1987).  Green Coffee Bean Extract Green coffee bean extract, an antioxidant-rich mixture from unroasted coffee beans, may temper post-meal spikes in glucose (Nagendran 2011). Chlorogenic acid, a compound derived from green coffee extract, has been shown to reduce glucose absorption in healthy volunteers (Thom 2007). One compelling study showed that people not taking green coffee extract had glucose levels of 130 mg/dL one hour after sugar ingestion. In this same study, glucose levels of subjects taking 400 mg of green coffee extract dropped to 93 mg/dL after sugar ingestion (Nagendran 2011). Chlorogenic acid may reduce postprandial hyperglycemia both by shutting down excess liver glucose production and also stimulating glucose uptake into skeletal muscle (Ong 2012; Ong 2013). Another means by which chlorogenic acid acts to suppress post-meal glucose surges is by inhibiting alpha-glucosidase. This intestinal enzyme breaks apart complex sugars and enhances their absorption into the blood (Pusztai 1998). Slowing the absorption of common sugars (including sucrose) limits after-meal glucose spikes (Alonso-Castro 2008). White Bean Extract (Phaseolus vulgaris) and Irvingia Gabonensis White bean extract (Phaseolus vulgaris) and Irvingia gabonensis are powerful blockers of the enzyme alpha-amylase, which is secreted by the pancreas (Mosca 2008; Obiro 2008). Alpha-amylase breaks down long-chain, complex starch molecules into simple sugars and short-chain oligosaccharides for absorption in the small intestine. Blocking alpha-amylase inhibits the metabolism of starches and slows the rate at which free sugars are absorbed (Udani 2004; Celleno 2007; Oben 2008; Ngondi 2009). In one double-blind, placebo-controlled study of obese but otherwise healthy adults, one month of supplementation with Irvingia gabonensis produced a 5.3% body weight loss in supplemented patients compared with only a 1.3% loss in the control group (Ngondi 2005). These individuals also saw significant improvement in their lipid profiles. Additional studies confirm these findings, demonstrating significant reductions in body fat  waist circumference, blood sugar levels, and markers of fat tissue regulation (Oben 2008; Ngondi 2009). White bean extract shows enormous potential for preventing the blood sugar and insulin spikes associated with many chronic health disorders (Preuss 2007). Slowing starch digestion prolongs the amount of time it takes for the stomach to empty its contents, reducing the amount of carbohydrate calories released at any one time into the intestine (Layer 1986). White bean extracts operate along numerous overlapping pathways in multiple, related physiological systems. Laboratory research shows that supplementation with white bean extract promotes weight loss in obese animals, with dramatic reduction in fat accumulation without loss of muscle mass (Santoro 1997; Pusztai 1998). Plasma insulin levels also dropped substantially following a high-carbohydrate meal including white bean extract in pre-clinical studies, reflecting a much more gradual rise in blood sugar levels (Pusztai 1998). Seaweed Extracts Extracts from kelp (Ascophyllum nodosum) and bladderwrack (Fucus vesiculosus) have been demonstrated to inhibit the activity of the digestive enzymes alpha-amylase and alpha-glucosidase (Paradis 2011). Inhibition of these enzymes interferes with the digestion of dietary starches and may reduce or slow the absorption of high glycemic carbohydrates (Preuss 2009). L-arabinose  Sucrose (table sugar) is composed of 2 simple sugar molecules, glucose and fructose. It is poorly absorbed in the intestine in this form. In order to be utilized, it must first be broken down by the digestive enzyme sucrase. Blocking the enzymatic action of sucrase therefore reduces uptake of sucrose. Researchers have identified a potent sucrase inhibitor called L-arabinose. L-arabinose, an indigestible plant compound, cannot be absorbed into the blood. Instead, it remains in the digestive tract and is eventually excreted (Seri 1996; Osaki 2001). By blocking the metabolism of sucrose, L-arabinose inhibits the spike in blood sugar and fat synthesis that would otherwise follow a sugar-rich meal (Osaki 2001).

Unfortunately, it often takes a life-threatening event to reveal an underlying insulin abnormality. Learn how to recognize and prevent insulin resistance early on to minimize your risk of lethal consequences like heart and vascular diseases. By Dr. William Davis, MD. Due to multimillion dollar advertising and marketing campaigns by the pharmaceutical industry, patients and physicians alike seem to associate heart attack and stroke risk only with cholesterol. Drugs that lower cholesterol (statins), have created a windfall of profit for pharmaceutical companies, with a single company’s statin drug often exceeding several billion dollars in annual sales. However, cardiovascular risk entails far more than just elevated cholesterol levels. In fact, the phenomenon known as insulin resistance offers a direct link between metabolic disease and cardiovascular risk, and is an often overlooked culprit underlying diabetes and heart disease. Learn how and why these two common diseases are intimately related and how to untangle them from your life. How are Blood Sugar and Plaque Related? Diabetes and heart disease are intertwined from the start, sharing a complex panel of hidden phenomena that lay the foundation for both conditions. If diabetes is present, heart disease is much more likely to develop. If heart disease develops, it is far more likely that diabetes will also. The shared misfortune of diabetes and heart disease emerged with Dr. Steven Haffner’s 1998 report from the University of Texas that people with diabetes who do not have heart disease have the same risk for heart attack as people with established heart disease—the risk is one and the same.1 In 1999, the American Heart Association went on to label diabetes “a cardiovascular disease.” Since then, more studies have established this link. A 2001 study of people with stable heart disease but no previous history of diabetes found that approximately 50% of subjects had newly diagnosed disturbances of glucose metabolism (16% had full-blown diabetes and 36% had impaired glucose tolerance).2 Another recent study in persons hospitalized with more advanced, unstable heart disease symptoms (“unstable angina”) uncovered that 66% of those who met the criteria for diabetes were not diagnosed as such by their treating physician.3 In addition, the more extensive the heart disease identified, the higher the blood sugars tended to be. These insights provide us with strategies that could help diminish the likelihood of both diabetes and heart disease. What You Need to Know: Insulin Resistance Most people with heart disease and diabetes are insulin-resistant, which is a root cause of the metabolic syndrome that leads to the same destination—raised blood sugar, increased triglycerides, reduced HDL, heightened inflammation, and an increased risk of heart attack, stroke, and diabetes. Diabetes and heart disease are intimately connected. Diabetics without heart disease have the same risk for heart attack as non-diabetics with established heart disease. The first step in guarding against metabolic syndrome is to gauge the risk of insulin resistance through simple blood tests such as triglycerides, insulin, HDL, CRP, and DHEA. Insulin resistance and inflammation can usually be reduced effectively without the need for prescription drugs by using the right nutritional supplement and lifestyle strategies. Nutritional supplements that are effective for reducing insulin resistance include fish oil, chromium, white bean extract, DHEA, vitamin D, lipoic acid, magnesium, cinnamon, beta glucans, resveratrol, and polyphenols found in cocoa, green tea, and apples. Insulin Resistance—Root of the Problem The majority of people with heart disease and diabetes have, often buried years earlier in their past, a pattern of poor responsiveness to insulin, or “insulin resistance.” Once this phenomenon becomes established, the stage is set. Insulin is the hormone that helps the cells and tissues of the body use glucose. An autoimmune process, whereby the body’s immune system attacks the insulin-producing cells of the pancreas, is the defect behind type 1 diabetes. This is a different process from so-called ‘adult-onset’, or type 2, diabetes. Type 2 diabetes in adults represents a metabolic imbalance of both insulin secretion and insulin action at the cellular level, as opposed to the absolute deficiency of insulin observed with type 1 diabetes. In patients with type 2 diabetes, a number of factors lead to a poor response to insulin in muscle, fat, and liver. In essence, tissue cells become less responsive to insulin. This triggers the pancreas to overcompensate by producing greater quantities of insulin. Blood levels of insulin double, triple, even quadruple as the pancreas struggles to overpower the body’s poor responsiveness to insulin. This is the situation called “insulin resistance.” For reasons that have yet to be understood, an overworked pancreas cannot meet the increased demand for insulin for long. After just a few years, the insulin-producing beta cells of the pancreas begin to “burn out” and blood sugar rises. Rising blood sugar is therefore a sign of insulin resistance. Insulin resistance is present in 90% or more of people with diagnosed diabetes.4 In all practicality, adult-onset, or type 2, diabetes is synonymous with poor sensitivity to insulin. Insulin resistance is an underlying cause of a number of metabolic abnormalities that are grouped together in a condition called the metabolic syndrome. This disorder is associated with a host of undesirable consequences such as rising blood sugar, increased triglycerides, which lead to a reduction in beneficial high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and an increase in dangerous, small low-density lipoprotein (LDL) particles, greater risk for blood clotting, and high blood pressure.4,5 The list of metabolic phenomena triggered by insulin resistance should appear familiar—these are also risk factors for coronary atherosclerosis.4 C-Reactive Protein (CRP)—What is it? A high CRP means that inflammatory processes are active in your body. You might have an obvious source, like a recent bout of viral bronchitis, painful arthritis in your left knee, or gout in the right big toe. However, an increased CRP also tells you and your doctor that inflammation may be active in your blood vessels. Increased CRP (>3.0 mg/L) doubles or triples heart attack risk, regardless of LDL levels.80 When CRP is high, coronary atherosclerotic plaque is more prone to rupture, the feared event that triggers a heart attack. When high CRP occurs in the company of small LDL particle size, one of the phenomena associated with insulin resistance (a lipoprotein measure,81 the risk of a heart attack risk is nearly seven-fold greater.82 C-reactive protein must be viewed in the context of other measures of health and disease. If elevated, the risk of multiple conditions escalates. More About Metabolic Syndrome Metabolic syndrome is known by a number of different names—insulin resistance syndrome, syndrome X, borderline diabetes, among others and is typically associated with increased triglycerides, reduced HDL, heightened inflammation, three-fold or greater risk of heart attack,6 greater risk for stroke, and diabetes. Metabolic syndrome can drive the growth of atherosclerotic plaque even when everything else, like LDL, is corrected to perfect levels. Even with excellent LDL levels, for instance, hidden atherosclerotic heart disease can continue to grow at an alarming rate. The first step in guarding against insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome is to gauge one’s risk through simple tests such as triglycerides, insulin, blood pressure, HDL, C-reactive protein, and dehyroepiandro-sterone (DHEA). You and your doctor should suspect insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome if: HDL is <50 mg/dL in women, <40 mg/dL in men Triglycerides are >150 mg/dL Blood pressure exceeds 130/85 mmHg Fasting blood sugar is >100 mg/dL There is excess abdominal fat. The likelihood of developing metabolic syndrome also escalates sharply above a body mass index (BMI) of 27. Keep in mind that these cut-offs are somewhat arbitrary and that lesser degrees of insulin resistance can be present before these cut-off points are fully reached. Some leading researchers advocate detecting risk of insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome by measuring waist size. If waist circumference is >35 inches in a female or >40 inches in a male, then metabolic syndrome is a high risk.7,8 Insulin Resistance and Inflammation Insulin resistance is also associated with inflammation, as reflected by increased levels of the inflammatory markers nuclear factor-kappa B, interleukin-6, and C-reactive protein (CRP).5,9 C-reactive protein is the blood test that has emerged as a valuable tool to gauge hidden, imperceptible inflammation. Studies have consistently shown that the higher the CRP, the brighter the flame of inflammation that burns in the body and the greater the likelihood of heart attack and diabetes.10-12 In addition, insulin resistance triggers abnormalities in a recently recognized group of signaling molecules called adipokines.13 Fat cells, particularly those in the abdomen (“central obesity”), assume a life of their own and begin to act just like an independent new organ of the body, producing dozens of these unique substances. The adipokine, leptin, for instance, is produced by abdominal fat cells and causes white blood cells called macrophages to grab cholesterol particles, a phenomenon believed to add to coronary atherosclerosis. Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), another potent adipokine, activates inflammatory responses in vascular tissue and increases release of adhesive molecules, both of which add to atherosclerosis.5,14,15 Increased adipose tissue mass contributes to increased secretion of proinflammatory cytokines, especially TNF-alpha.15 Increasing Insulin Sensitivity and Reducing Inflammation The key to reducing or eliminating many of the threats of both metabolic syndrome/insulin resistance and heart disease is to chip away at the root cause of both and increase insulin sensitivity. Correct this fundamental defect and correction of multiple other phenomena will follow—HDL will increase, small LDL particles will be reduced, and triglycerides will plummet. The blood-clotting protein fibrinogen will also drop while physical stamina and energy will increase. Likewise, hidden inflammation that fuels both heart disease and metabolic syndrome will be powerfully reduced. In most cases, insulin resistance, inflammation, and CRP can usually be reduced effectively and dramatically—usually to normal—just by using the nutritional supplements and lifestyle strategies discussed below. Furthermore, achieving glycemic control in patients with insulin resistance through lifestyle and nutritional interventions can effectively prevent or delay the development of cardiovascular problems and complications. As you will read, given the right kind of information, drugs are not always necessary, perhaps rarely. Lifestyle strategies that help correct insulin sensitivity, reduce hidden inflammation (CRP), and thereby contribute to reducing the likelihood of heart disease and diabetes include: Exercise. For improvement of insulin sensitivity, at least 30 minutes of physical activity per day is required for benefit, preferably 60 minutes. Also, the more frequent your efforts, the better. Exercise can scale down inflammation, as well. An Israeli experience in 28 patients with coronary heart disease showed that 12 weeks of aerobic exercise at 70–80% of maximum heart rate reduced CRP by 19% in non-diabetics and by 40% in diabetics.16 Strength training with weights or resistance machines also helps by increasing basal metabolic rate and accelerating fat loss. Twenty minutes twice a week of strength training can accelerate progress tremendously. Weight loss (if overweight). Weight loss yields the most dramatic effect of all for both improving insulin response and reducing inflammation. Weight reduction yields dramatic drops in CRP.17-19 The principal determinant is the amount of weight lost, not the means by which you achieve it.18–20 Healthy foods. Choose foods rich in soluble fiber and lower in glycemic load (i.e. the total amount of sugar and carbohydrate calories). The best foods are raw nuts and seeds, oat bran, lean proteins, and omega-3 fatty acids. Some dietary approaches may pack a greater effect than others (see below). Dietary strategies such as replacing saturated fat with healthy oils like olive, canola, and flaxseed (for monounsaturates); selecting lower glycemic-load foods such as lean proteins, whole grain products, and vegetables; and avoiding foods like processed white flour and white sugar-laden foods like cookies, crackers, candies, and cakes will help subdue inflammation and improve insulin response.21-23 The Mediterranean diet is one effective approach to improve insulin responses and reduce inflammation. The Greek ATTICA Study of over 3,000 men and women yielded 20% reduction of CRP in participants who most closely adhered to a traditional Mediterranean diet. The diet includes plentiful olive oil (a rich source of monounsaturated fat), vegetables and fruits, nuts, and fish, with little or no processed foods.24 Several other studies have demonstrated improvement in insulin responses and reduction of blood sugar on the Mediterranean diet.23,25,26 A major boost in soluble fiber intake may also increase success in reducing inflammation and insulin responses. David Jenkins, MD, PhD, DSc, at the Clinical Nutrition & Risk Factor Modification Center in Toronto has acquired a fascinating experience using an approach he calls “the dietary portfolio” of cholesterol-lowering foods. In one study, 46 participants followed a four-week nutrition program that added the following nutrients per 1,000 kcal of subjects’ total intake: 1.0 gram of phytosterols (high in plant sterols), 9.8 grams viscous, or soluble, fibers such as oat bran and oat products, barley, and psyllium seed, 21.4 grams soy protein, and 14 grams raw almonds. (An average 2,400 kcal diet would provide 2.4 grams phytosterols, 24 grams viscous fiber, 51 grams soy protein, and 34 grams almonds.) Participants averaged a fiber intake of 78 grams/day, which is five times more fiber than the average American consumes.27 A control group followed a very low saturated fat, dairy, and whole grain cereal diet, rather than foods containing viscous fibers and plant sterols.28 Dr. Jenkins’ dietary portfolio achieved an LDL reduction of 29% and a 28% reduction in CRP, compared with the control group who achieved only 8% reduction in LDL and 10% reduction in CRP. Another treatment group on the control diet received treatment with the cholesterol drug, lovastatin (Mevacor®), but performed no better than the dietary portfolio group.28 Dr. Jenkins’ dietary portfolio and other studies have also shown that abundant fiber intake, especially viscous or soluble fibers, slows the release of sugars into the bloodstream and thereby blunts excessive insulin responses. Improvements in insulin sensitivity and blood glucose responses have also been demonstrated in several other studies.29,30 Sleep. Chronic lack of a full night’s sleep impairs insulin function and contributes to the visceral (within abdominal contents) fat accumulation peculiar to metabolic syndrome.31 Maintaining seven to eight hours of sleep per night helps enhance insulin responses.31,32 Melatonin supplementation to restore normal sleep-wakefulness cycles may help improve metabolic syndrome and inflammation.33 What is Your Level of Insulin Resistance? A blood glucose meter can be a useful addition to your home health tools. Manufacturers often provide a coupon to cover the cost of the meter, though single-use test strips run about $1 each. According to the American Diabetes Association,83 if the blood is tested after an overnight fast and the number reads: >126 mg/dL – See your doctor for confirmation as 126 mg/dL is the cut-off for diagnosis of diabetes. 100–125 mg/dL – Impaired fasting glucose (IFG) may be present, meaning that the cells of your body are becoming insulin-resistant. 100–110 mg/dL – A gray zone. Not perfect but not yet into the official range of insulin resistance or IFG. If this is your reading, then now is the time to start taking action to prevent metabolic disease from materializing.84 <100 mg/dL – “Normal” (ideally, Life Extension researchers and scientists believe that fasting blood sugar should be in the range of 70-85 mg/dL for optimal longevity). Since insulin resistance triggers the pancreas to overproduce insulin, measuring the fasting insulin level can also identify resistance to its effects. Levels will be high, usually >10 µU/mL, though often 30, 40 or higher, even when glucose is normal (<100 mg/dL). What are the Odds? The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey in 1999-2002 showed that:85 One-third of adults with diabetes don’t know they have it. That adds up to over 6 million people. Of the total US population, one in four adults has impaired fasting glucose (IFG) and the proportion increases with age. Up to 35% of US adults have either diabetes (diagnosed and undiagnosed) or IFG. And the numbers are growing as Americans become more overweight and sedentary.85 Nutritional Supplements The following supplements can help reduce insulin resistance and inflammation in the body: Fish oil. Omega-3 fatty acids contained in fish oil help in numerous ways.34 Omega-3s effectively reduce the inevitably elevated triglycerides of metabolic syndrome, raise HDL, and reduce inflammation.35-38 Of all their benefits, the triglyceride-reducing power of omega-3s represents their most powerful effect, which is likely responsible for the dramatic reduction in heart attack and stroke seen with supplementation.39-41 Approximately 1,400 mg eicosapentaenoic acid and 1,000 mg docosahexaenoic acid are recommended each day for maintaining a healthy heart. Chromium. Doses of supplemental chromium ranging from 200 mcg/day to 1,000 mcg/day improve blood sugar by enhancing the effects of insulin.42,43 Chromium supplements also offer a useful adjunct to diabetic patients on sulfonylurea therapy, which is normally associated with weight gain when taken alone. In a recent study in adult diabetics, the usual weight gain seen with sulfonylurea therapy was significantly reduced by supplementing with chromium picolinate, 1,000 mcg/day.43 Other studies have demonstrated that chromium supplementation safely reduces cholesterol and triglyceride levels, and may reduce requirements for oral antidiabetes medication.44 White bean extract. This extract of the common white bean, Phaseolus vulgaris, is a starch blocker that blocks intestinal carbohydrate absorption by up to 66%. A recent randomized, placebo-controlled study showed that 445 mg of white bean extract twice daily in overweight adults led to 6.4 pounds of weight loss (while maintaining lean body mass) after 30 days compared with only 0.8 pounds in non-treated subjects.45 White bean extract also improves insulin responses by reducing sugar absorption and through weight loss.45 DHEA. When taken at bedtime, this adrenal gland hormone enhances mobilization of abdominal fat that contributes to metabolic syndrome, insulin resistance, and inflammation.46 Life Extension recommends the usual dose range for aging men and women is 15-75 mg daily. Ideally, DHEA-S blood levels should be obtained three to six weeks after dosing to assess individual response.46 Men and women with hormone-responsive cancers should only supplement with DHEA after clearance by their personal physician. Vitamin D. Numerous exciting reports about vitamin D’s myriad beneficial effects include recent observations that vitamin D deficiency contributes to insulin resistance and raises blood pressure (by increasing the blood pressure-raising hormone renin).47 Vitamin D deficiency is exceedingly common, particularly in northern climates, where up to 90% of people have moderate-to-severe deficiency. In sun-deprived climates, 1,000–4,000 IU/day may be required to raise blood levels to normal, occasionally more. Most people who lack sun exposure can safely take 2,000 IU/day.48 However, adequate sun exposure does not necessarily guarantee optimal vitamin D levels.49 Vitamin D status can be assessed by having one’s blood tested. Optimal levels are considered to be in the range of 30-50 ng/mL (75-125 nmol/L) of 25-hydroxyvitamin D in the blood. (Discuss vitamin D supplementation with your doctor if you have kidney disease, kidney stones, or a history of high calcium levels.) Vitamin D is also gaining recognition as a crucial modulator of inflammation. A University of London study demonstrated a dramatic reduction in the inflammatory proteins CRP and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP), after supplementation in 171 healthy adults, with a startling 68% reduction in MMP.50 Magnesium. This mineral is needed for more than 300 biochemical reactions and is recognized as an important mediator of insulin action and in reducing inflammation. In several studies, daily oral magnesium supplementation substantially improved insulin sensitivity by 10% and reduced blood sugar by 37%.51-53 The Women’s Health Study including nearly 12,000 participants showed that people who fail to take the recommended adequate intake of magnesium of 320-420 mg/day are more prone to have both metabolic syndrome and increased CRP.54 Improved sensitivity to insulin generated by magnesium replacement can dramatically reduce triglycerides by as much as 75 mg/dL.53 Reduced triglyceride availability, in turn, reduces the triglyceride-rich particles, very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) and small LDL, which are powerful contributors to heart disease. Magnesium supplementation can also raise levels of beneficial HDL.55,56 Magnesium deficiency is common not only from a dietary standpoint, but is also becoming an even larger issue as people turn to bottled water, which contains hardly enough magnesium, and as municipal water treatment more intensively “softens” its water by removing magnesium. Even the federal government admits that many Americans do not obtain the recommended amount of magnesium, which is 320 mg/day for women and 420 mg/day for men.57 Magnesium supplementation is therefore a basic requirement for health for most people. (Discuss this with your doctor if you have kidney disease or electrolyte disorders.) Flavonoids. Naturally occurring flavonoid compounds are important for suppressing inflammation. Emerging research suggests that some flavonoids also enhance insulin response and reduce insulin resistance. Of the thousands of known flavonoids identified, several, including polyphenols and resveratrol, stand out for these benefits. Polyphenols derived from green tea, cocoa, and apples are emerging as powerful facilitators of insulin responses as well as being potent anti-inflammatory compounds.58-60 A study comparing the effects of dark chocolate, containing beneficial cocoa polyphenols, with white chocolate (non-cocoa), 100 grams per day for 15 days, showed that only dark chocolate improved insulin sensitivity.61 Another study in 10 healthy volunteers showed that 37 grams of dark chocolate (containing 148 mg of procyanidins) yielded a 29% decrease in inflammatory leukotrienes and a 32% increase in the anti-inflammatory prostacyclin compared with subjects who received chocolate containing only 33 mg of procyanidins.58 This net decrease in the plasma leukotriene-prostacyclin ratio, a measure of proinflammatory-anti-inflammatory eicosanoid balance, dissipated six hours after subjects ingested the chocolate, suggesting that consumption of flavonoid sources several times a day is more likely to yield maximum benefit.58 Cocoa polyphenols also work in synergy with beta glucans, which offer an excellent source of low-glycemic carbohydrates. Beta glucans are an excellent form of soluble dietary fiber that help modulate the body’s response to carbohydrate-containing foods,62-64 promote satiety and weight loss,65 and lower CRP levels.66 Researchers have also found that cinnamon helps to diminish the dangerous after-meal surge in blood glucose,67 due to water-soluble polyphenols contained in this spice.68 Resveratrol, a flavonoid found in grape skins and concentrated in red wine, has also attracted a good deal of research attention. Red wine, 12 oz/day, has been found to improve insulin responses in people with diabetes. Resveratrol suppresses inflammatory mediators and powerfully inhibits matrix metalloproteinase, a trigger for atherosclerotic plaque rupture that results in heart attack and stroke.69 In data extrapolated from animal studies, resveratrol doses of at least 20 mg/day are necessary to protect against heart disease.70 A glass of red wine (about 6 oz or 180 mL) averages just 500 mcg of resveratrol.71 In addition, resveratrol content in red wines varies enormously depending on type of grape, soil characteristics, methods of barreling, etc., but averages around only 2.5 mg/L.71 Non-drinkers and those seeking protection for a healthy heart can obtain resveratrol as a standalone supplement, or mixed with other flavonoids. The powerful antioxidant supplement, lipoic acid, is also a useful strategy to curtail inflammatory responses and improve insulin responses.72-78 Although much of the research on lipoic acid 600-1,800 mg/day has focused on the improvement of painful nerve conditions associated with type 2 diabetes, lipoic acid also suppresses inflammatory mediators, such as interleukin-6 and plasminogen activator-1.79 Break the Insulin Resistance Connection and Lower Your Risk of Heart Disease and Diabetes Choosing low glycemic-load foods rich in soluble fiber, getting a full night’s sleep as consistently as possible, exercise, and taking nutritional supplements like fish oil, vitamin D (especially if you are sun-deprived), lipoic acid, magnesium, cinnamon, beta glucans, resveratrol, and polyphenols found in cocoa, green tea, and apples are part of a powerful integrative plan for breaking the insulin resistance connection. You can chart your progress by periodically measuring a variety of important metabolic and cardiovascular factors. You want to achieve: Fasting blood glucose: <100 mg/dL C-reactive protein: < 0.55 mg/L for men and <1.5 mg/L for women Fasting blood triglycerides: <100 mg/dL Blood HDL: >40-50 mg/dL for men and >50 mg/dL for women Waist circumference: <40 inches for men and <35 inches for women. If you have had a lipoprotein analysis, e.g., a VAP® (vertical auto profile) or NMR (nuclear magnetic resonance) test, reducing small LDL to <15% of total LDL can be a helpful secondary measure. Achieving a blood pressure of ≤130/85 mmHg is another important goal. Remember, decreasing heart disease risk is far more than simply taking a statin drug or making sure that your LDL is within an optimal range. By focusing on improving insulin sensitivity, you can help reduce the risk of heart attack and break the lethal connection between cardiovascular and metabolic diseases!

This cinnamon extract has demonstrated beneficial effects against elevated blood sugar and metabolic syndrome. Scientifically reviewed by: Dr. Vanessa Pavey, ND, on March 2020. Written By Cynthia Williams. A staggering number of Americans suffer from a disorder called “metabolic syndrome” that is characterized by a combination of:1 High blood sugar Increased blood pressure Abdominal obesity Abnormal cholesterol and triglyceride levels Those with metabolic syndrome are at increased risk for heart attack, stroke, type II diabetes and early death.2 A root cause of metabolic syndrome is insulin resistance.2,3 This article describes natural substances that work together to promote healthy fasting blood sugar and insulin sensitivity. In the United States there are 86 million adults with prediabetes.4 A substantial number of those with poor glucose control convert to full-blown type II diabetes. Before diabetes is diagnosed, chronically elevated glucose damages tissues throughout the body. The Power of Prevention Insulin resistance means the body’s cells cannot respond normally to insulin. That causes blood sugar levels to creep up gradually – entirely without symptoms in most people. In those with prediabetes or insulin resistance, risk of progression to type II diabetes can be reduced by about 58% with lifestyle interventions, including diet, that lower blood-sugar levels.2 In addition, studies have identified multitargeted nutrients capable of reducing blood glucose via a variety of mechanisms. What You Need to Know Targeted Blood-Sugar Control More than a third of Americans suffer from metabolic syndrome, which raises their risks of heart disease, stroke, diabetes, cancer, and other life-shortening conditions. Metabolic syndrome has many components, but scientists agree that a root cause is insulin resistance. Physicians rarely prescribe sugar-lowering drugs to anyone who is not already diabetic, placing millions of Americans at real risk for a host of life-threatening complications. Six natural compounds have been shown to work independently and together to prevent blood sugar increases, to enhance insulin sensitivity, and combat the effects of the occasional carbohydrate overindulgence. Chromium, amla, shilajit, cinnamon, iodine, and seaweed promote healthy blood sugar levels and prevent insulin resistance through a wide variety of related and complementary mechanisms. Any adult, even those with normal blood sugar levels, should consider regular supplementation with these nutrients, to prevent or slow the age-accelerating effects of borderline or high blood sugar by increasing insulin sensitivity, decreasing fasting blood sugar and preventing the effects of the occasional carbohydrate indulgence. Cinnamon Acts on Multiple Glucose Targets   Cinnamon is an effective tool for lowering blood sugar and reducing the risk of type II diabetes. A water-soluble, oil-free cinnamon extract has been identified that has demonstrated beneficial effects on blood sugar, glycation, and metabolic syndrome.5,6 The US Department of Agriculture filed a patent application on this extract based on its glucose- lowering properties.7,8 One of the primary ways cinnamon impacts blood sugar is by increasing production of GLUT4, a molecule that is responsible for transporting sugar from blood plasma into the cell, which enhances insulin sensitivity and therefore glucose uptake.9-11 Without effective GLUT4 transporters, sugar levels in the blood steadily rise, eventually producing damage to tissues through the chemical reaction known as glycation, in which glucose molecules bind to vital proteins, deleteriously altering both their structure and function.12 Increased production of PPARs is another critical mechanism of some antidiabetic drugs.13 When activated, PPARs promote insulin sensitivity and glucose uptake. PPARs also suppress fat accumulation and glucose production.13-15 Clinical trials have shown that cinnamon supplementation boosts insulin sensitivity and lowers blood sugar.16-20 Cinnamon also helps to induce satiety, the feeling of fullness after a meal that prevents us from overeating.21 Together, these effects have been shown to reduce evidence of long-term glucose overexposure in blood, as measured by hemoglobin A1C, a measure of chronic exposure to sugar.22 Cinnamon has other properties that help combat metabolic syndrome, such as lowering blood pressure and improving body fat distribution.23,24 Cinnamon has also shown that it could reduce disruptions associated with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, the liver manifestation of metabolic syndrome.25,26 Lower Blood Sugar With Chromium Another nutrient that improves blood-sugar levels and insulin sensitivity is chromium. Studies show there is a powerful connection between chromium and diabetes. For example, people with diabetes and heart disease are relatively deficient in chromium levels, compared with healthy people. And people with known chromium deficiencies develop symptoms associated with type II diabetes.27-33 Human studies show chromium’s impact on both short- and long-term blood-sugar control. When diabetic patients receive chromium supplements, their fasting blood glucose and insulin levels drop promptly, while their long-term sugar levels improve, as indicated by reductions in hemoglobin A1C.34,35 Unlike glucose-lowering drugs and insulin, chromium poses no danger of producing dangerously low blood sugar (hypoglycemia), which is a major advance in safety.36,37 Chromium works in multiple ways to boost glucose uptake from the blood.38 It boosts production of GLUT4 transporter molecules, and triggers the GLUT4 movement from the cell’s interior to its membrane—both of which help move glucose out of the blood and into cells.39-42 This has the dual benefit of lowering blood-sugar levels while providing much-needed chemical energy inside cells. These glucose uptake-promoting properties mean that chromium fights insulin resistance by enhancing the impact of insulin on a cell’s sugar-absorbing capabilities—and that’s a very good thing for anyone with borderline or high blood sugar. Ancient Remedies Prevent Tissue Damage Amla While chromium produces outstanding sugar-lowering effects, it is also a highly reactive metal ion that is capable of inducing oxidative stress that could damage tissue. That’s why scientists now recommend that chromium supplements be stabilized with organic compounds that can reduce the oxidative stress and allow chromium’s major benefits to emerge. Two such compounds are amla and shilajit. In addition to enhancing chromium’s benefits, these two ancient natural remedies have some impressive protective properties of their own that make them a perfect complement to chromium. Modern science has revealed that amla extracts powerfully oppose oxidative stress of all kinds. Amla protects against glycation of proteins, which helps prevent the damage that otherwise occurs in tissues throughout the body (eye lens and retina, heart muscle, kidney, nerves, and blood vessels).43,44 Amla also directly prevents blood-sugar levels from rising after a starch-containing meal by blocking the enzymes that convert starch into sugar in the intestine.43 This can help to prevent the effects of the occasional carbohydrate overindulgence and may also help address unhealthy fasting blood-sugar levels. Shilajit is an adaptogen that helps cells and tissues survive oxidative and other stresses.45 Research shows that shilajit promotes efficient glucose “burning” in mitochondria.46 Efficient-running mitochondria produce fewer chemically stressful byproducts, reducing cell damage. Their energy output is also maximal, helping cells to meet their needs.47 And clean-burning mitochondria are less vulnerable to outside oxidative stress.48,49 Studies show that amla and shilajit provide the tissue protection that is not found in many pharmaceutical drugs.50,51 Providing supplemental chromium stabilized with amla and shilajit is an effective, safe way of lowering blood sugar, minimizing glucose-induced tissue damage, and promoting efficient energy production—all of which are known to mitigate prediabetes and diabetes. Seaweed Regulates Blood Sugar Seaweed Seaweed is a sea vegetable that works in many ways to lower blood sugar and help protect against metabolic syndrome.52-55 Like cinnamon and chromium, seaweed increases levels of the glucose-transporting GLUT4, and increases activity of the energy-sensing PPAR system—both of which promote insulin sensitivity and glucose uptake.56,57 In addition, sea vegetables are rich in iodine, which plays a role in maintaining insulin sensitivity.58 Animal studies have shown that oral supplementation with iodine reduces glucose levels.59,60 And one recent human study showed that in obese, iodine-deficient women, iodine supplements reduced high cholesterol.61 Many of seaweed’s sugar-lowering effects occur directly in the digestive tract. There, seaweed components block the enzymes needed to release sugar molecules from starch.62-66 As a result, glucose is not released, never contributing to rising blood sugar levels.52 Another important way seaweed extracts help combat insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome is by reducing body weight and fat mass. When obese animals were given seaweed supplementation, it was found to lower blood sugar, diminish food intake, reduce body weight, and slow weight gain.67 One reason for these benefits could be because seaweed contains compounds that have been shown to activate systems that cause fat to be burned off rather than stored in the body.68,69 Seaweed supplementation also reduces the development and maturation of new fat cells, which helps prevent weight gain caused by a high fat diet.70,71 As a result, supplemented animals were exposed to far lower levels of the inflammation-promoting molecules (cytokines) that fat tissue pours out into the circulation.72 An Underlying Cause of Insulin Resistance Insulin resistance, a crucial factor in the development of prediabetes, occurs when the body’s cells cannot respond normally to insulin. That causes blood sugar levels to creep up gradually—and, in most people, entirely without symptoms.74 One of the key dysfunctions in developing insulin resistance is a reduction in movement of glucose-transporting molecules from deep within a cell out to its membrane. These transporters, known as GLUT4, are responsible for transferring sugar from blood plasma into the cell. Once there, its chemical energy is released to keep the cell working.75-77 Without adequate transportation out of the blood and into the cells, sugar is left in the blood, causing blood-sugar levels to steadily rise. Over time, this damages tissues through the chemical reaction known as glycation, which occurs when sugar reacts chemically with vital molecules, including proteins, causing them to become stuck together and preventing them from functioning properly.78 Glycation also creates harmful advanced glycation end products (AGEs), which are known to be a root cause of aging.12 The good news is that if it is caught early enough, insulin resistance can be alleviated. Studies have shown you can reduce the risk of progression from prediabetes to diabetes by about 58% within three years simply through lifestyle interventions.2 And of course, people who already have diabetes need to control their blood-sugar levels just as urgently as those with prediabetes. That’s why virtually everyone—diabetic or not—can benefit from recent discoveries about multitargeted nutrients capable of improving insulin sensitivity and reducing fasting blood glucose through a variety of mechanisms of action. Summary   More than one-third of Americans have metabolic syndrome, an insulin-resistant state in which borderline high blood sugar and other metabolic abnormalities signal ever-growing risks for heart disease, stroke, cancer, and a host of other age-accelerating conditions.73 Sugar-lowering drugs are not generally prescribed until after a person develops diabetes, which leaves millions of us in a dangerous, prediabetic state without treatment. Natural supplements have long been shown to reduce the risks of metabolic syndrome by lowering blood-sugar levels before they reach dangerous concentrations. Cinnamon, chromium, amla, shilajit, and seaweed provide sugar-lowering, energy-burning, and fat-reducing properties, and should be considered as a regular part of a healthy supplement regimen. While diabetics are well aware of the risks of elevated blood sugar, ultimately anyone—even those with normal blood sugar levels—should be keenly interested in maintaining healthy blood-sugar levels.

Find out how phenotypic nutrition, a powerful new strategy using specific nutrients with targeted biochemical and metabolic effects, can help guard against deadly metabolic syndrome. Scientifically reviewed by: Dr. Gary Gonzalez, MD, on January 2021. Written By Steven V. Joyal, MD. Can you control your genetic destiny? Are you doomed to suffer debilitating diseases because of “bad genes”? The answer is that a powerful strategy called phenotypic nutrition can help modulate the expression of your unique genetic code, thus dramatically reducing your risk of developing disease. Phenotypic nutrition uses specific nutrients with targeted biochemical and genetic effects to help protect you from disease. One of the most important threats to your health and longevity is metabolic syndrome, a disorder little known to the public but fast becoming an extremely important public health issue. This deadly, common condition affects approximately one of every five people overall, with even higher rates among certain ethnic groups.1 By applying a phenotypic nutrition strategy, we can help to guard against the deadly dangers of cardiovascular disease associated with metabolic syndrome. Metabolic Syndrome Defined Over 20 years ago, Stanford University professor Gerald Reaven, MD, coined the term “Syndrome X” to describe a constellation of metabolic abnormalities in serum cholesterol, blood pressure, blood-clotting tendencies, and cardiovascular disease risk.2 Now known as metabolic syndrome, this constellation of abnormalities is recognized as placing individuals at dramatically in-creased risk for cardiovascular disease.3 For example, a study published in 2004 in the Journal of the American Medical Association followed more than 1,200 men for 11 years. The investigators found that men with metabolic syndrome were 160-320% more likely to die from coronary heart disease than those without metabolic syndrome.4 The diagnostic criteria for metabolic syndrome proposed by the Third Report of the National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) Expert Panel on Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Cholesterol in Adults (Adult Treatment Panel III) include: Central obesity (waist circumference) greater than 40 inches for men and greater than 35 inches for women Fasting blood triglycerides greater than or equal to 150 mg/dL Blood high-density lipoprotein (HDL) of less than 40 mg/dL for men and less than 50 mg/dL for women Blood pressure greater than or equal to 130/85 mmHg Fasting glucose greater than or equal to 110 mg/dL.5 Despite the grave cardiovascular risk posed by metabolic syndrome, there is currently no standard, accepted interventional treatment regimen to prevent the disorder. However, for those at greatest risk for metabolic syndrome, phenotypic nutrition allows us to tailor a nutrient and supplement strategy to amplify beneficial biochemical pathways as well as gene expression. Orthomolecular Medicine: Visionary Science In 1968, the Nobel Prize-winning scientist Linus Pauling, PhD, published an article in the journal Science describing the “orthomolecular” approach to illness. This was the first time that such an approach was presented to the public—specifically, that “varying the concentrations of substances normally present in the human body may control mental disease.”6 Dr. Pauling later extended this strategy beyond mental illness to include the discipline of orthomolecular medicine. Orthomolecular medicine is a paradigm that attempts to prevent and treat disease by integrating conventional medical therapies with vitamins, phytonutrients, and other dietary micronutrients. Dr. Pauling’s fascination with vitamin C and its role in helping to prevent and treat disease is an example of orthomolecular medicine. Dr. Pauling published pioneering reviews on the use of vitamin C and the orthomolecular approach to cancer over 30 years ago.7,8 Biochemical Variations and Nutrient Needs From our physical and psychological traits to our enzyme systems that process nutrients and help guard against disease, each of us is unique. Roger Williams, PhD, discoverer of pantothenic acid (vitamin B5) and founder and director of the Clayton Foundation Biochemical Institute at the University of Texas, was a visionary in the understanding of biochemical uniqueness. Dr. Williams’ timeless classic Biochemical Individuality, originally published in 1956, acknowledges the unique biochemical variations among individuals and how these differences relate to their distinct nutritional needs for optimal health and disease prevention. Figure 1: Age-Adjusted Prevalence of Metabolic Syndrome Nutrigenomics: Guiding Genetic Destiny Driven by recent technological breakthroughs associated with the mapping of the human genome, the science of nutrigenomics holds great potential for predicting how specific nutrients and dietary ingredients can directly affect health and disease by specific genetic interactions. Nutrigenomics holds promise in advancing the goal of preventing disease with individualized, targeted nutrient-gene interactions.9,10 Nutrigenomics suggests that genetic testing will allow for “individualized nutrition” based on unique genetic needs. Currently, however, nutrigenomics remains a very young and developing science that has not yet developed to the point of being able to offer broad-based nutrient-gene testing of this sort. Furthermore, ethical questions surround genetic testing. For example, if you were to undergo a genetic test predicting you were at fourfold greater risk of having a heart attack unless you consumed specific nutrients, would you want that information shared with your health insurance company or employer? Who would control the confidentiality of this type of information? There is, however, another approach that we can use for specific, individualized nutrient recommendations that incorporates Dr. Pauling’s visionary approach to orthomolecular medicine, Dr. Williams’ brilliant insight into biochemical individuality, and the futurist promise of nutrigenomics—without having to worry about the ethical and confidentiality issues related to genetic testing. This alternative approach is called phenotypic nutrition. Genes, Genotype, and Phenotype Your unique genetic code defines your genotype. The expression of your individual genetic code is your phenotype. Both your genes and your environment influence your phenotype. While it is not known exactly which genes are responsible for the constellation of abnormalities associated with metabolic syndrome, a number of genes so far identified play a role in the malfunction associated with abnormally elevated plasma glucose.11 Metabolic syndrome is a phenotypic expression of the genetic code as it interacts with the environment. Specifically, if you have a genetic tendency to develop the metabolic syndrome phenotype, you will be far more likely to develop this phenotype if you are overweight, do not exercise, consume a diet high in simple sugars and saturated fats, and do not consume enough specific nutrients with beneficial nutrient-gene interactions. In 2004, an innovative approach to weight management and obesity was published in the peer-reviewed journal Current Drug Targets. This approach, called “nutriphenotypic,” is selective nutrition based on an individual’s phenotypic metabolic characteristics.12 This past year, researchers described the concept of a “nutritional phenotype” that characterizes the relationship of biochemical measures, metabolic parameters, and functional characteristics (for example, exercise, body weight, exposure to environmental pollutants and toxins, emotional stress) on health. The nutrient phenotype is a function of genes, diet, environment, and behavior.13 Figure 3: Components of the Nutritional Phenotype The nutriphenotypic/nutrient phenotype approach represents an integrative strategy to help prevent and treat disease. Just as specific inputs to a computer will cause specific outputs, phenotypic nutrition uses specific nutrients for specific effects. Phenotypic nutrition affects the expression of your genes and unique biochemistry so that you can influence your genetic destiny. Instead of dooming individuals to disease and an early demise due to “bad genes,” phenotypic nutrition uses nutrients that act on specific genes as well as biochemical and molecular pathways to help prevent disease and achieve optimal health and longevity. With phenotypic nutrition, once high-risk individuals have been identified, strategies that include dietary modifications and specific nutraceuticals can be implemented to help decrease disease risk. Identifying Those Most at Risk Metabolic syndrome is characterized by insulin resistance. Identifying individuals with evidence of insulin resistance before the development of full-blown metabolic syndrome allows us to intervene with a nutrient and lifestyle strategy to prevent the progression of this condition. Thankfully, simple metabolic markers are very useful in helping to identify individuals with insulin resistance who are at high risk of cardiovascular disease. Triglycerides, insulin, and HDL. Clinical studies suggest that the following threshold values for plasma triglycerides, the ratio of triglycerides to HDL, and fasting insulin are the most useful metabolic markers in identifying insulin-resistant individuals at risk of cardiovascular disease:14 Triglycerides greater than or equal to 130 mg/dL Triglycerides/HDL ratio greater than or equal to 3.0 Fasting insulin level greater than or equal to 15 µU/mL. C-reactive protein. Moreover, research has demonstrated that a condition of low-grade systemic inflammation is associated with insulin resistance. For example, a recent clinical study showed that insulin and insulin resistance remained significantly and independently related to C-reactive protein (CRP) levels, a marker of inflammation, after adjustments for age, sex, body mass index, waist size, alcohol consumption, level of physical activity, and smoking habits.15 Another clinical study found that CRP was significantly correlated to insulin resistance.16 DHEA. Scientists have associated suboptimal levels of dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) with risk for metabolic syndrome. For example, a cross-sectional study of 400 independently living men aged 40-80 reported a statistically significant relationship between DHEA levels and risk of metabolic syndrome—specifically, the higher the level of DHEA, the lower the risk of metabolic syndrome.17 A number of randomized, placebo-controlled clinical studies have shown that supplemental DHEA excels in improving many metabolic derangements associated with metabolic syndrome. For example, in a study of elderly men and women, 50 mg per day of DHEA for six months was associated with significant improvements in visceral fat, subcutaneous fat, and insulin sensitivity.18 Another study evaluated DHEA’s effects on markers of insulin resistance and cardiovascular risk in 28 hypoadrenal (demonstrating diminished adrenal gland function) women. In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study, women supplementing with DHEA significantly improved their insulin sensitivity and reduced their levels of triglycerides and low-density lipoprotein (LDL).19 These simple, surrogate screening assessments for insulin resistance and cardiovascular disease risk—that is, of triglycerides, insulin, HDL, CRP, and DHEA—can identify those at high risk of developing metabolic syndrome. DHA and EPA Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) are genetic transcription factors that act on DNA response elements. Carbohydrate responsive element binding protein (ChREBP) and sterol regulatory element binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c) are two other critical regulators of glucose metabolism in the liver. Fatty acids such as DHA (docosahexaenoic acid) and EPA (eicosapentaenoic acid) are nutrients that directly affect these genetic transcription factors. PPARs are present in high-energy-demand tissues, including the liver, heart, and, to a lesser extent, skeletal muscle. PPARs are critical to a phenotypic nutrition approach to preventing metabolic syndrome, as PPARs promote fatty acid oxidation and fat cell differentiation while promoting glucose utilization.20 Studies have shown that EPA and DHA decrease the expression of genes involved in fatty acid storage. Through a depleting effect on SREBP-1c, EPA and DHA reduce insulin response to oral glucose and protect against the effect of insulin resistance induced by a high-fat diet. At the molecular level, this is accomplished by preventing the decreased expression of the gene encoding the glucose transporter GLUT4 in fat cells.21 Research has also shown that EPA and DHA down-regulate genes involved in inflammation, an important protective attribute for our prevention program, given inflammation’s association with metabolic syndrome. For example, pre-clinical studies have shown that these fatty acids down-regulate pro-inflammatory nuclear factor-kappa beta (NfkB) through a PPAR-gamma-dependent pathway.22 Human studies have shown a relationship between increased DHA consumption and diminished CRP levels,23 and other in-vivo studies have shown that markers of oxidative stress such as urinary F2-isoprostanes decrease significantly with EPA and DHA intake.24 Lipoic Acid A naturally occurring nutrient, lipoic acid is known to improve glucose metabolism by influencing genetic transcriptional factors in fat cells through the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway.25 For example, in a multicenter, placebo-controlled trial, type II diabetes patients treated with lipoic acid demonstrated a significant increase in insulin-stimulated glucose disposal.26 Furthermore, lipoic acid’s molecular attributes include increasing glucose uptake through recruitment of the glucose transporter-4 (GLUT-4) to plasma membranes, a mechanism that is shared with insulin-stimulated glucose uptake.27 Research also shows that lipoic acid decreases markers of vascular inflammation in metabolic syndrome. A recent randomized, double-blind clinical trial showed that after four weeks of therapy, endothelium-dependent vasodilation of the brachial artery was increased by 67%, 44%, and 75% in groups receiving irbesartan (an angiotensin-blocking drug), lipoic acid, and irbesartan plus lipoic acid, respectively, compared to placebo. Furthermore, treatment with irbesartan and lipoic acid was associated with statistically significant reductions in plasma levels of pro-inflammatory mediators such as interleukin-6.28 Glucose and Dietary Carbohydrates The Mediterranean diet is rich in whole grains, fruits, vegetables, and fat from fish, nuts, and olives. Low in rapidly digested simple carbohydrates, this diet is helpful in decreasing genetic expression of fat-storage enzymes activated by high amounts of dietary carbohydrates. Scientists have realized that in addition to the key regulatory hormone insulin, glucose itself plays a critical role in helping to regulate glucose metabolism and fat storage (lipogenesis). Decreased ChREBP gene expression results in decreased fat-storage gene expression, thereby demonstrating the direct implication of ChREBP in glucose action and fat storage.29 Randomized clinical trials have shown that high-carbohydrate/low-fat diets accentuate the metabolic abnormalities of patients with glucose dysregulation such as diabetes. For example, a trial evaluated patients with type II diabetes mellitus after they were randomly placed on diets comprising either 55% carbohydrates, 30% fat, and 15% protein, or 40% carbohydrates, 45% fat, and 15% protein for six weeks, followed by crossover to the other diet. The high-carbohydrate/low-fat diet in patients with type II diabetes led to: higher day-long plasma glucose, insulin, and triglyceride concentrations postprandial accumulation of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins from the intestine increased production of very low-density lipoprotein-triglyceride (VLDL-TG).30 Simply stated, in people with impaired blood glucose control, a diet high in carbohydrates will cause gene expression to activate enzymes involved in fat storage. Furthermore, a diet moderate in carbohydrates and relatively high in monounsaturated fat from olive oil and polyunsaturated fatty acids from fish, such as the Mediterranean diet, has been shown in prospective, randomized clinical trials to decrease insulin resistance, improve endothelial function, and decrease markers of inflammation.31 Also, this dietary approach may be better than the National Cholesterol Education Program’s Step 1 prudent diet in preventing cardiac events.32 Other prospective clinical trials have shown that replacing carbohydrate calories with calories from nuts such as almonds, which are rich in monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats, reduces many of the metabolic abnormalities associated with metabolic syndrome.33 Clearly, a Mediterranean-type diet low in simple sugars and rich in vegetables, fruits, fish, nuts, olive oil, and whole grains is an ideal dietary strategy for helping to prevent metabolic syndrome. Bioflavonoids Inflammation and associated insulin resistance play a critical role in the development of metabolic syndrome and type II diabetes.34,35 Nutrients that act to down-regulate genes involved in inflammation are critical to preventing metabolic syndrome. Quercetin, a potent bioflavonoid found in vegetables, has been shown to inhibit the genetic expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines through inhibition of the NfkB pathway both in cell studies and animal trials.36 Along with quercetin, the bioflavonoid resveratrol, found in the skin of red fruits like grapes, has been shown in molecular pre-clinical studies to inhibit NfkB and cAMP response element binding protein-dependent, pro-inflammatory gene transcription to a greater extent than the potent cortico-steroid dexamethasone.37 The benefits of olive polyphenols are striking. Olive polyphenols have direct effects on the expression of genes involved in the vascular endothelium (the lining of blood vessel walls). At nutritionally relevant concentrations, hydroxytyrosol, a principal polyphenol in olives, reduced cell “stickiness” to the vascular endothelium by decreasing genetic expression for NfkB of vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) messenger RNA (mRNA).38 Furthermore, pre-clinical studies have shown that olive oil with a higher content of polyphenolic compounds shows protective effects in models of inflammation.39 Other pre-clinical studies have shown that olive polyphenols dramatically increase the resistance of LDL to oxidation.40 Oxidized LDL is a potent trigger for atherosclerosis.41 Tocopherols Vitamin E is an important nutrient in preventing metabolic syndrome, as it helps regulate several genes affecting cardiovascular disease risk:42 Genes that are associated with lipid uptake and atherosclerosis (CD36, SR-BI, and SR-AI) Genes that are related to inflammation, cell adhesion, and platelet aggregation (E-selectin, ICAM-1, integrins, glycoprotein IIb, IL-2, IL-4, and IL-beta). Furthermore, the appropriate genetic regulation of glucose transport protein (GLUT-3) is critical to optimal blood glucose control. Studies have shown that both aging and vitamin E deficiency are associated with decreased expression of GLUT-3.43 Carotenoids and Retinoids Using data from the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (1988-1994), researchers evaluated the intake of vitamins A and C, retinyl esters, five carotenoids, and other trace nutrients in 8,808 US adults aged 20 and older with and without metabolic syndrome. After adjusting for factors like age, sex, ethnicity, education, smoking status, and physical activity, they found that individuals with metabolic syndrome had significantly lower concentrations of retinyl esters, vitamin C, and carotenoids, except lycopene.44 Vitamin A is particularly important in preventing metabolic syndrome, given research showing that vitamin A plays a role in the regulation of genes involved in systemic insulin resistance. Specifically, researchers have shown that retinoic acid, the acid form of vitamin A, is a signal that inhibits the expression of resistin, an adipocyte-secreted protein previously proposed to act as an inhibitor of adipocyte differentiation and as a systemic insulin resistance factor.45 Pre-clinical models of early development have also shown that suboptimal intake of vitamin A decreases insulin-producing cells, and that this reduction can be attributed to a reduced rate of fetal beta-cell replication. This could potentially contribute to impaired glucose tolerance later in adult life.46 AN INTEGRATIVE STRATEGY FOR PREVENTING METABOLIC SYNDROME High-risk blood parameters • Triglycerides > 130 mg/dL • Triglycerides/HDL ratio > 3.0 • Insulin > 15 µU/mL • C-reactive protein > 3.00 mg/L • DHEA < 400 mcg/dL (men);< 350 mcg/dL (women) Dietary strategy • Avoid refined carbohydrates (for example, white flour, soda, potato chips, bagels) and saturated fats (such as bacon, beef, and tropical oils) • Emphasize fish, nuts, olive oil, vegetables, and whole fruits Nutraceutical strategy • DHEA: 10-50 mg per day to start (men), 10-30 mg per day to start (women); assess effect via repeat blood test • EPA/DHA: 2 capsules twice daily • Lipoic acid: 150 mg once or twice daily • Mixed bioflavonoids: 1400 mg twice daily • Mixed tocopherols: 400 IU twice daily with mixed tocotrienols (75 mg twice daily) • Vitamin A: 5000 IU per day, with mixed carotenoids (for example, lutein 5000 mcg, lycopene 3000 mcg, and zeaxanthin 360 mcg) daily • Water-soluble cinnamon extract: 85 mg three times daily, 30 minutes before meals • Barley extract: 2.5 grams three times daily with meals • Pycnogenol: 200 mg daily • Coffee extract standardized for 50% phenolic acids: 100 mg three times daily, 30 minutes before meals Exercise strategy • Moderate aerobic activity: 3-5 days per week for 20-40 minutes per session Cinnamon Extracts Figure 4: Effects of Malted Barley Extract on Fasting Blood Glucose Levels in Genetically Diabetic Mice In clinical trials, cinnamon has demonstrated remarkable effects on glucose control. In 2003, a placebo-controlled study of type II diabetes patients who were given one, three, or six grams a day of cinnamon or placebo showed that after 40 days, all three levels of cinnamon reduced mean fasting serum glucose by 18-29%, triglycerides by 23-30%, LDL by 7-27%, and total cholesterol by 12-26%. No significant changes were noted in the placebo groups.47 Cinnamon also has been shown to have excellent antioxidant properties. Natural water-soluble cinnamon extract has been shown to inhibit oxidation by 88%, while a synthetic antioxidant control, butylated hydroxytoluene, inhibited oxidation by only 80%.48 Water-soluble polyphenol polymers (polyphenol type-A polymers) from cinnamon increase insulin-dependent glucose metabolism in vitro. These polymers have recently been characterized by nuclear magnetic resonance and mass spectroscopy.49 The polyphenol type-A polymers from cinnamon up-regulate expression of genes involved in activation (phosphorylation) of the insulin receptor and increase glucose uptake in cell studies.50 In other cell studies, other cinnamon polyphenol polymers such as methylhydroxychalcone have been shown to be potent insulin mimics.51 Barley Extracts Purine adenine derivatives called cytokinins (not to be confused with the pro-inflammatory glycoproteins called cytokines) have been shown to control ribosomal RNA (rRNA) in barley.52 Furthermore, cytokinin genes in barley have recently been cloned.53 In pre-clinical studies, cytokinin-rich barley extract has been shown to alleviate many diabetes symptoms, including fasting serum glucose, in genetically obese mice, without affecting insulin levels.54 Most compelling is that the barley extract appears to function similarly to the drug metformin, known to dramatically improve plasma glucose in patients with type II diabetes. Cell study data show that barley extract inhibits gluconeogenesis (creation of new glucose molecules) in liver cells.55 Human pilot studies have also been impressive. The preliminary data show that barley extract reduced fasting and postprandial glucose levels in type II diabetes, reduced the LDL/HDL ratio, improved postprandial (after-meal) glucose, and improved glucose transport into muscle cells.55 Coffee Polyphenols Several published studies associate coffee consumption with a dramatically reduced risk of type II diabetes. For example, a large study (involving 16,670 men and women) published in JAMA in 2004 showed a very strong relationship between increased coffee consumption and decreased risk of developing type II diabetes mellitus.56 Another very large study that followed 41,934 men from 1986 to 1998, and 84,276 women from 1980 to 1998, showed a similar, powerful association between greater coffee intake and reduced risk for type II diabetes after adjusting for age, body mass index, and other risk factors.57 Water extracts of roasted coffee residues, including the primary coffee polyphenols caffeic acid and chlorogenic acid, have also been found to scavenge free radicals and offer protection against lipid peroxidation and the oxidative damage of protein.58 Found in relatively abundant amounts in coffee beans, chlorogenic acid is also found in blueberries, apples, and eggplant. Animal studies have shown that chlorogenic acid improves glucose tolerance, decreases fasting plasma cholesterol and triglycerides, and improves mineral pool distribution.59 Clinical studies have shown that chlorogenic acid delays glucose absorption and improves gastrointestinal hormone secretion. For example, a randomized crossover study in healthy volunteers showed that consuming 400 mL of decaffeinated coffee (equivalent to 2.5 mmol of chlorogenic acid per liter) significantly increased glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) secretion after meals compared to controls.60 The association between chlorogenic acid and GLP-1 is particularly remarkable. Several GLP-1-related pharmaceutical agents are mimicking this hormone as a treatment for type II diabetes mellitus, including the recently FDA-approved GLP-1 analog BYETTA™ (exenatide). Chlorogenic acid acts to increase GLP-1 and delay glucose absorption, thereby maintaining the responsiveness of the insulin-producing beta cells of the pancreas.61 Ferulic acid, another water-soluble coffee extract, improves blood vessel relaxation and decreases levels of homocysteine, an independent cardiovascular risk factor.62 Conclusion You are not doomed to disease by “bad genes”! Phenotypic nutrition enables you to choose dietary strategies and nutrients that influence powerful biochemical and genetic factors to help control the expression of your genetic code to your benefit. In a prevention program to guard against metabolic syndrome, the first step is identifying if you are at high risk. This can easily be accomplished by checking simple blood tests of triglycerides, insulin, HDL, CRP, and DHEA. Next, select specific nutritional strategies to beneficially influence the expression of your genetic code and biochemical make-up to decrease your disease risk. It is up to you—help control your own genetic destiny, or roll the dice and hope for the best. References 1. Ford ES, Giles WH, Dietz WH.

A novel beta-glucan fiber can limit surges of glucose and reduce degenerative disease risk, while helping you maintain a healthy body weight. Scientifically reviewed by: Dr. Gary Gonzalez, MD, on January 2021. Written By Debra Fulghum Bruce, PhD. Those who struggle with obesity often suffer from dangerously elevated glucose (blood sugar) levels. Beta-glucans (derived from oats and barley) slow the absorption of carbohydrates—enabling one to control blood sugar levels and induce the satiety needed to achieve healthy weight management. Side benefits of controlling blood glucose include lowering harmful blood fats and C-reactive protein. When blood sugar levels are stabilized, metabolic syndrome and diabetes can be averted. In this article, we explore how beta-glucans can protect against degenerative disease while offering a decisive advantage for those looking to take control of their blood sugar and their waistline. Fiber-Deficient Diet Elevates Disease Risk A number of health problems that plague aging adults—from high cholesterol to diabetes—can often be traced to inadequate levels of dietary fiber.1 Plant-derived fibers play many useful roles in the body, including binding with water to help propel partially digested foods through the intestinal tract. Principal dietary sources of fiber include whole grains, legumes, nuts, fruits, and vegetables. Americans consume an average of about 14 grams of fiber each day—less than half the amount recommended by the American Diabetes Association for disease prevention and wellness.2 In recent decades, as consumption of processed food has greatly increased, fiber intake has similarly decreased. The result is that most Americans are severely deficient in dietary fiber, and thus at much higher risk of contracting disease. In fact, a diet rich in fiber—particularly from cereal grains—is associated with a 40-50% lower risk of coronary heart disease and heart attack.3 Beta-GlucanS: A Fiber Powerhouse Beta-glucans, soluble fibers found in the cell walls of oats, barley, yeast, bacteria, algae, and mushrooms, have remarkable physiological health benefits. Studies show that when taken with meals, beta-glucan fibers markedly blunt post-meal elevations in blood sugar and insulin levels. Like other foods rich in soluble fiber, beta-glucans help improve blood glucose metabolism while also lowering serum lipid levels and improving colon health.4 About 30-40% of ingested soluble fiber is digested before reaching the colon, while the rest is fermented by bacteria in the large intestine to short-chain fatty acids, which may protect colon mucosa.4-6 Soluble beta-glucan fibers from oats and barley are notable in their ability to bind with water, thus increasing the volume and viscosity (thickness) of the intestinal contents. This leads to the slower absorption of carbohydrates into the bloodstream and decreased blood cholesterol levels.5 Fiber Modulates Post-Meal Blood Sugar Response The meager amounts of fiber that characterize the modern Western diet are a potent contributor to aberrant blood sugar metabolism and the growing epidemic of insulin resistance, metabolic syndrome, and type II diabetes. Currently, about 35 million Americans between the ages of 40 and 74 have impaired fasting glucose, and 16 million have impaired glucose tolerance. Because so many people have both conditions, the total number of adults aged 40 to 74 with pre-diabetes in the United States is estimated to be an astounding 41 million!7 We now know there is a direct link between ingesting carbohydrates and the resultant postprandial (after-meal) blood sugar response.8 After eating a large meal containing ample amounts of quickly absorbed carbohydrates and little soluble fiber, an individual may experience significant postprandial (after-meal) hyperglycemia, or high blood sugar. How quickly blood sugar rises sometimes depends on the glycemic index of the food consumed. The glycemic index is a numerical system that ranks foods on a scale of 0 to 100, according to how quickly their ingestion increases blood glucose levels relative to pure glucose itself. Although different foods may supply the same amount of carbohydratesper serving, they can have very different glycemic indexes. For example, highly processed foods such as white bread and doughnuts send blood sugar levels soaring, and have glycemic indexes of approximately 73-76.9 By contrast, naturally fiber-rich foods such as beans and raw pears slowly increase blood glucose and thus have far lower glycemic indexes, of approximately 29-38.9 Harvard studies suggest that the carbohydrate composition of foods plays a large role in their ability to promote or impair one’s health. High-glycemic-index foods that rapidly increase blood sugar contribute to the risk of heart disease and diabetes.10 However, not all fiber is created equal, especially when it comes to favorably influencing the glycemic index of foods. Scientists from the Agricultural Research Service found that barley fiber containing soluble beta-glucan fiber was more effective in regulating peak glucose response than wheat, a whole grain that contains no beta-glucans. They also noted beneficial reductions in glucose and insulin levels when oat-derived beta-glucans were ingested at mealtime.10 Other scientists have found that adding soluble fiber such as oat and barley beta-glucans to the diet helps modulate the after-meal rise in blood sugar, along with the insulin response to a meal containing carbohydrates.11-13 The low glycemic index values of oats or barley, both rich in beta-glucans, may stem from their ability to form a viscous gel with water in the gastrointestinal tract. This thick, gelatinous mixture delays the release of the stomach’s contents into the small intestine for further digestion. This contributes to slower production and release of insulin by the pancreas,14 as well as a slower rate of glucose uptake from the small intestine.15 Thus, the high viscosity of beta-glucans may play a critical role in reducing the more dangerous aspects of the glycemic response to a meal. Fiber May Help Avert Metabolic Syndrome, Diabetes Growing evidence suggests that soluble dietary fiber may play an important role in averting the dangers of metabolic syndrome, a precursor to diabetes associated with an elevated risk of cardiovascular disease.16 Metabolic syndrome refers to the constellation of metabolic abnormalities that includes abdominal obesity, high blood pressure, high blood sugar, high triglycerides, and low levels of beneficial high-density lipoprotein (HDL). A study of the prevalence of metabolic syndrome in the Framingham Offspring Cohort found that it was significantly less common among those who ingested the most whole grains and cereal fiber.17 Given both the high fiber content and a low glycemic index attributed to whole-grain foods, increasing one’s intake of whole grains may reduce the risk of developing metabolic syndrome. Since metabolic syndrome commonly precedes full-blown type II diabetes, dietary intervention with whole-grain fibers may help keep diabetes at bay. Dietary fibers also benefit those who already have type II diabetes. When diabetic patients consumed a healthy diet that substituted oat beta-glucans for some dietary fat, they exhibited notable improvements in metabolic parameters such as weight, HDL, and long-term blood sugar control.15 Beta-Glucans Lower Cholesterol, Improve Lipids Many physicians have long advised their cardiac patients to consider adding soluble fiber to their meals in order to reduce cholesterol levels. According to both the Third Report of the Expert Panel on Detection, the Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Cholesterol in Adults (ATP III) and the American Heart Association,18,19 the gel-forming characteristic of soluble fiber has been shown to improve lipid profiles.20 In one meta-analysis, researchers determined that for every 1-gram increase in soluble dietary fiber, potentially dangerous low-density lipoprotein (LDL) was reduced by 2.2 mg/dL on average.21 In particular, beta-glucan fibers are thought to lower cholesterol by increasing the bulk, volume, and viscosity of the intestinal tract’s contents, thus altering cholesterol and lipoprotein metabolism in the liver. Beta-glucans increase the excretion of bile acids released from the gall bladder. These bile acids are made up of oxidized cholesterol. The liver uses cholesterol to make more bile, which has the net effect of decreasing the amount of harmful LDL circulating in the blood.4 Thus, beta-glucans not only lower cholesterol, but also help to maintain already-normal levels of cholesterol. In a recent study in Venezuela, investigators set out to determine the effect of bread formulated with 6 grams of beta-glucans (oat-derived soluble fiber) on serum lipids of overweight men with mild to moderate hypercholesterolemia (high cholesterol). After eating a low-fat diet for one week, the men were divided into two groups. One group stayed on the American Heart Association (AHA) Step II diet with whole-wheat bread, while the other group remained on the AHA Step II diet containing high levels of monounsaturated fatty acids plus bread made with 6 grams of beta-glucan. It was suggested that all men exercise 60 minutes each day.22 After eight weeks, both groups of men reduced their body weight significantly. Those who ingested bread containing 6 grams of beta-glucans saw an impressive increase in their levels of beneficial HDL, which remained unchanged in the other group. Non-HDL cholesterol decreased in the beta-glucans group, and the total cholesterol/HDL ratio was reduced. While the diet with whole-wheat bread had no effect on fasting plasma glucose, the beta-glucans diet resulted in a decrease in fasting blood glucose. All of these improved lipid profiles reduced the risk of cardiovascular disease in the beta-glucans group.22 Beta-Glucans: What You Need to Know Fiber is an essential but often neglected constituent of a healthy human diet. While the recommended daily allowance of dietary fiber is 25-30 grams, Americans on average consume about half that amount. Scientists believe that inadequate dietary fiber contributes to some of the most prevalent health problems today, ranging from heart disease to metabolic syndrome and type II diabetes. Natural dietary fibers known as beta-glucans have been shown to be highly effective in helping to maintain healthy blood sugar control. By slowing the digestion and absorption of carbohydrates, beta-glucans help promote a feeling of fullness that effectively supports efforts to attain and maintain a healthy body weight. Other benefits of beta-glucans include modulating levels of harmful blood lipids and preventing metabolic syndrome. These plant-derived fibers may also help to quell dangerous inflammation in the body. Emerging research suggests a role for dietary fibers in preventing breast cancer and cancer metastasis. Incorporating a nutritional supplement rich in beta-glucans in one’s diet provides a convenient way to capture the numerous health benefits associated with optimal fiber intake. Fiber Promotes Satiety, Aids Weight Management Diets high in fiber may protect against unwanted weight gain via several mechanisms that involve effects on satiety and glucose and insulin responses.25 For example, research has shown that vegetarians weigh significantly less than non-vegetarians, whether measured by body mass index or body weight.26 Some experts believe that vegetarians’ lower average body weight is linked to one factor: the high fiber content of the plant foods consumed.27 Plant fiber fills you up quickly, and studies indicate that this results in less snacking and binging later in the day. The transnational Seven Countries Study provides additional evidence linking a high-fiber diet with lower body weight. Researchers found that people living in countries with high fiber intake weighed less than those living in countries where fiber intake is low.28 Higher fiber intake is also associated with lower average body weight in the US. In the Nurses Health Study, a prospective observational cohort study of female nurses aged 38 to 63 without known cardiovascular disease, cancer, or diabetes at baseline, those who ingested more dietary fiber consistently weighed less than did those who consumed less fiber.25 Finally, in the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) Study examining how heart disease develops in adults, researchers linked dietary fiber intake with body weight and waist-to-hip ratios, along with various markers of heart disease risk. Higher fiber consumption predicted less weight gain more strongly than did total or saturated fat consumption.27 Fiber Lowers CRP, Reduces Cardiac Risk C-reactive protein (CRP) is a special type of protein whose levels are increased in the blood in response to inflammation. People who smoke, have high blood pressure, are overweight, or have sedentary lifestyles often have elevated CRP, whereas lean, active people usually have lower levels. Like high serum cholesterol, high levels of C-reactive protein carry an increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Diets high in soluble fiber can help reduce CRP and thus lower the risk of heart disease.23 One review article noted a 28% reduction in CRP levels when volunteers consumed a whole-foods diet rich in soluble fiber.23 In another trial, 55 healthy adults were assigned one of three diets: a diet low in saturated fat; the same diet plus a cholesterol-lowering statin drug; or the same diet plus increased amounts of plant sterols, viscous fiber, soy protein, and nuts. After one month, serum C-reactive protein levels fell in all three groups. In the low-fat diet group, CRP dropped 10%, a difference not considered statistically significant. However, those who consumed a low-fat diet enriched with plant sterols and fibers achieved a statistically significant 28% reduction in CRP—nearly equaling the 33% drop seen in those taking a powerful statin drug.24 Supplementing with Beta-Glucans New Study: Beta-Glucans Supplement PropelS Weight Loss A recent trial demonstrates the ability of a high-viscosity fiber supplement containing beta-glucans to promote satiety and weight loss. Scheduled for publication in late 2007, this trial examined seven overweight or obese adults (with body mass indexes ranging from 25 to 35) who consumed 4 grams of a fiber blend containing beta-glucans each day for 16 weeks. The combination of the fiber supplement with a calorie-restricted diet and healthy lifestyle led to significant weight loss in the participants. In addition, the study participants reported a decrease in hunger and an earlier onset of fullness when eating.29 Adults seeking an effective way to manage their fluctuating blood glucose levels and stabilize their weight should consider supplementing with highly viscous beta-glucan fibers. Nutritional scientists have now made these beneficial fibers available in a pleasant-tasting drink mix that provides 5 grams of fiber per serving, or one fifth of the recommended daily fiber intake of 25 grams. According to the FDA, foods containing soluble fiber from whole oats (oat bran, oat flour, and rolled oats) may reduce the risk of heart disease when used in conjunction with a diet low in saturated fat and cholesterol. To qualify for the health claim, foods containing whole oats must provide at least 750 milligrams of soluble fiber per serving.30 To achieve cholesterol-lowering effects, doses of 3-6 grams of oat beta-glucans per day may be indicated.30 Oat beta-glucans are generally considered safe and well tolerated. The Physician’s Desk Reference reports no contraindications or precautions for using beta-glucans, and the only noted adverse effect is occasional intestinal gas.30 Conclusion Supplementing your daily diet with beta-glucan fibers derived from oats and barley is an ideal way to capture the abundant health benefits of optimal dietary fiber intake. When taken with meals, viscous beta-glucan fibers offer a convenient way to modulate the body’s response to carbohydrate-containing foods. In addition, these beta-glucan-rich grains can help lower potentially harmful blood lipids and avert the myriad dangers of metabolic syndrome. By promoting a feeling of satiety or fullness, beta-glucans can also contribute powerfully to healthy body weight management. References 1. Suter PM. Carbohydrates and dietary fiber.

The good news is that scientists are uncovering powerful agents that can prevent and even reverse the neurodegenerative effects of normal aging. Scientifically reviewed by: Dr. Gary Gonzalez, MD, on January 2021. Written By Dave Tuttle. Even people who pay careful attention to what they eat may see their blood sugar levels increase as they get older. Likewise, aging is associated with a potentially hazardous decline in insulin sensitivity. The regrettable outcome is that an ever-growing number of adults are diabetic or pre-diabetic, with glucose levels that are slowly but surely rising above the desired threshold of 100 mg/dL. Fortunately, scientists have discovered that, in addition to weight loss and exercise, certain phytonutrients can help your body defend itself against these dangers. Natural plant chemicals from cinnamon and coffee fruit can help control blood sugar in several ways, thus offering protection against dangerous conditions such as metabolic syndrome and diabetes. How the Body Controls Blood Sugar The body regulates blood sugar levels in several ways. The one most commonly understood involves insulin, a hormone secreted by the pancreas that delivers glucose to cells throughout the body. When you eat a meal, the pancreas responds by releasing insulin to transport the glucose into the cells. As long as receptors on the cell walls remain sensitive to insulin, the channeling of glucose out of the bloodstream occurs relatively quickly and without excessive insulin production. Sometimes, however, the cells become resistant to insulin’s effects. When this happens, the pancreas pumps out ever-greater amounts of insulin in an attempt to force the glucose into the cells. This effort is only partially effective in most instances, and may result in higher blood glucose levels and eventually type II diabetes. Nutrients such as chromium and lipoic acid may help to improve insulin sensitivity.1 Unfortunately, in some non-insulin-dependent diabetics and obese individuals, the body’s internal glucose-releasing mechanisms are more active than they should be, increasing blood glucose beyond optimal levels. Down-regulation of these processes can therefore be beneficial to controlling blood sugar.2 Computer artwork of an insulin molecule. Cinnamon Promotes Healthy Blood Sugar Cinnamon has been used for several thousand years in traditional Ayurvedic and Greco-European medical systems. Native to tropical southern India and Sri Lanka, the bark of this evergreen tree is used to manage conditions such as nausea, bloating, flatulence, and anorexia. It is also one of the world’s most common spices, used to flavor everything from oatmeal and apple cider to cappuccino. Recent research has revealed, however, that regular use of cinnamon can promote healthy glucose metabolism. A study performed at the US Department of Agriculture’s Beltsville Human Nutrition Research Center isolated insulin-enhancing complexes in cinnamon that are involved in preventing or alleviating glucose intolerance and diabetes.3 Three water-soluble polyphenol polymers were found to have beneficial biological activity, increasing insulin-dependent glucose metabolism by roughly 20-fold in vitro.3 The nutrients displayed significant antioxidant activity as well, as did other phytochemicals found in cinnamon, such as epicatechin, phenol, and tannin. Moreover, scientists at Iowa State University determined that these polyphenol polymers are able to up-regulate the expression of genes involved in activating the cell membrane’s insulin receptors, thus increasing glucose uptake and lowering blood glucose levels.4 These benefits of cinnamon have been confirmed in animal experiments. For example, when rats were given two different doses of an oral cinnamon supplement for three weeks, glucose infusion into their cells more than doubled, even with the lower dose studied.5 The extract improved insulin action by enhancing the insulin-signaling pathway in skeletal muscle, resulting in increased glucose uptake. Cinnamon can even help control the negative effects of a diet high in fructose, a simple sugar.6 When rats were fed large amounts of fructose for three weeks with or without the addition of cinnamon extract to their drinking water, the cinnamon extract improved the glucose infusion rate in the fructose-fed animals so much that it equaled that of control rats eating a standard chow diet. According to the study authors, this suggests that the early use of cinnamon could prevent the development of insulin resistance in those who consume abundant fructose sugar. Because the incidence of cardiovascular disease is increased up to fourfold in type II diabetics, researchers have sought out nutrients that can simultaneously improve glucose metabolism and lipid levels. In a recent study published in Diabetes Care, cinnamon proved to be such a dual-action agent. Sixty adults (30 men, 30 women) with type II diabetes were divided into six groups. The first three groups consumed one, three, or six grams of cinnamon daily, while the other three groups consumed equivalent numbers of placebo capsules. The spice or placebo was consumed for 40 days, followed by a 20-day washout period. After the initial 40-day period, all three levels of cinnamon reduced mean fasting serum glucose levels by 18-29%. The one-gram dose also reduced triglyceride levels by 18%, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) by 7%, and total cholesterol by 12%. Higher doses of cinnamon produced even greater reductions in triglycerides, LDL, and total cholesterol.7 Cinnamon Even better, these decreases persisted throughout the 20-day washout period. While glucose and triglyceride levels increased modestly during the washout period compared to day-40 levels, they remained below the levels recorded before cinnamon supplementation began. Meanwhile, LDL and total cholesterol levels continued to decline throughout the 20 days after cinnamon use stopped. This study suggests that cinnamon has sustained effects, so the benefits should continue even if a dose is occasionally missed. The results also suggest doses of one gram or more are likely to be beneficial in controlling blood glucose and lipid levels.7 Cinnamon thus appears to be one of the most powerful nutrients available for improving glucose metabolism. USDA researchers at the Beltsville center studied the effects of 49 herbs, spices, and medicinal plant extracts on glucose utilization in the fat cells of rats.8 They found that cinnamon was the most bioactive product, followed by witch hazel, green and black teas, and allspice. The active phytochemicals in cinnamon were determined to be the polyphenols. Another Beltsville study found that cinnamon potentiated insulin activity more than threefold.9 Coffee Fruit Cuts Diabetes Risk Coffee is one of the world’s most popular beverages, yet most people know very little about the fruit that produces coffee beans. Grown in mountainous tropical climates, the brightly colored fruit ripens into a glowing red fruit that is usually harvested by hand. The fruit’s exterior is discarded and the bean is dried and processed. Roasting normally occurs in the country where the beverage will be consumed. However, as with many fruits, most of the powerful nutritional benefits of coffee are found in the whole fruit itself, not just in the seed (or bean). Nature evolved the cherry of the coffee shrub to withstand intense ultraviolet radiation found at mountainous elevations. As a result, whole coffee fruit is loaded with beneficial antioxidants and other powerful plant nutrients that are partially destroyed during the separation and roasting processes of conventional coffee production. Kona coffee beans growing on tree. This nutrient-rich coffee fruit has been relegated to virtual obscurity because it quickly deteriorates during normal coffee harvesting. Now, however, a patent-pending technology has been developed that preserves the whole coffee fruit, eliminating the potential for toxicity and making it possible to develop supplements that contain all of the nutrients naturally found in the fruit. The coffee fruit contains some well-studied phytochemicals such as chlorogenic acid, caffeic acid, ferulic acid, and quinic acid.10 These nutrients have recently been shown to help quench free radicals,11 provide cardiovascular benefits,12 and reduce cholesterol oxidation.13 However, some of coffee fruit’s most impressive effects can be seen in blood glucose management. Chlorogenic acid and caffeic acid are the two primary nutrients in coffee that benefit individuals with high blood sugar. Glucose-6-phosphatase is an enzyme crucial to the homeostatic regulation of blood sugar. Since glucose generation from glycogen stored in the liver is often overactive in people with high blood sugar,2 reducing the activity of the glucose-6-phosphatase enzyme leads to reduced blood sugar levels, with consequent clinical improvements. Chlorogenic acid has been shown to inhibit the glucose-6-phosphatase enzyme in a dose-dependent manner, resulting in reduced glucose production.14 In a human clinical trial at the Moscow Modern Medical Center, 75 healthy volunteers were given either 90 mg of chlorogenic acid a day or a placebo. Blood glucose levels of the chlorogenic acid group were 15-20% lower than those of the placebo group.15 Chlorogenic acid also has an antagonistic effect on glucose transport, decreasing the intestinal absorption rate of glucose.16 This may help to reduce blood insulin levels and minimize fat storage. Caffeic acid has benefits for elevated blood sugar as well. At National Cheng Kung University in Taiwan, scientists determined that this acid increases glucose uptake into cells, helping to remove it from the bloodstream.17 When researchers at nearby Taipei Medical College injected caffeic acid into diabetic rats, they saw a dose-dependent reduction in plasma glucose.18 However, a similar effect was not observed in normal rats, suggesting that insulin is not involved in this action. In a related experiment, the researchers ob-served that caffeic acid reduced elevated plasma glucose in insulin-resistant rats receiving a glucose challenge test.18 Three studies have shown that coffee consumption helps reduce the risk of type II diabetes. In an analysis of more than 17,000 Dutch men and women, the more coffee a person drank, the lower the incidence of diabetes. Consuming three to four cups a day decreased the risk by 23%, while persons drinking more than seven cups daily cut their risk in half.19 Blood glucose test in diabetes. A study among middle-aged Finnish men and women confirmed these results. The Finns drink more coffee per capita than any nation in the world, so its impact on their public health could be dramatic. After controlling for numerous variables, this study found that consuming three to four cups a day reduced diabetes risk by 24%. Those consuming 10 or more cups lowered their risk by 61%. The scientists suggested that this protective effect is partially due to the inhibition of glucose-6-phosphatase activity by chlorogenic acid, since glucose-6-phosphatase is widely considered a significant factor in the abnormally high rates of hepatic glucose production observed in the diabetic state.20 Consequently, they believe that reduced glucose-6-phosphatase hydrolysis can lower glucose output, leading to decreased plasma glucose concentrations. Chlorogenic acid also has an antagonistic effect on glucose transporters at the intestinal stage, and has been shown to influence the secretion of two gastrointestinal peptides known for their glucose-lowering effects.20 These various mechanisms may explain why coffee can produce such a dramatic decrease in the incidence of diabetes. Another study of coffee consumption explored the relative benefits of caffeinated versus decaffeinated coffee. This analysis examined the intake patterns of more than 41,000 men and nearly 85,000 women participating in the Health Professionals Follow-up Study and the Nurses’ Health Study. Due to the different start dates for these investigations, the men were followed for 13 years and the women for 18 years. While the researchers found correlations between regular caffeinated coffee and diabetes that were similar to those of previous studies, they also discovered a lesser, but still significant, relationship between decaffeinated coffee and disease incidence. After controlling for several variables, men who drank one to three cups of decaffeinated coffee daily reduced their risk by 9%, while those drinking four or more cups a day lowered it by 26%. Women experienced a slightly smaller reduction in risk than men. Tea drinkers saw no decrease in their risk for diabetes.21 While caffeine intake is associated with a decreased risk of type II diabetes, intake of decaffeinated coffee can still cut your chances of developing diabetes. For those who wish to avoid stimulants like caffeine, this is good news indeed. A Major Advance in Glucose Management The growing epidemic of type II diabetes in the United States is neither surprising nor inevitable. It is a direct consequence of a profound deterioration in the dietary habits and lifestyle practices of millions of Americans. Fortunately, health-conscious individuals can implement preventive strategies to help maintain healthy blood sugar levels. In addition to exercising regularly and maintaining a healthy body weight, nutrients such as chromium and lipoic acid can help support optimal insulin action, helping to keep the body’s cells sensitive to insulin’s signals. Cinnamon increases glucose uptake into the cells, while coffee fruit contains phytochemicals that promote healthy blood sugar levels. In combination with regular exercise and maintenance of a healthy body weight, these nutrients can help support optimal metabolic function and blood sugar control. References 1. Kelly GS.

Learn how you can protect yourself against a newly identified (yet overlooked) cause of heart disease, stroke, and aneurysm. Scientifically reviewed by: Dr. Gary Gonzalez, MD, on January 2021. Anatomy of a portion of the cardiovascular system, showing the heart, aorta, and prominent arteries of the upper torso. An arteriole (small branch of an artery) is shown in cross-section. If you’ve seen a loved one suffer and die from cardiovascular disease, knowing that your own cholesterol is normal can be a relief. Unfortunately, standard cholesterol panels based on fasting blood samples may overlook a hidden, potentially deadly cause of cardiovascular disease: dysfunctional lipid (fat) metabolism patterns known as postprandial disorders. Postprandial (after-meal) disorders are characterized by abnormally persistent lipid (fat) remnants that persist in the bloodstream for up to 24 hours after eating. Hours after dinner, and even during sleep, these abnormal fat particles can inflict serious damage to your arteries. In fact, postprandial disorders are among the most potent—yet widely ignored—causes of heart disease, stroke, and aneurysm. In this article, we examine lipid remnants that lurk in the blood between meals, how you can detect the presence of these deadly compounds, and nutritional strategies that can help you reduce and eliminate them. As you eat a meal of, say, steak, buttered rolls, salad dressing on your lettuce, and cream in your coffee, food passes through your digestive tract. The fats contained within this food are first broken down by enzymes, and then absorbed into veins passing through the liver. From there, they go into the body’s circulatory system. Four to six hours later, the remnants of your meal should be history. Digestion and clearance from the blood should be quick and efficient. After six hours, these remnants should no longer be detectable in the bloodstream. In some people, however, meal remnants persist in the blood even 10, 12, or 24 hours later. The longer they stick around, the more opportunity they have to trigger the growth of atherosclerotic plaque in arteries. Clinical studies show that these postprandial lipoproteins (lipids that are transported by protein carriers known as “lipo-proteins”) are powerful instigators of coronary plaque, carotid plaque, and aneurysms of the aorta. Cut-away view of the primary parts of the digestive system. After processing in the stomach, food passes to the duodenum (the first portion of the small intestine). Here, it is combined with bile (fat-digesting juices made in the liver and stored in the gall bladder), pancreatic juices and enzymes (made by the pancreas), and intestinal enzymes for further digestion. These post-meal lipid remnants lurk in the blood from the moment you begin eating, but usually dissipate by the time your “fasting” blood is drawn to assess your risk for vascular disease. Postprandial disorders are therefore almost always overlooked or ignored, and rarely enter into a doctor’s assessment and treatment of vascular risk and disease. Although their presence may not be apparent from a fasting blood sample, postprandial lipoproteins can still be a critically important instigator of vascular disease. Postprandial Patterns: Potent Causes of Vascular Disease When postprandial lipoproteins linger for many hours after eating, they are afforded ample opportunity to exert damaging effects on vascular structures. Postprandial lipoprotein particles insert themselves into atherosclerotic plaque, fueling its growth.1 They contribute to atherosclerosis through other paths as well: Postprandial lipoproteins block the natural artery-relaxing agent known as nitric oxide, while increasing the artery constrictor called endothelin. This induces endothelial dysfunction (an impaired ability of the arterial walls to dilate),2,3 which in turn contributes to the formation of atherosclerotic plaque.4 Postprandial lipoproteins increase blood levels of cellular adhesion molecules, allowing inflammatory white blood cells to more readily adhere and gain entry to the arterial wall, which also leads to atherosclerotic plaque formation.5 Postprandial lipoproteins activate blood clotting by increasing factors that both promote blood clotting and inhibit clot breakdown.6 Postprandial lipoproteins trigger the formation of a cascade of other abnormal lipoprotein particles that contribute to heart and vascular disease, such as small low-density lipoprotein (small LDL) particles.7 Carotid ultrasound studies show that people who have elevated postprandial lipoproteins have more carotid plaque than people who do not, independent of their cholesterol values.8,9 Postprandial lipoproteins also predict a greater likelihood of coronary atherosclerotic plaque, and people with excessive postprandial abnormalities experience more rapid plaque growth.8-11 Triglycerides: Building Block of Postprandial Lipoproteins Because triglycerides are a principal component of postprandial lipoproteins, elevated fasting triglycerides—which can be readily measured using a standard lipid or cholesterol test panel—can serve as an indirect index of increased postprandial lipoproteins. If triglycerides are high, postprandial lipoproteins are likely to be present. What constitutes “high” is arguable, though fasting triglycerides equal to or greater than 100 mg/dL are clearly associated with greater postprandial lipoproteins. This issue is essentially ignored in the national guidelines for cholesterol and lipid management (the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III),12 which specify that triglyceride levels of 150 mg/dL or higher are associated with an increased likelihood of postprandial lipoprotein elevation.13,14 It has long been the position of the Life Extension Foundation that aggressive steps (such as using fish oil supplements) should be taken to reduce triglycerides over 100 mg/dL. Simply put, the higher your triglycerides, the more likely postprandial lipoproteins are also present, potentially putting you at risk for atherosclerotic disease. However, fasting triglycerides are not foolproof, and an excess of postprandial lipoproteins can still occur even with triglyceride levels of less than 100 mg/dL.1 Metabolic Syndrome Promotes Postprandial Lipoproteins Metabolic syndrome is a frighteningly common precursor to diabetes that can create an excess of postprandial lipoprotein abnormalities. Metabolic syndrome—the cluster of metabolic abnormalities that include high triglycerides, high blood pressure, high blood sugar, excess abdominal fat, and low HDL—is rampant throughout America, with one in four adults now showing established degrees of this condition.15 The more features of metabolic syndrome present, the more likely postprandial lipoproteins are elevated—even if fasting triglycerides are normal. In the presence of metabolic syndrome, postprandial lipoproteins are not only present at higher levels, but may persist longer in the bloodstream.16 Full-blown metabolic syndrome is not required for a person to exhibit excessive postprandial lipoproteins. Having hypertension alone, for example, suggests the presence of greater postprandial lipoprotein levels.16,17 People with metabolic syndrome exhibit higher blood sugar after meals (usually 140 mg/dL or more), since sugar is unable to enter into the body’s tissues. Now deprived of sugar, these tissues (particularly muscle) turn to burning fat for energy, which causes the release of free fatty acids in the blood. This cascades into an increase of postprandial triglycerides and other abnormal particles.18 Increased blood insulin levels associated with metabolic syndrome trigger the liver to overproduce very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) particles, a principal postprandial lipoprotein particle. Postprandial lipoproteins, including VLDL, are ineffectively cleared from blood, permitting their accumulation and raising blood levels of VLDL as much as several-fold.19,20 Postprandial lipoproteins such as VLDL spark formation of potentially harmful small LDL particles, a leading cause of coronary plaque. The abundant triglycerides in postprandial lipoproteins are inserted into LDL particles by an enzyme known as cholesteryl-ester transfer protein, which is the crucial first step in creating small LDL particles.21 Thus, persistent postprandial lipoproteins not only cause atherosclerosis, but also set in motion a “domino effect” of other particles that likewise contribute to atherosclerotic disease.22 While the elevated insulin levels associated with metabolic syndrome cause postprandial lipoproteins to persist in the blood, the reverse also occurs: postprandial lipoproteins block the body’s response to insulin, aggravating pre-diabetes.23 Thus begins a vicious cycle that accelerates toward full-blown diabetes. Although metabolic syndrome is an important indicator of increased and persistent postprandial particles, increased postprandial lipoproteins commonly occur without metabolic syndrome and when fasting triglycerides are at desirable levels. This has led doctors and scientists to wonder whether a better indicator of persistent and elevated postprandial particles exists. Postprandial Disorders: What You Need to Know Even if your fasting cholesterol profile results are normal, you may still be at risk of cardiovascular disease if you suffer dysfunctional lipid metabolism, or postprandial disorders. These occur when the breakdown products of fats, known as postprandial lipoproteins, linger in the bloodstream many hours after eating. Postprandial lipoproteins contribute to atherosclerotic plaque buildup, endothelial dysfunction, increased blood-clotting tendencies, and dangerous lipid patterns, such as small low-density lipoprotein (small LDL). Since postprandial lipoproteins are derived from triglycerides, high levels of fasting triglycerides strongly suggest the presence of postprandial lipoproteins. Because the diabetes precursor known as metabolic syndrome is frequently accompanied by high triglycerides, metabolic syndrome often indicates the presence of postprandial lipoproteins. A principle postprandial lipoprotein is very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL), which is processed into intermediate-density lipoprotein (IDL), a potent trigger of atherosclerotic plaque growth. IDL can be measured using advanced lipoprotein testing known as the Vertical Auto Profile (VAP™). The presence of any IDL indicates increased cardiovascular disease risk. To reduce postprandial lipoproteins, replace saturated fats in your diet with monounsaturated fats (such as olive and canola oils) and polyunsaturated omega-3 fatty acids (from fish oil and flaxseed oil). Reducing your intake of refined carbohydrates (such as those found in white bread, pasta, cakes, and cookies) in favor of lean protein and fiber-rich foods will also help to reduce postprandial lipoproteins. Weight loss and vigorous exercise help lower levels of postprandial lipoproteins. Nutrients such as green tea, soy protein, and white bean extract can likewise be effective. Pharmaceutical agents that lower postprandial lipoproteins include diabetes medications and cholesterol-lowering drugs. Fasting blood samples are limited in their ability to detect disease by their failure to detect postprandial lipoproteins. Advances in blood testing are making it possible to assess cardiovascular risk factors, including postprandial lipoproteins. Critical Role of Intermediate-Density Lipoprotein (IDL) Beyond fasting triglycerides and VLDL, there is a measure of postprandial lipoproteins that is reliable and readily available: intermediate-density lipoprotein (IDL). After being released into the blood by the liver, VLDL particles are processed in the blood over several hours, yielding IDL. IDL persists longer than VLDL and signals the persistence of postprandial particles. A normal amount of IDL is none—that is, no IDL whatsoever should be detected in fasting blood. If present, IDL triggers atherosclerotic plaque growth.24,25 It may also be a potent risk factor for abdominal and thoracic aneurysms of the aorta (a bulging of part of the wall of the body’s largest artery). The presence of IDL also heightens the likelihood of pure soft plaque in carotid arteries, the kind that easily fragments, releases debris, and causes strokes.26,27 IDL can be measured using the Vertical Auto Profile lipoprotein test (VAP™ test). For lipoprotein testing, blood is usually drawn after an 8- to 12-hour fast. IDL particles can persist up to 24 hours after a meal and thus may remain elevated even during the “fasting” period. If IDL particles are present in a fasting blood sample, a substantial postprandial abnormality is clearly present, which can play a major role in causing atherosclerotic disease. Testing for Postprandial Lipid Disorders Unlike LDL and total cholesterol, postprandial patterns lack clear-cut guidelines to follow. Nonetheless, some general guidelines can still be useful to gauge whether a postprandial lipid disorder is a factor in your cardiovascular risk profile. Standard blood test indicators of postprandial lipid disorder include: Fasting triglycerides equal to or greater than 100 mg/dL.13 If fasting triglycerides are over 150 mg/dL1,13, you almost certainly have a postprandial disorder. On blood samples drawn four to six hours after a meal, triglycerides over 250 mg/dL indicate a postprandial disorder.28 In most cases, if fasting triglycerides are equal to or greater than 100 mg/dL, increased postprandial triglycerides and other lipoproteins, like VLDL and IDL, are also present. Specific measurement of postprandial (after-meal) blood samples does add more telling information, but in practicality is usually not necessary. Because IDL persists for a long period after eating, even beyond the four- to six-hour after-meal window during which triglycerides are increased, any amount of fasting IDL is among the best and most powerful indicators of a postprandial disorder. IDL is among the additional measures available through advanced lipoprotein testing, such as the VAP™ test. Strategies for Reducing Postprandial Lipoproteins Saturated fats, like those found in butter, shortening, and fried foods, are especially potent inducers of excess postprandial lipoproteins. Because postprandial disorders cause fats to linger longer, avoiding unhealthy fats is doubly important. Minimizing these fats is advisable for other reasons, such as reducing LDL, blood pressure, inflammation, and cancer risk. While avoiding saturated fats will not eliminate postprandial lipoproteins, it will help reduce them.29 A polyunsaturated omega-6 fatty acid—linoleic acid derived from safflower oil—also raises postprandial lipoprotein levels, just as saturated fats do.3 Although the immediate cause of persistent and increased postprandial lipoproteins is an unhealthy fat-containing meal, two varieties of fat reduce postprandial lipoproteins: • Monounsaturated oils, like olive oil, modestly reduce postprandial lipoproteins. Monounsaturated oils may thus be a preferable form of oil for cooking and everyday use.3,30 • Polyunsaturated omega-3 fatty acids reduce postprandial lipoproteins dramatically. It is not uncommon to see omega-3 supplementation eliminate abnormal postprandial patterns entirely. Sources of omega-3 fatty acids include fish oil, flaxseed oil, and walnuts. If undesirable saturated fats lead to increased postprandial lipoprotein particles, does a low-fat diet reduce postprandial lipoproteins? Paradoxically, it does not. All too often, low-fat diets can evolve into diets rich in processed carbohydrates, which cause postprandial lipoprotein particles to multiply out of control.31 Diets that are rich in monounsaturated fats, omega-3 fats, fiber, and lean proteins, and low in saturated fats and processed carbohydrates, are effective tools in reducing postprandial lipoproteins.32 The following strategies can reduce triglycerides dramatically, and help reduce or eliminate IDL and postprandial lipoproteins: • Weight loss can greatly reduce triglycerides and postprandial lipoproteins, particularly with a diet that is low in carbohydrates and high in protein and monounsaturated fats. Cutting out processed carbohydrates (such as breads, crackers, breakfast cereals, bagels, and pretzels) alone can yield a 30% reduction in postprandial lipoproteins.33,34 Increasing your intake of yogurt, cottage cheese, and other low-fat dairy products, raw almonds and walnuts, and fish, chicken, turkey, and other sources of lean protein will also yield substantial reductions in postprandial lipoprotein particles. Weight loss restores the insulin responsiveness lost in metabolic syndrome, which also reduces postprandial lipoproteins.31 Illustration of the structure of a low-density lipoprotein (LDL) particle, a form of cholesterol found in the blood. • Omega-3 fatty acids in fish oil exert powerful effects in reducing postprandial lipoproteins. Ingesting just 1200 mg of EPA/ DHA from fish oil can easily lower IDL by 50%, and higher doses can produce even greater reductions. When fasting triglycerides are higher than 200 mg/dL, or when IDL is increased, higher doses of fish oil may be indicated to fight excess postprandial lipoproteins. Omega-3 fatty acids decrease liver production of VLDL by 30% or more, and lower IDL by 70% or more.35,36 Omega-3s also activate the enzyme known as lipoprotein lipase, which accelerates clearance of postprandial lipoproteins from the blood.37 Fish oil can safely augment the cholesterol-lowering effects of statin drugs such as Lipitor®, yielding dramatic improvement in triglycerides, VLDL, and postprandial lipoproteins.38 • Soy protein (20 grams per day) from tofu, soy milk, soy protein powder, and other sources can lower LDL by 10-20 mg/dL and reduce postprandial lipoproteins by 10%.39 • Green tea contains catechins (flavonoids) that can decrease postprandial lipoproteins by up to 30%. Approximately 600-700 mg of green tea catechins are required to achieve this effect, the equivalent of 6-12 servings of brewed tea. Nutritional supplements also provide green tea catechins at this dose.40 Green tea’s effectiveness in accelerating weight loss may augment its ability to reduce postprandial lipoproteins. • White bean extract blocks the sugar-digesting enzyme known as alpha-amylase, thereby reducing the absorption of sugars. A recent study showed that participants who took 1500 mg of white bean extract twice a day for eight weeks lost an average of four pounds and lowered their triglycerides by an average of 26 mg/dL.41 • Vigorous exercise can reduce postprandial lipoproteins by 30%.42 • Diabetes treatment (with insulin or oral hypoglycemic drugs, for example) significantly reduces postprandial lipoprotein levels.43,44 The thiazolidinedione drug Actos® may be especially effective for its postprandial lipid-suppressing effects; a similar agent, Avandia®, may be modestly effective.45,46 The agent metformin also reduces fasting and postprandial triglycerides by 25%.47 (Caution: Like other thiazolidinediones, Actos® and Avandia® can cause fluid retention, which may lead to or exacerbate heart failure. Actos® and Avandia® should be discontinued if any deterioration in cardiac status occurs.) • Statin drugs such as Zocor®, Crestor®, and Lipitor® not only lower cholesterol, but can reduce postprandial lipoproteins by 30-80%.48 • Fibrates (cholesterol-lowering drugs such as Lopid® and Lofibra®) can reduce postprandial lipoproteins by 70%. They can be a useful second-line strategy if fish oil, weight loss, and nutritional efforts fail to do the job.49 Clearly, choosing the right foods and fish oil supplements should be your first choice in controlling a postprandial disorder. Fish oil is safe, inexpensive, and easy to take, yet it provides an extraordinary array of benefits, including reduced risk of sudden cardiac death, stroke, and depression.50 Weight loss, exercise, soy protein, and green tea can all increase your likelihood of success. Because of their possible side effects, prescription drugs should always be your last choice for correcting postprandial patterns and other disorders. Why Fasting Is Necessary for Blood Work When you have blood drawn to measure cholesterol and other markers, you are instructed to fast for 8-12 hours beforehand. If postprandial disorders (such as IDL or an exaggerated increase in triglycerides) become apparent only after eating, why not have blood drawn after a meal? Doctors instruct their patients to fast for cholesterol tests because triglycerides rise after a meal, and triglycerides are used to calculate LDL. Because LDL is usually the sole focus of the conventional approach to heart disease prevention, the fact that triglycerides are elevated, postprandial or fasting, is simply ignored. Thus, over the years, doctors have failed to recognize elevated triglycerides in the after-meal period as a powerful, independent indicator of risk. In the future, there will be growing recognition of our over-reliance on LDL as the only important value for gauging the risk of atherosclerotic disease, and measures of postprandial triglycerides and other postprandial lipoproteins will gain increased recognition. Rather than fasting for your blood work, it may be obtained in the first few hours after a meal. Right now, however, there are insufficient data to justify this practice on a broad scale, though we occasionally do such testing on certain patients in our clinical practice. Improvements over conventionally calculated LDL that requires fasting will also allow blood to be drawn in a non-fasting state. Measures that are superior to calculated LDL—such as directly measured LDL, VLDL, and LDL particle number and size (all available through VAP™ lipoprotein testing)—can eliminate the need for fasting while providing more clinically useful information. As experience grows, standard meals (that is, specific preparations of known fat, protein, carbohydrate, nutrient, and fiber composition) will be used to develop standards to better diagnose postprandial disorders. This way, people and populations can be compared based on their response to a standardized meal. Because the meals you choose yourself can vary tremendously in composition, postprandial blood obtained for analysis can likewise vary, whether or not you have a postprandial disorder. Until then, we are left with reasonably good insight into postprandial patterns provided by fasting triglycerides, VLDL, and IDL levels. Mindful attention to these critical blood markers can greatly enhance and preserve your vascular health. Dr. William Davis is an author and cardiologist practicing in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.

Read how to control your blood sugar through diet modification, nutritional supplements, weight management, and physical exercise. Scientifically reviewed by: Dr. Gary Gonzalez, MD, on January 2021. Written By Lyle MacWilliam, BSc, MSc, FP. Almost everyone knows someone who has diabetes. An estimated 18.2 million Americans and 2 million Canadians, over 6% of each nation’s population, have been diagnosed with diabetes.1,2 Millions more have the disease and are unaware of it. The World Health Organization estimates that by 2025, the number of people with diabetes will reach 300 million—a staggering 122% increase in less than 30 years.3 At the dawn of the third millennium and 83 years after the discovery of insulin, “we are still grappling with the enormous complexity of a disease process in which almost every aspect of the body’s metabolism goes awry.”4 Diabetes is now recognized as the sixth leading cause of death and disability in the US. Its associated health care costs have spiked dramatically, more than doubling from $44 billion to $92 billion from 1997 to 2002. In Canada, diabetes treatment now consumes 15% of the national health care budget. Today, diabetes accounts for 28% of all new cases of kidney disease in Canada, and is a primary cause of adult blindness, non-trauma-related limb amputations, and major cardiovascular events.5 Source: National Diabetes Clearinghouse. The disease exhibits a strong ethnic bias: Native Americans, Hispanic-Latino Americans, and African-Americans show an increased prevalence compared to the non-Hispanic white population. Unknown in Canada’s aboriginal community until recently, type II diabetes has undergone exponential growth. Within the next two decades, 27% of Canada’s First Nations (native) peoples are expected to develop the disease.5 Epidemiological data from elsewhere mirror the North American situation. Within the next 30 years, diabetes is projected to soar by almost 50% in Great Britain, 72-78% in New Zealand and Australia, and a staggering 184% in Mexico.6 Diabetes is often misunderstood as a simple sugar imbalance that can be readily corrected through medical intervention. In truth, it is a complex metabolic disorder in which a confluence of social, behavioral, dietary, and lifestyle factors unmask an underlying genetic susceptibility. The disease has serious implications for vision, cardiovascular health, and kidney and neural functions. Its expression largely depends on lifestyle issues, including diet, weight management, and physical exercise—a multifaceted combination of factors that makes treatment complex and challenging. The Driver: Type II Diabetes The predominant form of diabetes is type II or non-insulin-dependent diabetes, a disease highly correlated with family history, physical inactivity, obesity, and ethnicity. Traditionally associated with middle age, the incidence of type II diabetes among younger adults and children is rising dramatically. More common in women, especially those with a history of gestational (pregnancy-related) diabetes, its prevalence in America has tripled in the last 30 years. While increasing across all age and ethnic groups, its ascendance among children and adolescents is most worrisome. Over 90% of diabetics are type II, and it is the rapid increase in this form of the disease that is propelling the global increase in all diabetes cases. While diabetes exhibits a strong hereditary component, its rate of increase is too great to be a consequence of increased gene frequency. Instead, evidence points toward the combined influences of lifestyle, dietary, and environmental factors.7 An Emerging Epidemic: Diabetes and Children Virtually unknown in children until recently, type II diabetes is now appearing with alarming regularity in overweight and sedentary young people. During the last three decades, the number of overweight children in the US has more than doubled. With this has come a dramatic rise in type II diabetes. In major US urban centers, the percentage of children with newly diagnosed type II diabetes has ballooned from less than 5% in 1994 to 30-50% in recent years.8 Obesity is a hallmark of the disease. A predisposition toward visceral obesity (deposition of abdominal fat) is associated with increased insulin resistance and contributes to its early onset.9 This may explain why 85% of American children who develop type II diabetes are overweight or obese at the time of diagnosis. According to Dr. Arlan Rosenbloom, chair of the American Diabetes Association Consensus Panel, “Type II diabetes in children is an emerging epidemic.” Insulin Resistance: the Silent Stalker Syndrome X is the dark force behind type II diabetes. Also known as metabolic syndrome, it is a preclinical stage of the disease, believed to affect up to 25% of North American adults. A constellation of metabolic changes that progress silently over a period of years, Syndrome X is characterized by increased resistance to insulin, the regulatory hormone that suppresses hepatic (liver) glucose output and removes excess glucose from the blood. Diagram of the homeostatic (insulin-glucagon) system. View enlarged image The onset of insulin resistance is characterized by a host of related symptoms, including: hypertension (high blood pressure) elevated blood triglycerides (fats) elevated LDL (“bad”) cholesterol reduced HDL (“good”) cholesterol accelerated hardening of the arteries proliferation of cells in the arterial walls development of abdominal obesity glycosylation (cross-linking of fats and proteins with glucose) hyperinsulinemia (high-blood insulin levels). The syndrome is particularly alarming in children and adolescents because the changes, which in adults are usually spread over a number of years, are compressed into a few short years in young teens.10 The longer a person has the disease, the greater the likelihood of developing long-term disabilities. Unfortunately, physicians are now seeing more young people prematurely develop these life-threatening complications. The prognosis is not encouraging: approximately one-third to one-half of those diagnosed with insulin resistance will develop diabetes. Of those, two-thirds will eventually die of cardiovascular complications. Compared to non-diabetics, adult diabetics are almost twice as likely to have asthma, three times more likely to have hypertension and heart disease, and four times more likely to suffer a stroke.11 Clearly, early detection of the disease is paramount. A Delicate Balance Insulin is produced by highly specialized beta cells in the pancreas, a lobular gland located behind the stomach. The hormone is secreted into the blood in response to elevated blood-sugar levels. Insulin helps the body utilize blood sugar by binding to specialized receptor sites on the cellular surfaces, much like a key fits into a lock. Insulin “unlocks” the receptor and glucose (a molecule too large to pass through) is transported into the cell. Once inside, glucose is used for cellular fuel, and any excess is stored as glycogen (a form of animal starch) or converted to glycerol for the formation of fat. When blood sugar levels are low, or during times of stress, liver glycogen stores are quickly converted back to glucose by the action of glucagon, another pancreatic hormone. Glucagon also encourages the breakdown of fat in adipose tissue to glycerol and fatty acids. The liver reconverts these to glucose, releasing it into the blood. Through this intricate balancing act, insulin and glucagon perform a central role in regulating the body’s blood-sugar level. Rising insulin resistance disrupts this balance when the normal levels of insulin no longer unlock the cellular “doors.” The beta cells of the pancreas, in a futile attempt to restore homeostasis, shift into “overdrive” and begin pumping out ever-increasing amounts of insulin. Chronically high levels of insulin further “desensitize” the cellular receptors, leading to even greater insulin resistance. A vicious and damaging cycle ensues—the genesis of type II diabetes. Photomicrograph of human pancreas magnified 125x. The Mechanism of Onset What defies explanation is what causes insulin resistance in the first place. We know that virtually everyone who develops type II diabetes starts with insulin resistance. We also know that the risk of developing type II diabetes is strongly correlated with central body obesity and the ectopic (abnormal) accumulation of fat. It appears that insulin resistance may not be determined so much by the amount of body fat as by where the fat is located.4 In fact, one of the best predictive markers for insulin resistance is excess body weight, in particular weight around the waist. McGarry presents a compelling case that the ectopic accumulation of fat in muscle and other peripheral tissues is intimately involved with the onset of insulin resistance and the gradual collapse of pancreatic beta cell function.4 Insulin sensitivity can fall dramatically without the appearance of diabetes, as long as the pancreatic beta cells compensate. It is their inevitable demise (possibly due to lipotoxicity) that leads to increased hyperglycemia, a further rise in blood lipids, and an ever-greater accumulation of fat in the muscle cell. Increasing hyperlipidemia (high blood lipids) in turn exacerbates insulin resistance and degrades liver function. According to McGarry, in the progression from being overweight to being obese, the liver becomes resistant to insulin and the hormone’s ability to suppress hepatic (liver) glucose production. “Under these conditions, the hyperinsulinemia turns the liver into a ‘fat-producing factory’ with all of its negative downstream effects.”4 Once established, these disturbances in lipid metabolism are devastating to blood sugar balance and weight management. Accel-eration of the cycle and eventual collapse of pancreatic insulin production herald the appearance of diabetes. The answer to how these metabolic derangements begin may lie in the “thrifty gene hypothesis,” which postulates the presence of a genetic factor designed to promote extra fat deposition.12 Speculation also suggests a defect in the leptin-signaling system, a metabolic pathway that appears to mediate fatty acid metabolism in muscle tissue and acts as a kind of “fuel gauge” to monitor cellular energy status.13 (Leptin, a chemical messenger produced by the adipose, or fat-storing, cells of the body, initiates the breakdown and oxidation of stored fat.)14 Still other research points to the possible development of functional resistance to the actions of the leptin hormone itself.15,16 Whatever the mechanism, a diminished capacity to oxidize fat appears to be a pre-eminent clinical marker for insulin resistance.17-19 This is supported by animal studies, which confirm that dietary lowering of muscle triglycerides improves insulin sensitivity and reverses diabetes.20,21 The fact that two of the most effective preventive programs for diabetes are diet and exercise lends credence to the argument that onset of the disease involves a profound disturbance in lipid dynamics. Assessing Your Risk for Diabetes The previous clinical definition of insulin resistance syndrome required evidence of insulin resistance. Disturbances in glucose metabolism, however, develop relatively late in the disease’s progression. Consequently, under the old definition, many people in the early stages of insulin resistance went undiagnosed. The new definition, developed recently by the US National Cholesterol Education Panel, incorporates five easily measured variables: abdominal obesity elevated fasting blood triglyceride levels low levels of HDL (“good”) cholesterol high fasting blood sugar levels high blood pressure. Under the new definition, a person with any three of these conditions is classified as having insulin resistance syndrome. To assess whether the new criteria could predict excess risk for heart disease and diabetes, researchers found that the risk of coronary heart disease—and, more strikingly, diabetes—rose as the number of metabolic abnormalities increased. Men with four to five features of the syndrome had almost four times the risk of coronary heart disease and 25 times the risk of diabetes compared to those with no abnormalities. The study also confirmed that C-reactive protein, an inflammatory marker, was significantly elevated in men with metabolic syndrome compared to those without metabolic syndrome.22 Current guidelines suggest that people are diabetic if their fasting glucose levels exceed 126 mg/dL (7.0 mmol/L). Levels over 109 mg/dL indicate a prediabetic state and levels below 109 are considered normal. While significantly improved from the previously used glucose tolerance test, these recommendations may still be too lenient. In October 2003, the American Diabetes Association further reduced the cut-off for impaired glucose tolerance from 109 to 100 mg/dL, meaning anyone with fasting glucose levels above 100 would be classified as prediabetic. More recently, the Life Extension Foundation has prescribed optimal fasting glucose levels of less than 86 mg/dL.23 This recommendation is based on clinical evidence that higher fasting levels can progressively and markedly increase cardiovascular risk.24 Lowering the bar on fasting glucose levels is a good thing, as it is estimated that up to one-half of diabetes sufferers have not been diagnosed.25 Screening for diabetes should begin at 45 years of age and should be repeated every three years in persons without risk factors and more frequently in individuals with risk factors.26 The Life Extension Foundation believes that high fasting blood levels of insulin (hyperinsulinemia) is the first indication of insulin resistance syndrome. Lifestyle Considerations Fortunately, insulin resistance and type II diabetes lend themselves to a holistic approach to disease management. Lifestyle modifications can have a remarkable impact on prevention and treatment. Controlling insulin resistance—not the high blood sugar levels caused by it—is the key to success. The Obesity Connection With a death toll second only to smoking, obesity claims the lives of nearly 300,000 Americans each year.27 According to the American Diabetes Association, “Obesity is now reaching epidemic proportions in the US and elsewhere.” From 1991 to 2001, obesity in America increased 74% while the prevalence of diabetes increased 61%. The tripling of type II diabetes incidence over the last 30 years owes much to this surge in obesity. A recent study by researchers at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention investigated the links between obesity, diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, asthma, and arthritis. Compared to adults of a healthy weight, obese adults had twice the risk for high cholesterol, three times the risk for asthma, four times the risk for arthritis, and over six times the risk for hypertension.28 The strongest correlation was between obesity and diabetes: obese people exhibited over seven times the risk for diabetes compared with people of normal weight. The good news is that up to 90% of type II diabetes cases can be prevented with simple lifestyle changes, including diet, exercise, and smoking cessation.29 The Diabetes Prevention Program, a multi-center trial involving over 3,200 people with impaired glucose tolerance, was the first large-scale study to demonstrate conclusively that weight loss can effectively delay type II diabetes. Results showed that lifestyle intervention, consisting of calorie reduction and 30 minutes a day of mild exercise, reduced risk by 58%—almost double that conferred by the oral diabetes drug metformin (Glucophage®). The results were so convincing that the study was concluded earlier than planned. The authors surmise that up to 10 million Americans can sharply lower their risk of diabetes through simple attention to diet, exercise, and lifestyle modification.30 These findings are supported by the earlier work of Dr. Roy Walford, who demonstrated that caloric restriction aggressively lowers both fasting glucose and blood insulin levels.23 Growing evidence suggests that C-reactive protein may also play a role in the development of central body obesity and the onset of type II diabetes.31 Abdominal fat is a major source of this inflammatory agent, and the increased risk of atherosclerosis and insulin resistance associated with visceral obesity may well be a consequence of enhanced C-reactive protein secretion. The surest and safest way to remedy the situation is to lose weight. Women who completed a 12-week restricted-calorie diet lost an average of 17.4 pounds and reduced their C-reactive protein levels by 26%.32 One thing is certain: people who are overweight are already in a prediabetic state and need to take corrective action before the damage is done. Unfortunately, most diagnoses occur far too late in the game. The Value of Diet While opinions differ as to which ratio of carbohydrates, proteins, and fats is optimal in preventing and treating diabetes, it is safe to say that carbohydrates create insulin. As more carbohydrates are consumed, more insulin is produced. Today’s obesity and diabetes epidemics reflect that too many people are asking their bodies to run on the wrong grade of fuel—refined carbohydrates. In the 1980s, Americans consumed an average of 12 pounds of sugar each year; today, US per-capita sugar consumption is an astounding 150+ pounds per year.33 Stanford’s Dr. Gerald Reaven suggests that a diet consisting of 45% carbohydrates, 40% “good” fats, and 15% protein will benefit individuals with insulin resistance. According to Reaven, only when healthy fats replace carbohydrates will insulin levels drop and clusters of symptoms associated with insulin resistance abate.34 Unfortunately, the standard diabetic diet recommended by most physicians is very high in carbohydrates, which raises blood sugar, stimulates insulin production, and almost guarantees that the diabetic will be a patient for life. People need to pay attention not only to their total carbohydrate load, but also to the types of carbohydrates they eat. High-glycemic foods—such as white rice, white flour-based products, pasta, starchy vegetables, and many processed foods—are quickly converted to blood sugar when digested, causing insulin levels to spike. Conversely, the carbohydrates found in low-glycemic foods, such as asparagus, broccoli, cabbage, green beans, and other low-starch vegetables and fruits, are converted slowly to blood sugar and create a more gradual rise in blood insulin levels. Avoiding “white foods” is a simple recipe that can help you avoid trouble. Fats and Fiber While total fat intake does not appear to influence the risk of diabetes, consuming trans-saturated fats (trans fats), the hydrogenated or partially hydrogenated oils so ubiquitous in processed and fast foods, can greatly increase your risk for diabetes. A recent study showed that a minuscule 2% increase in calories from trans-fatty acids raised the risk of diabetes in women by 39%; conversely, a 5% increase in calories from polyunsaturated (good) fats reduced the risk for diabetes by 37%.35 If nothing else, simply replacing trans-fats in the diet with polyunsaturated fats will reduce the risk of diabetes dramatically. Dietary fats that are considered to be beneficial include extra virgin olive oil, fish oil, almond oil and almond butter, avocados, nuts, and seed oils such as sesame, pumpkin, sunflower, and flax. Eating a diet rich in soluble and insoluble fiber improves insulin sensitivity and reduces circulating insulin levels. Fiber impedes gastric emptying and the passage of food through the gut, slows the breakdown of high-glycemic starchy foods, and delays glucose uptake into the blood. In a recent study reported in the New England Journal of Medicine, researchers conclude that a high-fiber diet significantly improves glycemic control, decreases insulin levels, and lowers plasma lipid concentrations in as little as six weeks.36 Exercise Is Essential Exercise improves cardiovascular function and the body’s ability to metabolize glucose. Weight loss through exercise and diet correlates to a return to normal levels of insulin resistance and may be the single most effective approach to treating insulin resistance and reducing the risk of diabetes.37 Conditioned muscles are more responsive to insulin and blood sugar balance than non-conditioned muscles,33 possibly due to an increase in the number of insulin receptors on the muscle cell. Physical exercise burns calories, and as energy expenditure is increased, the incidence of diabetes is found to decrease. Moreover, this protective effect appears to be most pronounced in individuals who are at greatest risk for developing the disease.38 Physically fit people also secrete less insulin. Results from the Nurses’ and Physicians’ Health Studies, conducted in the early 1990s, reveal that insulin response is more attenuated in physically fit individuals than in people who are less fit.39,40 Researchers recently demonstrated that when individuals are introduced to a regular exercise program, they experience a striking decrease in their risk of developing diabetes.41 In fact, regular exercise, when combined with weight loss, can reduce the insulin requirements of type II diabetics by up to 100%.42,43 A low-glycemic, reduced-calorie diet with healthy fats and fiber, along with regular exercise, is a safe and effective means to prevent and treat diabetes, as well as to shed excess weight. The Role of Supplements Beyond a healthy diet, considerable evidence demonstrates the efficacy of daily nutritional supplementation as a way to prevent and treat diabetes. The following dietary supplements have been found to be particularly beneficial: Alpha-lipoic acid enhances the breakdown of glucose through intervention at several points along the central metabolic pathway. Supplementation provides a significant boost in glucose disposal and insulin sensitivity.44 Biotin assists in the metabolism of fats, proteins, and carbohydrates, and directly influences blood glucose levels by enhancing glucokinase activity.45 (Glucokinase is an enzyme that controls the first step of glucose oxidation.) Supplementation at high levels significantly improves glucose control and reduces the risk of diabetic neuropathy.46 L-carnitine deficiency is common in diabetics and is associated with cataract formation and cardiomyopathy (weakening of the heart muscle). Supplementation improves insulin sensitivity, in-creases glucose storage, and optimizes carbohydrate metabolism.47 Carnitine also appears to protect against diabetic neuropathy by lowering sorbitol levels in nerve cells. Carnosine, an amino acid peptide, prevents cross-linking of glucose with proteins (glycation) and arrests the formation of advanced glycation end-products in the cell.48 Glycation accelerates the aging process and is problematic in diabetics. Carnosine also bolsters proteolytic (protein-destroying) pathways to dispose of damaged proteins created through glycation. Chromium is essential in modulating glucose metabolism and boosting glucose sensitivity.49 It enhances insulin-dependent transport of glucose into the cell, likely by facilitating the binding of insulin to the receptor site. Supplementation at 1000 micrograms per day has been found to markedly reduce insulin resistance.50 As over 90% of adults are deficient in chromium, daily supplementation is warranted. Coenzyme Q10, an important component of the cell’s central metabolic pathway, enhances cellular energy production and protects cells from damage by free radicals. Japanese researchers cite its ability to boost respiratory chain function in pancreatic beta cells and improve glycemic control.51 Magnesium lowers blood glucose, increases insulin sensitivity, reduces stress response (which promulgates diabetes), and assists in the maintenance of healthy beta cells.52 Low magnesium status is common among type II diabetics53 and is believed to disrupt insulin secretion and the hormone’s capacity to transport glucose. Supplementation has been found to increase the number and sensitivity of cellular insulin receptors50 and to mitigate carbohydrate intolerance.45 N-acetyl-L-cysteine protects pancreatic beta cells from oxidative damage. Free radicals flourish in fatty tissue and when circulating glucose levels are high (two conditions common in insulin resistance syndrome and diabetes). Supple-mentation with N-acetyl-L-cysteine lowers blood sugar levels, protects beta cells from glucose toxicity, and suppresses beta cell death.54 Vitamin C (ascorbic acid) lowers blood glucose, inhibits glycation,55 prevents the accumulation of sorbitol (which causes cataracts), and synergizes and replenishes other antioxidants. By reducing the level of C-reactive protein, ascorbic acid helps quench the inflammatory response in diabetics and lowers cardiovascular risk. Because vitamin C is the principal antagonist for the excessive free-radical activity observed in diabetes, its presence is critical.45 As most diabetics are deficient in this important nutrient, supplementation is essential. Vitamin E (alpha-tocopherol), a potent lipid-phase antioxidant, quenches lipid peroxidation, increases insulin sensitivity, and enhances glucose transport. High-dose vitamin E supplementation at 1200 milligrams per day has been found to reduce vascular inflammation and lower C-reactive protein levels.56 Vitamin K appears to play an important role in the regulation of blood sugar57 and the reduction of interleukin-6 (IL-6), an inflammatory marker for diabetes; however, people on anticoagulant drugs, such as Coumadin®, should not take vitamin K. Insulin resistance and diabetes can also be treated successfully with plant-based remedies indigenous to many native cultures. Several herbal remedies are remarkably effective and, unlike drug therapies, have few or no side effects. Hormone therapies, using testosterone and dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), show considerable promise. For a detailed description of these complementary therapies, readers are encouraged to consult the protocols in the Life Extension Foundation’s Disease Prevention and Treatment book,58 as well as Michael Murray’s excellent treatise in his book, Healing Power of Herbs.59 References 1.

Written By Ivy Greenwell.   Anti-aging medicine is really a very ancient field, Dr. Barry Sears points out in his latest book, The Anti-Aging Zone. There exists an Egyptian papyrus, written 2,600 years ago, called ""Book for Transforming an Old Man into a Youth of Twenty."" Likewise, Taoist sages prescribed diet regimens, herb potions and special exercises in the hope of preserving vigor and attaining physical immortality. Stories of magical elixirs and immortality-giving, youth-preserving ""food of the gods"" are a common theme in mythology and literature, showing humanity's longing to conquer aging. Amazingly, for millennia humans believed that the right special food could preserve eternal youth; that there existed something the gods ate or drank that prevented aging. This aging-retarding food of the gods is right in our kitchen, Sears announces. But the secret is not so much in what we eat, as what we do not eat. If we eat less, we will live longer. Or, as Sears puts it, ""The fewer calories you consume, the less energy is required to process the incoming food and the fewer free radicals you make. The fewer free radicals you make, the longer you live."" And no, we do not have to go hungry. Sears promises that by using food wisely, we can slow down aging and still have plenty of energy and no feeling of deprivation at all. Calorie restriction: the ""Holy Grail"" of anti-aging The first rule of anti-aging seems a harsh one: we must eat less. ""There is only one consensus in the world of anti-aging: the only proven way to reverse aging is to restrict calories,"" Sears explains. There is nothing new here, as attested by the old saying to the effect that most people dig their own graves with a fork. Yes, we readily agree that many people, perhaps most, in effect kill themselves by eating too much. There are no obese centenarians. But what about the usual contention that Americans, the fattest people in the world and in the history of the world, are incapable of practicing calorie restriction? Sears finds that the main problem is ignorance about proper food choices. He asserts that it is indeed possible to feel perfectly sated and have a lot of energy if one eats the correct carbohydrate-restricted diet that includes sufficient protein and fat-the two macronutrients that will stabilize blood sugar in the longevity-promoting low-normal range and provide sustained energy. Then, instead of the government recommended 2000 calories/day for the average woman and 2500 calories/day for the average man, one can go down to 1200 calories for the average woman and 1500 calories for the average man. Health benefits should be enormous. Why? Because, Sears explains, 90% of free radicals in our bodies are generated through the utilization of food. In spite of the outcry about pollution and radiation, these are relatively marginal sources of free radicals. The sad truth is that the more calories we eat, the more free radicals we generate. And if most of these calories come from high-glycemic carbohydrates (bread, cereal, pasta, pastry, most fruit juice, overcooked vegetables, etc.), then we also begin to suffer from hyperinsulinemia and hypercortisolism, with a corresponding drop in beneficial hormones such as DHEA and growth hormone. The result of both excess calories and the endocrine imbalance that follows is the creeping middle-age spread (as the saying goes, ""middle age starts when you start growing in the middle""), and no end of degenerative disorders. What is the secret of being able to reduce calories without going hungry? According to Sears, the crucial concept is the inversion of the USDA food pyramid, with its bizarre, pro-aging recommendation of up to eleven daily servings of starchy foods. Starches-cereal, bread, pasta and other refined carbohydrates-are placed at the very top of Sears' anti-aging pyramid, with the admonition: ""Use sparingly."" While the government urges us to eat mainly bread, cereal, pasta and the like refined carbohydrates, Sears says that these should be severely reduced, even eliminated. Instead of being the main staple, they should hardly be consumed at all. Humans evolved to thrive on the kind of food that was available before the relatively recent development of agriculture and food processing. Sears is impressed with the diet of our remote ancestors. The Paleolithic hunter was a world-class athlete; the mostly vegetarian agricultural people who followed later were stunted and disease-ridden by comparison. According to Sears, if all bread disappeared from the earth, we'd be better off. Bread, including the so-called whole-wheat bread, is very efficient at raising our blood sugar and insulin. If you ever see the insulin curve after a ""meal containing bread,"" you would be quite motivated to eliminate all forms of bread except perhaps a bit of coarse rye. If we eliminated bread from our diet, most likely we'd live longer and remain practically free from heart disease and cancer. What would we eat in the place of bread and other cereals? Lots of vegetables, as long as they are not overcooked, and moderate servings of low-glycemic fruit. When refined starches are used sparingly (if at all), and all meals including snacks contain adequate protein and fat, blood sugar and insulin stay in the optimal low-normal range. Calorie intake can thus be easily controlled, without insulin-induced hunger and the obesity that generally results from a low-fat, high-carbohydrate diet, especially when such diet is combined with the modern sedentary lifestyle rather than hard physical labor in the fields. I think that in this volume Sears succeeds at last in clarifying the misunderstanding that followed his first book. He emphatically points out again and again that the Zone diet is not a weight-loss diet. It is a life-long calorie-restricted, carbohydrate-restricted diet aimed at controlling blood sugar and insulin. In other words, it is a special form of calorie restriction that should work to slow aging. Sears thinks that anyone interested in extending life span should follow his plan-no ifs, ands or buts. The plan can be modified according to individual needs (athletes can use more fat, for instance; some people have genetically better metabolism and can do well on a higher carbohydrate protein ratio). But it is still the same idea: restrict high-glycemic carbohydrates. The typical American diet has become the very opposite of calorie restriction. With the emergence of breakfast cereals and fast food, it has also grown to be very unbalanced: cold cereal and fruit juice for breakfast, a white-bread sandwich for lunch, followed by a pasta dinner, with sugary junk food snacks in between. It is a high-carbohydrate prescription for obesity, disease and rapid aging. Macronutrients Sears calls his nutritional regimen a ""protein-adequate diet,"" rather than a high-protein diet. Yet it is hard to deny that no macronutrient looks as good as protein in terms of the benefits it provides. For one thing, Sears attributes the dramatic increase in longevity (as well as the equally dramatic increase in the average height) during the twentieth century chiefly to greater consumption of protein. Adequate protein means an adequate immune system-and Sears convincingly documents that the decline in the rate of mortality from infectious diseases started even before the advent of antibiotics. Protein plays a starring ""good guy"" role also because it stimulates the release of glucagon, the little-known but extremely important pancreatic hormone. Glucagon helps us sustain normal blood sugar levels. Unlike insulin, which is a storage hormone and thus keeps energy stored as fat, glucagon releases our energy stores. Protein-induced release of glucagon also makes it unnecessary for the body to rely on cortisol in an attempt to maintain an adequate supply of glucose. Cortisol can do the job, but at a big price. In addition, certain amino acids play an important physiological role. Arginine, for instance, is necessary for the production of nitric oxide, which is of great importance for vasodilation, short-term memory and immune function. Sears recommends frequent consumption of turkey and soy protein as sources of arginine. Healthy fats (Sears basically means fish oil and olive oil) also look extremely good: the benefits include lower and more stable blood sugar, lower insulin, higher metabolic rate and increased immune function, among others. Fat slows the rate of carbohydrate entry, thus helping keep blood glucose and insulin steady and normal, without harmful surges. In addition, fat signals the brain to produce the message: ""Stop eating."" Because fat is essential for controlling blood sugar, every meal, including snacks, should include fat, just as it should include protein. It is, alas, carbohydrates, especially the grain-derived processed carbohydrates (bread, cereal, pasta) so beloved of many diet gurus, that lead to most trouble and can seriously accelerate aging. There are essential amino acids and essential fatty acids, but insofar as we know, there are no essential carbohydrates. If we are to practice calorie restriction in order to live longer, this is the part of the diet that is most dispensable-and, according to Sears, the most pro-aging. Sears states, ""The key to practical calorie restriction is to determine the minimum level of carbohydrates you need to function efficiently."" Still, it is unfair to accuse Sears of trashing all carbohydrates. He trashes only the high-glycemic, grain-derived starches and excess fruit and fruit juice. Otherwise, unlike Atkins and the high-protein school, he is in emphatically in favor of including a certain minimum of low-glycemic carbohydrates in order to avoid ketosis. The argument with Atkins is not successfully resolved. It has not yet been established whether mild ketosis is actually harmful-after all, mild ketosis is the state we wake up in every morning. Some experts claim that our Paleolithic ancestors were often in a state of mild ketosis, especially hunters out on a long hunt. If the transition is slow rather than sudden, side effects such as a feeling of weakness (which in any case is transient) should not happen. What goes wrong in some cases is that a person on an 80% carbohydrate diet reads one of Atkins' books, and the next day it's nothing but cottage cheese for breakfast, and meat and salad for lunch and dinner. Then s/he goes for an evening run and discovers that s/he doesn't seem to have the energy to do it. With a slow transition to a ketogenic diet, the initial side effects are minimized, and a sense of well-being, alertness and high energy follows. On the other hand, there is also something to Sears' argument that ketosis results in increased urination, and thus the risk of electrolyte loss. Since bananas are definitely the forbidden fruit when one is on a very carbohydrate-restricted, ketogenic diet, getting sufficient potassium may be difficult. But here again, the counterargument is that the kidneys do adapt, and the body learns how to preserve electrolytes. Maybe the worst thing for those who rely on ketosis for weight loss is that fat cells also adapt to ketosis and are said to become ""fat magnets,"" becoming more efficient in accumulating fat once more carbohydrates start coming in. This has indeed been observed: if a person returns to considerably higher carbohydrate consumption, the regain of lost fatty tissue is shockingly rapid. But this seems to happen after any low-calorie diet. The solution is basically to stay on the diet on a life-long basis-and here Sears' plan has an advantage, since his diet is not so extreme, and does include a satisfying amount of plant food. And there is a truly compelling reason that Sears cites for our need to consume a certain minimum of low-glycemic carbohydrates: it is the only way to obtain many valuable phytochemicals, so important for the prevention of heart disease and cancer. And if we eat this plant food raw, we are also getting the benefits of natural, live, enzyme-rich food. Type II diabetics: ""Canaries in the coal mine of aging"" Sears points out that type II diabetics, with their high blood sugar and high (but ineffective) insulin, their greater rates of free radical formation, lipid peroxidation, glycation, and higher levels of inflammation are the very picture of accelerated aging. The higher the level of blood sugar, the more severe and frequent the problems typical of diabetes (and also of aging): impotence, depression, cataracts, glaucoma, atherosclerosis, kidney failure, dementia and more. The main reason for this, according to Sears, is that insulin is our ""passport to accelerated aging."" Let us bear in mind that type II diabetics actually have elevated insulin levels; the problem is that they are insulin-resistant, so their pancreas keeps pumping out more and more insulin in the effort to lower blood sugar. Unlike diabetics and most of the elderly, individuals with low blood sugar and low insulin have been found to be healthiest and to live the longest. Diabetics, with high blood sugar and high insulin, age fast and die prematurely. Insulin is a potent accelerator of aging for many reasons. By now many people know that it promotes obesity, with disastrous consequences for the cardiovascular system. But few know that insulin is a very powerful growth factor. It drives more frequent cell division, thus leading to faster telomere shortening. It makes tumors proliferate faster. Insulin also decreases the levels of cyclic AMP, the ""second messenger"" used by many hormones to communicate with the cells, thus decreasing endocrine regulation of body functions. The result is hormonal miscommunication and metabolic chaos. In addition to this, insulin also inhibits the release of glucagon, thus promoting the release of cortisol, another hormone whose levels tend to rise with aging. Excess cortisol has its own pro-aging consequences. That's why Sears calls elevated insulin ""your worst aging nightmare."" It should be emphasized that this applies to elevated insulin-and aged people typically have higher insulin levels than young people. They also have higher blood sugar; the problem is insulin resistance. A certain level of insulin is essential for health. The same is true of ""bad"" prostaglandins. One of the virtues of Sears' book is that it stresses the notion of balance. Calorie-restriction, Okinawan centenarians and Luigi Coronaro The island of Okinawa is famous for having four times as many centenarians per 100,000 people as the rest of Japan. Compared to other Japanese, Okinawans have 60% lower mortality due to heart disease, stroke and cancer. According to Sears, the secret of the superior health and longevity of the Okinawans is their Zone-like diet: less rice, more protein (fish and pork), and three times as many vegetables. It is of special interest that Okinawans eat twice as much fish than the average Japanese. People for whom fish is the main source of protein seem to be the healthiest in the world, healthier by far than strict vegetarians. They have the lowest rates of heart disease and Alzheimer's disease. Part of the answer lies in the anti-inflammatory benefits of omega-3 fatty acids; we are becoming increasingly aware that inflammation plays an important part in most degenerative diseases of aging. At the same time, Sears points out, fish protein is the only animal protein that is a poor source of omega-6 fats; thus a fish-eater is not loading up on excess linoleic acid. Sears quotes yet another example of calorie restriction: the longevity of Luigi Coronaro, a sixteenth-century Italian nobleman. Coronaro started his Spartan diet of coarse dark bread, red wine, meat broth and eggs only at the age of fifty, in a state of poor health, and still managed to live until 98-back then, an unheard-of great old age. It is a great pity that Coronaro began calorie restriction so late in life. Fish oil and eicosanoids Sears says, ""I believe that aging can be viewed as a growing eicosanoid imbalance over time,"" as well as ""All roads to anti-aging lead to eicosanoids,"" and ""Eicosanoid balance is the real key to anti-aging."" Another way of stating this is that Sears proposes something of an ""inflammatory theory of aging."" The levels of inflammatory chemicals (not only pro-inflammatory prostaglandins) go up quite dramatically with aging. Sears does not suggest that all of aging can be explained as a consequence of increasing inflammation, but he is a pioneer who emphasizes the pro-aging role of inflammation. In order to understand his ideas more fully, we must first understand eicosanoids. If the newness of the term bothers you, you can substitute the term ""prostaglandins."" Prostaglandins are the best known and most studied member of the eicosanoid family. Synthesized from fatty acids, eicosanoids are powerful, short-range, short-lived cellular hormones that have a very direct role in controlling our physiological function. This is where the balance of omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids becomes crucial, as well as hormones such as insulin, cortisol, glucagon and estrogens. Cortisol blocks the production of all prostaglandins, good and bad, radically decreasing inflammation. But this comes at a severe price if the action of cortisol continues unopposed. Insulin promotes the production of inflammatory eicosanoids through its activation of delta-5-desaturase, the enzyme that initiates the production of arachidonic acid, the substrate for inflammatory prostaglandins and other ""bad"" eicosanoids. Glucagon, the thyroid hormone triiodothyronine (T3), and estrogens decrease the activity of delta-5-desaturase, and thus lower the production of arachidonic acid and ultimately of inflammatory eicosanoids. And then there is eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), Sears' favorite fatty acid. It can be made by the body from alpha-linolenic acid (found in flax and Perilla oils, but can also be obtained pre-formed from the oil of cold-water fish such as salmon. Sears regards EPA as the most important modulator of eicosanoid production. In simpler words, EPA is a powerful anti-inflammatory. But simply taking fish oil supplements is not as optimal as taking fish oil in addition to frequently eating fish. Why should you eat fish even if you already take fish oil? Because it is the only animal protein that happens to be poor in omega-6 fatty acids. Eating fish further helps to undo the ravages of our excess consumption of omega-6 fats. The cardioprotective effects of fish oil are well-documented. Likewise, fish oil is one of the mainstays of alternative treatment of arthritis and other inflammatory disorders. Fewer people know that high consumption of fish is also associated with significantly lower risk of Alzheimer's disease. Another great promise of Sears' anti-aging program is that the combination of insulin-lowering, calorie-restricted diet and fish oil will dramatically reduce the risk of cancer. Cancer is primarily a disease of aging, promoted by high insulin and pro-inflammatory prostaglandins. Calorie restriction and fish oil help reduce both. The carbohydrate-restricted, anti-inflammatory Zone diet, Sears claims, also acts as an antidepressant. Interestingly, depressed individuals have been found to have higher levels of inflammatory prostaglandins. This may be one of the reasons why depression is such a strong risk factor for heart disease and cancer. It also implies that the anti-inflammatory omega-3 fats such as fish oil should ameliorate depression, which appears to be the case. Can one get enough EPA by just eating fish? Probably, if you eat the way that inhabitants of traditional fishing villages do, enjoying freshly caught fish every day. The cardiovascular profile of such people has been found to be better than that of total vegetarians. The trouble is that most people do not really like fish all that much, and tend to think in terms of canned tuna rather than delicious freshly caught fish. That's why most of us could use fish oil supplements. By the way, if you take fish oil, be sure you are also taking vitamin E. EPA and vitamin E synergize to produce benefits such as greater insulin sensitivity and increased cell-membrane fluidity. Lower insulin resistanceand maintenance of a low triglyceride/HDL ratio One profound benefit of a carbohydrate-restricted diet, especially when combined with EPA supplements, is an improved triglyceride/HDL ratio, a marker for insulin resistance. A low (1 or less) ratio of triglycerides to HDL cholesterol, Sears states, may be the most important factor in predicting the kind of freedom from heart disease that centenarians seem to enjoy. A high fasting triglyceride/HDL ratio indicates that the LDL particles are small and thus very prone to oxidation (only oxidized cholesterol is harmful). A high ratio also suggests a high degree of insulin resistance; it increases the risk of a heart attack 16 times (compared with only four times for smoking). Warning readers against the low-fat, high-carbohydrate diets, Sears quotes from a recent article by the American Heart Association Nutrition Committee: Very low fat diets in the short term increase triglyceride levels and decrease HDL cholesterol levels without yielding additional decreases in LDL cholesterol levels. The first step toward achieving lower triglyceride levels is a carbohydrate-restricted diet. After all, it's mostly excess carbohydrates that are turned into fat. It's bagels and pancakes and potato chips (even the low-fat variety) that people end up carrying as ""saddlebags"" around their waist. Fruit might also be a special culprit, since fructose is suspected of being easily turned into triglycerides. Taking EPA supplements is also an effective way to lower triglycerides. Higher EPA intake leads to increased mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation and improved glucose metabolism. Ideally, the ratio of triglycerides to HDLs should be less than 1; studies show that very low triglycerides and very high HDLs give one virtual immunity to heart disease. A ratio of 1.5 is still pretty good; a ratio of 2 and above should be reason to take action. Even moderately high triglycerides, in the so-called ""normal"" range, contribute to atherosclerosis. While EPA from fish oil is a crucial supplement, Sears failed to mention L-carnitine, lipoic acid, niacin, chromium and especially conjugated linoleic acid, or CLA. Likewise, polyphenols seem very promising. Green tea and bilberry extract have been shown to lower blood sugar and triglycerides. Dry red wine has also been found to lower blood glucose, fasting insulin, and triglycerides while raising HDLs, which may account for its effectiveness in preventing cardiovascular disease. (French women-who are known to consume dry red wine with meals-have the lowest cardiovascular mortality in the world, ahead even of Japanese women). The better statin drugs also raise HDLs and lower triglycerides, though these drugs should be the last resort. And it is important to note that various hormones have an impact on both triglycerides and HDLs; in the right dose, DHEA and testosterone both lower triglycerides, as well as blood sugar and insulin. Estrogens can also lower blood sugar and improve insulin sensitivity, but the effect is dose-dependent. Sears describes it as the bimodal effect: at low doses, estrogens decrease insulin resistance; at high doses, they increase it. The drop in estrogens at menopause is associated with increased serum glucose, insulin resistance, and higher insulin. For Sears, this explains why the rate of heart attacks skyrockets in women within the first ten years after menopause. We are now finding out that various phytoestrogens likewise affect blood sugar. Preliminary evidence also suggests that hormone replacement therapy reduces the risk of diabetes, although more studies as needed. Sears points out that thyroid hormones (T3 and T4) also improve the serum lipid profile. It is shocking how few people (including physicians) know that thyroid hormones play an enormous role in preventing heart disease and preserving cardiovascular health. Hypothyroidism is associated with higher LDL cholesterol, lower HDL cholesterol, and higher triglycerides. Thus it is not surprising that a high degree of atherosclerosis is found in untreated hypothyroid patients. Sears also points out that excess insulin appears to cause a faster degradation of the more bioactive thyroid hormone, T3. While some critics condemn Sears for being overly fixated on carbohydrates, blood sugar, insulin and eicosanoids, a careful reading of his latest book should clearly show that he is far from being simplistic, and does recognize complex interactions between various hormones. In fact, the chapter on the thyroid is one of the best in the book. Sears is one of the few voices of sanity insisting that the elderly need thyroid supplementation if they show symptoms of hypothyroidism-being cold all the time, lethargy, mental slowness, confusion-even if blood tests still pronounce their thyroid levels ""within normal."" Sears is also to be commended for insisting that diet comes first: the public is still largely ignorant of the fact that high triglycerides are mainly due to excess consumption of refined carbohydrates (""glycemic gluttony,"" as Dr. Atkins calls it), combined with a sedentary lifestyle. But Sears' own enthusiasm for fish oil points to the fact that the right supplements can significantly enhance the benefits of diet, even if it is already carbohydrate-restricted. He does, however, make a very valid point about taking lots of supplements as one's sole anti-aging regimen: he warns that unless one follows the insulin and cortisol-reducing Zone diet, coupled with daily moderate exercise and meditation, supplements will be ""relatively worthless"" in the battle against aging. Moderate exercise lowers blood sugar and insulin Sears recommends daily moderate exercise as an essential part of his anti-aging program. For one thing, exercise lowers triglycerides and raises HDLs, and a low triglyceride/HDL ratio should be the grail of any life extensionist. But Sears stresses the ""moderate"" injunction. He states point-blank, ""The more intense the exercise, the fewer the benefits for longevity."" What about the philosophy that it's OK to eat lots of carbohydrates as long as you burn them off in hard daily exercise? Sears warns that this would be pro-aging. First, the consumption of a lot of calories results in the production of excess free radicals (90% of the free radicals in our bodies originate in the process of utilizing food). Second, intense exercise also increases the levels of free radicals. True, exercise also upregulates our own antioxidant defenses, but if the exercise becomes too strenuous and prolonged, these defenses are overwhelmed. Third, if the exercise is excessively prolonged, or if the diet lacks sufficient protein to stimulate the release of glucagon, cortisol will be needed to sustain blood glucose levels, and excess cortisol is a pro-aging disaster. The current infatuation with excessive exercise such as marathon running is ironic in the light of historical knowledge. It has been known for millennia that a life of hard physical labor tends to be a short one. True, today's elite athletes tend to eat an excellent diet and take plenty of antioxidants; it's the beginning amateur athletes that Sears worries about, the kind who may think that more exercise is necessarily better, and not be aware of the need for extra antioxidants. What about the high-carbohydrate sports drinks and bars? Absolutely not, Sears warns. They undo all the insulin-lowering benefits of exercise. And while he certainly recommends moderate exercise, Sears does not think that it is quite as important as the right diet. The Zone diet remains the primary anti-aging tool. According to Sears, ""80% of your ability to lower insulin levels will come from the Zone diet. Only 20% will come from exercise."" Still, combine the two, and you are farther ahead. The basic exercise program that Sears recommends consists of a brisk 30-minute daily walk, and five to ten minutes of strength exercises such as push-ups. Once you are more fit, you can consider increasing the intensity of the workout. Sears warns, however, that one should do no more than 45 minutes of weight lifting every other day. The reason for the 45 minute limit is that beyond that point, the rise in cortisol overwhelms the beneficial effects. Ideally, Sears says, our fasting insulin should be under 10, and our glycosylated hemoglobin (a marker of glycation) under 5%. These excellent youthful values indicate that a person is biologically aging more slowly than average. They can be achieved and maintained only through a combination of proper diet and exercise, with some assistance from the right metabolism-enhancing supplements such as fish oil. Lowering cortisol Even if we achieve an optimal diet, we still have another enemy that can greatly accelerate aging: stress. Life has become overwhelmingly complicated, family and social networks have weakened, commuting to and from work is nightmarish in large cities; no wonder we see more and more stress-related diseases. Working mothers have been found to have chronically elevated cortisol levels (cortisol is our main ""stress hormone""). But practically everyone's cortisol levels go up with age. Cortisol accelerates gluconeogenesis-the production of glucose from the breakdown of tissue protein (proteolysis). That protein is mostly derived from the breakdown of muscle tissue. Thus, chronically elevated cortisol leads to accelerated muscle atrophy. Furthermore, cortisol is a major culprit in bone loss. It is our primary catabolic hormone: it tears down tissue in order to raise serum glucose. Cortisol also stops all eicosanoid production. This works for reducing inflammation, but unfortunately also shuts down the flow of chemicals that aid in the building of muscle and cartilage, for instance. Cortisol is also immuno-suppressive and toxic to the thymus. In addition, chronic high levels of cortisol damages neurons, leading to memory loss and poor brain function in general. The aging effects on the skin are obvious to anyone who has ever gone through a period of prolonged stress (in fact, the new theory of female adult acne places the blame on cortisol). In sharp contrast to antioxidant hormones such as DHEA, cortisol exhibits pro-oxidant properties. And more production of cortisol means less production of beneficial steroids such as DHEA, progesterone and testosterone, since the main precursor hormone, pregnenolone, is diverted into the production of glucocorticoids. Elevated cortisol also means lower production of the thyroid hormones, so important for the regulation of metabolism. Cortisol is basically an ""emergency hormone."" It is meant to help us survive a fight-or-flight emergency, and then be quickly cleared out of the body. How can we keep cortisol levels reasonably low? Obviously it's impossible to eliminate all stress, nor would it be necessarily desirable. Still, we can try to use the various stress-reduction techniques available. Sears is particularly enthusiastic about meditation as a cortisol-lowering, anti-aging tool. Sears believes that daily meditation is as important as daily exercise. In addition, keeping your blood glucose levels as steady as possible should also keep cortisol within bounds. That's why it's important to eat frequent small meals (Sears recommends three main meals and two snacks; even the snacks should be fully balanced, containing protein and healthy fat as well as carbohydrates). If the interval between meals gets too long, cortisol is likely to be called into action in an attempt to elevate blood sugar. Lesson: keep your blood sugar steady by eating small, frequent meals and avoiding high-glycemic carbohydrates. Finally, our body has a built-in defense against excess cortisol, and that is another adrenal hormone, DHEA. DHEA competitively binds to glucocorticoid receptors, helping to prevent harm that would be caused by high cortisol levels, such as muscle and bone wasting. ""Most of the touted benefits of DHEA can be explained in terms of its role as an inhibitor of the biological actions of corticosteroids, especially cortisol,"" Sears believes. Researchers such as Dr. William Regelson, an ardent proponent of DHEA supplementation, would probably agree. It is often said that DHEA is the most abundant steroid in the body, produced in the range of 25 to 30 mg per day. But as Sears points out, cortisol is the second most abundant steroid, produced in the range of 10 to 20 mg under ""normal conditiocyclic AMP, the ""second messenger"" needed for good hormonal communication and produced by the good eicosanoids. Another interesting inclusion is ginger, a good anti-inflammatory agent, capable, like cortisol, of inhibiting the synthesis of both prostaglandins and leukotrienes, but without producing the pro-aging side effects of cortisol. Since every expert has different supplement recommendations, it is good to bear in mind that we need to read many books and make our own choices rather than blindly follow this or that person's advice. Sears is right about the importance of fish oil; other authors point to the importance of lipoic acid and the rest of the network antioxidants. It is up to the reader to integrate this complex information. Objectively speaking. . . How valid is Sears' approach? The main problem so far is the scarcity of research confirming some of the assumptions on which Sears bases his system. What he says about the destructive role of insulin and its crucial role in producing obesity is extremely plausible, but not definitely proven, according to many dissenting experts. They accuse him of demonizing insulin and of trashing cereals and other starches, traditionally regarded as a staple. Sears could reply that probably the most important way in which calorie restriction retards aging is by reducing insulin. Less insulin means less inflammation, less heart disease and cancer, and more production of health-promoting eicosanoids. As for starches, the consensus is that it's people who eat the most vegetables who are healthiest, not people who eat the most bread, corn flakes and pasta. Another objection that one frequently hears is that the sanctified 4:3:3 macronutrient ratio surely can't be optimal for everyone. In this book, however, Sears readily admits that we should speak in terms of a range rather than an absolute ratio. People differ in their ability to handle carbohydrates. For some, 1:1:1 might work better. Others may tolerate as much as 60% carbohydrate diet without suffering pro-aging consequences. Furthermore, one could plausibly argue that the evening meal should contain more carbohydrates in order to promote relaxation rather than protein-induced rise in dopamine, generally desirable in daytime. If Sears' recommendations are used flexibly rather than rigidly, the system becomes highly workable. Don't worry too much about hitting the precise ratio of macronutrients; just see how your body feels if you skip the pasta and have more salad instead. Also watch what happens to your energy and your aches and pains when you start taking fish oil and eating more seafood. And practically no one doubts the benefits of moderate exercise and meditation. Once it is understood that the system advocated by Sears is not an unbalanced high-protein diet, but a fairly conservative set of health guidelines, consisting of the vegetable-rich Zone diet plus fish oil plus exercise plus meditation, one is even tempted to say, ""What else is new?"" Now if we could only have some controlled research to see if the combination of Zone diet, moderate exercise, meditation, and fish oil and other supplements is effective for slowing down aging, as indicated by various biomarkers. Intuitively speaking, it should work. Eating more vegetables rather than bread and pasta, consuming adequate as opposed to high amounts of protein and healthy fats, and emphasizing seafood and/or taking fish oil supplements should have multiple health and anti-aging benefits. Until more research is done, however, we will not know for sure about the specifics of Sears' recommendations. There is also some debate about which relationships are causal, and which only correlational. Much remains to be elucidated about the extremely complex interactions between the endocrine, immune, and other physiological systems, especially in relation to aging. In the meantime, however, this challenging book is a treasure house of anti-aging information, especially in relation to diet and hormones. It is Sears' best book.

Now, a new high-viscosity fiber blend called PGX® helps reduce after-meal insulin surges, lowers LDL and total cholesterol levels, and may help people lose weight. Scientifically reviewed by: Dr. Gary Gonzalez, MD, on January 2021. The public has awoken to the fact that high-glycemic carbohydrates promote weight gain by causing insulin to surge. In response to a wave of media publicity, “low-carb” diets have become enormously popular. Weight-loss books warning of insulin’s fat-inducing effects have sold millions of copies. Anecdotal reports of people shedding huge amounts of body fat have caused dieters to avoid high-glycemic foods. Published scientific findings reveal that weight loss occurs in response to low-carb diets, but the average reduction in body fat has not been overly dramatic. Nevertheless, there are benefits to shedding (rather than gaining) fat pounds each year, along with enormous disease-preventing effects if excess insulin secretion is reduced. This article examines the dangers of excess insulin, the role of insulin in promoting obesity, and a new dietary supplement that has been shown to reduce after-meal insulin release by 40%. Why the Confusion Over Insulin? Those afflicted with type I diabetes do not produce enough insulin. For these individuals, supplemental insulin is a lifesaving therapy. The public often associates insulin with healthy hormones, but insulin has an insidious dark side. As normal aging and poor diet deprive cells of insulin sensitivity, many people produce excess insulin to force serum glucose into cells. This excessive insulin production is a contributing cause to a host of degenerative disorders, including heart disease and cancer. The most immediate and noticeable effect of excess insulin production is unwanted weight gain. Insulin drives fat into cells, prevents fat from being released from cells, and makes people chronically hungry. High insulin levels contribute not only to obesity, but also to the disease states associated with being overweight. While insulin saves the lives of type I diabetics who are dependent on it, it becomes a “death hormone” to aging people who secrete too much insulin. Reducing excess serum insulin is thus a critical component of any weight-reduction and longevity program. What Is Hyperinsulinemia? Insulin is produced by the beta cells in the pancreas. Insulin stimulates uptake of glucose (sugar) from the blood into the body’s cells. The resistance of the body’s cells to the action of insulin is called insulin resistance. As a result of insulin resistance and other factors, the pancreas produces more insulin than normal. This is called hyperinsulinemia. In a normal person, one unit of insulin might be needed to help 10 mg of glucose go into a cell group. In hyperinsulinemia, ten units of insulin might be needed to get the same 10 mg of glucose into the cell group.1 Hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance create myriad problems, including elevated triglycerides, low HDL, type II diabetes, and obesity. Figure 1 below shows the pathways to obesity and several degenerative diseases associated with insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia. Insulin and Age-Related Disease Numerous published studies reveal that excess serum insulin (hyperinsulinemia) is a major health problem. High serum insulin promotes hypertension by impairing sodium balance.2,3 Too much insulin harms the kidneys.4 The vascular system is severely damaged by prolonged exposure to excess insulin.5,6 By acting as a catalyst in promoting cell growth, excess insulin increases the risk and progression of certain cancers.7-11 High insulin promotes the formation of beta-amyloid in brain cells and may contribute to the development of Alzheimer’s disease.12 Overproduction of insulin is even a contributory factor to prostate enlargement because of its effects in promoting the overgrowth of prostate cells.13 High serum insulin is associated with the development of abdominal obesity and the many health problems induced by abdominal obesity, including atherosclerosis and impotence.14-20 Obesity is associated with excess insulin and reduced insulin sensitivity, both risk factors for type II diabetes. Perhaps the simplest way to evaluate the toxic effects of excess insulin is by examining its effects on human mortality. One study showed that over a 10-year period, the risk of dying was almost twice as great for those with the highest levels of insulin compared to those with the lowest.21 The study authors stated that hyperinsulinemia is associated with increased all-cause and cardiovascular mortality independent of other risk factors. INSULIN BLOCKAGE EXTENDS MAXIMUM LIFE SPAN The magnitude of insulin’s impact on body fat accumulation was demonstrated in a study published last year in the journal Science. Researchers altered the insulin receptor gene in the fat cells of mice so that the cells would not respond to insulin. Because insulin is needed to help cells store fat, these mice had less body fat and were protected against obesity. The altered mice ate 55% more food per gram of body weight than normal mice, yet had 70% less body fat at three months of age. Moreover, the genetically altered mice had increased median and maximum life spans. After three years, all of the normal mice had died, but one-quarter of the mice whose fat cells were genetically altered to not respond to insulin were still alive. The mice in this study were able to eat whatever they wanted and still stay slim because their fat tissue was programmed to not respond to insulin. The scientists concluded: “A reduction of fat mass without caloric restriction can be associated with increased longevity in mice, possibly through effects on insulin signaling.”28 While it is not yet possible to alter human fat cells so that they do not respond to insulin, humans can take relatively simple steps to reduce the surge of insulin into the blood that occurs after eating. Why Aging People Gain Weight The number of overweight people is staggering. A review of the published literature indicates that a significant percentage of degenerative diseases is attributed to excess body fat. Those who are overweight face a significant risk of developing type II diabetes.22-24 The treatments for obesity and type II diabetes are interrelated. By effectively treating either one of these diseases, doctors can mitigate or control the other. Poor diet, obesity, and aging result in excessive secretion of insulin, a factor in the development of type II diabetes. Suppressing the overproduction of insulin is a crucial component of a medically supervised weight-loss program. A noticeable effect of surplus serum insulin is constant hunger, which results in a vicious cycle in which overeating causes more and more body fat to accumulate, which in turn causes even greater amounts of unwanted insulin to be secreted from the pancreas.25 We now know that hyperinsulinemia predicts diabetes mellitus.26 Even in children, serum insulin levels are far higher in obese than in non-obese children of the same age. The effects of consuming high-glycemic foods and the subsequent hyperinsulinemia, hunger, and weight gain that occur are the subject of an article published in the Journal of the American Medical Association titled “The Glycemic Index.”27 The article’s authors summarized their position as follows: “It is possible that the hunger incident to hyperinsulinemia may be a cause of overeating, and therefore, the obesity that so often precedes diabetes.” Dangerous After-Meal Sugar Levels The excess elevation of blood sugar after eating wreaks havoc in the body via multiple pathological mechanisms. Elevations in postprandial (after-meal) blood sugar, along with the accompanying insulin surge, are major contributors to the development of diabetic and age-related disorders such as heart disease, as well as diseases of the microvasculature (small blood vessels within the eyes, kidneys, and nerves). People who have normal fasting glucose levels but whose average postprandial glucose level exceeds 200 mg/dL are three times more likely to suffer diabetic retinopathy than those who do not.29 Growing evidence indicates that severe spikes in postprandial blood sugar are a major problem for non-diabetics as well. The two primary mechanisms by which post-meal hyperglycemia causes such problems are formation of advanced glycation end products (the binding of glucose to body proteins) and increased production of free radicals that lead to severe arterial wall damage.30,31 To investigate the relationship between glucose metabolism and the severity of heart disease, one study measured how many coronary arteries were blocked in relation to postprandial glucose-insulin blood levels and other atherogenic risk factors. All of the men participating in the study had normal fasting glucose blood readings, but in response to a glucose challenge, demonstrated significantly different rates of glucose-insulin spikes. Men with the highest levels of post-load glucose, insulin, and other measurements of glycemic imbalance had the greatest number of blocked coronary arteries.32 These studies make it abundantly clear that blunting the after-meal increase in blood sugar is an important goal for those seeking optimal longevity. FOODS TO AVOID Eating foods and beverages that are high in sugar causes the release of excess insulin. Chronic insulin overload results in weight gain and the development of age-related diseases. Most people do not realize that many common foods (in addition to pure sugar) induce a dangerous insulin spike. When evaluating the glucose-insulin-elevating effects of foods, the two established measurements are the “glycemic index” and “glycemic load.” Consumption of foods that are high in both of these measurements should be avoided or reduced. Here are some examples of how different types of foods compare: High Glycemic Index + High Glycemic Load   Glycemic Index Glycemic Load* Instant rice 91 24.8 Baked potato 85 20.3 Corn flakes 84 21.0 White bread 70 21.0 Rye bread 65 19.5 Banana 53 13.3 Spaghetti 41 16.4 Lower Glycemic Index + Lower Glycemic Load   Glycemic Index Glycemic Load* Carrot 71 3.8 Apple 36 8.1 Lentils 29 5.7 Milk 27 3.2 Peanuts 14 0.7 Broccoli negligible negligible * Glycemic load calculated on differing quantities of each food group. The chart of high-glycemic foods offers guidance for dining out: avoid eating bread, ask for a double portion of vegetables in lieu of potato or rice, and refuse any kind of dessert offered. While these dietary changes can be difficult to implement, reducing the carbohydrate-craving effects of excess insulin can make this diet modification tolerable over the long term. The use of a new dietary supplement that reduces the amount of glucose and insulin in the blood after ingesting high-glycemic foods can help curb cravings for foods that are high in carbohydrates. Correlating Food Type and Obesity According to the US Surgeon General, 60% of adult Americans are clinically overweight, having a body mass index of 25 or greater. Obesity has become so common that those who are not grotesquely overweight appear to look normal. These “normal” heavy people, however, suffer significantly greater incidences of disability and premature death. Mounting evidence points to hyperinsulinemia as being a culprit in today’s obesity epidemic. One way to help reduce excessive insulin is by eating a low-glycemic diet. This means eliminating foods that induce the pancreas to over-secrete insulin. While people seeking to lose body fat know they should avoid sucrose and fructose, too often the craving for sugar (induced by hyperinsulinemia) results in binging on carbohydrate-rich food. The food industry misleads the public into thinking that high-glycemic foods are healthy. Fruit juices, for instance, are promoted as a concentrated source of nutrients contained in fruit. The downside to juice, however, is that it is a concentrated form of quick-release fructose that can spike serum insulin. Eating whole fruit produces a gradual release of sugar into the blood. Once most fruits are juiced, however, they become catalysts for insulin overload because of their concentration of rapidly absorbable sugar. Carrots rank high on the glycemic index, but because their glycemic load is very low, there is nothing wrong with eating carrots. Once carrots are juiced, however, the sugar is concentrated into a form that instantly hits the bloodstream and provokes an insulin spike. The moral to this story is to eat lots of fruits and vegetables, but avoid the juice. A look at the calorie content of a glass of fruit or vegetable juice confirms its fat-potentiating effects. For those concerned about obtaining adequate folic acid, vitamin C, alpha carotene, and similar nutrients, these can be obtained by eating whole fruits and vegetables and by taking supplements. As shown in the sidebar on the previous page, foods that were once considered part of a healthy “low-fat diet” have a high glycemic index and high glycemic load. Ingesting these kinds of foods helps you gain weight, even though you think you are eating right. The message for those seeking to lose some pounds is to reduce or avoid consumption of foods with a higher glycemic index/load. While this is not the entire solution to the obesity crisis, it is an important component. The problem is that it is difficult to suppress carbohydrate craving. Even when people know they should avoid sucrose-fructose foods, they too often succumb to an insulin-induced addiction and gorge themselves with ice cream, chocolate, and other sugar-laden desserts. When it comes to the problem of high-glycemic diets, two obstacles must be overcome: cutting the craving for sugar, and changing eating patterns to avoid high-glycemic foods. A partial solution is to impede the rapid absorption of sugars into the bloodstream in order to reduce the accompanying insulin spike. This reduction in postprandial insulin secretion can help induce satiety and somewhat inhibit calorie intake. After six years of intensive research, a supplement is now available that interferes with the rapid absorption of sugar, thus reducing after-meal blood glucose and insulin levels by 23% and 40%, respectively. FOOD FRAUD While “low fat” or “fat free”appear on more and more food labels, a record number of Americans are overweight. The problem is that “low fat” often means “high sugar.” If you examine the labels of fat-free salad dressings, for example, you can see that they are loaded with sucrose or fructose. Sugar is cheap and is a palatable alternative to oils that add fat calories. If you look at pasta sauce labels, for instance, you will find that most of them are loaded with “high-fructose corn syrup” or just plain old sucrose. Eating these sugar-fortified sauces with high-glycemic pastas and bread can create an enormous insulin spike. Fruit and vegetable juices feature healthy looking photos on their labels, but when you look at the calorie content of these sugar concentrates, you should seek to consume the actual fruit or vegetable in lieu of the juice. Even products that purport to have health benefits like tea beverages are usually loaded with sugar. Food companies have duped Americans into believing that anything that is low in fat is beneficial. Consumers should carefully read food labels to make sure they are not inadvertently loading up on insulin-spiking sugar calories. The Search for a Better Fiber Scientific studies consistently document the ability of water-soluble fibers to inhibit carbohydrate absorption, reduce cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein (LDL), and induce some weight loss.33,34 When taken before meals, these fiber sources bind to water in the stomach and small intestine to form a gelatinous, viscous mass that slows the absorption of sugars and inhibits the re-absorption of intestinal cholesterol excreted from the liver. The net effect is a reduction in the number of absorbed calories and an induction of a feeling of satiety. The problem until now is that the large quantity of fiber required to produce a meaningful effect has resulted in poor compliance, primarily because of upper and lower gastrointestinal-related discomfort. In the early 1990s, scientists at the University of Toronto began to investigate a novel class of viscous fibers in order to identify a low-dose blend that would reduce blood glucose, insulin, cholesterol, and LDL levels. Initial studies confirmed the beneficial effects of these soluble fibers. Compared to placebo, those consuming highly viscous fibers before meals showed improvement in glycemic control, blood lipid levels, and blood pressure.35,36 The problem, however, remained—these beneficial effects could be produced only by ingesting large amounts of this fiber. To overcome this problem, the scientists tested hundreds of different fiber blends with the objective of achieving significant benefits from only a few grams of soluble fiber per meal. One of the initial findings that motivated the University of Toronto scientists to pursue this research occurred during a study that measured the glycemic-index response to different forms of fiber (or no fiber). In this study, three grams of various fibers were administered prior to a 20-gram glucose challenge. As expected, the glycemic index of the control group receiving no fiber was 100. Those receiving three grams of psyllium and xanthan showed only negligible glycemic index reductions (3% and 6%, respectively). By contrast, test subjects receiving three grams of a novel fiber blend showed a remarkable 39% reduction in their glycemic index. This finding demonstrated that consuming just three grams of this highly viscous fiber before a meal could significantly reduce the number of insulin-spiking carbohydrate calories absorbed.37 Using the Most Viscous Fibers Glucomannan possesses the greatest viscosity (gelling property) of all known soluble fibers.37,38 Four to five grams of glucomannan blended into fluid or mixed with food can slow carbohydrate absorption into the bloodstream and dampen the ensuing insulin spike by up to 50%.39 Controlled clinical studies document that glucomannan can promote satiety and induce modest weight loss.40-43 It has been shown to significantly lower LDL and total cholesterol, improve diabetic control, and correct constipation.29-31,33-38,40-43 The reason glucomannan has fallen by the wayside is that in the 1980s, programs promoting quick weight loss advertised glucomannan as a supplement that could make obese people thin. The FTC stepped in and aggressively attacked those who were making exaggerated fat-loss claims for glucomannan. The subsequent negative reports by the news media caused glucomannan to be viewed by the public as a worthless dietary supplement. THE GLYCEMIC INDEX The glycemic index is a way of calculating the rate by which blood glucose levels rise in response to different food types, with pure glucose producing a reading of 100. The glycemic index measures how fast a particular food triggers a spike in blood glucose. Higher-glycemic foods prompt an elevated insulin release because the pancreas is stimulated to metabolize the sudden surge of glucose into the blood. The published scientific studies on glucomannan, however, are quite impressive. Although it does not make fat people thin, a double-blind trial showed that compared to placebo, obese subjects taking one gram of glucomannan before each meal lost 5.5 pounds after only eight weeks.40 The subjects were instructed not to change their eating or exercise patterns. Total cholesterol and LDL also were reduced (by 21.7 and 15.0 mg/dL, respectively) in the glucomannan-supplemented group. No adverse reactions to glucomannan were reported. Several other published studies confirm that glucomannan modestly reduces weight compared to placebo or diet alone.41-43 Total cholesterol and LDL, along with after-meal insulin and glucose blood levels, are significantly reduced when glucomannan is taken before meals.41-43 With this knowledge of glucomannan as a foundation, University of Toronto scientists led by Vladimir Vuksan, PhD, combined glucomannan with two other viscous fibers (xanthan and alginate) in an exact ratio to increase the viscosity of the original glucomannan material by 2.5-5 times.44 A mulberry concentrate (20:1) was added to enhance the glycemic-control and lipid-lowering effects.48 The primary benefit of this proprietary fiber blend lies in its superior viscosity. This means that it is better able to expand in the gastrointestinal tract to inhibit sugar absorption and bind cholesterol. This enables much smaller quantities to be taken than of other viscous dietary fibers to achieve comparable health benefits. The fiber blend’s trade name is PGX™, which stands for “polyglycoplex.” Studies Confirm Effectiveness At last June’s 64th Annual Meeting of the American Diabetes Association, held in Orlando, FL, the results of two studies using the PGX™ fiber blend were presented by researchers from the Risk Factor Modification Centre at St. Michael’s Hospital and the University of Toronto.53 The first study reported on test subjects who took three grams of the fiber blend, followed by a huge 50-gram acute glucose challenge. Compared to the control group, those taking the fiber blend had a 65% reduction in postprandial glucose elevation. The second study was performed over a three-week period to better reflect real-life experiences. Study subjects took three grams of the fiber blend three times a day before meals. After three weeks, there was a 23% reduction in postprandial glucose, a 40% reduction in after-meal insulin release, and a 55.9% improvement in whole-body insulin sensitivity scores. In addition, this proprietary fiber blend reduced body fat by 2.8% from baseline by the end of the three-week study period. As a result of these findings, a large, longer-term clinical study has been initiated to further evaluate this unique fiber blend’s effects on weight loss. MULBERRY NATURALLY AIDS BLOOD SUGAR CONTROL By Dale Kiefer Type II diabetes is reaching epidemic proportions in the developed world as obesity rates continue to climb. While the American Diabetes Association estimates that diabetes affects about 17 million Americans, some medical professionals believe this figure vastly underestimates the true scope of the pandemic. An additional 16-20 million people probably suffer from a precursor condition known as pre-diabetes.45 Patients with glucose-handling difficulties are at increased risk of developing life-threatening conditions ranging from heart disease and stroke to blindness, nerve damage, depression, and kidney disease. These dire secondary complications are the result of excess glucose in the bloodstream (hyperglycemia). Too much “sugar” (glucose) damages blood vessels and the tissues they support. Blood sugar rises when cells become “resistant” to the normal effects of insulin, which ordinarily shepherds glucose molecules across the cell membrane into the cell’s interior, where it is burned for energy. As body fat rises, production of a hormone called resistin increases, rendering cells deaf, so to speak, to insulin’s knock at the door.46,47 Evidently, mulberry leaves contain substances that reverse this defect. In a study conducted in India, patients with type II diabetes were randomly assigned to one of two groups.48 One group took glibenclamide, a drug that stimulates pancreatic insulin secretion and is prescribed to certain type II diabetics. Patients in the second group received three grams of mulberry leaf powder taken with each of three daily meals. Treatment continued for 30 days. Before treatment began, researchers measured a variety of parameters that collectively provide a detailed picture of a patient’s lipid status and glucose-handling abilities. These parameters were measured again at the end of the 30-day trial. Patients taking mulberry leaf had significantly lower fasting glucose, while the decrease in the glibenclamide group was statistically insignificant. While glibenclamide subjects enjoyed some minimal improvements in their blood lipid profile, the changes were not statistically significant, except for triglycerides, which fell by 10%. Mulberry patients, on the other hand, experienced striking improvements across all lipid parameters, including a remarkable 18% increase in highly desirable HDL. The biggest change was a dramatic drop in harmful LDL. While glibenclamide patients saw no significant change in their levels of this artery-clogging lipid, mulberry patients saw their LDL decline by 23%. The research team also measured changes in lipid peroxidation in plasma, urine, and red blood cell membranes. Lipid peroxidation occurs when lipids are oxidized in the body, rendering them yet more harmful. One of the goals of antioxidant therapy is to prevent this harmful process (common among diabetics) from occurring. Plasma and urinary lipid peroxidation dropped significantly in both groups, but the effect was stronger among mulberry patients. Only mulberry significantly improved lipid peroxidation and decreased cholesterol in red blood cell membranes. As the researchers noted: “Mulberry therapy is highly effective against lipid peroxidation when compared with glibenclamide treatment.”48 This finding has also been seen in diabetic rats.49 These results indicate that mulberry not only reduces harmful lipids and apparently improves sensitivity to glucose, but also possesses beneficial antioxidant properties. This antioxidant activity probably reflects mulberry’s own defense and repair mechanism at work. Japanese researchers showed in 2001 that stressed mulberry leaves produce chemicals that mop up free radicals in leaf tissue.50 Free radicals, which are responsible for harmful lipid peroxidation in humans, are also damaging to plant tissue. Previous (and subsequent) research has shown that rodents with experimentally induced diabetes also experience dramatic improvements when fed mulberry leaf.49, 51,52 Using Fiber to Aid Weight Loss Critics have attacked the use of fiber supplements because they are not a cure for obesity. While this is true, clinical findings reveal that ordinary fiber supplements can reduce the number of calories consumed by 30 to 180 calories per day.54 While modest, this reduction in calorie absorption would, over the course of a year, result in a weight loss of 3-18 pounds.55 MEDICAL ESTABLISHMENT RECOGNIZES NEED TO SUPPRESS INSULIN In June 2004, the journal Current Medicinal Chemistry published an article titled, “Inhibition of insulin secretion as a new drug target in the treatment of metabolic disorders.” The scientists who authored the article stated that the relationship between hyperinsulinemia and certain metabolic diseases such as obesity has been known for decades, but that only a few inhibitors of insulin release have been identified. These insulin inhibitors (diazoxide and octreotide) are drugs that can produce side effects. They are not to be taken on a daily basis. The scientists wrote: “Clinical studies have furthermore indicated that inhibitors of insulin release will be of benefit in treatment or prevention of diabetes and obesity.”57 This paper indicates that pharmaceutical companies will be pursuing drugs to suppress overproduction of insulin. The good news is that a low-cost dietary supplement is already available that has demonstrated potent postprandial insulin-reducing effects. The new PGX™ high-viscosity fiber blend may provide better results than ordinary fibers used in previous studies. Clinical studies have repeatedly shown that after-meal blood sugar levels decrease as soluble fiber viscosity increases.34,56 This relationship has also been shown with improved weight control and diminished appetite.40-43 We are anxiously awaiting the results of the ongoing weight-loss study of PGX™. In the meantime, however, the dramatic effects shown by the PGX™ fiber blend in reducing insulin, glucose, LDL, and total cholesterol make it a common-sense supplement to take before meals. Any reduction of calorie absorption should benefit overall health. Taking steps to reduce excess insulin secretion may help protect against a wide range of degenerative processes. Fiber: Limits to Weight Loss With all the books that have been written about the obesity-inducing effects of excess insulin, one would think that weight loss would automatically occur in response to a lowered intake of high-glycemic foods combined with a high intake of soluble fibers. The problem is that age-associated weight gain is a multifactorial process that can be only partially addressed with existing approaches. The scientific protocol on obesity in Life Extension’s Disease Prevention and Treatment book describes why it is difficult for people to lose significant amounts of body fat. There is help on the way, but the total solution in a pill is not yet here. In the meantime, Life Extension recommends that people seeking to lose weight consume the following supplements: Chromium polynicotinate 600-1000 mcg daily Conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) 3000-4000 mg daily PGX™ highly viscous fiber blend 1000-3000 mg 5-10 minutes before each meal with 8-16 ounces of water. Consider asking your doctor to prescribe 500 mg two to three times daily of the insulin-normalizing drug metformin.58-67 Men (without prostate cancer) should restore testosterone to youthful levels to help reduce dangerous abdominal obesity.68-108 Thyroid hormone deficiencies should be corrected.109,110 Make some effort to reduce consumption of high-glycemic foods, and to exercise, if possible.111-114 METFORMIN FOR WEIGHT LOSS Metformin is used to treat diabetes, but published research shows that it also helps non-diabetics to lose weight.115 Metformin reduces sugar (glycogen) release from the liver to prevent blood glucose levels from rising too high, so that the body does not need to produce as much insulin.116-118 Metformin lowers insulin levels,119 prevents many of the side effects of diabetes, and can be used by people who want to lose weight. A common cause of obesity in women is called polycystic ovary syndrome, which is caused by having high blood levels of insulin. Metformin helps women with polycystic ovary syndrome to lose weight.120-125 Metformin prevents blood sugar levels from rising too high, but eating foods that cause rapid elevations in glucose levels can negate its effects. Taking metformin after eating two bagels will not help you to lose weight. Consider taking 500 mg of metformin a few minutes before you eat. Do not take metformin if you have kidney disease, heart failure, or any medical condition that could make your blood acidic. Some drugs cannot be taken with metformin, so check with your doctor about all your medications. If you have nausea or diarrhea, take one-half of a pill (250 mg) with a meal once a day, and if you then have no symptoms, try to work up to one-half of a pill before each meal. Summary Type I (insulin-dependent) diabetes was at one time universally fatal. In 1922, a young boy received the first form of supplemental insulin and experienced a reduction of blood sugar. Insulin was soon viewed as a wonder drug because it saved the lives of those who were previously doomed to death shortly after diagnosis with insulin-dependent diabetes. In today’s gluttonous world, overproduction of insulin has become a major health problem. Even in people who eat a healthy diet, the aging process often causes insulin resistance that results in higher-than-desired insulin levels. An overwhelming number of scientific studies shows that hyperinsulinemia is an underlying culprit for many of today’s killer diseases and infirmities. While pharmaceutical companies are investigating insulin-suppressing drugs, the good news is that fiber supplements have been shown to enhance blood sugar control, decrease after-meal insulin levels, and reduce the number of calories absorbed by the body. The best fiber sources for reducing after-meal blood sugar-insulin levels, lowering cholesterol levels, and promoting weight loss are those that are rich in water-soluble fibers such as glucomannan, psyllium, guar gum, and pectin. When taken with water before meals, these fiber sources bind to the water in the stomach and small intestine to form a gelatinous, viscous mass that not only slows down the absorption of glucose, but also induces a sense of satiety (fullness) and reduces the absorption of calories. With the introduction of a new highly viscous fiber blend trademarked under the name PGX™, it may now be possible to achieve the multiple documented benefits of fiber by swallowing only a few capsules before each meal. The longevity potential associated with reducing after-meal glucose and insulin blood levels, lowering total cholesterol and LDL, and losing some weight is enormous.

Scientifically reviewed by: Dr. Gary Gonzalez, MD, on January 2020. Written By JoAnn Knorr, MMS. Metformin (brand name ""Glucophage"") has been used in the treatment of type II diabetes for the past 40 years.1 This drug counteracts many of the underlying factors that result in the manifestation of this insidious disease. Metformin also produces helpful side benefits that can protect against the lethal complications of type II diabetes. Frequently prescribed anti-diabetic drugs fail to address the fundamental causes of type II diabetes and can induce serious side effects. Type II diabetes affects between 16 to 19 million Americans. About 75% of type II diabetics will die from a cardiovascular-related disease. Conventional doctors often prescribe drugs for the purpose of lowering blood sugar levels. These drugs do not adequately address the multiple underlying pathologies associated with the type II diabetic state. Type II diabetes is characterized by cellular insulin resistance. The result is excess accumulation of glucose in the bloodstream as cells become resistant to the effects of insulin. Type II diabetes is characterized by cellular insulin resistance. The result is excess accumulation of glucose in the bloodstream because cells become resistant to the effects of insulin and fail to take up glucose As the type II diabetic condition progresses, many people gain weight and develop more fat cells.2 Treating type II diabetes with insulin-enhancing therapy increases the risk of cardiovascular complications, induces weight gain, and fails to correct the underlying cause of the disease. Many type II diabetics produce too much insulin in a futile attempt to drive glucose into insulin-resistant cells. When doctors prescribe insulin-enhancing drugs to these type II diabetics, a temporary reduction of serum glucose may occur, but the long-term effects of this excess insulin can be devastating. An ideal anti-diabetic drug would enhance cellular insulin sensitivity, inhibit excess intestinal absorption of sugar, reduce excess liver production of glucose, promote weight loss and reduce cardiovascular risk factors. Metformin (Glucophage) is the one drug that does all of this and more. Metformin works by increasing the number of muscle and adipocyte (fat cell) insulin receptors and the attraction for the receptor. It does not increase insulin secretion, it only increases insulin sensitivity. Therefore, metformin is not associated with causing hypoglycemia. This activity reduces insulin levels by increasing the sensitivity of peripheral tissues to the effects of insulin by rejuvenating the response, and restoring glucose and insulin to younger physiological levels that may cause weight loss and most certainly a decrease in the body's total fat content.3-7 In a study published by the American Diabetes Association, metformin was found to decrease the fasting plasma glucose concentration by -60 to -70mg/dl in patients with non-insulin dependent type II diabetes.1 Metformin also reduced hemoglobin A1C levels, a blood measurement of glycosylation. One of the most devastating consequences of diabetes is protein degradation caused by the formation of advanced glycated end products. Reductions in serum hemoglobin A1C levels are a good indicator of consistent glucose control in the diabetic patient. Dr. Ward Dean is a specialist in anti-aging and life extension medicine, author of over a 100 articles on the biology of aging, and founder and Medical Director of the Center for Bio-Gerontology in Florida. He recommends taking 500 mg of metformin two or three times per day to all his patients over 40 who do not have kidney or liver problems, or a history of congestive heart failure.4,5 According to Dean, aging causes insulin resistance. Metformin increases hypothalamo-pituitary sensitivity that declines with age. As we get older, there is a loss of sensitivity of the hypothalamus and the peripheral tissues to the effects of insulin, which causes elevated blood insulin levels (hyperinsulinemia).4,5 A number of harmful and age-accelerating effects are associated with elevated blood insulin levels. These effects include: increased infections, microvascular complications like retinopathy (eye problems), nephropathy (kidney problems), neuropathies (nerve problems), hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, premature atherosclerosis and obesity, which eventually evolve into cardiovascular problems.1,3-5,8 Metformin and Type II Diabetes Life Extension® is a big advocate for the use of the drug metformin. Research shows that not only is it an effective drug for treating type-II diabetes, but it also has an extensive list of off-label benefits. Metformin treats type-II diabetes by addressing the underlying issue, which is insulin resistance. Conventional medical doctors have largely failed at properly treating type-II diabetics with drugs that target their insulin resistance. Instead, many doctors have treated patients by prescribing more insulin. By targeting insulin resistance and making insulin more sensitive (effective), metformin reduces risk of cancer, heart disease, polycystic ovarian syndrome and more. It may be the most underutilized drug due to its vast list of off-label benefits. Learn more about the research on metformin in this article. The cardiovascular system Patients with type II diabetes often present with a cluster of cardiovascular risk factors like visceral obesity, hypertension, high triglyceride and low high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels, and hypofibrinolysis, all of which form insulin resistance and potentially contribute to increased cardiovascular risk.8 In the United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study, metformin was the only medication that reduced diabetes related deaths, heart attacks and strokes.1,8 In the Fontbonne and Associates BIGPRO 1 trial, the individuals with visceral obesity treated with metformin showed greater weight loss, a greater decrease in fasting insulin levels and a smaller increase in low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol concentrations than those who received placebo. A decrease in plasminogen activator inhibitor was most associated with the body weight loss in subjects.8,9 In the trial, the effects of metformin were most notable on the level of endothelial (artery lining) damage that showed a decrease. The microvascular complications of retinopathy, nephropathy and neuropathy improve due to metformin's ability to decrease damage to arterial lining.2 These small blood vessels are somewhat unblocked to provide healthier blood supply to vital tissues surrounding the eyes, kidneys and nerves.2 The potentially preventive effects of metformin on type II diabetes and evolving cardiovascular complications include a decrease in total cholesterol and low density cholesterol (LDL), free fatty acids, tissue plasminogen activator antigen and insulin levels when patients present with symptoms of hypertension, dyslipidemia, visceral obesity or hyperglycemia.8 In non-diabetic patients with hypertension, 3 placebo controlled trials were done. These trials showed that metformin significantly reduced fasting insulin or C-peptide levels, as well as total cholesterol, low density lipids cholesterol or apolipoprotein B levels, fasting free fatty acids and tissue plasminogen activator antigen levels. Metformin had a significant effect on lowering blood pressure and fasting triglyceride levels in one of these trials.8 Polycystic ovarian syndrome Metformin has been found to suppress the growth of some tumors and enhance the activity of anti-cancer drugs. Polycystic ovarian syndrome is characterized by irregular or absent menstrual periods, and elevated serum testosterone and androstenedione. These patients complain of abnormal bleeding, infertility, obesity, excess hair growth, hair loss and acne. Polycystic ovarian syndrome seems to have a genetic component in which those who are affected often have both male and female relatives with type II diabetes, obesity, elevated blood triglycerides or high blood pressure. They may also have female relatives with infertility, hirsutism or menstrual problems. For women in the reproductive age range, polycystic ovarian syndrome is a serious common cause of infertility because of the endocrine abnormalities that accompany elevated insulin levels. As women with polycystic ovarian syndrome maybe at greater risk for other medical conditions, testing is essential. They should be tested for blood lipids, diabetes and blood clotting factors that promote abnormal clotting. Metformin, at doses of 500 mg to 850 mg three times per day, has been shown to reverse these endocrine abnormalities. In women with polycystic ovarian syndrome, metformin reduced systolic blood pressure, hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance, and facilitated menstrual regulation and pregnancy.10,11 Cancer & cellular immunity Metformin has been found to suppress the growth of some tumors and enhance the activity of anti-cancer drugs. By giving the immune system a boost, metformin can improve cellular immunity. It has also been found to reduce the incidence of chemically induced cancer in rats.5,7 The way metformin improves cellular immunity is linked to its blood sugar lowering effect by improving receptor sensitivity and number. Bacteria, fungi and some viruses tend to feed on sugar. By diminishing their fuel supply, we diminish them. That is why diabetics and other individuals with endocrine abnormalities tend to be more prone to infections.2 Contraindications & side effects Metformin is not traditionally recommended for people who have a history of kidney or liver disease, or a history of congestive heart failure.* People with a history of alcohol abuse should also avoid taking the drug, as serious lactic acidosis can develop in these individuals. Long term use of metformin may cause malabsorption of vitamin B12.1,3-5,8 Because of the depletion of B12, supplementation is recommended.4-6 When a person begins to take metformin, they may experience some nausea and vomiting, stomach pain, bloating and diarrhea. The latter usually disappear once the person becomes accustomed to the drug.1,5 *Metformin use in close coordination and evaluation with a physician is still possible. Consult your healthcare provider to determine whether metformin use is recommended for you. Many helpful side benefits Metformin's multiple effects benefit individuals with a propensity to develop diabetes, cardiovascular problems, endocrine problems, retinopathies, nephropathies, cancer or decreased immunity, infections and weight gain.1-5,8 As with diabetes, metformin has been shown to cause a reduction in appetite, weight, and the body's total fat content. In associated heart disease conditions, there is plaque build-up that lines the arteries. This build-up of plaque can lead to atherosclerosis.8 Metformin reduces or lowers the chances of developing atherosclerosis and reduces the rate of pro-aging cross linkages of collagen, which plays a role in the scar tissue build-up that occurs during wound healing.4 Metformin has been shown to reduce the amount of supplemental insulin needed by type II diabetics who become insulin-dependent. They are able to take a lower insulin dose in conjunction with metformin without the risk of becoming hypoglycemic. For 40 years metformin has been used to control blood glucose levels in patients with type II diabetes. Physicians are recommending it to patients who are predisposed to diabetes for the prevention of developing the disease.8 Metformin prevents the acceleration of atherosclerosis and reduces the rate of pro-aging cross linking of collagen. With the cluster of cardiovascular problems associated with hyperinsulinemia, metformin has proven effective in lowering total cholesterol, low density lipids, free fatty acids, tissue plasminogen activator antigen and insulin levels when patients present with symptoms of hypertension dyslipidemia, visceral obesity or hyperglycemia. Metformin prevents the acceleration of atherosclerosis and reduces the rate of pro-aging cross linking of collagen. The microvascular complications of hyperinsulinemia are improved by metformin due to the arterial clearance in small blood vessels of the eyes, kidneys and nerves. There are other positive effects associated with metformin: decreased tumor growth and improved cellular immunity in individuals who are prone to chronic infections associated high blood sugar levels. In non diabetics, metformin reduced low density lipid, total cholesterol, free fatty acids, tissue plasminogen activator antigen, blood pressure and fasting triglyceride levels.1-5,8 Women suffering from polycystic ovary syndrome have been treated with metformin. Benefits include: lipid lowering effects, reduction in systolic blood pressure, hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance syndrome. Metformin has also been shown to aid in normal menstrual regulation and pregnancy.10,11 In conclusion, the scientific research points to metformin's multiple uses, with few drawbacks. Accordingly, the drug's numerous side benefits associated with the treatment and prevention of diabetes, as well as other disorders, appear to outweigh its limited side effects.

About 80% of diabetics die from heart attack or stroke. Two recent conferences explore the connection between diabetes and heart disease. By Ben Best, BS, Pharmacy. The lifetime risk of type II diabetes is now estimated to be about 40% for an American.1 Type II diabetes (formerly called adult-onset diabetes) accounts for 95% of diabetes cases, distinct from type I (previously called juvenile-onset diabetes), which accounts for 5% of cases.2 Type II diabetes is usually caused by abdominal obesity, physical inactivity, or excess sugar consumption.3-5 The fact that high blood sugar may be more damaging to blood vessels than high blood lipids might be indicated by the fact that diabetes greatly increases risk of cardiovascular disease. Middle-aged diabetic men have triple the rate of cardiovascular deaths as nondiabetic men in the same age-group.6 About 80% of diabetics die of heart attack or stroke, while a substantial number of the remainder die of kidney failure.7 Blood vessel damage in diabetes includes damage to vessels in the kidneys.8,9 In healthy persons, elevated blood glucose from a meal causes pancreas cells to secrete insulin. Insulin causes muscle cells to absorb glucose, fat cells to store fat, and liver cells to store rather than produce glucose. In a prediabetic condition (metabolic syndrome), the responsiveness to insulin by muscle, liver, fat, and other cells diminishes (insulin resistance), although not to the same degree in every tissue.10 Even though about 80% of obese persons have insulin resistance and symptoms of metabolic syndrome, nearly 40% of normal-weight people also have metabolic syndrome symptoms.11 Due to the close connection between diabetes and cardiovascular disease, both the World Congress on Insulin Resistance, Diabetes & Cardiovascular Disease held in Los Angeles and the Cardiovascular Disease Prevention Symposium held in Miami are very similar. The Miami conference is organized by Michael Ozner, MD, who is a member of the Life Extension® Scientific Advisory Board. Both annual conferences are attended by physicians concerned with diabetes and cardiovascular disease. I have previously reported on these conferences in Life Extension Magazine® (July 2015 and July 2014). This report will provide updates based on the most recent conferences which were held in November 2015 and February 2016. Can Food Be Addictive? Avena Nicole Avena, PhD, a research neuroscientist at New York Obesity Research Center, Columbia University, studies food addiction. Although food is required for survival, some people overconsume food, displaying symptoms comparable to what is seen with drug addiction, including compulsive bingeing, tolerance, withdrawal, and cross-sensitization to other addictive substances. Food is comparable to alcohol insofar as only a minority of consumers exhibit addictive symptoms. Dr. Avena has observed that people do not binge on broccoli, but are most likely to binge on sugar or, to a lesser degree, on fat (especially when combined with sugar).12 Dr. Avena has shown that sugar-addicted rats demonstrate activation of the same regions of the brain as are activated by drug addiction.13 Sugar-addicted rats deprived of sugar will increase their intake of alcohol, thereby displaying cross-sensitization.14 Dr. Avena suggests that the sugar fructose contributes to obesity more than glucose because glucose (from starches and sucrose) releases insulin, which reduces appetite,15 whereas fructose does not cause insulin release.16 A survey of 175 countries showed that increased availability of sugar is associated with increased diabetes, an association not found with any other food type.11 Is Sitting a Health Hazard? La Forge Ralph La Forge, MSc, CLS, a clinical lipid specialist at Duke Lipid Clinic, Durham, North Carolina, is concerned with the health hazards of sitting. More than half of the average person’s waking hours are spent sitting.17 Spending much time sitting has been associated with greater risk of dying from cancer and cardiovascular disease.18 The greatest health hazard is seen for those who are the least active.19 Obese and overweight individuals who were induced to walk for 2 minutes every 20 minutes showed reduced blood glucose and insulin.20 But a study of healthy individuals who get moderate exercise showed no mortality risk associated with the amount of time spent sitting.21 Treadmill workplace desks have been shown to reduce blood glucose and raise blood HDL, but standing desks did not show this benefit.22 Treadmill desks reduce work performance, whereas desks where it is possible to cycle while sitting do not interfere with work.23 Types of LDL Cholesterol Krauss Ronald Krauss, MD, director of Atherosclerosis Research at California’s Children’s Hospital Oakland Research Institute, is concerned about the fact that low blood LDL cholesterol often is not a good predictor of low risk for coronary heart disease because the size of LDL particles is more important than the level of LDL cholesterol. Persons with the highest concentration of small, dense LDL particles have triple the incidence of metabolic syndrome,24 and are more insulin resistant than persons with large, buoyant LDL.25 Small, dense LDL is not only more easily oxidized than the larger particles, it is more easily glycated (modified by sugar). Even in healthy persons, the amount of glycated LDL is several times larger than the amount of oxidized LDL.26 Dr. Krauss has shown that diets low in fat and high in carbohydrate increase small, dense LDL in proportion to the amount of carbohydrate.27 Aside from dietary influences, Dr. Krauss has established that many people do not benefit from LDL-lowering statin drugs because of inherited genetic factors.28,29 Blood Lipids in Diabetes Underberg James Underberg, MD, an internist at NYU Medical Center, New York City, is an expert in metabolic abnormalities most often found in diabetics (diabetic dyslipidemia), which are characterized by high blood triglycerides and lipoprotein composition that promotes atherosclerosis.30 The amount of triglycerides divided by the amount of HDL cholesterol is an excellent predictor of insulin resistance and cardiovascular disease risk when the ratio is high.31 A high carbohydrate diet has been shown to increase this ratio, indicating increased risk.32 Atherosclerosis is most strongly predicted by small, dense LDL, low HDL, and remnant cholesterol particles.33 Remnant cholesterol is calculated as non-fasting total cholesterol minus HDL cholesterol, minus LDL cholesterol.34,35 Remnant cholesterol is associated with chronic inflammation, whereas LDL cholesterol is not.36 Remnant cholesterol induces endothelial dysfunction through oxidative stress.37 According to one study, high remnant cholesterol is more predictive of myocardial infarction (heart attack) than any other lipid particle.38 Benefits of HDL Cholesterol Brinton Eliot Brinton, MD, associate professor at University of Utah School of Medicine, Salt Lake City, spoke about the role of HDL cholesterol in protecting against cardiovascular disease. Unlike LDL cholesterol, which can contribute to atherosclerosis by its deposition in the walls of arteries, HDL can prevent atherosclerosis by removing cholesterol from arteries.39 HDL can also help to prevent or to correct endothelial dysfunction (the reduced ability of blood vessels to dilate), another condition that contributes to atherosclerosis.40 A third means by which HDL can protect against atherosclerosis is by its anti-inflammatory properties.40 Approximately 10% of patients given statin drugs to lower LDL cholesterol cannot tolerate those drugs. These patients can benefit from the increased HDL resulting from taking nicotinic acid (niacin, vitamin B3).41 But no benefit is seen for most patients attempting to combine statins with nicotinic acid.42 Insulin Secretion and Insulin Resistance DeFronzo Ralph DeFronzo, MD, professor of medicine at the University of Texas Science Center, San Antonio, is a renowned diabetes expert who edited International Textbook of Diabetes Mellitus. In the 1980s, Dr. DeFronzo showed that although muscle is the most important tissue associated with insulin resistance (resistance to glucose-uptake induced by insulin),43 insulin resistance of the liver prevents the liver from reducing its glucose production.44 More of the glucose produced by the liver comes from protein than from glucose that has been stored in the liver as glycogen.45 According to Dr. DeFronzo, obese type II diabetics tend to be insulin resistant in both their liver and muscle, whereas lean type II diabetics have defective insulin secretion in response to blood glucose.46 But as type II diabetes progresses, both lean and obese diabetics exhibit increasingly defective insulin secretion as well as defective insulin sensitivity.46 Dr. DeFronzo and his associates have shown that insulin sensitivity and glucose utilization decrease in proportion to increasing amounts of free fatty acids in the blood.47 But the ability of insulin to suppress free fatty acids is impaired in type II diabetes, creating a vicious cycle. 48,49 Dr. DeFronzo has shown that reducing free fatty acids in the blood of type II diabetics improves glucose utilization in mitochondria (energy producing parts of cells).50 Branched-Chain Amino Acids in a High Fat Diet? Kim Sun Kim, MD, assistant professor of medicine at Stanford University, has attempted to understand research by Duke University’s Dr. Chris Newgard indicating that adding branched-chain amino acids to a high-fat diet increased insulin resistance above that seen with a high-fat diet alone.51 In healthy people a test drink of branched-chain amino acids has been shown to increase blood insulin even more than a pure glucose drink.52 Another test on healthy humans showed that combining branched-chain or aromatic amino acids with carbohydrates doubled the insulin increase of carbohydrates alone.53 Unlike other amino acids, which are oxidized primarily in the liver, branched-chain amino acids are primarily oxidized in skeletal muscle.54 Although Dr. Kim has confirmed the association between certain amino acids and insulin resistance, she has questions about what causal relationships exist.55 Dr. Newgard has not yet published data confirming a causal relationship, but he cautions persons at risk of type II diabetes from eating foods high in fat and branched-chain amino acids such as meat and some milk products. Heart Failure and High Blood Pressure Jessup Mariell Jessup, MD, professor of medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, discussed treatment and prevention of heart failure. In heart failure the heart is unable to pump enough blood to meet the needs of the body. One American in five over the age of 40 will develop heart failure.56 Heart failure is the leading cause of hospitalization for people over age 65, with up to half of the victims dying within one year.57 A heart failure victim has shortness of breath, is easily tired, and can accumulate fluid in tissues. Fluid retention (congestive heart failure) in the lungs causes breathing difficulties and a hacking cough, whereas peripheral fluid retention (edema) is associated with swollen limbs. Poor kidney function is the best predictor that a heart failure victim will die.58 High blood pressure is the greatest modifiable risk factor for heart failure,59 along with diabetes and being overweight.60 Losing weight is an effective way to reduce blood pressure. Every increased unit of body mass index (BMI) is associated with a 5% increased risk of heart failure in men, and a 7% increased risk in women.61 Cardiovascular disease risk increases in direct proportion to all blood pressure readings above 115/75 mmHg.62 Concluding Remarks   Insofar as these conferences were mainly concerned with preventing cardiovascular disease risk, they did not acknowledge the fact that type II diabetes greatly increases the risk of getting cancer.63 Excess weight and lack of exercise are obvious contributors to type II diabetes and death by cardiovascular disease or cancer. Metformin is the most commonly used drug to lower blood glucose for prevention and treatment of type II diabetes.64 Most attempts to lose weight by dieting fail in almost all cases, nearly all the weight is regained within five years, with a third of dieters gaining more weight than they lost.65 Bariatric surgery, by contrast, is usually a successful way for the very obese to lose weight.66 Rather than reducing food consumption, changing to a vegetarian diet can be an effective way of losing weight without regaining it. Vegetarians have lower body weight,67,68 and a lower risk of metabolic syndrome.69 Dr. Michael Ozner (who organized the Miami conference) recommends a Mediterranean diet. Reducing carbohydrates can also be a way of losing weight. In many cases a low carbohydrate diet has led to reduction or elimination of medications being used to treat type II diabetes.70 Lower risk of cancer, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease by dietary changes that don’t require restricting food intake can be the simplest way to better health. This lifestyle change can often be achieved without a protracted or difficult period of adjustment.

This topic provides information about type 2 diabetes in children. If you are looking for information about type 1 diabetes, see the topic . Type 2 diabetes is a disease that develops when the body's tissues cannot use insulin properly. Over time, the cannot make enough . Insulin is a hormone that helps the body's cells use sugar (glucose) for energy. It also helps the body store extra energy in muscle, fat, and liver cells. Without insulin, the sugar cannot get into the cells to do its work. It stays in the blood instead. This can cause high blood sugar levels. A person has diabetes when the blood sugar stays too high too much of the time. High blood sugar can cause problems with the eyes, heart, blood vessels, nerves, and kidneys. High blood sugar also makes a person more likely to get serious illnesses or infections. In the past, doctors believed that type 2 diabetes was an adult disease and that type 1 diabetes was a children's disease. Now, more and more children are getting type 2 diabetes. Finding out that your child has diabetes can be scary. But your child can live a long, healthy life by learning to manage the disease. Doctors do not know exactly what causes diabetes. Experts believe the main risks for children getting type 2 diabetes are being overweight, not being physically active, and having a family history of the disease. Also, the hormones released during the early teen years make it harder than usual for the body to use insulin correctly. This problem is called insulin resistance. It can lead to diabetes. Most children with type 2 diabetes do not have symptoms when the disease is first found. If there are symptoms, they usually are mild and may include: A simple blood test is usually all that is needed to diagnose diabetes. Your child's doctor may do other blood tests if it is not clear whether your child has type 1 or type 2 diabetes. A doctor may test your child for diabetes if he or she is overweight, gets little physical activity, or has other risk factors for the disease. A risk factor is anything that increases your chances of having a disease. Some children are diagnosed with type 2 diabetes when they have a blood or urine test for some other reason. The key to treating diabetes is to keep your child's blood sugar levels within a target range. To do this: Keep track of your child's blood sugar levels.

Help your child stay active. Your child does not have to start a strict exercise program, but being more active can help control blood sugar. For example, your child could play outside with friends, take walks with family members, or take part in sports. Set a good example. It will be easier for your child if the rest of the family also eats well and gets regular exercise. This may also reduce the risk that other family members will get the disease.

Things that affect the body's resistance to insulin in childhood include: Developmental stage. Growth hormone released during puberty can make it harder than usual for the body to use insulin correctly. Being female. Girls seem to develop more resistance to insulin than boys. Race. Hispanic, African-American, Native American, Asian-American, or Pacific Island ancestry raises risk for type 2 diabetes. Body composition. Insulin resistance increases as the amount of increases. Activity. Exercise may improve how the body's cells use insulin and get the sugar they need. Children often have no symptoms of type 2 diabetes before they are diagnosed, because their blood sugar level has been rising so slowly.

The main risk factors for are the length of time a person has diabetes and the degree of blood sugar control. A child who develops type 2 diabetes may have an increased risk of complications, because he or she will have the disease for a long time. Some complications that children and teens may develop include: Eye disease () and kidney disease (). or , which increases the risk of heart and blood vessel disease later in life. If a child's blood sugar levels remain high for a long time, he or she may grow at an abnormal rate—faster than normal for a while, then slower than normal later.

This topic covers type 1 diabetes, including information about symptoms, tests, and home treatment. For specific information about children who have type 1 diabetes, see the topic . Type 1 diabetes happens when your stops making insulin. Insulin is a hormone that helps the body's cells use sugar (glucose) for energy. It also helps the body store extra energy in muscle, fat, and liver cells. Without insulin, this sugar can't get into your cells to do its work. It stays in your blood instead. And then your blood sugar level gets too high. High blood sugar can harm , such as the eyes, heart, blood vessels, nerves, and kidneys. It can also increase your risk for other health problems (complications). Type 1 diabetes can occur at any age, but it usually starts in children or young adults. That's why it used to be called juvenile diabetes. Type 1 diabetes is different from type 2 diabetes. In type 1 diabetes, the body stops making insulin. In type 2, the body can't use insulin the right way. Over time with type 2, the body doesn't make enough insulin. There isn't a cure for type 1 diabetes. But with treatment, people can live long and healthy lives. The body makes insulin in beta cells, which are in a part of the pancreas called the islet (say ""EYE-let"") tissue. Type 1 diabetes starts because the body destroys those beta cells. Experts don't know why this happens. Some people have a greater chance of getting type 1 diabetes because they have a parent, brother, or sister who has it. But most people with the illness don't have a family history. Other things that increase the risk of getting type 1 diabetes are being white and having in the blood. What are the symptoms of undiagnosed type 1 diabetes?

When you have diabetes, your insulin injections can't control your blood sugar moment to moment, the way your pancreas would. So you may have high and low blood sugar levels from time to time. Stress and being ill (such as with severe flu) or having an infection, especially if you aren't eating or drinking enough.

Sometimes a person's blood sugar level rises greatly before he or she knows something is wrong. Because insulin isn't available, the cells in the body are unable to get the sugar (glucose) they need for energy. The body begins to break down fat and muscle for energy. When fat is used for energy, ketones—or fatty acids—are produced and enter the bloodstream. This causes the chemical imbalance . This can be a life-threatening condition.

Damage to the nerves of the body can change how the stomach contracts when digesting food. Food can take longer to digest, which can make it harder to know when insulin will work after eating. This can lead to high and low blood sugars. . Too little thyroid hormone can slow metabolism, which can cause some medicines (like insulin) to stay in the body longer. This can cause low blood sugar. And when the kidneys are damaged, insulin may stay in the body longer, causing low blood sugar. The kidneys may also have problems making glucose, causing low blood sugar.

Risk factors for type 1 diabetes include: Having a family history of the disease increases the chance that a person will have or other autoantibodies that attack the cells in the pancreas that produce insulin. But it doesn't predict that a person will have the disease. White people have a greater risk for type 1 diabetes than black, Asian, or Hispanic people. People who have both a family history of type 1 diabetes and two or more autoantibodies in their blood are likely to get type 1 diabetes.

Albuminuria may be a sign of kidney disease. — a type of cell in an area of the pancreas called the Islets of Langerhans. Alpha cells make and release a hormone called glucagon, which increases the amount of glucose in the blood. — the building blocks of proteins; the main material of the body’s cells. is made of 51 amino acids joined together. — proteins that the body produces to protect itself from foreign substances (such as bacteria or viruses). — a large blood vessel that carries blood from the heart to other parts of the body. Arteries are thicker than veins and have stronger, more elastic walls. — a disease of the arteries in the heart (also called or arteriosclerosis). Atherosclerosis occurs when the normal lining of the arteries deteriorates, the walls of the arteries thicken and deposits of fat and plaque block the flow of blood through the arteries. The arteries that supply blood to the heart become severely narrowed, decreasing the supply of oxygen-rich blood to the heart — especially during times of increased activity. — a disorder of the body’s immune system in which the immune system mistakes your body's own cells as invaders and attack them. Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease. — nerve damage most often affecting the digestive system, blood vessels, urinary system and sex organs. Autonomic nerves are not under a person's control and function on their own. — also called nonproliferative retinopathy. Is the early stage of retinopathy caused by diabetes. It does not usually impair vision. — continuous supply of low levels of insulin, such as provided by the insulin pump. — a type of cell in an area of the pancreas called the Islets of Langerhans. Beta cells make and release insulin, which controls the glucose level in the blood. — the measurement of the pressure or force inside the blood vessels (arteries) with each beat of the heart. Blood pressure is written as two numbers; the first number, the systolic pressure, is the pressure in the arteries when the heart beats and fills the arteries with blood. The second number, the diastolic pressure, is the pressure in the arteries when the heart rests between beats. — waste product of the kidneys. Increased BUN levels may indicate early kidney damage. — a bump or bulge on the first joint of the big toe caused by the swelling of a sac of fluid under the skin. Shoes that fit well can prevent bunions from forming. Bunions may lead to other problems, such as serious infection. — a small area of skin, usually on the foot, that has become thick and hard from rubbing or pressure. Calluses may lead to other problems, such as serious infection. Shoes that fit well can prevent calluses from forming. — energy that comes from food. Carbohydrates, protein, fat and alcohol all have calories. Fats have the most calories per gram. — one of the three main classes of nutrients and a source of energy. Carbohydrates are mainly sugars and starches that the body breaks down into glucose. — a doctor who takes care of people with heart disease; a heart specialist. — relating to the heart and blood vessels (arteries, veins and capillaries). — a health care professional who has met special requirements and is certified by the National Certification Board for Diabetes Educators to teach people with diabetes how to manage their condition. — a waxy, odorless substance made by the liver that is an essential part of cell walls and nerves.

A registered dietitian (RD) has special qualifications. — cards, bracelets, or necklaces with a written message, used by people with diabetes or other medical conditions to alert others in case of a medical emergency. — a doctor who treats people who have problems with their endocrine glands. The pancreas is an endocrine gland. — a lab test that measures a person’s blood glucose level after fasting or not eating anything for 10 to 12 hours. Normal fasting blood glucose is less than 100 mg/dl for people who do not have diabetes. A diagnosis of diabetes is made when two blood tests show that your fasting blood glucose level is greater than or equal to 126 mg/dl. —substances that help the body use some vitamins and keep the skin healthy. They are also the major way the body stores energy. In food, there are two types of fats; saturated and unsaturated. — a type of sugar found in many fruits and vegetables and in honey. Fructose is used to sweeten some diet foods. — the death of body tissues, usually due to a lack of blood supply, especially in the legs and feet. — a form of nerve damage that affects the stomach. Food is not digested properly and does not move through the stomach normally. — a high blood glucose level that is discovered during pregnancy. As pregnancy progresses, there is an increased need for glucose for the developing baby. Additionally, hormone changes during pregnancy affect the action of insulin, resulting in high blood glucose levels. Usually, blood glucose levels return to normal after childbirth. However, women who have had gestational diabetes are at increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes later in life. — an eye disease associated with increased pressure within the eye. Glaucoma can damage the optic nerve and cause impaired vision and blindness. — a hormone that raises the level of glucose (sugar) in the blood. Glucagon is sometimes injected when a person has lost consciousness (passed out) from a low blood sugar reaction. The injected glucagon helps raise the level of glucose in the blood. — a simple sugar found in the blood. It is the body’s main source of energy; also known as dextrose. — a test that can be used to determine if a person has diabetes. The test is done in a lab or doctor’s office in the morning before the person has eaten. First a sample of blood is taken. Then the person drinks a liquid that has glucose (sugar) in it. Periodically, another sample of blood is taken to see how the body processes the glucose in the blood. — the average amount of glucose that has been in a person’s blood over the past two to three months. It can be used to diagnose diabetes. It is also used along with home glucose monitoring to determine overall diabetes management. A level of 6.5% or higher is a diagnosis of diabetes. The target HbA1c for most people with diabetes is less than 7%. — a condition when the blood flows through the blood vessels at a force greater than normal. High blood pressure strains the heart, harms the arteries, and increases the risk of heart attack, stroke and kidney problems. Also called hypertension. — a way in which a person can measure how much glucose (sugar) is in the blood. Also called self monitoring of blood glucose. — a chemical released by the endocrine glands and other tissues to help control certain functions in the body. For instance, insulin is a hormone made by the beta cells in the pancreas, and when released, it triggers other cells to use glucose for energy. — bio-engineered insulin that is very similar to insulin made by your own body. — high blood sugar. Many things can cause hyperglycemia. It occurs when the body does not have enough insulin or cannot use the insulin it does have. — low blood glucose. Hypoglycemia in people with diabetes is often caused by an imbalance in diabetes medications, food intake, and/or activity levels. — persistent inability of the penis to become erect or stay erect. Men with diabetes may become impotent if blood sugar levels are high for a long time due to nerve and blood vessel damage caused by the high blood sugar. — changing the areas on the body where a person injects insulin. If the same injection site is used over and over again, hardened areas, lumps or indentations can develop under the skin which keep the insulin from being used properly. These lumps or indentations are called lipodystrophies. — recommended places on the body where people can inject insulin. These sites include the back of the upper arm, the abdomen, the thighs and the buttocks. — a hormone that helps the body use glucose for energy. The beta cells of the pancreas make insulin. — former term used for type 1 diabetes, also formerly called juvenile diabetes. — a small, computerized device that is worn on a belt , in a pocket, or under clothes. Most insulin pumps delivers insulin through a small, flexible tube inserted under the skin. It delivers a steady flow of insulin 24 hours a day, and on-demand doses programmed by the user for food or high blood sugar. — areas on the outer part of a cell that allow insulin in the blood to join or bind with the cell. When the cell and insulin bind together, the cell can take glucose from the blood and use it for energy. — when a person’s body will not allow insulin to work properly in the body. This condition can occur when a person is overweight, and it often improves when the person loses weight. — loss of consciousness as a result of severe hypoglycemia (low blood sugar). — former term used for type 1 diabetes. — the waste products of fat burning. When your blood glucose gets too high, the body breaks down its own fat and protein for energy instead of glucose. When fat is used, ketones appear in your urine and blood. A large amount of ketones can lead to a serious condition called diabetic ketoacidosis. — a fine, sharp pointed needle for pricking the skin. Used in blood glucose monitoring. — the use of a strong beam of light (laser) to heal a damaged area. A person with retinopathy from diabetes might receive laser treatments to heal blood vessels in the eye. — former term used for type 2 diabetes. – a collection of health risks that increase the chance of developing heart disease, stroke and diabetes. It is also known as Syndrome X, insulin resistance syndrome and dysmetabolic syndrome. — all of the physical and chemical processes in the body which occur when food is broken down, energy is created, and wastes are produced. — measurement that indicates the amount of glucose in a specific amount of blood. — disease of the kidneys caused by damage to the small blood vessels in the kidneys . People with diabetes may develop nephropathy as a result of high blood sugar damaging the blood vessels. — nerve damage. People with diabetes may develop neuropathy as a result of high blood sugar damaging the blood vessels and nerves. — former term for type 2 diabetes. —too much body fat for a person’s age, height, and gender. Obesity is a risk factor for type 2 diabetes and insulin resistance. — a doctor who treats people with eye diseases. — a person professionally trained to test the eyes and to detect and treat eye problems and some diseases by prescribing and adapting corrective lenses. — an organ behind the lower part of the stomach that is about the size of a hand. It has many roles, including the production of insulin and glucagon. — the time when the effect of something is as strong as it can be, such as when insulin is having the most effect on blood glucose. — damage to the gums and tissues around the teeth. People who have high blood sugar are more likely to have periodontal disease than people who do not . — a type of nerve damage most commonly affecting the feet and legs. The arms, abdomen and back may rarely be affected. — any abnormal condition that affects the blood vessels outside the heart and lymphatic vessels. Often occurs as decreased blood flow to the hands and feet. People with diabetes may develop PVD as a result of high blood sugar damaging the blood vessels. — a health professional who diagnoses and treats foot problems. — excessive thirst that lasts for long periods of time; may be a sign of diabetes. —excessive hunger and eating; may be a sign of diabetes. People with polyphagia as a result of diabetes often lose weight even though they are eating more than normal. — a type of fat that comes from vegetables. — increased need to urinate often; a common sign of diabetes. – a mixture of insulin that contains two different types of insulin. Using pre-mixed insulin prevents someone from having to take two injections at the same time or mixing insulin from two vials (bottles). — one of three main classes of nutrients. Proteins are made of amino acids, which are called the ""building blocks of the cells."" The cells need proteins to grow and to mend themselves. Protein is found in many foods such as meat, fish, poultry, eggs, legumes and dairy products. — the point at which the blood is holding so much of a substance, such as glucose, that the kidneys allow the excess to ""spill"" into the urine. — the center part of the back lining of the eye that senses light. It has many small blood vessels that can be harmed by high blood sugar levels. — a disease of the small blood vessels in the retina of the eye. People with diabetes may develop retinopathy as a result of high blood sugar damaging the blood vessels in the eyes. — anything that increases the chance of a person developing a disease or condition. — an artificial sweetener that is sometimes used in place of sugar because it has no calories. — also called rebound effect. A swing to a high level of glucose in the blood after an extremely low level It often happens as the result of an untreated low blood sugar during the night. People who experience high levels of blood glucose in the morning may need to test their blood glucose levels in the middle of the night. If blood glucose levels are repeatedly low overnight, adjustments in evening snacks or insulin doses may be recommended. —table sugar; a form of sugar that the body must break down into a more simple form before the blood can absorb it and take it to the cells. — a type of carbohydrate. Sugar is a quick and easy fuel for the body to use. Some types of sugar are lactose, glucose, fructose and sucrose. — fats carried in the blood from the food we eat. Most of the fats we eat, including butter, margarines and oils, are in triglyceride form. Excess calories, alcohol or sugar in the body are converted into triglycerides and stored in fat cells throughout the body. The body needs insulin to remove this type of fat from the blood. — a type of diabetes in which the insulin-producing cells (beta cells) of the pancreas are damaged. People with type 1 diabetes produce little or no insulin, so glucose cannot get into the body’s cells for use as energy. This causes blood glucose to rise. People with type 1 diabetes must use insulin injections to manage their blood glucose. — a type of diabetes in which the insulin produced is either not enough or doesn’t work properly in the body. As a result, glucose cannot get into the body’s cells for use as energy. This causes blood glucose to rise. — a break in the skin; a deep sore. People with high blood sugar levels may develop ulcers from minor scrapes on the feet or legs, from cuts that heal slowly, or from the rubbing of shoes that don’t fit well. Ulcers can become infected and should be treated promptly. — the basic measure of insulin. U-100 is the most common concentration of insulin. U-100 means that there are 100 units of insulin per milliliter (ml) of liquid. – an infection of the urinary system (kidneys, bladder, and/or the tubes that connect them. Symptoms can include burning or pain with urination and frequent urination. People with high blood sugar levels have a higher risk of getting a UTI than people with target blood sugar levels. - an inflammation or infection of the vaginal tissues, usually caused by a fungus. A woman with this condition may have itching or burning or vaginal discharge. Women who have high blood sugar levels may develop vaginitis more often than women who have target blood sugar levels. — relating to the body's blood vessels (arteries, veins and capillaries). — a blood vessel that carries blood to the heart. — a procedure in which the gel from the center of the eyeball is removed because it has blood and scar tissue in it that blocks vision. An eye surgeon replaces the clouded gel with a clear fluid. – a fungal infection of male or female genitals. Symptoms can include itching, soreness, white discharge, and pain with intercourse.

If It Doesn't Challenge You It Doesn't Change You Exercise is good medicine and one that health care professionals don’t prescribe often enough. Plus, regular physical activity may slow the aging process. No one likes the outward and inward changes that appear with aging and the health problems that go with it, but there’s good news. Exercise may help you stay fitter and healthier longer. Have you ever wondered how exercise slows aging? Let’s look at what science shows about the anti-aging benefits of exercise. Physical Activity Lowers the Risk of Chronic, Age-Related Health Problems One thing you can look forward to during mid-life and later is a higher risk of age-related health problems, like cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes. Studies show regular physical activity lowers the risk of both of these health problems. How? Aerobic exercise and strength training improves insulin sensitivity, the way cells handle glucose. By boosting glucose uptake by cells, exercise reduces the risk of type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and obesity. Plus, according to the American Cancer Society, exercise lowers the risk of at least 13 types of cancer. How does staying physically active reduce cancer risk? For one, it helps with bodyweight control. Obesity is associated with an increased risk of many cancers in men and women. Plus, aerobic exercise reduces blood levels of estrogen, meaning it may lower the risk of estrogen-dependent breast cancer and cancer of the uterus in females. Also, people who exercise regularly have better insulin sensitivity and lower insulin levels. Insulin is a factor that drives the growth of some cancers. Another problem people worry about as the years go by is losing their mental facilities and going into cognitive decline. Dementia is marked by a significant decline in cognitive function and a loss of short-term memory, but there’s a less pronounced form of cognitive dysfunction called mild cognitive impairment (MCI). People with MCI don’t have dementia but they have minor memory and cognitive issues that still impact their quality of life. People with mild cognitive impairment also have a higher risk of developing dementia. The good news? Studies show exercise improves mild cognitive impairment. A six-month study of adults with MCI found that those who engaged in six months of aerobic exercise experienced improvements in mild cognitive impairment while a group that simply stretched did not. Research also shows exercise increases the volume of certain portions of the brain, including the hippocampus, a part that plays a key role in learning and memory. Sedentary people also lose brain volume at a faster rate than those who get regular aerobic exercise. One reason men and women become less functional and fall more later in life is that they lose muscle mass and muscle strength. Strength training is the key to reducing muscle loss and preventing the frailty that comes with old age. It’s never too late to start either. Research shows even people in the eighth and ninth decades of life can build new muscle tissue and gain strength in response to a strength-training program. It’s one of the best investments you can make in your future health. Exercise Reduces Bone Loss and the Risk of Falling A fractured hip due to a fall can be life-changing. For an older adult, a tumble can lead to disability and reduced quality of life. Bone density begins to decline after the age of 30 and accelerates during late middle age. Women are at higher risk, especially small-boned women. Yet there is a way to slow the age-related loss of bone density and it’s exercise. Studies show high-impact exercise where both feet leave the ground at the same time, like running or jumping, signals cells called osteoblasts to lay down new bone tissue. Although it’s questionable whether you can build significant quantities of new bone late in life, high-impact exercise helps maintain the bone density you have and there is some research showing you can modestly enhance bone density even after menopause. Strength training, as long as you use a challenging weight that you can only lift 8 to 10 times, does too. For best results, you need both types of exercise, high impact, and strength training. If you already have osteoporosis, don’t do high-impact exercise without consulting your physician first. Telomeres are the tiny endcaps on the ends of chromosomes, the genetic material inside cells. Chromosomes determine traits such as eye color, hair color, blood type, and more. It’s telomeres that protect the chromosomes from fraying, much like the hard tip on a shoestring protects the shoestring from unraveling. Each time a cell replicates the telomeres become shorter. Once telomeres shorten to a certain point, the cell undergoes senescence and loses their ability to replicate or reproduce themselves. So, longer telomeres offer a longevity advantage. The good news is research shows physical activity may lengthen telomeres. One study found that physically active people have telomeres that are up to nine years younger than those who are inactive. The amount of activity you need to get these benefits is doable too. Based on the study, 30 to 40 minutes of jogging five days of the week is sufficient. So, staying physically active could slow aging at the cellular level. Now you know why it’s so important to make time for exercise. As Harvard Health Publishing points out, exercise is as effective as some pharmaceuticals for preventing disease-shortening health problems such as type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Think of it as an investment in your future health and as something you can do to tack on extra years to your life. It will also help you stay more functional too. ·        Cancer.org. “Exercise Linked With Lower Risk of 13 Types of Cancer” ·        Arch Neurol. 2010 Jan; 67(1): 71-79.doi: 10.1001/archneurol.2009.307. ·        ScienceDaily.com. “High levels of exercise linked to nine years of less aging at the cellular level” ·        Larry A.

You've asked and we've answered your questions about managing diabetes in the following categories: I have been trying to eat better to manage my diabetes. Now that I know my risk for cardiovascular disease, I realize I have to eat better for my heart, too. As a person with diabetes, am I supposed to watch my calories, fat or carbohydrates? Lori Wolf, R.D./L.D., patient education advisor for the American Heart Association in Dallas, Texas, explains: Diabetes increases the risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD), and dietary intervention has been proven to help lower that risk. Following recommendations from the American Heart Association is heart healthy. Since diabetes is a major risk factor for CVD, you should protect your heart with diet and physical activity (as your healthcare provider allows). To manage your diabetes, it's important to monitor calories, fat and carbohydrates. On a diabetic meal plan, your caloric intake should remain about the same from day to day. That's because the meal plan is designed around a total caloric level. Your healthcare provider set your level to support optimal blood sugar control and to allow gradual weight loss or weight maintenance, depending on your need. That's why it's imperative that you comply with the recommended calorie levels. Fat is an important nutrient in the diet, so don't exclude it. To manage your diabetes to protect your heart, it helps to know about saturated, unsaturated and trans fats. - Saturated fats are usually solid at room temperature and come from animal products such as meats, cheese, eggs, milk products and butter. They are also found in tropical oils such as coconut and palm oils. Saturated fats increase CVD risk by increasing the bad cholesterol (LDL). To protect against CVD, you should limit these fats to less than 5-6 percent of calories in your diet. - Unsaturated fats are liquid at room temperature and come from vegetable sources such as canola oil and olive oil. They also can be found in soft tub or liquid margarine. These fats protect your heart's health by lowering the bad cholesterol, so most of your daily fat should come from unsaturated fats. And you should use these oils to substitute for saturated fat choices, not in addition to them. - Trans fats are created in an industrial process that adds hydrogen to liquid vegetable oils to make them more solid. Another name for fats is ""partially hydrogenated oils."" Look for them on the ingredient list on food packages. fats raise your bad (LDL) cholesterol levels and lower your good (HDL) cholesterol levels. You should limit your diet to less than 1 percent of your total daily calories. To manage diabetes and decrease CVD risk, it's best to increase unsaturated fats and decrease saturated fat and trans fat. Carbohydrates should be the main focus of your daily efforts to control your blood sugar and thus your diabetes. Carbohydrates are completely digested and put into your bloodstream in the form of sugar within two hours of eating them. (This is one of the reasons it's important to test your blood sugar two hours after a meal to monitor how your body handled the amount of carbohydrates you just ate and to design the perfect plan for your body.) To successfully manage diabetes, consistency is the key with carbohydrates. Typically, eating the same amount of carbohydrates at each meal at the same time every day is a great formula for stabilizing blood sugar levels according to the caloric level of your meal plan. Some people are more sensitive because of medications and/or activity levels. They will need more specific monitoring of their meals and carbohydrate intake with a dietitian's help. First, there was the South Beach Diet, then the Grapefruit Diet, then the Atkins Diet. Do any of these — and other fad diets — work for someone with diabetes? What's the best way to lose weight? First, I do not like the word ""diet"" as it is commonly used. Instead, think ""lifestyle change,"" because when you stop using a diet, you go back to where you were before you began the diet. There's nothing magical about any of these fad diets. They're quick fixes. All of them will help you lose weight as long as you eat fewer calories than you expend. A lot of these diets replace something you eat with something else. So, going on these diets is the wrong approach to take. If, as a person with diabetes, you want to get your weight under control, make major behavior changes. I recommend you join Weight Watchers because it will put you into a lifestyle change mode. Think of diet in the context of ""eat less, move more."" You must work on both sides of the equation: how many calories you consume (diet) and how many calories you expend (exercise). There's a difference between diets that help you lose weight and diets that can help you lower both blood cholesterol and body weight. For example, the diet that lowers blood cholesterol is low in saturated fat and cholesterol and has the right amount of calories for you. A diet that fosters weight loss only, such as some of the fad diets, can cause weight loss temporarily but may not help with glucose control or maintaining weight loss. In fact, a good diet — that is, a healthy lifestyle — causes weight loss and will improve blood sugar control, lower blood pressure and lower blood cholesterol. So remember, it's not about diet — it's about behavior change. I have heard that drinking a glass of wine a day is good for the heart. Is this true if you have diabetes? Are the benefits of alcohol limited to wine, or can I drink other types of alcohol? Can alcohol have an adverse effect on my blood sugar levels? Prakash Deedwania, chief of the cardiology division and professor of medicine at the University of California School of Medicine in San Francisco, Calif., explains: Drinking a glass of wine is good for the heart in the sense that the main mechanism by which alcohol protects the heart is increasing good cholesterol (HDL). The grape skin provides flavonoids and other antioxidant substances that protect the heart and vessels from the damaging effects of free oxygen radicals produced by our body. This is particularly true for diabetics because they have been shown to have a high production of free oxygen radicals. But we don't have any evidence specifically related to diabetes patients. A glass of wine can also help individuals relax. The strongest evidence is in favor of wine, but some evidence recently showed beer and other types of alcohol may provide the same benefits related to increasing good cholesterol (HDL). In general, alcohol does not seem to have an adverse effect, unless excessive amount is used — and it increases calories, among other things. For example, excessive amounts of alcohol consumption could be harmful by increasing the risk of high blood pressure, for which diabetic patients are already at high risk. My healthcare provider told me that if I lose some weight, my diabetes will be better controlled. I have been incorporating physical activity into my everyday life and have lost a little weight. But the last couple of weeks, I feel like I have hit a plateau — nothing's happening anymore and I still have some weight to go! What's going on? First, congratulations on your weight loss! Losing even 10 pounds will improve your blood sugar readings and HbA1c. It also will help lower your blood pressure and LDL (""bad"") cholesterol and raise your HDL (""good"") cholesterol. It's hard for most people to get enough physical activity to substantially reduce their weight. Regular physical activity must be combined with sensible eating — and, most importantly, portion control. Even when physical activity and reducing calories are used together, people often reach a plateau. The number of calories that your body needs depends on your body weight. The heavier you are, the more calories you can eat to maintain your body weight. As you lose weight, though, you may need to adjust your calorie intake downward to keep losing weight. Sometimes if people have been severely restricting their calorie intake, they may lower their metabolic rate. Then they may need to add 100 to 200 calories per day of healthy foods to rev up their metabolism. When people have been working at weight loss for a long time and feel that they've hit a plateau, it's often a good idea to take a break from actively trying to lose more and spend some time maintaining this new weight. Also, varying the type of physical activity can be helpful. By doing this you will not only use different muscle groups, but you will be less likely to become bored. In addition, you may want to assess how much and what types of food you are eating. It is easy to believe you are eating less when in fact you are taking in more calories than is necessary. Remember to drink enough water, too — it helps your metabolism and cellular function. Losing weight is hard work. The people who are most successful in the long-term are those who have lost weight slowly and steadily and who have learned to incorporate sound eating habits and moderate levels of physical activity into their everyday life. I've started working some physical activity into my daily routine. But my blood sugar seems a little more out of control. How does my becoming more active affect my blood sugar? Alain Bertoni, M.D., M.P.H., assistant professor in Public Health Sciences and Internal Medicine at Wake Forest University School of Medicine in Winston-Salem, N.C., explains: Becoming more physically active is a great way to help control your diabetes. When you walk or do other moderate-intensity physical activities such as biking, swimming or dancing, you burn more calories than when you're sitting still. Your now-active muscles take up sugar from the blood to use as energy. This tends to lower your blood sugar levels, which is generally good. Many people with diabetes can exercise safely. Before beginning any exercise program, consult with your healthcare provider to help choose the safest activities for you, given your age and medical history. Once your healthcare provider has given you the green light, increase your physical activity. By doing regular physical activity, you will probably lower your blood sugar levels (as measured by the HbA1c test) and may make it easier to reach your diabetes treatment goals. However, be aware that the change in blood sugar levels during a particular exercise session may cause blood sugar to drop so low that it could cause hypoglycemia (extremely low blood sugar levels). This may be more likely to happen if you use insulin or oral drugs in the sulfonylurea family. To guard against this, you should know your usual symptoms of hypoglycemia and carry a source of sugar with you such as tablets, hard candy or juice (with real sugar, not artificial sweetener). If you experience hypoglycemic symptoms, stop exercising and eat or drink the source of sugar. Other general precautions include: don't take your medications just before exercise, and If you have experienced hypoglycemia during exercise, especially if severe passing out or if milder cases have occurred several times, consult with your healthcare provider or diabetes educator before continuing your exercise program. You may need to coordinate your eating, exercise and medication times, test your blood sugar levels before exercising, or eat a heart-healthy snack (like a piece of fruit) just before exercising. Finally, pay close attention to your eyes, feet and joints. Wearing shoes that don't fit properly or doing more demanding exercises (like jogging) may cause injuries. Lower-impact sports and good socks/athletic shoes may help guard against this. Report blisters or ulcers to your healthcare provider immediately. Certain strenuous activities (like racket sports) may cause problems with your eyes if you already have significant retinopathy. I am eating right, and increasing my activity, but my waist size is still big. Is this okay, or am I still at risk? Dr. Lori Mosca, an American Heart Association volunteer and director of preventive cardiology at New York-Presbyterian Hospital explains: Waist size is a very important predictor of having unhealthy levels of blood cholesterol, high blood pressure, and prediabetes. For men, if the number is over 40, or for women if the number is over 35, risk increases. The research is beginning to tell us that it's not IF you're fat that matters, but WHERE you're fat. It seems the belly is not just a simple storage depot for fat but is a pretty active place in the body that leads to a lot of metabolic abnormalities that increase the risk for cardiovascular disease, such as heart attack or stroke. At this point we can't fully explain why, but we do know that an oversized waist is a red flag. I have heard that if I have type 2 diabetes, my risk for heart attack is the same as that of someone who has already had a heart attack. Is this true? Can you help me understand the relationship between type 2 diabetes and heart disease? Dr. Lori Mosca, an American Heart Association volunteer and director of preventive cardiology at New York-Presbyterian Hospital explains: Type 2 diabetes is the type that often develops in adulthood, though more and more children and adolescents are also developing it. It's often associated with being overweight and leading a not-so-healthy lifestyle. We've learned in our research that people with diabetes have almost the same risk of having a future heart attack as people who already have heart disease or other vascular disease. So diabetes is really one of the strongest risk factors we have. Some of us feel so strongly about diabetes that we call it a risk equivalent, which means it's equivalent to having heart disease already. We are extremely aggressive with this risk factor, because we know that if you have diabetes, you are at substantially higher risk for future heart disease. We also know that diabetes is associated with unhealthy levels of different types of blood cholesterol. So, people with diabetes tend to have an increased level of the bad cholesterol (LDL) and of triglycerides, and they tend to have reduced levels of the good cholesterol (HDL). This may be one of the explanations for why people with diabetes are at such high risk for heart attacks. Learn how to better manage your . My healthcare provider told me I have type 2 diabetes. He also told me that my risk for cardiovascular disease, such as heart attack or stroke, is very high. Why is the risk so much higher for me? Wahida Karmally, Dr.Ph., R.D., associate research scientist and director of nutrition of the Irving Center for Clinical Research in the Columbia University Medical Center in New York, explains: Even when blood sugar levels are under control, diabetes increases the risk of heart disease and stroke. The risks are even greater if blood sugar is not well controlled. This occurs because diabetes causes damage to the blood vessels and arteries throughout the body including the ones that supply blood to your heart and brain. As this damage occurs, it becomes easier for plaque to form in the arteries. This buildup (atherosclerosis) is what can increase your blood pressure. When high blood pressure exists with obesity, smoking, high blood cholesterol or diabetes, the risk of heart attack or stroke increases several times. It's very important to control your weight and blood cholesterol with a low-saturated-fat, low-cholesterol, plant-based diet and regular exercise. It's also important to lower high blood pressure and not to smoke. Diabetes is a coronary heart disease risk equivalent. This means the risk for major coronary events is equal to that in established coronary heart disease. The risk for cardiovascular disease, such as heart attack and stroke, is higher because most people with diabetes have other health problems such as high blood pressure and blood cholesterol. If you have diabetes, you can reduce your risk for cardiovascular disease and stroke by controlling your Blood cholesterol — Get your cholesterol checked and talk to your doctor about your numbers and how they impact your overall risk. Managing your weight, eating a plant-based healthy diet, engaging in regular physical activity and taking medications (if prescribed by your healthcare provider) can also help you reach your treatment goals. I was recently diagnosed with type 2 diabetes and I am concerned about my children's risk for diabetes. What steps can I take to help them lead a healthy lifestyle and avoid diabetes? Many parents who are diabetic worry about their child’s risk for diabetes. It is true that having a family member with diabetes measurably increases the risk that a child may develop diabetes. Fortunately, with some knowledge and with help from your health care providers, there are things you can do to keep your children healthy. Having a parent with type 2 diabetes increases a child’s risk for developing diabetes. This is related in part to genetics and in part to learned habits around exercise and eating. One way of thinking about it is that genes lay the groundwork, and the lifestyle allows for or protects against a diabetic predisposition. So, having a healthy lifestyle is extremely important. The risk that your child will develop type 2 diabetes depends on the parent’s gender and how old they were when they were diagnosed; children of mothers diagnosed before the age of 50 years have significant risk, 1 in 7. No medication has yet been shown to slow the progression to type 2 diabetes in children, although some medications may be useful in adults, and research is ongoing. Fortunately, lifestyle change can prevent diabetes in adults, and this is likely to be true in children as well. Weight loss, regular moderate-intensity, aerobic physical exercise such as 30 minutes of brisk walking 5 times per week and healthy eating habits, decrease the risk of diabetes in adults. Research in children shows that having a healthy lifestyle can improve factors associated with diabetes, including weight, cholesterol and blood pressure. Some specific things you can do to improve your child’s health are: Limit screen time: Keeping screen time to 2 hours or less per day may reduce rates of obesity, an important risk factor for diabetes type 2 Encourage a healthy diet: Serve lots of fruits and vegetables, unsalted nuts, low-fat (1%) or fat free dairy, fiber-rich, whole grain foods, fish twice per week, and limit intake of saturated fat, trans fat, and cholesterol. Choose healthy, monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats and avoid highly processed foods that can be high in sodium. Limit added sugars in beverages and foods such as sodas, fruit drinks, sucrose, fructose, maltose, honey, high-fructose corn syrup, concentrated fruit juice, corn syrup, cane juice, sweets (examples: candy, cookies, cake, etc.). Aim for a healthy weight: helping your child work towards a healthy weight is an important way to reduce your child’s risk of diabetes. Children and adolescents should do 60 minutes or more of physical activity per day. Model good habits: Positive role modeling is important. Show your children that physical activity is important and can be fun by spending time playing actively. Keep in mind that if you don’t take care of yourself, it will be hard for your children to follow a healthy lifestyle. For parents with the more rare type of diabetes mellitus, Type 1, the risk that your child will develop the disease depends in part on your gender and also the age you were diagnosed. Children of male type 1 diabetics have a 1 in 17 risk of contracting diabetes, while children of very early onset diabetics, those with two affected parents, and with multiple endocrine problems are at much greater risk (1 in 2-10). Breastfeeding may offer some protection from Type 1 diabetes. Some research has evaluated blood tests that may be available for siblings of children with type 1 diabetes; speak to your child’s doctor about this. So far, no medication has been shown to prevent type 1 diabetes in children, although research studies are ongoing. You and your doctor can better understand your child’s individual risk for diabetes using blood testing. A fasting glucose test should be done in overweight children with 2 of the following risk factors: family history of Type 2 diabetes including gestational diabetes in the child’s mother, at risk racial/ethnic background, high risk medical conditions such as insulin resistance, PCOS or metabolic syndrome. Screening should be done at least every 3 years using either a fasting glucose or a glycosylated hemoglobin (hemoglobin A1C). A more specialized test (oral glucose tolerance test) can tell how the body responds to glucose and can help your provider evaluate your child more closely. Talk to your child’s doctor about these tests.

It is a chronic disease that has no cure. Therefore it comes to no surprise that this disease has acquired countless number of attentions. Unfortunately, 5.4 million people in the United State are unaware that they have this disease. Until they do, they have already developed life-threatening complications. This may include blindness, kidney diseases, nerves diseases, heart diseases, strokes, and amputations. It is no wonder that diabetes is known as the silent killer. Diabetes is condition where the body does not produce or properly use insulin, which is a type of hormone that converts sugar, starches, and other types of foods into the energy that humans need everyday. It controls the blood sugar level and without it, death is inevitable. There are two major types of diabetes: Type I, and Type II. Type I is where the body does not produce any insulin also known as insulin dependent or immune-medicated diabetes. It is a disease that destroys the cells in the pancreas that produces insulin. Type II, is where the body can't make enough or properly use insulin, also known as non-insulin dependent. Other specific type of diabetes may have its origin from certain genetic syndromes, surgery, drugs, malnutrition inflection and other illness. The cause of this disease remains a mystery. Genetics, environmental factors, lack of exercise, plays an important role in the cause of diabetes. Diabetes can cause different types of problems depending on which types of diabetes they have. For Type I diabetes, two problems may occur: ketoacidosis, and hyperglycemia. In ketoacidosis, your body produces ketones. This occurs when your blood glucose level increases too high. The productions of ketones have its unpleasant results. Ketones can cause you to vomit, have trouble breathing, become dehydrated, have dry itchy skin, and/or go into a coma.

Managing type 1 is composed of a handful of elements: blood glucose control and insulin management, exercise, nutrition and support. A diagnosis of type 1 means your pancreas is no longer capable of producing insulin. Through multiple daily injections with insulin pens or syringes or an insulin pump, it will be up to you to monitor your blood glucose levels and appropriately administer your insulin. Exercise is a key component of proper care. Along with all of the other benefits you will receive from being active, your will also respond in kind with more stable blood glucose levels. Regardless of the type of you have, regular physical activity is important for your overall health and wellness. With type 1, it’s important to balance your insulin doses with the food you eat and the activity that you do – even if you are just doing house or yard work. Planning ahead and knowing your body’s typical blood glucose response to exercise can help you keep your blood glucose from going too low or too high. Some activities may cause your blood glucose to drop quickly while others do not. If your blood glucose levels are trending down before a workout, have a pre-exercise snack.

We are a group of 14 year olds trying to make a better community. We are here to speak to you about our future. Have you ever come home with the stench of smoke clinging to your clothes? Or inhaled a cloud of smoke as a group of smokers passed, causing you to cough and choke? Neither experiences are pleasant and this is why smoking should be banned in public areas. Smoking is a dangerous habit that not only affects the smoker, but those around him or her. Banning the smoking in public will keep non-smokers safer. People who smoke subject themselves to deadly diseases by choice. Why should non-smokers be forced to be around it? Let’s hand it over to Fred who will now tell you how our world needs our help and that smoking should be banned. Main speaker: I’m here to tell you people that smoking should be banned. Every day in Great Britain about 450 children start smoking, 1 in 4 which turns into regular smokers by the age of 15 and every year 106, 000 people die from the effect of cigarettes. Would you want your child to become addicted to smoking? Watching people smoking disgusts me.

Atherosclerosis is the leading cause of heart disease in the United States. The following is the definition provided by the American Heart Association: Atherosclerosis (ath""er-o-skleh-RO'sis) comes from the Greek words athero (meaning gruel or paste) and sclerosis (hardness). It's the name of the process in which deposits of fatty substances, cholesterol, cellular waste products, calcium and other substances build up in the inner lining of an artery. This buildup is called plaque. It usually affects large and medium-sized arteries. Some hardening of arteries often occurs when people grow older (AHA, 2005). Atherosclerosis is different from Arteriosclerosis, though the two are oftentimes concurrently present as a result of heart disease and are likewise confused. Arteriosclerosis is defined by the Well-Net group as: ...during which the arteries of the cardiovascular system develop areas which become hard and brittle. Vessels become thickened. There is a loss of elasticity. It can involve the arteries of the cardiovascular system, the brain, kidneys, upper and lower extremities. This occurs because of the deposition of calcium in their walls.

Her labs would probably indicate: Serum glucose will probably be over 300mg/dL Osmolarity would most likely be high if the patient is dehydrated from polyurea caused by the hyperglycemia. Hyperglycemia itself is a hyperosmotic state. It’s possible that this high blood suger could try to pull fluids from cells, creating an almost isotonic state in the early stages of DKA. In other words, this may not be the best indicator of what is actually going on…it can be variable. Serum acetone would be high due to the production of ketone bodies (from breakdown of fatty acids for energy) BUN: (increased) &gt; 20mg/dL due to dehydration status Arterial PH: low due to current state of acidosis. Arterial PCO2 would be high. This would stimulate Kussmaul respirations to exhale accumulation of CO2. If this kind of breathing continues it can result in respiratory alkalosis (overcorrection). This situation is a medical emergency because these changes lead to imbalances in blood PH and electrolyte loss. If potassium levels rise, it can effect the heart, causing dysrhythmias. The brain is not getting needed glucose..This can lead to shock, coma and death. 2. The nurse should initially give this patient an IV isotonic solution (normal saline) to replace fluid loss.

Insulin regulates the level of glucose in your blood. Glucose is a simple form of sugar found in foods and sugary drinks. It’s absorbed by your body as a natural part of digestion and is carried around your body in your blood. When glucose reaches your body tissues, such as muscle cells, it's absorbed and converted into energy. Insulin is secreted into your blood by your pancreas, which is a gland located behind your stomach. If your cells don't respond properly to insulin, it can cause glucose to build up in your blood. This is called insulin resistance. If this happens, your pancreas needs to produce more and more insulin to overcome the resistance and control your blood glucose...

Other causes of hypoglycemia include , certain (such as ), , , , , , , and a number of drugs, including alcohol. Low blood sugar may occur in otherwise healthy babies who have not eaten for a few hours. The glucose level that defines hypoglycemia is variable. In people with diabetes, levels below 3.9  (70 mg/dl) are diagnostic. In adults without diabetes, symptoms related to low blood sugar, low blood sugar at the time of symptoms, and improvement when blood sugar is restored to normal confirm the diagnosis. Otherwise, a level below 2.8 mmol/l (50 mg/dl) after not eating or following exercise may be used. In newborns, a level below 2.2 mmol/l (40 mg/dl), or less than 3.3 mmol/l (60 mg/dl) if symptoms are present, indicates hypoglycemia. Other tests that may be useful in determining the cause include insulin and levels in the blood. Among people with diabetes, prevention is by matching the foods eaten with the amount of exercise and the medications used. When people feel their blood sugar is low, testing with a is recommended. Some people have few initial symptoms of low blood sugar, and frequent routine testing in this group is recommended. Treatment of hypoglycemia is by eating foods high in simple sugars or taking . If a person is not able to take food by mouth, by injection or in the nose may help. The treatment of hypoglycemia unrelated to diabetes includes treating the underlying problem and a . The term ""hypoglycemia"" is sometimes incorrectly used to refer to , a controversial condition with similar symptoms that occurs following eating, but with normal blood sugar levels. Hypoglycemic symptoms and manifestations can be divided into those produced by the counter-regulatory hormones (/adrenaline and glucagon) triggered by the falling glucose, and the effects produced by the reduced brain sugar. , feeling of warmth (sympathetic rather than adrenergic) Nonspecific dysphoria, moodiness, depression, crying, exaggerated concerns Feeling of numbness, (paresthesia) Negativism, irritability, belligerence, combativeness, , weakness, apathy, , daydreaming, Confusion, , or dizziness, Staring, glassy look, blurred vision, , incoordination, sometimes mistaken for Focal or general motor deficit, , Not all of the above manifestations occur in every case of hypoglycemia. No consistent order to the appearance of the symptoms is seen, if symptoms even occur. Specific manifestations may also vary by age, severity of the hypoglycemia, and speed of the decline. In young children, vomiting can sometimes accompany morning hypoglycemia with . In older children and adults, moderately severe hypoglycemia can resemble , mental illness, drug intoxication, or drunkenness. In the elderly, hypoglycemia can produce focal -like effects or a hard-to-define malaise. The symptoms of a single person may be similar from episode to episode, but are not necessarily so, and may be influenced by the speed at which glucose levels are dropping, as well as previous incidents. In , hypoglycemia can produce irritability, jitters, , , respiratory distress, episodes, sweating, , somnolence, , refusal to feed, and seizures or ""spells"". Hypoglycemia can resemble , , , or . In both young and old people with hypoglycemia, the brain may habituate to low glucose levels, with a reduction of noticeable symptoms despite impairment. In insulin-dependent diabetic people, this phenomenon is termed , and is a significant clinical problem when improved is attempted. Another aspect of this phenomenon occurs in , when chronic hypoglycemia before diagnosis may be better tolerated than acute hypoglycemia after treatment is underway. Hypoglycemic symptoms can also occur when one is sleeping. Examples of symptoms during sleep can include damp bed sheets or clothes from perspiration. Having nightmares or the act of crying out can be a sign of hypoglycemia. Once individuals are awake, they may feel tired, irritable, or confused and these may be signs of hypoglycemia, as well. In nearly all cases, hypoglycemia that is severe enough to cause seizures or unconsciousness can be reversed without obvious harm to the brain. Cases of death or permanent neurological damage occurring with a single episode have usually involved prolonged, untreated unconsciousness, interference with breathing, severe concurrent disease, or some other type of vulnerability. Nevertheless, brain damage or death has occasionally resulted from severe hypoglycemia. Research in healthy adults shows that mental efficiency declines slightly but measurably as blood glucose falls below 3.6 mmol/l (65 mg/dl). defense mechanisms ( and ) are normally activated as it drops below a threshold level (about 3.0 mmol/l (55 mg/dl) for most people), producing the typical hypoglycemic symptoms of shakiness and . Obvious impairment may not occur until the glucose falls below 2.2 mmol/l (40 mg/dl), and many healthy people may occasionally have glucose levels below 3.6 mmol/l (65 mg/dl) in the morning without apparent effects. Since the brain effects of hypoglycemia, termed , determine whether a given low glucose is a ""problem"" for that person, most doctors use the term hypoglycemia only when a moderately low glucose level is accompanied by symptoms or brain effects. Determining the presence of both parts of this definition is not always straightforward, as hypoglycemic symptoms and effects are vague and can be produced by other conditions; people with recurrently low glucose levels can lose their threshold symptoms so that severe neuroglycopenic impairment can occur without much warning, and many measurement methods (especially glucose meters) are imprecise at low levels. Recovery from severe hypoglycemia with unconsciousness or seizure even after restoration of normal blood glucose may take longer. When a person has not been unconscious, failure of carbohydrate to reverse the symptoms in 10–15 minutes increases the likelihood that hypoglycemia was not the cause of the symptoms. When severe hypoglycemia has persisted in a hospitalized person, the amount of glucose required to maintain satisfactory blood glucose levels becomes an important clue to the underlying cause. Glucose requirements above 10 mg/kg/minute in infants, or 6 mg/kg/minute in children and adults are strong evidence for . In this context, this is referred to as the glucose infusion rate. Finally, the blood glucose response to glucagon given when the glucose is low can also help distinguish among various types of hypoglycemia. A rise of blood glucose by more than 1.70 mmol/l (30 mg/dl) suggests insulin excess as the probable cause of the hypoglycemia. Significant hypoglycemia appears to increase the risk of . The most common cause of hypoglycemia is medications used to treat diabetes mellitus such as insulin, sulfonylureas, and . Risk is greater in diabetics who have eaten less than usual, exercised more than usual, or drunk . Other causes of hypoglycemia include kidney failure, certain , liver disease, hypothyroidism, starvation, inborn errors of metabolism, severe infection or sepsis, , and a number of drugs, including alcohol. Low blood sugar may occur in babies who are otherwise healthy who have not eaten for a few hours. Inborn errors of metabolism may include the lack of an enzyme to make glycogen (glycogen storage type 0). Serious illness may result in low blood sugar. Severe disease of nearly all major organ systems can cause hypoglycemia as a secondary problem. persons, especially in or those prevented from eating, can develop hypoglycemia from a variety of circumstances related to the care of their primary disease. Hypoglycemia in these circumstances is often multifactorial or . Once identified, these types of hypoglycemia are readily reversed and prevented, and the underlying disease becomes the primary problem. Not enough cortisol, such as in , not enough glucagon, or not enough epinephrine can result in low blood sugar. This is a more common cause in children. Like most animal tissues, brain depends primarily on glucose for fuel in most circumstances. A limited amount of glucose can be derived from stored in , but it is consumed within minutes. For most practical purposes, the brain is dependent on a continual supply of glucose diffusing from the blood into the interstitial tissue within the and into the themselves. Therefore, if the amount of glucose supplied by the blood falls, the brain is one of the first organs affected. In most people, subtle reduction of mental efficiency can be observed when the glucose falls below 3.6 mmol/l (65 mg/dl). Impairment of action and judgment usually becomes obvious below 2.2 mmol/l (40 mg/dl). Seizures may occur as the glucose falls further. As blood glucose levels fall below 0.55 mmol/l (10 mg/dl), most neurons become electrically silent and nonfunctional, resulting in . These brain effects are collectively referred to as . The importance of an adequate supply of glucose to the brain is apparent from the number of nervous, hormonal, and metabolic responses to a falling glucose level. Most of these are defensive or adaptive, tending to raise the blood sugar by and or provide alternative fuels. If the blood sugar level falls too low, the liver converts a storage of glycogen into glucose and releases it into the bloodstream, to prevent the person going into a , for a short time. Brief or mild hypoglycemia produces no lasting effects on the brain, though it can temporarily alter brain responses to additional hypoglycemia. Prolonged, severe hypoglycemia can produce lasting damage of a wide range. This can include impairment of cognitive function, motor control, or even consciousness. The likelihood of permanent brain damage from any given instance of severe hypoglycemia is difficult to estimate and depends on a multitude of factors such as age, recent blood and brain glucose experience, concurrent problems such as , and availability of alternative fuels. Prior hypoglycemia also blunts the counter-regulatory response to future hypoglycemia. While the mechanism leading to blunted counterregulation is unknown several have been proposed. Those type 1 diabetics found ""dead in bed"" in the morning after suspected severe hypoglycemia are often found to have had some underlying coronary pathology that led to an induced fatal heart attack. In 2010, a case report was published demonstrating the first known case of an individual found ""dead in bed"" whilst wearing a , which provided a history of glucose levels before the fatal event; the person had suffered a severe hypoglycemic incident, and while the authors described only a ""minimal counter-regulatory response"", they stated no ""anatomic abnormalities"" were observed during autopsy. The vast majority of symptomatic hypoglycemic episodes results in no detectable permanent harm. The glucose level that defines hypoglycemia is variable. In diabetics a level below 3.9  (70 mg/dl) is diagnostic. In adults without diabetes, symptoms related to low blood sugar, low blood sugar at the time of symptoms, and improvement when blood sugar is restored to normal confirm the diagnosis. This is known as the . Otherwise, a level below 2.8 mmol/l (50 mg/dl) after not eating or following exercise may be used. In newborns, a level below 2.2 mmol/l (40 mg/dl) or less than 3.3 mmol/l (60 mg/dl) if symptoms are present indicates hypoglycemia. Other tests that may be useful in determining the cause include insulin and C peptide levels in the blood. , a high blood sugar level, is the opposite condition. Throughout a 24‑hour period, blood plasma glucose levels are generally maintained between 4 and 8 mmol/l (72 and 144 mg/dl). Although 3.3 or 3.9 mmol/l (60 or 70 mg/dl) is commonly cited as the lower limit of normal glucose, symptoms of hypoglycemia usually do not occur until 2.8 to 3.0 mmol/l (50 to 54 mg/dl). In cases of recurrent hypoglycemia with severe symptoms, the best method of excluding dangerous conditions is often a diagnostic fast. This is usually conducted in the hospital, and the duration depends on the age of the person and response to the fast. A healthy adult can usually maintain a glucose level above 2.8 mmol/l (50 mg/dl) for 72 hours, a child for 36 hours, and an infant for 24 hours. The purpose of the fast is to determine whether the person can maintain his or her blood glucose as long as normal, and can respond to fasting with the appropriate metabolic changes. At the end of the fast, insulin should be nearly undetectable and ketosis should be fully established. The person's blood glucose levels are monitored and a critical specimen is obtained if the glucose falls. Despite its unpleasantness and expense, a diagnostic fast may be the only effective way to confirm or refute a number of serious forms of hypoglycemia, especially those involving excessive insulin. The precise level of glucose considered low enough to define hypoglycemia is dependent on the measurement method, the age of the person, presence or absence of effects, and the purpose of the definition. While no disagreement exists as to the normal range of blood sugar, debate continues as to what degree of hypoglycemia warrants medical evaluation or treatment, or can cause harm. Deciding whether a blood glucose in the borderline range of 2.5–4.2 mmol/l (45–75 mg/dl) represents clinically problematic hypoglycemia is not always simple. This leads people to use different ""cutoff levels"" of glucose in different contexts and for different purposes. Because of all the variations, the Endocrine Society recommends that a diagnosis of hypoglycemia as a problem for an individual be based on the combination of a low glucose level and evidence of adverse effects. Glucose concentrations are expressed as millimoles per (mmol/l or mM) in most of the world, and milligrams per deciliter (mg/dl or mg/100 ml) in Lebanon, the United States, Japan, Portugal, Spain, France, Belgium, Egypt, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Colombia, India, and Israel. Glucose concentrations expressed as mg/dl can be converted to mmol/l by dividing by 18.0 g/dmol (the of glucose). For example, a glucose concentration of 90 mg/dl is 5.0 mmol/l or 5.0 mM. The circumstances of hypoglycemia provide most of the clues to diagnosis. Circumstances include the age of the person, time of day, time since last meal, previous episodes, nutritional status, physical and mental development, drugs or toxins (especially insulin or other diabetes drugs), diseases of other organ systems, family history, and response to treatment. When hypoglycemia occurs repeatedly, a record or ""diary"" of the spells over several months, noting the circumstances of each spell (time of day, relation to last meal, nature of last meal, response to carbohydrate, and so forth) may be useful in recognizing the nature and cause of the hypoglycemia. Blood glucose levels discussed in this article are levels measured by standard, automated methods used in . For clinical purposes, plasma and serum levels are similar enough to be interchangeable. plasma or serum levels are slightly higher than levels, and levels are typically in between. This difference between arterial and venous levels is small in the fasting state, but is amplified and can be greater than 10% in the postprandial state. Whole blood glucose levels (e.g., by fingerprick ), though, are about 10–15% lower than venous plasma levels. Furthermore, available glucose meters are only warranted to be accurate to within 15% of a simultaneous laboratory value under optimal conditions, and home use in the investigation of hypoglycemia is fraught with misleadingly low numbers. In other words, a meter glucose reading of 39 mg/dl could be properly obtained from a person whose laboratory serum glucose was 53 mg/dl; even wider variations can occur with ""real world"" home use. Two other factors significantly affect glucose measurement: and delay after . The disparity between venous and whole blood concentrations is greater when the hematocrit is high, as in newborn infants, or adults with . High neonatal hematocrits are particularly likely to confound glucose measurement by meter. Second, unless the specimen is drawn into a tube or processed immediately to separate the serum or plasma from the cells, the measurable glucose will be gradually lowered by metabolism of the glucose at a rate around 7 mg/dl/h, or even more in the presence of . The delay that occurs when blood is drawn at a satellite site and transported to a central laboratory hours later for routine processing is a common cause of mildly low glucose levels in general chemistry panels. Children's blood sugar levels are often slightly lower than adults'. Overnight fasting glucose levels are below 3.9 mmol/l (70 mg/dl) in 5% of healthy adults, but up to 5% of children can be below 3.3 mmol/l (60 mg/dl) in the morning fasting state. As the duration of fasting is extended, a higher percentage of infants and children will have mildly low plasma glucose levels, typically without symptoms. The normal range of newborn blood sugars continues to be debated. Newborns' brains are thought to be able to use alternate fuels when glucose levels are low more readily than adults. Experts continue to debate the significance and risk of such levels, though the trend has been to recommend maintenance of glucose levels above 60–70 mg/dl the first day after birth. represents a special case with respect to the relationship of measured glucose and hypoglycemic symptoms for several reasons. First, although home glucose meter readings are often misleading, the probability that a low reading, whether accompanied by symptoms or not, represents real hypoglycemia is much higher in a person who takes insulin than in someone who does not. The following is a brief list of hormones and metabolites that may be measured in a critical sample. Not all tests are checked on every person. A ""basic version"" would include insulin, cortisol, and electrolytes, with C-peptide and drug screen for adults and growth hormone in children. The value of additional specific tests depends on the most likely diagnoses for an individual person, based on the circumstances described above. Many of these levels change within minutes, especially if glucose is given, and there no value exists in measuring them after the hypoglycemia is reversed. Others, especially those lower in the list, remain abnormal even after hypoglycemia is reversed, and can be usefully measured even if a critical specimen is missed. Part of the value of the critical sample may simply be the proof that the symptoms are indeed due to hypoglycemia. More often, measurement of certain hormones and metabolites at the time of hypoglycemia indicates which organs and body systems are responding appropriately and which are functioning abnormally. For example, when the blood glucose is low, hormones that raise the glucose level should be rising and insulin secretion should be completely suppressed. It can also be mistaken for . The most effective methods of preventing further episodes of hypoglycemia depend on the cause. The risk of further episodes of diabetic hypoglycemia can often be reduced by lowering the dose of insulin or other medications, or by more meticulous attention to blood-sugar balance during unusual hours, higher levels of exercise, or decreasing alcohol intake. Many of the inborn errors of metabolism require avoidance or shortening of fasting intervals, or extra carbohydrates. For the more severe disorders, such as type 1 glycogen storage disease, this may be supplied in the form of every few hours or by continuous gastric infusion. Several treatments are used for , depending on the exact form and severity. Some forms of congenital hyperinsulinism respond to or . Surgical removal of the overactive part of the pancreas is curative with minimal risk when hyperinsulinism is focal or due to a benign insulin-producing tumor of the pancreas. When congenital hyperinsulinism is diffuse and refractory to medications, near-total pancreatectomy may be the treatment of last resort, but is less consistently effective and fraught with more complications. Hypoglycemia due to hormone deficiencies such as hypopituitarism or adrenal insufficiency usually ceases when the appropriate hormone is replaced. Hypoglycemia due to dumping syndrome and other postsurgical conditions is best dealt with by altering diet. Including fat and protein with carbohydrates may slow digestion and reduce early insulin secretion. Some forms of this respond to treatment with an , which slows digestion. Reactive hypoglycemia with demonstrably low blood-glucose levels is most often a predictable nuisance that can be avoided by consuming fat and protein with carbohydrates, by adding morning or afternoon snacks, and reducing alcohol intake. Idiopathic postprandial syndrome without demonstrably low glucose levels at the time of symptoms can be more of a management challenge. Many people find improvement by changing eating patterns (smaller meals, avoiding excessive sugar, mixed meals rather than carbohydrates by themselves), reducing intake of stimulants such as , or by making lifestyle changes to reduce stress. Treatment of some forms of hypoglycemia, such as in diabetes, involves immediately raising the blood sugar to normal through the eating of carbohydrates such as sugars, determining the cause, and taking measures to hopefully prevent future episodes. However, this treatment is not optimal in other forms, such as , where rapid carbohydrate ingestion may lead to a further hypoglycemic episode. Blood glucose can be raised to normal within minutes by taking (or receiving) 10–20 g of . It can be taken as food or drink if the person is conscious and able to swallow. This amount of carbohydrate is contained in about 3–4 ounces (100–120 ml) of orange, apple, or grape juice, although fruit juices contain a higher proportion of fructose, which is more slowly metabolized than pure dextrose. Alternatively, about 4–5 ounces (120–150 ml) of regular (not sugar-free) soda may also work, as will about one slice of bread, about four crackers, or about one serving of most starchy foods. Starch is quickly digested to glucose (unless the person is taking ), but adding fat or protein retards digestion. Symptoms should begin to improve within 5 minutes, though full recovery may take 10–20 minutes. Overfeeding does not speed recovery, and if the person has diabetes, it will simply produce afterwards. A mnemonic used by the and others is the ""rule of 15"" – consuming 15 grams of carbohydrate followed by a 15-minute wait, repeated if glucose remains low (variable by individual, sometimes 70 mg/dl). If a person has such severe effects of hypoglycemia that they cannot (due to combativeness) or should not (due to seizures or unconsciousness) be given anything by mouth, medical personnel such as paramedics, or in-hospital personnel can give intravenous dextrose, concentrations varying depending on age (infants are given 2 ml/kg dextrose 10%, children are given dextrose 25%, and adults are given dextrose 50%). Care must be taken in giving these solutions because they can cause skin necrosis if the IV is infiltrated, sclerosis of veins, and many other fluid and electrolyte disturbances if administered incorrectly. If IV access cannot be established, the person can be given 1 to 2 mg of glucagon in an . If a person has less severe effects, and is conscious with the ability to swallow, medical personal may administer gelatinous oral glucose. The soft drink has been used for hypoglycemia in the United Kingdom, but it has recently replaced much of its glucose with artificial sweeteners, which do not treat hypoglycemia. One situation where starch may be less effective than glucose or sucrose is when a person is taking acarbose. Since acarbose and other prevent starch and other sugars from being broken down into that can be absorbed by the body, people taking these medications should consume monosaccharide-containing foods such as glucose tablets, honey, or juice to reverse hypoglycemia. Hypoglycemia was first discovered by when he was working with on purifying insulin in 1922. Collip was asked to develop an assay to measure the activity of insulin. He first injected insulin into a rabbit, and then measured the reduction in blood-glucose levels. Measuring blood glucose was a time-consuming step. Collip observed that if he injected rabbits with a too large a dose of insulin, the rabbits began convulsing, went into a coma, and then died. This observation simplified his assay. He defined one unit of insulin as the amount necessary to induce this convulsing hypoglycemic reaction in a rabbit. Collip later found he could save money, and rabbits, by injecting them with glucose once they were convulsing. The word ""hypoglycemia"" is hypoglycaemia or hypoglycæmia.

Diabetes and exercise: When to monitor your blood sugar Our general interest e-newsletter keeps you up to date on a wide variety of health topics. Diabetes and exercise: When to monitor your blood sugar Exercise is an important part of any diabetes treatment plan. To avoid potential problems, check your blood sugar before, during and after exercise. Exercise is a crucial component of diabetes management. Exercise can help you: But diabetes and exercise pose unique challenges, too. To exercise safely, you'll need to track your blood sugar before, during and after physical activity. This will show you how your body responds to exercise, which can help you prevent potentially dangerous blood sugar fluctuations. Before exercise: Check your blood sugar before your workout Before jumping into a fitness program, get your doctor's OK to exercise — especially if you've been inactive. Ask your doctor how activities you're contemplating might affect your blood sugar. Your doctor can also suggest the best time to exercise and explain the potential impact of medications on your blood sugar as you become more active. For the best health benefits, experts recommend at least 150 minutes a week of moderately intense physical activities such as: Experts also recommend that children — even those with type 1 diabetes — participate in at least 60 minutes of moderate to vigorous activity every day. If you're taking insulin or other medications that can cause low blood sugar (hypoglycemia), test your blood sugar 15 to 30 minutes before exercising. If you don't take medications for your diabetes or you don't use medications commonly linked to low blood sugar levels, you probably won't need to take any special precautions prior to exercising. Check with your doctor. Below are some general guidelines for pre-exercise blood sugar levels. The measurements are expressed in milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL) or millimoles per liter (mmol/L). Your blood sugar may be too low to exercise safely. Eat a small snack containing 15 to 30 grams of carbohydrates, such as fruit juice, fruit, crackers or even glucose tablets before you begin your workout. You're good to go. For most people, this is a safe pre-exercise blood sugar range. This is a caution zone — your blood sugar may be too high to exercise safely. Before exercising, test your urine for ketones — substances made when your body breaks down fat for energy. The presence of ketones indicates that your body doesn't have enough insulin to control your blood sugar. If you exercise when you have a high level of ketones, you risk ketoacidosis — a serious complication of diabetes that needs immediate treatment. Instead of exercising immediately, take measures to correct the high blood sugar levels and wait to exercise until your ketone test indicates an absence of ketones in your urine. During exercise: Watch for symptoms of low blood sugar During exercise, low blood sugar is sometimes a concern. If you're planning a long workout, check your blood sugar every 30 minutes — especially if you're trying a new activity or increasing the intensity or duration of your workout. Checking every half-hour or so lets you know if your blood sugar level is stable, rising or falling, and whether it's safe to keep exercising. This may be difficult if you're participating in outdoor activities or sports. But, this precaution is necessary until you know how your blood sugar responds to changes in your exercise habits. Your blood sugar is 70 mg/dL (3.9 mmol/L) or lower Eat or drink something (with approximately 15 grams of fast-acting carbohydrate) to raise your blood sugar level, such as: Glucose tablets or gel (check the label to see how many grams of carbohydrate these contain) 1/2 cup (4 ounces/118 milliliters) of regular (NON-diet) soft drink Hard candy, jelly beans or candy corn (check the label to see how many grams of carbohydrate these contain) Recheck your blood sugar 15 minutes later. If it's still too low, have another 15 gram carbohydrate serving and test again 15 minutes later. Repeat as needed until your blood sugar reaches at least 70 mg/dL (3.9 mmol/L). If you haven't finished your workout, you can continue once your blood sugar returns to a safe range. Check your blood sugar as soon as you finish exercising and again several times during the next few hours. Exercise draws on reserve sugar stored in your muscles and liver. As your body rebuilds these stores, it takes sugar from your blood. The more strenuous your workout, the longer your blood sugar will be affected. Low blood sugar is possible even four to eight hours after exercise. Having a snack with slower-acting carbohydrates, such as a granola bar or trail mix, after your workout can help prevent a drop in your blood sugar. If you do have low blood sugar after exercise, eat a small carbohydrate-containing snack, such as fruit, crackers or glucose tablets, or drink a half-cup (4 ounces/118 milliliters) of fruit juice. Exercise is beneficial to your health in many ways, but if you have diabetes, testing your blood sugar before, during and after exercise may be just as important as the exercise itself.

Exercise: A drug-free approach to lowering high blood pressure Our general interest e-newsletter keeps you up to date on a wide variety of health topics. Exercise: A drug-free approach to lowering high blood pressure Having high blood pressure and not getting enough exercise are closely related. Discover how small changes in your daily routine can make a big difference. Your risk of high blood pressure (hypertension) increases with age, but getting some exercise can make a big difference. And if your blood pressure is already high, exercise can help you control it. Don't think you've got to run a marathon or join a gym. Instead, start slow and work more physical activity into your daily routine. How are high blood pressure and exercise connected? Regular physical activity makes your heart stronger. A stronger heart can pump more blood with less effort. If your heart can work less to pump, the force on your arteries decreases, lowering your blood pressure. Becoming more active can lower your systolic blood pressure — the top number in a blood pressure reading — by an average of 4 to 9 millimeters of mercury (mm Hg). That's as good as some blood pressure medications. For some people, getting some exercise is enough to reduce the need for blood pressure medication. If your blood pressure is at a desirable level — less than 120/80 mm Hg — exercise can help prevent it from rising as you age. Regular exercise also helps you maintain a healthy weight — another important way to control blood pressure. But to keep your blood pressure low, you need to keep exercising on a regular basis. It takes about one to three months for regular exercise to have an impact on your blood pressure. The benefits last only as long as you continue to exercise. Aerobic activity can be an effective way to control high blood pressure. But flexibility and strengthening exercises such as lifting weights are also important parts of an overall fitness plan. You don't need to spend hours in the gym every day to benefit from aerobic activity. Simply adding moderate physical activities to your daily routine will help. Any physical activity that increases your heart and breathing rates is considered aerobic activity, including: Household chores, such as mowing the lawn, raking leaves, gardening or scrubbing the floor The Department of Health and Human Services recommends getting at least 150 minutes of moderate aerobic activity or 75 minutes of vigorous aerobic activity a week, or a combination of moderate and vigorous activity. Aim for at least 30 minutes of aerobic activity most days of the week. If you can't set aside that much time at once, remember that shorter bursts of activity count, too. You can break up your workout into three 10-minute sessions of aerobic exercise and get the same benefit as one 30-minute session. Also, if you sit for several hours a day, try to reduce the amount of time you spend sitting. Research has found that too much sedentary time can contribute to many health conditions. Aim for five to 10 minutes of low-intensity physical activity — such as getting up to get a drink of water or going on a short walk — each hour. Consider setting a reminder in your email calendar or on your smartphone. Weight training can cause a temporary increase in blood pressure during exercise. This increase can be dramatic, depending on how much weight you lift. But weightlifting can also have long-term benefits to blood pressure that outweigh the risk of a temporary spike for most people. And it can improve other aspects of cardiovascular health that can help to reduce overall cardiovascular risk. The Department of Health and Human Services recommends incorporating strength training exercises of all the major muscle groups into a fitness routine at least two times a week. If you have high blood pressure and you'd like to include weight training in your fitness program, remember: Using proper form and technique when weight training reduces the risk of injury. Holding your breath during exertion can cause dangerous spikes in blood pressure. Instead, breathe easily and continuously during each exercise. Heavier weights require more strain, which can cause a greater increase in blood pressure. You can challenge your muscles with lighter weights by increasing the number of repetitions you do. Stop your activity right away if you become severely out of breath or dizzy, or if you experience chest pain or pressure. If you have high blood pressure, get your doctor's OK before adding weight training exercises to your fitness routine. Sometimes it's best to check with your doctor before you jump into an exercise program, especially if: You're a man older than age 45 or a woman older than age 55. You have a chronic health condition, such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease or lung disease. You have a family history of heart-related problems before age 55 in men and age 65 in women. You feel pain or discomfort in your chest, jaw, neck or arms during activity. You're unsure if you're in good health or you haven't been exercising regularly. If you take any medication regularly, ask your doctor if exercising will make it work differently or change its side effects — or if your medication will affect the way your body reacts to exercise. To reduce the risk of injury while exercising, start slowly. Remember to warm up before you exercise and cool down afterward. Build up the intensity of your workouts gradually. Stop exercising and seek immediate medical care if you experience any warning signs during exercise, including: The only way to detect high blood pressure is to keep track of your blood pressure readings. Have your blood pressure checked at each doctor's visit, or use a home blood pressure monitor. If you already have high blood pressure, home monitoring can let you know if your fitness routine is helping to lower your blood pressure, and may make it so you don't need to visit your doctor to have your blood pressure checked as often. Home blood pressure monitoring isn't a substitute for visits to your doctor, and home blood pressure monitors may have some limitations. If you decide to monitor your blood pressure at home, you'll get the most accurate readings if you check your blood pressure before you exercise. AskMayoExpert.

Our general interest e-newsletter keeps you up to date on a wide variety of health topics. If you have diabetes, you're at increased risk of various bone and joint disorders. Certain factors, such as nerve damage (diabetic neuropathy), arterial disease and obesity, may contribute to these problems — but often the cause isn't clear. Learn more about various bone and joint disorders, including symptoms and treatment options. Charcot (shahr-KOH) joint, also called neuropathic arthropathy, occurs when a joint deteriorates because of nerve damage — a common complication of diabetes. Charcot joint primarily affects the feet. You might have numbness and tingling or loss of sensation in the affected joints. They may become warm, red and swollen and become unstable or deformed. The involved joint may not be very painful despite its appearance. If detected early, progression of the disease can be slowed. Limiting weight-bearing activities and use of orthotic supports to the affected joint and surrounding structures can help. Diabetic hand syndrome, also called diabetic cheiroarthropathy, is a disorder in which the skin on the hands becomes waxy and thickened. Eventually finger movement is limited. What causes diabetic hand syndrome isn't known. It's most common in people who've had diabetes for a long time. You may be unable to fully extend your fingers or press your palms together flat. Better management of blood glucose levels and physical therapy can slow the progress of this condition, but the limited mobility may not be reversible. Osteoporosis is a disorder that causes bones to become weak and prone to fracture. People who have type 1 diabetes have an increased risk of osteoporosis. Osteoporosis rarely causes symptoms in the early stages. Eventually, when the disease is more advanced, you may experience loss of height, stooped posture or bone fractures. A healthy lifestyle, including weight-bearing exercise, such as walking, and eating a balanced diet rich in calcium and vitamin D — including supplements if needed — are the best ways to address this condition. In some patients with more severe or advanced disease, medications to prevent further bone loss or increase bone mass may be needed. Osteoarthritis is a joint disorder characterized by the breakdown of joint cartilage. It may affect any joint in your body. People who have type 2 diabetes have an increased risk of osteoarthritis, likely due to obesity — a risk factor for type 2 diabetes — rather than to the diabetes itself. Osteoarthritis may cause joint pain, swelling and stiffness, as well as loss of joint flexibility or movement. Treatment involves exercising and maintaining a healthy weight, caring for and resting the affected joint, physical therapy, medications for pain, and surgery such as knee or hip replacement (joint arthroplasty). Complementary treatments — such as acupuncture and massage — also may be helpful for managing pain. Diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis (DISH), also called Forestier disease, is a hardening of tendons and ligaments that commonly affects the spine. DISH may be associated with type 2 diabetes, perhaps due to insulin or insulin-like growth factors that promote new bone growth. You may experience pain, stiffness or decreased range of motion in any affected part of your body. If DISH affects your spine, you may experience stiffness in your back or neck. Treatment involves managing symptoms, usually with pain relievers (Tylenol, others), and in rare cases may require surgery to remove bone that has grown due to the condition. Dupuytren's contracture is a deformity in which one or more fingers are bent toward the palm. It's caused by thickening and scarring of connective tissue in the palm of the hand and in the fingers. Dupuytren's contracture is common in people who've had diabetes for a long time, perhaps due to the metabolic changes related to diabetes. You may notice thickening of the skin on the palm of your hand. Eventually, you may not be able to fully straighten one or more fingers. If you have pain, a steroid injection may help by reducing inflammation. Surgery, collagenase enzyme injection and a minimally invasive technique called aponeurotomy to break apart the thick tissue are other options if the condition prevents you from being able to grasp objects. Frozen shoulder is a condition characterized by shoulder pain and limited range of motion. It typically affects only one shoulder. Although the cause is often unknown, diabetes is a common risk factor. Frozen shoulder causes pain or tenderness with shoulder movement, stiffness of the joint, and decreased range of motion. If started early, aggressive physical therapy can help preserve movement and range of motion in the joint. Additional types of neuropathy.

Exercise: A drug-free approach to lowering high blood pressure Our general interest e-newsletter keeps you up to date on a wide variety of health topics. Exercise: A drug-free approach to lowering high blood pressure Having high blood pressure and not getting enough exercise are closely related. Discover how small changes in your daily routine can make a big difference. Your risk of high blood pressure (hypertension) increases with age, but getting some exercise can make a big difference. And if your blood pressure is already high, exercise can help you control it. Don't think you've got to run a marathon or join a gym. Instead, start slow and work more physical activity into your daily routine. How are high blood pressure and exercise connected? Regular physical activity makes your heart stronger. A stronger heart can pump more blood with less effort. If your heart can work less to pump, the force on your arteries decreases, lowering your blood pressure. Becoming more active can lower your systolic blood pressure — the top number in a blood pressure reading — by an average of 4 to 9 millimeters of mercury (mm Hg). That's as good as some blood pressure medications. For some people, getting some exercise is enough to reduce the need for blood pressure medication. If your blood pressure is at a desirable level — less than 120/80 mm Hg — exercise can help prevent it from rising as you age. Regular exercise also helps you maintain a healthy weight — another important way to control blood pressure. But to keep your blood pressure low, you need to keep exercising on a regular basis. It takes about one to three months for regular exercise to have an impact on your blood pressure. The benefits last only as long as you continue to exercise. Aerobic activity can be an effective way to control high blood pressure. But flexibility and strengthening exercises such as lifting weights are also important parts of an overall fitness plan. You don't need to spend hours in the gym every day to benefit from aerobic activity. Simply adding moderate physical activities to your daily routine will help. Any physical activity that increases your heart and breathing rates is considered aerobic activity, including: Household chores, such as mowing the lawn, raking leaves, gardening or scrubbing the floor The Department of Health and Human Services recommends getting at least 150 minutes of moderate aerobic activity or 75 minutes of vigorous aerobic activity a week, or a combination of moderate and vigorous activity. Aim for at least 30 minutes of aerobic activity most days of the week. If you can't set aside that much time at once, remember that shorter bursts of activity count, too. You can break up your workout into three 10-minute sessions of aerobic exercise and get the same benefit as one 30-minute session. Also, if you sit for several hours a day, try to reduce the amount of time you spend sitting. Research has found that too much sedentary time can contribute to many health conditions. Aim for five to 10 minutes of low-intensity physical activity — such as getting up to get a drink of water or going on a short walk — each hour. Consider setting a reminder in your email calendar or on your smartphone. Weight training can cause a temporary increase in blood pressure during exercise. This increase can be dramatic, depending on how much weight you lift. But weightlifting can also have long-term benefits to blood pressure that outweigh the risk of a temporary spike for most people. And it can improve other aspects of cardiovascular health that can help to reduce overall cardiovascular risk. The Department of Health and Human Services recommends incorporating strength training exercises of all the major muscle groups into a fitness routine at least two times a week. If you have high blood pressure and you'd like to include weight training in your fitness program, remember: Using proper form and technique when weight training reduces the risk of injury. Holding your breath during exertion can cause dangerous spikes in blood pressure. Instead, breathe easily and continuously during each exercise. Heavier weights require more strain, which can cause a greater increase in blood pressure. You can challenge your muscles with lighter weights by increasing the number of repetitions you do. Stop your activity right away if you become severely out of breath or dizzy, or if you experience chest pain or pressure. If you have high blood pressure, get your doctor's OK before adding weight training exercises to your fitness routine. Sometimes it's best to check with your doctor before you jump into an exercise program, especially if: You're a man older than age 45 or a woman older than age 55. You have a chronic health condition, such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease or lung disease. You have a family history of heart-related problems before age 55 in men and age 65 in women. You feel pain or discomfort in your chest, jaw, neck or arms during activity. You're unsure if you're in good health or you haven't been exercising regularly. If you take any medication regularly, ask your doctor if exercising will make it work differently or change its side effects — or if your medication will affect the way your body reacts to exercise.

Exercise is one of the best ways to help keep your diabetes under control. Many people say they feel better when they get regular exercise. Exercise is important for everyone. If you have diabetes, regular activity can make you feel better and help prevent complications. Research has shown that exercise offers many health benefits. They include: Raising your good cholesterol and lowering your bad cholesterol Preventing falls and improving memory in older adults If you haven’t been active, talk with your healthcare team before you begin. People with diabetes and eye or foot problems may need to change certain exercises. Or not do some types of exercise. Start out slowly. Try adding more movement to your daily routine. Every little bit helps. Here are some suggestions: Other types of exercise that are good for people with diabetes include swimming, aerobics, bicycling, skating, tennis, and basketball. These activities work your large muscles, raise your heart rate, and increase how much air your lungs can hold. These are important fitness goals. Strength training exercises use hand weights, elastic bands, or weight machines. These exercises can help strengthen and build muscle. Stretching helps you stay flexible and prevents soreness. As you get stronger and can do more, you can add a few extra minutes to your physical activity. If you have pain, stop your activity until the pain goes away. If it comes back, call your healthcare provider right away. Do some type of physical activity each day. Walking 10 or 20 minutes every day is better than 1 hour just once a week. Try not to go more than 30 minutes during the day without some movement or light physical activity. If you have certain diabetes-related problems, don't do certain kinds of physical activity. Talk with your healthcare provider before doing exercise with heavy weights if you have blood vessel or eye problems. Also talk with your provide if your blood pressure is not under control. If you have nerve damage from diabetes, you may not be able to tell if you’ve injured your feet during exercise. Always check your blood sugar before you exercise. This is especially true if you take insulin or certain medicines by mouth (oral). Physical activity can lower your blood glucose too much and lead to hypoglycemia. Hypoglycemia can occur during exercise, after, or much later. Signs of hypoglycemia include: Be careful about exercising if you have recently skipped a meal. And if your blood glucose level is below 100, have a small snack first. If your blood glucose is higher than 300, physical activity might drive it higher. Wait until your glucose level is lower before exercising. Also don't exercise if your fasting blood glucose is higher than 250 and if you have ketones in your urine. Ask your healthcare provider about the best times for you to exercise. Another tip for exercise is to wear cotton socks and well-fitted, comfortable athletic shoes. After exercise, look closely at your feet for signs of irritation, broken skin, blisters, or other injuries. Drink plenty of fluids during exercise. Dehydration can affect your blood glucose levels. If you're having fun doing physical activities you really like, you'll be more likely to exercise each day.",8,best apps daily activity exercise diabetes,-0.10566103458404541,12

Meanwhile, the app tracks daily weights, food intake, calories, daily exercise, and daily steps. Daily weigh-ins and food logging are central to the service and happen to be healthy practices when your goal is improving weight or fitness. We found that Noom’s program requires an active commitment of about 10-15 minutes per day. The service isn’t too big of a burden for even the busiest people to incorporate it into their routine. In fact, if you have a smart scale, you can feed your daily measurement automatically into Noom’s program, saving a little time each day. With Noom, you’re also not striving to lose weight and get healthier all by yourself. You’ll get a one-on-one goal coach, as well as a virtual group and group leader to support you along the way. Noom takes your privacy seriously and uses TLS encryption to protect your data. Noom does upload the data from your app to its servers to give coaches access to your information, in order for them to provide good service. This includes weigh-ins, exercises, and logged meals. The cost of depends on how many months you choose in your subscription. The longer your subscription, the more you save. The 3-month auto-recurring plan is discounted to $129, which equates to $43 per month. An eight-month plan is discounted from $480 to $179 (roughly equating to $23 per month). When purchasing an annual auto-recurring plan, you’ll make one payment of $199, bringing your effective per-month cost to only $16.59. Noom’s pricing is a little difficult to nail down because of frequent discount opportunities. The company often offers a two-week free trial. Noom tells you up-front that each free trial costs the company about $18. There is an option to contribute a donation to help offset this cost. If you feel like doing so, you can choose to pay as little as $3, but the free option is also available. You can cancel at any time during the trial period, but we believe Noom could make the process more straightforward. To cancel, you have to send a message to your goal specialist or the robotic assistant through the app. Then they will send you a link to cancel. This seems unnecessarily complicated. Deleting the app from your phone does not cancel your plan. Noom is also very clear about not offering refunds. Your subscription automatically renews at the end of your billing cycle. If you forget to cancel, you have to wait until the end of the next billing cycle to do so. This is also true when taking advantage of the free trial period; pay close attention to the billing details when signing up. You have to provide credit card information at this time, even when choosing the free option. Make note of the billing dates that are clearly laid out from the beginning because, if you choose to cancel after the trial period but mistake the dates, you’ll be automatically charged. Noom does not have an official policy concerning these forms of payment. In certain situations, the IRS may allow you to use your FSA or HSA to pay for Noom, but this usually requires a letter of medical necessity from your physician. Some health insurance providers may cover weight loss programs like Noom, but, again, only when deemed medically necessary by your doctor. Check with your insurance company to be sure. Noom’s main product is its personalized weight loss plan, which customizes to you based on your answers in the initial screening questionnaire. Your answers help Noom provide you with an expected date for hitting your target weight as well as some insight into how you think and communicate. The plan includes exercise tracking and food tracking features, as well as access to weight loss coaches and daily curriculum. As mentioned above, this is a monthly membership, the cost of which depends on how many months you sign up for. You also have the option to purchase add-ons at an additional cost. When it comes to tracking, Noom uses a color-coded system to help you balance your calorie intake. A red, yellow, and green classification system makes you think about what you’re eating. You may question whether or not you want to use so many of your daily calories on red labeled foods when green foods are much healthier. Green foods consist mostly of fruits and veggies, while yellow foods include those that aren’t as nutrient-dense. Lean meat, low-fat milk, and grains like couscous and quinoa are all examples of yellow foods. Red foods are those that you should eat sparingly, such as bacon, salami, fries, and sugary treats. The Noom app also tracks your exercise and then accounts for the calories burned in your daily total. In this respect, it’s similar to other calorie trackers like MyFitnessPal, though the color-coded food system gives the Noom tracker an edge over the competition. Noom’s system is a little more restrictive than the points system used by Weight Watchers/WW. Technically, nothing is off-limits with Noom, just as with WW. But because WW has a list of “free” foods you can eat, meal planning is a bit easier. Though Noom is rapidly gaining popularity, its database isn’t as large as WW’s. There are also some errors, particularly when using the barcode scanner. That said, the tracking part of the app is very sleek and easy to use compared to some of the other free trackers available. excels in integrating diabetes management. It syncs with iHealth Gluco-Smart to help you keep track of your blood sugar levels throughout the day. You can also input them manually. Noom can help you monitor your blood pressure as well. Noom focuses on using a “universally healthy diet” to help users make important lifestyle changes for managing diabetes. It also provides educational resources for teaching the importance of good nutrition and how this plays an important role in the long-term successful management of diabetes. Noom is the first virtual program recognized as a Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) by the CDC. When you sign up with Noom, a goal coach is assigned to you. They work with you on a one-on-one basis. You are also assigned to a group coach who leads you and your group in discussions and offers regular motivation. Groups are useful for meeting other people using the Noom program and can be a great way to stay motivated. They offer tips and support, but you must actively participate to benefit from them. Your one-on-one goal coach checks in on your progress every week or so, asking if you have any specific goals you want to work on. Some users find that the coaches can be unresponsive at times or offer unrewarding or robotic interactions, but in our testing, this wasn’t the case. Noom provides daily lessons designed to help you identify your mindset toward food and change that mindset, as needed, to allow you to lose weight. These lessons are created by a specialized team with a background in psychology, nutrition, exercise science, and medicine. The lessons themselves are based on behavioral psychology and boast a simple, easy-to-understand presentation. What gives an edge is the daily curriculum focused on changing your behaviors. The curriculum focuses on the science behind weight loss and the idea that it’s crucial for you to change how you think about food. As a company, Noom tries to make the process more enjoyable, and the daily curriculum is clear evidence of that. In addition to Noom’s core program, the company offers add-ons some users may want to purchase. Add-ons include: These add-ons strike us as interesting directions that Noom might further develop in order to improve their impact and efficacy. Right now, for instance, the meal plans don’t seem as personalized as needed in order to achieve their desired benefit. For the moment, Noom’s big contribution is its core service, which we recommend. You can sign up for through its website or app, which is available for iPhone and Android. It’s easy to get started. When you do, you will fill out the questionnaire that asks general information like your age, gender, current weight, and goal weight. The questionnaire also includes other relevant questions focused on your current habits, health concerns, factors that have contributed to your weight gain, and other weight loss programs you’ve tried in the past. Noom uses this information to put together a customized plan. It asks for your email address at the end of the questionnaire. Once you provide this information, you get an estimate as to how long it will take you to meet your goal weight. At this point, you have to commit to signing up for a subscription and provide your payment information. You can choose to take advantage of a two-week free trial during the checkout process if it’s available at the moment. You will still have to enter your payment details so Noom could begin charging you after the trial expires.

c0386d83-eadc-4eca-83b1-62bf7fd5c428,"Exercise Won’t Help 20 Percent of Type 2 Diabetes Patients. Blame Their Genes — Almost 20 percent of people with type 2 diabetes who participate in exercise plans do not see improvements in metabolism due to stubborn genes, according to a new scientific review. Obesity and lack of physical activity are two key risk factors for type 2 diabetes, so doctors often recommend exercise and other lifestyle interventions to prevent or manage the disease. But as many as 1 in 5 people with type 2 diabetes do not see any improvement in blood sugar management when they take part in a supervised exercise program, according to new scientific review published in the Endocrine Society’s . Read More: Can We Improve Health of Diabetes Patients with HIV Model of Care? » A review of scientific literature showed that 15 to 20 percent of study participants with diabetes didn’t see any improvement in their blood sugar control, insulin sensitivity, or muscle mitochondrial density brake, a measurement of the ability to burn fat, study co-author Lauren M. Sparks, Ph.D., of the Translational Research Institute for Metabolism and Diabetes at Florida Hospital and the Sanford-Burnham Medical Research Institute in Orlando, told Healthline. One study of 1,700 people with type 2 diabetes found that 7 percent actually had an adverse response to exercise in the form of greater cardiovascular risk factors, Sparks explained. The research tracked 45 African American and Caucasian adults in their mid-50s who had type 2 diabetes. The volunteers all exercised for nine months, doing weight training and aerobic activities. About 20 percent of participants saw no changes in key measurements like HbA1c (a measure of blood glucose concentration over long periods of time), fat burning ability, Body Mass Index (BMI), and body fat after nine months of exercising. Although the study had a limited sample size, Sparks believes that if the results were scaled to the 30 million people estimated to have type 2 diabetes, they would show that a significant number of people with diabetes are not benefitting from exercise. Researchers are beginning to understand that when a person exercises, there are immediate changes in parts of their genes in response to the experience, explained Sparks. “What happens to these people who don’t respond is that they are not changing the way their DNA is expressed in response to that exercise,” Sparks said. “They are not able to release that brake.” Since DNA is passed from one generation to another, this so called “brake” in the DNA of some type 2 diabetes patients, which halts the response to exercise, is also inherited. Sparks believes researchers may be able to use people’s DNA to discover which genes aren’t responding. Drug companies could ultimately find compounds or drugs to release the “brake.” “The idea is not to replace exercise. The message is, let’s find these people, find out where the brake is, and find a way to release that brake. It could be drugs, other kinds of exercise, a supplement, or a change in diet,” said Sparks, adding that more studies are needed, especially in larger patient populations. Dr. Gerald Bernstein, director of the diabetes management program at the Friedman Diabetes Institute at Mount Sinai medical center in New York, told Healthline that although Sparks’ study was conducted on a small population, it “opens a lot of doors to finding solutions through exercise.” Bernstein said the study raises the following questions for future research: Is the data consistent over a lifetime? Would an exercise non-responder at age 30 be the same at 60, even if he or she continued to exercise over those 30 years? Can repetitive behavior over many years result in gene modification a decade or two later? Bernstein said it is still very important for patients to exercise, provided they work with their doctors. “The better part of therapeutic valor would be for everyone at risk to be in an exercise program for their lifetime, as we do when we brush and floss our teeth,” he said. — Metformin is a prescription drug used to treat type 2 diabetes.

0542e98b-ff58-42bb-abaf-5e84eb9fce9f,"Fighting Diabetes Fatigue to Work Out Can Feel Impossible — Here’s How to Do It Medically reviewed by — — Exercising is an important part of a diabetes treatment plan but can be difficult when you’re experiencing extreme fatigue. Exercise has never been a way of life for Denise Baron. But after being diagnosed with two years ago, Baron now finds a way to make fitness a part of her day. “For me, exercising is never on my top three things to do in life, but nowadays it’s a requirement,” the 49-year old tells Healthline. Like millions of other people who live with, Baron now understands the role plays in managing her symptoms. That said, she’s also familiar with “diabetes fatigue,” a common effect of the condition that can make it challenging to stick with a consistent workout program. Dealing with type 2 diabetes can feel taxing. And when you’re tired all the time, just getting through the day is often all you can manage. Unfortunately, getting more sleep isn’t necessarily the right answer. show that people with type 2 diabetes experience extreme tiredness and fatigue that can disrupt their life and makes it difficult to function. The impact is so significant that experts now refer to this as “.” “Excessive feelings of tiredness or fatigue are commonly associated with diabetes, but the causes may be multifactorial,” explains , PhD, FACSM, and Professor Emerita of Exercise Science. “The most common cause is the rise in blood glucose levels, which can make you feel sluggish and lethargic,” she explains. And she should know. In addition to helping others, Colberg also lives with diabetes. Colberg also points out that people may experience fatigue as the result of some diabetes-related complications, such as kidney disease, or as a side-effect of some medications. It’s no secret that regular exercise is key in managing and preventing several health-related conditions including type 2 diabetes. In fact, the recommends physical activity to all people living with diabetes to manage glycemic control and overall health. In particular, the ADA urges people living with diabetes to interrupt long periods of sitting with light activity by doing 3 minutes of light exercise (like stretches or walking) every 30 minutes. While this recommendation tops the list of ways to manage and treat diabetes, exercising when you’re experiencing diabetes fatigue is often easier said than done. “Fatigue is common among people with diabetes, which can make it difficult to work up the motivation and energy to stay physically active,” explains , an endocrinologist with Kaiser Permanente in Denver. However, exercise is a crucial part of diabetes management. Schroeder says it’s vital that patients come up with ways to integrate exercise into their daily routines. Once you establish a routine, you can gradually increase that activity up to 30 minutes a day — or more — as your body becomes accustomed to it. The first thing to keep in mind, says Colberg, is that doing any physical activity is likely to help you feel better and less tired, even if it’s just taking more daily steps. “Physical movement doesn’t have to be structured exercise sessions to lower your blood glucose or make you feel better in the short run,” she explains. Colberg recommends you start by standing up more, breaking up your sedentary time frequently (by standing, walking around, stretching, or doing any activity for a few minutes every 30 minutes or so), and just moving more all day long. Once the diabetes fatigue starts to lift from doing these activities, you may feel more like engaging in exercises like walking, resistance training, or dancing. As an endocrinologist, Schroeder has extensive experience working with type 2 diabetes and diabetes fatigue. When talking with patients about exercise, she gives them the following advice: “If you start out thinking you need to hit the gym for hours every day to stay fit, you’re more likely to give up before you’ve even begun,” she says. Instead, challenge yourself to work out in small increments. For example, you can walk for 10 minutes, three times a day, to get the recommended 30 minutes of moderate daily exercise. Join a class or make plans to exercise with a friend. “It’s much harder to let fatigue talk you out of a workout when you have a fitness buddy waiting for you or you’ve already committed to participating in a class,” says Schroeder. Activities like gardening can be great exercise — not to mention a good way to get some fresh air. Schroeder also says to consider chores such as vacuuming the house for 15 minutes (which can burn up to 90 calories). “Embracing exercise that also checks items off your to-do list can provide twice the motivation to get active,” she says. Some individuals may need to monitor their blood sugar before, during, and after exercise. Schroeder says exercise will be easier if your blood sugar is in the normal range. In addition, exercise can cause low blood sugars. That’s why you need to talk with your physician about ways to keep your blood sugar in the normal range during and after exercise. Start slow, but aim to build up to the recommended 30 minutes of moderate daily exercise. 4 exercise ideas to get you started at home or outside , a TopLine MD internist certified in obesity and lifestyle medicine, says some forms of exercise may be better than others if you’re dealing with diabetes fatigue. She recommends starting small and slow with physical activity. Even committing to five minutes can make a difference. She recommends (since it incorporates healthy breathing, balance, and strengthening), water exercises, , walking, and seated exercises. And if you’re not ready for fitness activities outside of your home, Schroeder says there are still exercises you can do at home to help increase your physical activity. Here are some movements she recommends to her patients: Keep some hand weights under the couch to fit in a few bicep curls while you binge the latest “House Hunters” marathon. It’s so easy and beneficial. Stand up and march in place during commercial breaks. In the average hour of television, that’s 15 minutes of movement. Do leg lifts in bed. Before you get up in the morning, spend a few minutes lying flat on your back, slowing raising and lowering one leg at a time. Try two sets of 10 repetitions per leg to get your blood flowing and start the day with more energy. Try abdominal crunches. These are also easy to do in bed, and there are many variations to try that can keep them interesting and challenge different muscle groups. Depending on your starting fitness level and medical conditions, it’s important to work with a doctor or trainer in developing a plan that’s right for you. When it comes to working with a professional, Baron agrees it’s helpful to seek information from experts in the fitness field. She now lives an Ayurvedic lifestyle, which she says changed her life for the better. Her physical activity consists of daily walks and bicycle rides every morning for 20 to 40 minutes, stretching every day, and occasionally some gentle yoga. ”My suggestion to those with type 2 diabetes is to find something you love to do and do it often,” says Baron. Make sure to speak with your doctor before starting an exercise program. They can help you determine the most effective way to manage diabetes fatigue so you can incorporate physical activity into your day.

It has many functions, such as allowing your cells to take in sugar from your blood for energy. However, too much insulin can lead to serious health problems. Having high levels, also known as hyperinsulinemia, has been linked to obesity, heart disease and cancer (, , ). High blood insulin levels also cause your cells to become resistant to the hormone’s effects. When you become insulin resistant, your pancreas produces insulin, creating a vicious cycle (). Here are 14 things you can do to lower your insulin levels. Of the three macronutrients — carbs, protein and fat — carbs raise blood sugar and insulin levels the most. For this and other reasons, can be very effective for losing weight and . Many studies have confirmed their ability to lower insulin levels and increase insulin sensitivity, compared to other diets (, , , , ). People with health conditions characterized by insulin resistance, such as metabolic syndrome and polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), may experience a dramatic lowering of insulin with carb restriction. In one study, individuals with metabolic syndrome were randomized to receive either a low-fat or low-carb diet containing 1,500 calories. Insulin levels dropped by an average of 50% in the low-carb group, compared to 19% in the low-fat group (). In another study, when women with PCOS ate a lower-carb diet containing enough calories to maintain their weight, they experienced greater reductions in insulin levels than when they ate a higher-carb diet (). Low-carb diets have been shown to increase insulin sensitivity and reduce insulin levels in people with obesity, diabetes, metabolic syndrome and PCOS. has been credited with preventing insulin and blood sugar spikes after eating. This has been shown to mainly occur when vinegar is taken with high-carb foods (, , ). A small study found that people who took about 2 tablespoons (28 ml) of vinegar with a high-carb meal experienced lower insulin levels and greater feelings of fullness 30 minutes after the meal (). Researchers believed this effect was partly due to vinegar’s ability to delay stomach emptying, leading to a more gradual absorption of sugar into the bloodstream (). Vinegar may help prevent high insulin levels after you consume meals or foods high in carbs. Although the pancreas releases different amounts of insulin depending on the type of food you eat, eating too much of any food at one time can lead to hyperinsulinemia. This is especially a concern in obese people with . In one study, insulin-resistant obese people who consumed a 1,300-calorie meal had twice the increase in insulin as lean people who consumed the same meal. They also experienced nearly twice the increase in insulin as obese people who were considered “metabolically healthy” (). Consuming fewer calories has consistently been shown to increase insulin sensitivity and decrease insulin levels in overweight and obese individuals, regardless of the type of diet they consume (, , , , , , ). One study looked at different weight loss methods in 157 people with metabolic syndrome. The researchers found that fasting insulin levels decreased by 16% in the group that practiced calorie restriction and 12% in the group that practiced portion control (). Reducing calorie intake by portion control or counting calories can lead to lower insulin levels in overweight and obese people with type 2 diabetes or metabolic syndrome. may very well be the most important food to stay away from if you’re trying to lower your insulin levels. In one study where people overate either candy or peanuts, the candy group experienced a 31% increase in fasting insulin levels, compared to a 12% increase in the peanut group (). In another study, when people consumed jams containing high amounts of sugar, their insulin levels rose significantly more than after consuming low-sugar jams (). Fructose is found in table sugar, honey, high-fructose corn syrup, agave and syrup. Consuming large quantities of it promotes insulin resistance, which ultimately drives insulin levels higher (, , ). One study found that people had similar insulin responses after consuming 50 grams of table sugar, honey or high-fructose corn syrup every day for 14 days (). In another study, overweight people who added to their usual diet experienced a 22% increase in fasting insulin levels. In contrast, the group who added artificially sweetened foods to their usual diet experienced a 3% in fasting insulin levels (). A high intake of sugar in any form has been shown to increase insulin levels and promote insulin resistance. Engaging in regular physical activity can have powerful insulin-lowering effects. Aerobic appears to be very effective at increasing insulin sensitivity in people who are obese or have type 2 diabetes (, , , ). One study compared two groups. One performed sustained aerobic exercise, and the other performed high-intensity interval training. The study found that although both groups experienced improvements in fitness, only the group that performed sustained aerobic activity experienced significantly lower insulin levels (). There’s also research showing that resistance training can help decrease insulin levels in older and sedentary adults (, ). Combining aerobic and resistance exercise seems to be the most effective and has been shown to most greatly affect insulin sensitivity and levels (, , ). In a study of 101 breast cancer survivors, those who engaged in a combination of strength-training and endurance exercise for 16 weeks experienced a 27% reduction in insulin levels (). Aerobic exercise, strength training or a combination of both may help increase insulin sensitivity and lower your levels. is a delicious spice loaded with health-promoting antioxidants. Studies in healthy people and those with insulin resistance suggest that taking cinnamon may enhance insulin sensitivity and decrease insulin levels (, , ). In one study, healthy people who consumed about 1.5 teaspoons of cinnamon in rice pudding had significantly lower insulin responses than when they ate rice pudding without cinnamon (). In another small study, young men who consumed a high-sugar drink after taking cinnamon for 14 days experienced lower insulin levels than when they consumed the drink after taking a placebo for 14 days (). It’s important to note that not all studies have found that cinnamon lowers your levels or increases insulin sensitivity. Cinnamon’s effects may vary from person to person (, ). However, including up to one teaspoon (2 grams) per day may provide other health benefits, even if it doesn’t reduce your levels significantly. Some studies have found that adding cinnamon to foods or beverages lowers insulin levels and increases insulin sensitivity. are a major part of many people’s diets. However, research in animals and humans has found that consuming them regularly can lead to several health problems. These include high insulin levels and weight gain (, , ). Furthermore, refined carbs have a high glycemic index. The glycemic index (GI) is a scale that measures a specific food’s capacity to raise blood sugar. Glycemic load takes into account a food’s glycemic index, as well as the amount of digestible carbs contained in a serving. Several studies have compared foods with different glycemic loads to see if they affected insulin levels differently. They found that eating a high-glycemic load food raises your levels more than eating the same portion of a low-glycemic load food, even if the carb contents of the two foods are similar (, , ). In one study, overweight people followed one of two unrestricted-calorie diets for 10 weeks. After a test meal, the high-GI group had higher insulin levels than the low-GI group (). Replacing refined carbs, which are digested and absorbed quickly, with slower-digesting whole foods may help lower insulin levels. In order to reduce insulin levels, it’s important to live an active lifestyle. One study of over 1,600 people found that those who were the most were nearly twice as likely to have metabolic syndrome as those who performed moderate activity at least 150 minutes per week (). Other studies have shown that getting up and walking around, rather than sitting for prolonged periods, can help keep insulin levels from spiking after a meal (, ). A 12-week study in middle-aged sedentary women found that the women who walked for 20 minutes after a large meal had increased insulin sensitivity, compared with women who didn’t walk after a meal. In addition, the walking group became more fit and lost body fat (). Another study looked at 113 overweight men at risk of type 2 diabetes. The group who took the most steps per day had the greatest reduction in insulin levels and lost the most belly fat, compared to the group who took the lowest number of steps daily (). Avoiding prolonged sitting and increasing the amount of time you spend walking or doing other moderate activities can reduce insulin levels. Intermittent fasting has become . Research suggests it may help reduce insulin levels as effectively as daily calorie restriction (). One study found that obese women lost weight and had other health improvements following calorie-restricted intermittent fasting with either liquid or solid meals. However, only the liquid diet significantly reduced fasting insulin levels (). Alternate-day fasting involves fasting or dramatically reducing calories one day and eating normally the following day. Some studies have found it effectively lowers insulin levels (, ). In one study, 26 people who fasted every other day for 22 days experienced an impressive 57% decrease in fasting insulin levels, on average (). Although many people find intermittent fasting beneficial and enjoyable, it doesn’t work for everyone and may cause problems in some people. To find out more about intermittent fasting, read . Intermittent fasting may help reduce insulin levels. However, study results are mixed, and this way of eating may not suit everyone. provides a number of health benefits, including helping with weight loss and . It absorbs water and forms a gel, which slows down the movement of food through the digestive tract. This promotes feelings of fullness and keeps blood sugar and insulin from rising too quickly after a meal (, , , ). One observational study found women who ate the highest amount of soluble fiber were half as likely to be insulin resistant as women who ate the least amount of soluble fiber (). Soluble fiber also helps feed the friendly bacteria that live in your colon, which may improve gut health and reduce insulin resistance. In a six-week controlled study of obese older women, those who took flaxseed experienced greater increases in insulin sensitivity and lower insulin levels than women who took a probiotic or placebo (). Overall, fiber from whole foods appears to be more effective at reducing insulin than fiber in supplement form, although results are mixed. One study found that a combination of whole food and supplemental fiber lowered insulin levels the most. Meanwhile, another found that insulin decreased when people consumed black beans but not when they took a fiber supplement (, ). Soluble fiber, especially from whole foods, has been shown to increase insulin sensitivity and lower insulin levels, particularly in people with obesity or type 2 diabetes. Belly fat, also known as visceral or abdominal fat, is linked to many health problems. Carrying too much fat around your abdomen promotes inflammation and insulin resistance, which drives hyperinsulinemia (, , ). Studies have shown that decreasing belly fat leads to increased insulin sensitivity and lower insulin levels (, , ). Interestingly, one study found that people who lost abdominal fat retained the benefits for insulin sensitivity, even after regaining a portion of the belly fat back (). Unfortunately, people with high insulin levels often find it very difficult to lose weight. In one study, those with the highest levels not only lost weight less rapidly but also regained the most weight later on (). However, there are to lose belly fat effectively, which should help lower your insulin levels. Losing belly fat can increase insulin sensitivity and help reduce your insulin levels. It contains high amounts of an antioxidant known as epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG). Several studies suggest it may help fight insulin resistance (, , , , , ). In one study, people with high insulin levels who took green tea extract experienced a small decrease in insulin over 12 months, while those who took a placebo had an increase (). In a detailed analysis of 17 studies, researchers reported that green tea was found to significantly lower fasting insulin levels in studies considered the highest quality (). However, not all high-quality studies have shown that green tea reduces insulin levels or increases insulin sensitivity (, ). Several studies have found that green tea may increase insulin sensitivity and decrease insulin levels. There are many reasons to consume fatty like salmon, sardines, mackerel, herring and anchovies. They provide high-quality protein, and are by far the best sources of long-chain omega-3 fats, which have . Studies have shown they may also help reduce insulin resistance in people with obesity, gestational diabetes and PCOS (, , , ). One study in women with PCOS found a significant 8.4% decrease in insulin levels in a group who took fish oil, compared to a group who took placebo (). Another study in obese children and adolescents showed that taking fish oil supplements significantly reduced insulin resistance and triglyceride levels. The long-chain omega-3 fatty acids found in fatty fish may help reduce insulin resistance and insulin levels. Consuming at meals can be beneficial for controlling your weight and insulin levels. In one study, overweight older women had lower insulin levels after consuming a high-protein breakfast compared to a low-protein breakfast. They also felt fuller and ate fewer calories at lunch (). However, protein does stimulate insulin production so that your muscles can take up amino acids. Therefore, eating very high amounts will lead to higher insulin levels. In addition, some types of protein appear to cause greater insulin responses than others. One study found that and casein protein in dairy products raised insulin levels even higher than bread in healthy people (). However, the insulin response to dairy proteins may be somewhat individual. One recent study found that insulin levels increased similarly in obese men and women after meals containing beef or dairy (). Another study in obese adults showed a high-dairy diet led to higher fasting insulin levels than a high-beef diet (). Avoiding excessive amounts of protein, especially dairy protein, can help prevent insulin levels from rising too high after meals. High insulin levels can lead to many health problems. Taking steps to increase your insulin sensitivity and decrease your insulin levels may help you lose weight, lower your risk of disease and increase your quality of life.

In fact, shows that people whose doctors use internet-based interventions for type 2 diabetes have lower incidence of complications and improved quality of life. Whether you engage with your doctor online or in person, following their advice on how to manage your condition is crucial. But connecting with others living with type 2 diabetes can provide invaluable support, too. According to a , diabetes online communities enhance members’ quality of life through shared experience, social support, community building, feelings of empowerment, and improved diabetes self-management. When Mary Van Doorn was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes over 20 years ago (at age 21) it took her a long time to take her condition seriously. “I didn’t have any symptoms. I was actually diagnosed when I went for a routine physical and my doctor insisted I do blood work since it had been a long time,” she says. Van Doorn eventually took steps to manage her condition, and she now takes long-lasting insulin. She also watches what she eats and exercises daily. However, from the beginning of her journey, she craved support from other women going through the same thing. After engaging in several online support groups, where she encountered criticism and negative attitudes, Van Doorn was inspired to create her own community based on warmth, compassion, and sisterhood. That’s when she started the blog and a Facebook group for women only. Now, she’s also using the free to find support. “Lots of groups out there can be divisive,” says Van Doorn. “It’s so great to have a place specifically for people with type 2 to feel safe to share their experiences without worrying about how their experiences will be judged by others in the diabetic community or others outside the diabetic community.” She particularly likes the app’s match feature that connects users with similar members, allowing them to message each other and even share photos. “It’s hard to travel this road alone, and with the app connecting us, we don’t have to do that,” Van Doorn says. Mila Clarke Buckley, who blogs about living with type 2 diabetes at and is a community guide in the T2D Healthline app, can relate. When she was diagnosed at the age of 26, she felt overwhelmed and confused — so she turned to social media for help. “Initially, I sought out some groups on Facebook, but what I found in those is that they were really about people checking in with their blood pressure numbers and it was full of detailed questions that a doctor should really answer, so it didn’t always feel like the right place to have a discussion,” says Buckley. In her role as a T2D Healthline app guide, Buckley helps lead daily group discussions relevant to life with type 2 diabetes. “I get an opportunity to help people with diabetes just like I needed in the beginning. Hopefully no one else has to feel loneliness or confusion about being diagnosed with type 2 diabetes,” says Buckley. The best parts about the app, she adds, is that users can be anonymous and use it at their convenience. “It gives people the ability to pick up their phones and check in,” she says. “Instead of having to log into a website or go out of their way to find a community, the community is right there at your fingertip.” Cathy Cassata is a freelance writer who specializes in stories about health, mental health, and human behavior.

So much so that she chalked up her tiredness, light-headedness, and extreme thirst to the demands of her digital communications job. But when her symptoms lingered in spite of her getting rest, Buckley visited her primary care doctor. In 2016, after several tests, Buckley learned she had . “I had already been doing what doctors tell you to do when you get diagnosed with diabetes. I was exercising every day, had good eating habits, and I had lost 30 pounds before that visit with the doctor,” says Buckley. “So when they told me I had type 2 diabetes, I didn’t think it made sense, and I was confused why I had this diagnosis,” she says. In retrospect, she says understanding her family history could have given her insight to her risk for developing the condition. Both her mother and maternal grandmother were diagnosed with type 2 diabetes after having . “I was surprised that I had never been pregnant, but I had diabetes. Even when I lived with my parents, I saw my mom taking her medications and pricking her finger, but I just thought it was something she had to do. She didn’t really talk about it, so I didn’t really ask. It was just part of who she was,” says Buckley. When the reality of her diagnosis set in, Buckley worked hard for 3 months to improve her condition with diet and exercise. However, her levels required she go on medication. To cope with her condition, she turned to the internet for support. While social media offered some help, she says in many ways it was a dead end. “Finding people who were openly willing to talk about how they were living with diabetes was hard, especially with type 2,” she says. “Most people diagnosed with type 2 [were older than me], so it was really hard to find people my age to connect with who were open to talk about it.” After navigating her condition for a year, Buckley made it her mission to help others looking for support. In 2017, she started a blog called , which aims to connect millennials living with type 2 diabetes. She shares recipes, tips, and diabetes resources with thousands of followers. Her first book, “Diabetes Food Journal: A Daily Log for Tracking Blood Sugar, Nutrition, and Activity,” encourages those living with type 2 diabetes to take active steps to manage their condition. Buckley’s advocacy continues with her latest endeavor as a community guide for the free . The app connects those diagnosed with type 2 diabetes based on their lifestyle interests. Users can browse member profiles and request to match with any member within the community. Every day, the app matches members from the community, allowing them to instantly connect. This feature is Buckley’s favorite. “It’s interesting to get matched with someone who shares your same passions and same ways of managing diabetes. A lot of people with type 2 feel like they are the only ones going through it, and they don’t have anyone in their lives to talk to about their frustrations,” says Buckley. “The matching feature connects you with people who are like you and facilitates a conversation in a one-on-one space, so you build a good support system, or even friendships, that can get you through the lonely parts of managing type 2,” she says. Users can also join a live chat held daily, led by Buckley or another type 2 diabetes advocate. Discussion topics include diet and nutrition, exercise and fitness, healthcare, treatment, complications, relationships, travel, mental health, sexual health, and more. “Instead of just sharing your A1C or blood sugar numbers or what you ate today, there are all these topics that give a holistic picture of managing diabetes,” says Buckley. She’s proud to help facilitate a community that she wished existed when she was first diagnosed. “In addition to helping people connect with each other, my role is to encourage people to converse about diabetes and things they are going through. If someone is having a bad day, I can be that encouraging voice on the other end to help them keep going by telling them, ‘I feel you. I hear you. I’m rooting for you to keep going,'” says Buckley. For those who like to read information related to type 2 diabetes, the app provides lifestyle and news articles reviewed by Healthline medical professionals that includes topics like diagnosis, treatment, research, and nutrition. You can also find articles related to self-care and mental health, and personal stories from those living with diabetes. Buckley says the app has something for everyone, and users can participate as much or as little as they like. You may feel most comfortable just signing into the app and scrolling through the feed, or you may want to introduce yourself and engage in as many conversations as you can. “We’re here for you in whatever capacity feels right,” says Buckley.

When your blood sugar level gets too high — known as hyperglycemia or high blood glucose — the quickest way to reduce it is to take fast-acting insulin. Exercising is another fast, effective way to lower blood sugar. In some cases, you should go to the hospital instead of handling it at home. Very high blood sugar levels can result in when insulin levels are low. This is a medical emergency. If you aren’t sure what to do, call your doctor to get instructions on administering a dose of insulin, and for advice about whether to go to the emergency room. This article looks at ways to lower your blood sugar quickly, when to go to the emergency room or see a doctor, and tips for managing high blood sugar. When treated early, you can bring levels down and prevent complications, including DKA. Some sources suggest that drinking water or eating a high protein snack can quickly lower your blood sugar levels, though there isn’t enough research to support this. If you have high blood sugar and need to lower it fast, try the following methods: High blood sugar occurs when your body has too little , or your body can’t use insulin properly. Administering insulin can bring your blood sugar levels down. Talk to your doctor about how much rapid-acting insulin you should administer when your blood sugar is high. You may want to check your blood sugar about 15–30 minutes after taking insulin to make sure your blood sugar is going down and that it’s not dropping . Exercise is a fast and effective way to lower your blood sugar levels. Exercise can lower your blood sugar for after you’ve finished. This is because it makes your body more sensitive to insulin. Physical activity causes the body to demand glucose for energy. As a result, the cells deliver glucose to the muscles and blood sugar levels usually drop. For this to work, you need a form of exercise that gets your heart pumping faster than usual. This can include walking at a quick pace. Importantly, if your blood sugar is , you should check your urine for . If ketones are present, do not exercise, because this can make your blood sugar rise even higher. Exercising when you have ketones in your urine increases your risk of complications from high blood sugar. If you have , your doctor will likely recommend you check your blood sugar before exercising. You can do this with at-home urine ketone testing kits, which are . While exercise is an effective way to lower your blood sugar throughout the day, some types of exercises — particularly short bursts of strenuous activity — can briefly increase blood sugar levels. This is because strenuous activity activates the body’s stress response, causing a release of glucagon to power the muscles. If your ketone levels are high, avoid strenuous exercise and try some light exercise, like walking, instead. Exercising can usually bring down high blood sugar levels, but don’t exercise if there are ketones in your urine. Talk to your doctor about whether you should take insulin to treat hyperglycemia. High blood sugar can be very concerning because your body can start burning fat for energy instead of blood glucose. This can cause conditions such as DKA and . These conditions are medical emergencies and can be fatal if left untreated. DKA is a serious complication of type 1 diabetes. It’s rare in people with , but can occur. Symptoms that can indicate you should go to the emergency room include: ketones in your urine, as diagnosed using a urine dipstick test High blood sugar levels can cause a fluid imbalance in the body and can cause the blood to become acidic in a manner that doesn’t support life. Medical treatments for these conditions include administering intravenous insulin on a continuous basis and IV fluids to correct . High blood sugar can become a medical emergency. Go to the ER if you suspect DKA or HHS. According to the , blood sugar levels of 300 mg/dL or more can be dangerous. They recommend calling a doctor if you have two readings in a row of 300 or more. Call your doctor if you’re worried about any symptoms of high blood sugar. They can offer advice and reassurance. See your doctor if you have consistently high blood sugar levels. Symptoms of this include: Ask your doctor how often to check your blood sugar and about your ideal blood sugar levels. If you don’t currently see a doctor who specializes in diabetes, known as an endocrinologist, you can find one by searching the ‘ website. You can find a certified diabetes educator by visiting the website and searching by zip code. Talk to your doctor if you have consistently high blood sugar readings or symptoms of chronic hyperglycemia. Checking your blood sugar and then treating hyperglycemia early will help prevent any complications. Health problems can arise when someone has high blood sugar regularly and without treatment. nerve damage, called , that may affect sensations in the feet and hands , or damage to the blood vessels in the eyes that affects vision Taking steps to keep your blood sugar at target levels can help to minimize the likelihood that these complications will occur. Find several tips for avoiding blood sugar spikes here. Having high blood sugar frequently and without treatment can raise the risk of diabetes-related health problems, including neuropathy and retinopathy. Talk to your doctor about your blood sugar levels and when you should seek emergency medical attention. Here are some general guidelines for blood sugar ranges: , or low blood sugar. Eat a snack to raise blood sugar (e.g. 1/2 cup fruit juice, 1 tbsp. honey, or 2 tbsp. raisins). Ideal postprandial range (1–2 hours after beginning a meal). Check your urine for ketones. Call your doctor if you find moderate amounts of ketones after more than one test. Sometimes, doctors recommend that a person maintains higher blood sugar goals than others. That’s why it’s important to talk with your doctor about goals for your glucose levels. Ideally, your blood sugar will be 80–130 mg/dL before a meal and less than 180 mg/dL after a meal. Most people can manage their diabetes in a way that stops their blood sugar levels from ever getting too high. The following tips can help: Maintain a steady carbohydrate intake, avoiding “empty calorie” foods, such as processed foods, whenever possible. Foods high in dietary fiber help keep your blood sugar levels steady. Engage in physical activity that gets your heart pumping for at least 30 minutes a day, most days of the week. Read about how exercise can benefit people with diabetes. High stress levels can increase your blood sugar. Try out some relaxation methods to keep stress in check. These might include: Drink plenty of water. If your urine is yellow, you’re likely dehydrated. Avoid drinking too many sugary soft drinks or sugary juices as well. High quality restorative sleep can help reduce stress and balance blood sugar levels. Turn off your electronic devices an hour before bed and sleep in a cool, dark, and quiet room for . Make sure you see your doctor to test your at recommended intervals. This is a measure of how consistent your blood sugar is over a 3-month period.

Diet and exercise help lower body weight — and excess body weight is closely linked to the onset of diabetes. A major clinical study called the Diabetes Prevention Program studied people at risk for diabetes. It showed that lifestyle changes involving 150 minutes of exercise per week decreased the risk of progressing to type 2 diabetes by . Keep in mind that diet and exercise should go hand in hand. For instance, even if you regularly exercise, a diet with lots of sugar and fat and very little fiber or phytonutrients (beneficial plant compounds) could more than counteract those efforts. On the other hand, you can eat a healthful diet, but if you never get up and move, your cardiovascular health will almost certainly suffer. Cardiovascular health and diabetes are also intricately linked. Committing to a better diet and daily exercise promotes better blood sugar levels, blood lipid control, and mood. It also leads to higher energy levels, which makes it easier to exercise. Daily exercise helps keep blood vessels healthy, makes you feel better about yourself, and may aide in weight loss. All movement counts! Do something you enjoy so you can stick with it. Even small changes can make a big difference. Beneficial exercise can be as simple as walking every day. Virtually anything you do to move your body is preferable to inactivity. Consider parking as far from the door as you can on your next trip to the store. Exercise adds up. If you can’t walk for 30 minutes, try three 10-minute walks per day. If you work at a desk, take a standing break every 15 minutes or so. Be sure to speak with your doctor before launching a new exercise program. To begin, set modest goals. For example, start by walking for a specific, manageable time each day. After a week or so, aim to increase this time until you’re walking for 30 minutes or more per day. You’re more likely to stick to your exercise plan if it’s realistic. shows that mild to moderate intensity aerobic exercise (for example, walking or jogging for 10–30 minutes) three to five days per week is enough to produce significant improvements in blood sugar control. Aerobic fitness vs. weight-training: Which do I need? The recommends aerobic exercise and strength training for optimal physical fitness. Aerobic exercise (think anything that raises your heart rate) can be achieved through activities such as walking, running, swimming, dancing, tennis, basketball, and more. Strength training, sometimes called resistance training, focuses more on building or maintaining muscle. Both forms of exercise are important for optimal fitness and blood sugar control. If you struggle to lift a gallon of milk, for instance, you may want to focus on increasing your upper body strength. Small, lower-weight dumbbells or stretchable bands can be useful for building upper and lower body strength. show that both types of exercise can significantly affect glycemic (blood sugar) control.

Exercising may seem like a chore at first, but people who stick with it often find that they actually look forward to their activity fairly quickly. The point is to commit.

If you buy through links on this page, we may earn a small commission. The ketogenic, or keto, diet is a very-low-carb, high-fat diet that has been shown to offer several health benefits. In recent years, interest in using the keto diet as a tool to help manage diseases, such as epilepsy, cancer, and diabetes, has increased. Type 1 diabetes mellitus is a chronic condition in which your pancreas produces little or no insulin. It should not be confused with type 2 diabetes, which affects the way your body processes blood sugar and is usually associated with insulin resistance. Though the keto diet has been shown to improve blood sugar control and reduce insulin requirements, several complications may arise for those with type 1 diabetes (). This article tells you whether the keto diet is safe for those with type 1 diabetes. A common area of misunderstanding surrounding the keto diet is the concept of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) versus nutritional ketosis (ketosis). Knowing the difference between the two becomes even more important if you have type 1 diabetes. On a , you significantly reduce your carb intake to less than 50 grams per day and increase your fat intake instead. This pushes your body to produce ketones from fat in your liver and use fat as its main fuel source as opposed to carbs. This shift in metabolism results in , which means your body uses ketones in your blood for energy. On the other hand, diabetic ketoacidosis is a medical emergency that occurs mostly in people with type 1 diabetes if they don’t take insulin. Without insulin to transport blood sugar into your body’s cells, blood sugar and ketone levels rise rapidly, disrupting your blood’s acid-base balance (). Thus, the main difference between nutritional ketosis and diabetic ketoacidosis is as follows: In ketosis, only ketone levels are elevated, allowing your body to use mostly fat for energy. In diabetic ketoacidosis, blood sugar and ketone levels are very high, resulting in a critical health state. If you have type 1 diabetes and are thinking about trying a ketogenic diet, it’s extremely important to work with healthcare professionals, such as a registered dietitian and medical doctor, to avoid serious complications. Nutritional ketosis is a metabolic state in which your body burns fat instead of carbs as its primary fuel source. Diabetic ketoacidosis is a serious complication in type 1 diabetes in which blood sugars run high and excess ketones are produced. The keto diet has been shown to significantly levels in people with type 1 and 2 diabetes (, ). One 2.5-year study in 11 adults with type 1 diabetes found that the keto diet significantly improved A1C levels, a marker of long-term blood sugar control (). However, some participants experienced episodes of their blood sugar levels falling too low. This can happen if your blood sugar levels drop below 70 mg/dl (3.9 mmol/L) and is likely due to improper insulin dosing. The keto diet raises the risk of your blood sugar levels becoming too low. This could lead to potentially serious complications, such as confusion, dizziness, slurred speech, and loss of consciousness (, ). The keto diet can considerably lower blood sugar levels in people with type 1 and 2 diabetes. Without proper insulin adjustments, your levels may become too low, leading to potentially serious complications. Strong evidence suggests that the keto diet can (). A number of factors are believed to be responsible, including: The keto diet promotes feelings of fullness, likely due to changes in hunger hormones, making you less likely to overeat (). Higher-carb foods are eliminated, reducing your calorie intake (). Keto diets tend to be higher in protein than standard diets, leading to increased fullness at meals (). While some people with type 1 diabetes may be interested in losing weight, this is not the goal, or even safe, for everyone. It’s important to take this possible side effect into consideration before starting the keto diet. Following a keto diet may lead to weight loss, which may be undesirable or unsafe for some people, especially those who are underweight. To control their blood sugar, people with type 1 diabetes use short-acting insulin in varying doses that depend on how high their blood sugar levels are and how many carbs a given meal contains. When drastically reducing your carb intake, such as with the keto diet, blood sugar levels trend much lower, requiring less insulin to manage them. For instance, a study in 10 people with type 1 diabetes on a found that participants needed an average of 20 fewer units of insulin per day (). Insulin dosing must be properly adjusted to account for your current blood sugar levels, which will likely be lower after starting the keto diet. If you administer the same amount of insulin as before starting the diet, you may experience hypoglycemia (low blood sugar), a serious side effect. Considering that less insulin is required, it’s crucial to seek medical guidance and test your blood sugar levels frequently to prevent episodes of hypoglycemia. On a keto diet, blood sugar levels run lower due to reduced carb intake. If you have type 1 diabetes, you may need to decrease insulin accordingly. This reduction should be supervised by your doctor. Whether the keto diet is safe for people with type 1 diabetes does not have a simple yes-or-no answer. Many factors need to be considered. If your diabetes is well managed and you thoroughly educate yourself and seek medical guidance, the keto diet can be a relatively safe option (, ). However, it’s best to experiment with a lower-carb diet before implementing a full keto diet to see how your body responds. If you have type 1 diabetes and are interested in the keto diet, it’s extremely important to start by seeking medical guidance from a registered dietitian (RD) and medical doctor (MD). An RD can assist you with the specific format and outline of the diet, whereas your doctor can help adjust your insulin regimen or oral medications accordingly. Together, their supervision and guidance will greatly reduce your risk of serious complications and help you adhere to the diet safely and sustainably. In addition to closely monitoring your blood sugar levels, be sure to test your ketone levels regularly when following a keto diet. Many people with type 1 diabetes may be familiar with already, as it’s used to detect early stages of diabetic ketoacidosis (). You can purchase meters with test strips that work similarly to blood glucose meters. You can buy test strips that indicate ketones by color when submerged in a urine sample. These devices measure acetone levels, a ketone byproduct, in your breath. Specifically, you should check your ketone levels if your blood sugar level is above 300mg/dl (16.6 mmol/L) or you’re feeling sick, confused, or in a fog (). Blood ketone meters tend to be the most accurate and are readily available or in pharmacies. and can be purchased as well. Due to potentially negative overall health effects, some people with type 1 diabetes should not follow a keto diet, including: those with a history of chronic low blood sugar levels people who are underweight or have an people undergoing or recovering from a medical procedure These populations have an increased risk of complications and are not advised to start a keto diet without medical clearance (, ). Some people with type 1 diabetes can safely follow a keto diet, though close medical supervision is crucial. Other groups of people should avoid the diet. It’s important to monitor ketone levels, especially if your blood sugar levels are elevated. Whether the keto diet is safe if you have type 1 diabetes depends on many individual factors, such as how well your diabetes is managed or whether you’re underweight or have a history of low blood sugar levels. With proper medical guidance, the keto diet can be a relatively safe option for some people with type 1 diabetes while others should avoid it altogether. It’s best to start by trying a lower-carb diet before implementing a full ketogenic diet to gauge how your body responds. If you have type 1 diabetes and want to try the keto diet, speak to your healthcare provider and a dietitian to set up a personalized program to minimize your risk of potentially dangerous .

Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is a serious complication of type 1 diabetes and, much less commonly, of type 2 diabetes. DKA happens when your blood sugar is very high and acidic substances called ketones build up to dangerous levels in your body. Ketoacidosis shouldn’t be confused with , which is harmless. Ketosis can occur as a result of an extremely low carbohydrate diet, known as a , or . DKA only happens when you don’t have enough insulin in your body to process high levels of glucose in the blood. It’s less common in people with because insulin levels don’t usually drop so low; however, it can occur. DKA may be the first sign of , as people with this disease can’t make their own insulin. Symptoms of DKA can appear quickly and may include: DKA is a medical emergency. Call your local emergency services immediately if you think you are experiencing DKA. If left untreated, DKA can lead to a coma or death. If you use , make sure you discuss the risk of DKA with your healthcare team and have a plan in place. If you have type 1 diabetes, you should have a supply of home urine . You can buy these in drug stores or . If you have type 1 diabetes and have a blood sugar reading of over 250 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL) twice, you should test your urine for ketones. You should also test if you are sick or planning on exercising and your blood sugar is 250 mg/dL or higher. Call your doctor if moderate or high levels of ketones are present. Always seek medical help if you suspect you are progressing to DKA. The treatment for DKA usually involves a combination of approaches to normalize and insulin levels. If you’re diagnosed with DKA but haven’t yet been diagnosed with diabetes, your doctor will create a diabetes treatment plan to keep ketoacidosis from recurring. Infection can increase the risk of DKA. If your DKA is a result of an infection or illness, your doctor will treat that as well, usually with . At the hospital, your physician will likely give you fluids. If possible, they can give them orally, but you may have to receive . Fluid replacement helps treat , which can cause even higher blood sugar levels. Insulin will likely be administered to you intravenously until your blood sugar level falls below 240 mg/dL. When your blood sugar level is within an acceptable range, your doctor will work with you to help you avoid DKA in the future. When your insulin levels are too low, your body’s can also become abnormally low. Electrolytes are electrically charged minerals that help your body, including the heart and nerves, function properly. Electrolyte replacement is also commonly done through an IV. DKA occurs when blood sugar levels are very high and insulin levels are low. Our bodies need insulin to use the available glucose in the blood. In DKA, glucose can’t get into the cells, so it builds up, resulting in high blood sugar levels. In response, the body starts breaking down fat into a useable fuel that doesn’t require insulin. That fuel is called ketones. When too many ketones build up, your blood becomes acidic. This is diabetic ketoacidosis. missing an insulin injection or not injecting enough insulin a clog in one’s (for people who are using one) Who is at risk for developing diabetic ketoacidosis? have had some form of trauma, either emotional or physical Although DKA is less common in people who have type 2 diabetes, it does occur. Some people with type 2 diabetes are considered “ketone prone” and are at a higher risk of DKA. Some medications can increase the risk of DKA. Talk to your doctor about your risk factors. Testing for ketones in a sample of urine is one of the first steps for diagnosing DKA. They will likely also test your blood sugar level. Other tests your doctor may order are: basic bloodwork, including potassium and sodium, to assess metabolic function arterial blood gas, where blood is drawn from an artery to determine its acidity if ill, a chest X-ray or other tests to look for signs of an infection, such as pneumonia There are many ways to prevent DKA. One of the most important is of your diabetes: Follow your meal plan and stay hydrated with water. Test your blood sugar consistently. This will help you get in the habit of making sure your numbers are in range. If you notice a problem, you can talk to your doctor about adjusting your treatment plan. Although you can’t completely avoid illness or infection, you can take steps to help you remember to take your insulin and to help prevent and plan for a DKA emergency: Set an alarm if you take it at the same time every day, or download a medication reminder to help remind you. Pre-fill your syringe or syringes in the morning. That will help you easily see if you missed a dose. Talk to your doctor about adjusting your insulin dosage levels based on your activity level, illnesses, or other factors, such as what you’re eating. Develop an emergency or “sick day” plan so you will know what to do if you develop DKA symptoms. Test your urine for ketone levels during periods of high stress or illness. This can help you catch mild to moderate ketone levels before they threaten your health. Seek medical care if your blood sugar levels are higher than normal or ketones are present. Early detection is essential. DKA is serious, but it can be prevented. Follow your treatment plan and be proactive about your health. Tell your doctor if something isn’t working for you or if you’re having trouble. They can adjust your treatment plan or help you come up with solutions for better managing your diabetes.

b3ae089c-60a4-421f-a5a9-370e0cf88197,"Your Ultimate Guide to Managing Blood Sugar for Diabetes — If you’re new to diabetes, or trying to get your head around it for a loved one, you’re surely hearing the term “blood glucose management” a lot. What does that mean? Well, it’s the heart of controlling diabetes, so to speak. We proudly present this “BG Management Primer” about what makes our blood sugar levels go up and down, and what we can do about it. Consider this a great introduction for newbies and refresher for the rest of us. For the veterans of living with diabetes: Please add your input on our . Let’s share our collective wisdom for the greater good! What’s the deal with ‘blood glucose,’ aka blood sugar? The essence of diabetes is the fact that there’s too much sugar flowing through our bloodstream, and our bodies are not able to regulate it the way a healthy person’s body does. In (an autoimmune condition), the body actually kills off the pancreatic cells that make insulin, so there’s no natural insulin at all — therefore we have to inject it (or ). In , the body has become “resistant” to the insulin present, which can be offset by lifestyle changes and oral medications. But in many T2 cases, after a decade or so, the resistance becomes so strong that those methods no longer work and insulin injections are necessary. Some people have likened having diabetes (either kind) to being a car with a manual transmission; our pancreases don’t automatically regulate the glucose in our blood. Rather, we have to do it manually, through medications, diet, and exercise. In fact, regulating the levels of glucose in our blood is all about the balance of those three things: the physical activity we do, the medications we take, and the food we eat (specifically, ). Food makes your BG levels rise, while physical activity and medications generally make it drop. The trick is not to overdo it on any of these, in order to keep BG levels from surging or plummeting. With type 1 diabetes in particular (people taking insulin), it’s especially challenging that these factors can overlap and confound each other. If you have a dose of insulin “on board” when you start exercising, for example, the effect of that medication will get turbo-charged and you’ll very likely experience hypoglycemia (dangerous low blood sugar, that can make you pass out or cause a seizure). Or if you eat a very high-fat meal, that will slow down carbohydrate absorption so the insulin you took may hit too early, and you will go too low before getting too high later on. Ugh! Even with type 2 diabetes (non-insulin therapy), never let anyone tell you that balancing these factors is easy if you just follow doctor’s orders. Quite the contrary: Since BG levels can also be impacted by all sorts of variables like stress, lack of sleep, menstruation, and other medication interactions, it’s very easy to make mistakes! In short, BG management requires a lifetime troubleshooting approach. There is no “bad” versus “good” type of diabetes; we all have to manage our BG on a regular basis to avoid the physical damage diabetes can do. The American Diabetes Association (ADA) sets for “nonpregnant adults with diabetes” as between 70 to 130 mg/dL (or 4.4 to 7.2 mmol/L for our European friends, who use a different measurement system). That is, you’re not supposed to dip below 70 mg/dL to avoid dangerously low blood sugar, and ideally not top out over 180 mg/dL, even after meals. The latter is a lot harder than it sounds, given that carbohydrates (which turn to sugar in the bloodstream) can easily make your BG skyrocket immediately after eating. The thing about BG levels, especially for folks who take insulin, is they’re very contextual, based on all the factors that make your glucose go up and down (see below). If you’re about to do some heavy exercise, a slightly elevated glucose level is probably a good idea, to safeguard you from going too low. Whereas if you’re about to indulge in some birthday cake, running a bit low may not be bad. The main cause of high BG is mainly food, specifically carbohydrates. These are the sugars and starches found in grains, fruits, dairy products, and some vegetables. It also includes all sugary foods like sweets, fresh fruit, and sugar itself, along with all manner of starchy foods (bread, pasta, potatoes, rice) that break down to glucose in your body. People with diabetes absolutely need to be of their food, because limiting carbs is an important tool for regulating BG levels. A can make your BG levels rise, too, including illness, infection, stress, lack of sleep, and menstruation. Basically, anything that puts a burden on your body is likely to increase your insulin resistance, meaning even injected insulin will be less effective than usual and you may need more to bring your BG levels down. Low blood sugar is mainly caused by exercise and medications, especially insulin. That is, physical activity of nearly any kind that makes your heart beat a little faster will also cause your muscles to use more glucose, which lowers your BG levels. It also makes any BG-lowering medications in your body work more effectively. This can be a good thing but can also be dangerous; if you have too much insulin “on board” when you begin exercising, you may very well “crash” and have a hypoglycemic episode. Experts warn you should not begin strenuous exercise if your BG is already too high — over 250 mg/dl — because this can cause your body to pour extra glucose into your bloodstream, which in turn can cause dangerously high BG (hyperglycemia) that leads to , a state than can lead to a coma. Sound complicated? It is. But despite these warnings, exercise is still your friend! We can’t overemphasize the importance of being physically active. Regular exercise not only reduces insulin resistance and improves BG control, it also eases tension and anxiety; improves sleep; gives you more energy and a sense of well-being; and even improves your sex life, according to clinical studies. For more, check out a global initiative called . “High blood sugar” (glycemia) is defined as over 130 mg/dL before eating, and over 180 mg/dL following meals. For people with diabetes, getting to 180 mg/dL can be a common occurrence, but anything persistently over 200 mg/dL should be cause for some alarm — or at least some immediate action, like additional insulin or physical activity to bring levels down. The symptoms of high blood sugar are feeling irritable, headachy, fatigued, hungry, or nauseous. If BG spikes above 400 mg/dL, seek treatment immediately because, as noted, you could be heading into DKA. “Low blood sugar” (glycemia) is generally considered 70 mg/dL or lower. include feeling nervous, dizzy, shaky, weak, and/or hot and sweaty. You can also experience tingling skin, difficulty sleeping, and bad dreams. Note that low blood sugar is more immediately threatening than high. If not treated right away with sugar (fast-acting carbohydrates), you are likely to pass out or have a seizure. If you have diabetes, it’s advisable to carry emergency sugar at all times. This can include glucose tablets or gels made specifically for treating hypoglycemia. The “gold standard” lab test for blood glucose control is called the . It’s usually conducted in a clinic or hospital lab, although all that’s really needed is one big drop of blood for an accurate test. It produces an average level of BG control over roughly the past 3 months, expressed as a percentage. The ADA recommends an A1C level of less than 7 percent, to match the BG levels of non-diabetic people. For many people with diabetes, hitting that A1C level is a constant struggle. It is especially frustrating given that your A1C result is used by everyone from your doctor to your insurance company to friends and family to with your diabetes management. Lately, there’s been a backlash against overemphasizing the A1C because it doesn’t really reflect your daily glucose control, nor your well-being in any way. Remember that the A1C is calculated as an average or a mid-point of all your glucose values over the past 3 months. It’s possible to have a “perfect” A1C result of 6.5 percent that in reality is nothing more than a mid-point between several weeks of severe highs and lows. Not good. If, however, your A1C is slightly elevated at, say, 7.2 percent, and you did not have frequent low BG values, that means all your levels over the previous 3 months were pretty good. This is because if you were hitting frequent highs, your A1C would also be much higher. Clinicians, researchers, and advocates have been putting a lot of emphasis in recent years on “” rather than A1C. This looks at how many hours per day are spent in the ideal BG range of roughly 70 to 180mg/dL, which is MUCH more meaningful for people navigating a day-to-day existence with diabetes. “Fasting blood sugar” is a term that refers to both your BG level upon waking in the morning and a lab test of your glucose levels after not eating for a period of 8 hours. That’s right, for a fasting blood glucose test, you can’t eat or drink anything but water for 8 hours prior. Most people schedule these tests first thing in the morning, so they don’t have to go hungry during the day. In people who already have diabetes, this number can be used to gauge overnight BG control. However, it’s most commonly used when diabetes is suspected, as in: A fasting BG level of 100 to 125 mg/dL indicates prediabetes A fasting BG level of 126 mg/dL or higher means a diabetes diagnosis When home glucose meters became mainstream in the 1980s, they revolutionized diabetes care. Before that, all people had was a urine test that took 24 hours or longer to produce results. Now people could actually know their own BG level, right in the moment! Today, these glucose meters are getting increasingly high-tech, with Bluetooth wireless connections to smartphone apps and the capability to crunch the data collected and provide feedback. With or without these bells and whistles, a glucose meter remains the essential tool for managing diabetes. Most patients get a basic meter for cheap or free from their doctor at diagnosis, and it’s the that cost them money over time. Bottom line is: If you have diabetes, you need to test regularly. If you have type 2 diabetes and are not taking insulin, it may be sufficient to test every morning and evening, and then periodically before and after meals to gauge how certain foods affect your BG levels. If you take insulin, you’ll need to test much more often to stay safe and sane. Test in the morning, bed time, before and after meals, before and after (and sometimes during) exercise, and ANY TIME that you feel the slightest bit light-headed or “off.” Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) changes the game! The first hit the market in 2007 and has really changed the game for anyone who needs to test frequently throughout the day. It’s especially life-saving for those who experience “,” meaning they no longer feel the natural symptoms of plummeting blood sugar. Being able to wear a sensor that gives constant readings and alarms when you are out of range is revolutionary! CGM now provides the “24-hour movie version” of your BG levels versus the “snapshot photo version” we get from traditional fingerstick meters. There are currently three CGMs on the market: one from , one from , and a slightly different variety called . All three include a small sensor that’s attached to your skin with an adhesive, and penetrates the skin with a tiny needle called a cannula. These sensors contain an electrode that helps measure your glucose levels from the “interstitial fluid” between the tissue cells rather than directly from your blood, like a fingerstick meter does. Your BG results are beamed to a handheld “receiver” or, increasingly, to a smartphone app, where you can also manage settings and alarms. See this Note that the biggest challenge with CGM is getting insurance coverage for this expensive device, something the D-community has been heavily advocating for a decade now. Traditionally, all diabetes patients were encouraged to keep records of their BG test results in written logbooks. Thankfully, today both fingerstick meters and CGM devices store this data for easy reviewing. What to do with all that data? Obviously, the immediate result can help you decide what to do next: Do you need food to bring up your BG? Or do you need more insulin to bring it down? And there are an array of logging tools and apps that can help you analyze the aggregate data, to spot trends, and to discover problem areas. For example, does your BG regularly spike in the early mornings, something called ? See this guide to 5 Easy Ways to Actually Learn from Your Diabetes Data. While the pressure to review your data can be one of the biggest annoyances of living with diabetes, it really is important to be able to see how your numbers change over days and weeks. This helps you and your doctor spot trends, like, “Why I am always too high on Thursdays?” or “I seem to be going low regularly after breakfast.” This can help you make changes in your routine for better BG control. The thing about this data is that your BG numbers on their own can only tell so you so much — whether you were running high or low. That’s not the full picture without any information on the medications you took, the food you ate, and the exercise you did. (Those Big Three factors.) In other words, you ideally need to log the number of carbohydates you ate per meal and make notes on exercise and dosing alongside your BG data — at least for short periods in order to gain insights. This is where the technology tools are really helpful. New smartphone apps make it really easy to record all those factors. Some popular apps to know about are and , and the connected meters and . If you’re using a CGM, your BG data is being automatically recorded, and you can actually add notes about food and exercise in the device’s companion app. If it isn’t obvious by now, BG management is a big balancing act. It’s all about working to stay in range (that “”) as much as humanly possible. This requires being constantly aware of your food and medicine intake, and physical activity output. Unlike people with healthy pancreases, the choice to eat a sugary dessert or take the stairs instead of the elevator can have both an immediate and long-term effect on our health. To reiterate, there are LOTS of factors that impact your BG levels — and sometimes it even feels like the direction the wind is blowing is playing a role! That’s because BG management is . Every day presents new challenges, and often the strategy you used yesterday or last week does not produce the same results. Therefore, one of the most important things to know about BG management is not to beat yourself up about it! Yes, you need to put in the work, but it’s imperative not to see every glucose test as some kind of pass/fail exam. (You’re just checking, not “testing”). Don’t ; simply keep on plugging away with your daily efforts. Feel free to tell your friends, family, and especially your doctor we said that!

You can find more valuable content about exercising with T1D in If you’ve participated in any physical activity while also living with Type 1 diabetes, you know that managing blood sugar levels alongside exercise can be challenging. While exercise can help manage overall blood glucose levels and make insulin work more efficiently in the body, low blood sugars during and after exercise can be disruptive and dangerous. Below, we’ll dive into the science behind the blood sugar drops so you can better understand and plan for them.  With exercise, the impact on your blood glucose depends on how much energy is expended, the intensity and duration of the exercise, and whether the movement is mostly aerobic, anaerobic or both. Aerobic activity in particular is often associated with lowering blood sugar levels, but did you know that aerobic activity can actually lead to two distinct blood sugar drops, one during and one after exercise? Any activity that is at least slightly challenging and uses muscles in a continuous fashion can be considered aerobic – like raking leaves, walking, running, and cycling.  First, let’s understand the science of how the body controls blood sugar levels. Two hormones are most important – insulin and glucagon. Insulin reduces blood sugar levels, while glucagon raises them.  Insulin reduces the amount of glucose in the blood by binding to receptors on the body’s cells, like how a key enters a lock to unlock a door. When activated, the insulin receptors bring glucose transporters to the cell’s surface, allowing glucose to be transported into the cell. This lowers the amount of glucose in the bloodstream and allows glucose to enter the cells, either to be stored or burned for fuel.  Glucagon does the opposite; it raises the glucose level by getting the liver to break down its stored sugar called glycogen, and then dumps it into the bloodstream.  Exercise makes our muscles burn glucose for fuel, and also makes insulin work more efficiently by increasing the number and responsiveness of the glucose transporters. Insulin also blocks the production of glucagon. This is what causes blood glucose levels to drop during exercise.  The second delayed drop in blood glucose levels is due to two things – the body replenishing glucose stores that were used during exercise and increased insulin sensitivity, which can last for several hours after exercise. This can cause glucose levels to drift downward for up to 24 hours after a workout. Even if you are doing low to moderate activity for a relatively short amount of time, you may need some extra carbohydrates or a reduction to your insulin dose before you exercise (the video below outlines specific ways to measure how many carbs you may need, or how much you may need to reduce insulin levels).  Remember, if you experience a severe low blood sugar for any reason, your chances of experiencing another low within 24 hours are increased. It’s best to avoid exercise for a day after experiencing a severe low.  You might notice different glucose responses when you do the same exercise at different times of the day. It may be worth experimenting to figure out how your blood glucose levels are affected differently depending on when you work out.  No matter what, always be prepared with a rapid acting carbohydrate, such as glucose tablets, gels, or a sweetened drink in case you need to raise a low blood sugar.  Watch the video below to learn a few specific calculations to help reduce low blood sugars during and after exercise!

9c6973c3-b24e-4a68-9c2e-8af5d305baaa,"Christel is a Los Angeles-based speaker, writer, diabetes coach and diabetes advocate. She has been living with Type 1 diabetes since 1997. met up with Christel Oerum from  for a chat about fitness and her next  which is kicking off on January 3. Christel has Type 1, but she also has professional training experience that pertains to safely and effectively working out with Type 1 diabetes, no matter what your level of fitness is. Here’s what she had to say about the program that can change the way those with Type 1 think and feel about working out and the physical and mental health that can follow. BT1: Why did you decide to do the Fit With Diabetes challenge? I created  as a website dedicated to diabetes and fitness because I was missing a place online for guidance on how to safely and effectively exercise with diabetes. Every week, I receive a lot of really good questions from my readers and the people I train about , what to eat for good nutrition and blood sugar control, as well as more emotional questions on how to get motivated or how to manage the fears of . In my Fit With Diabetes Challenges, I (and a team of diabetes experts) take people through all of the different aspects of exercising and eating healthily with diabetes in an easy-to-follow, step-by-step fashion and give them the tools they need to be successful. This challenge will focus on what people living with diabetes needs to know about exercise, mental health, nutrition and weight management when living with diabetes. So we’ll be covering a lot. We will have weekly workout plans, meal plans and articles about how to manage both the practical and mental aspects of healthy nutrition. For example, phycologist and diabetes expert Dr. Mark Heyman is writing a post about how to start a weight loss program without compromising and self-worth. I really look forward to reading that myself. We will also focus a lot on setting people up for success when working out, which means controlling crazy blood sugar fluctuation. There will be posts written by me and other diabetes and fitness experts (like Ginger Vieira and our Diabetes Strong fitness editor Ben Tzeel) that will give everybody The formula I’m talking about is that right level of insulin and carbs that will make your workout efficient and keep your blood sugars from going through the roof or tanking completely. We’ll also be getting our sweat on, so I’ve created workouts that we’ll be doing 2-3 times aweek throughout the challenge. Since the challenge is for people of all ages and fitness levels, the workouts are just suggestions and people will be able to do their own workouts instead if they like. The important part is learning how your body and blood sugar reacts to exercise and learning the tools to exercise successfully. Lastly, there will be a weekly meal plan and a lot of more general diabetes management and health advice, like how to reduce your A1c and how to deal with high morning blood sugars, because learning those things can have a huge effect on your health and diabetes management. At a high level, the Fit With Diabetes Challenge consists of five main things: Daily activities or “challenges” that take you through everything you need to do in a step-by-step fashion Articles covering the most important topics on diabetes and weight management Workout programs that you can do during the challenge (home and gym workouts) A Facebook support group for challenge participants in which you can ask questions, share your experiences and connect with other people who want to be Fit With Diabetes BT1: How do you think the challenge can help people living with diabetes? My motto is “there is nothing you can’t do with diabetes” and one of my goals is to support people living with diabetes in living healthy, active lives. There is no reason why people living with diabetes shouldn’t be active — in fact, we are one of the groups that can benefit the most from exercise. What I’ve found is that when you get active and stay active, the diabetes actually becomes easier to manage. When you exercise, your insulin sensitivity improves, meaning you need less insulin and, in my experience, you’ll see less blood sugar fluctuations. BT1: Where can people who sign up find support and ask questions? After you sign up on for the challenge on , you will receive a welcome email with a link to private Facebook group for challenge participants. This is a great place to meet other people with diabetes and ask questions. My husband and I are in the group multiple times each day to answer questions and moderate the discussions.

Losing weight can be difficult — add Type 1 diabetes to the mix with its daily management demands — and it’s even more of a challenge. I know, because I’ve been a Type 1 diabetic for 29 years and I’m also an endurance athlete. The internet is saturated in advice on how to lose weight with or without Type 1, so it’s hard to know what is worth while and what will just waste your time — or worse, can negatively impact your health. I’m not going to declare all out war on carbohydrates, or tell you can or can’t drink your calories in the form of olive oil, or feast and fast with cayenne peppers and maple syrup. No, the real distilled learning from my years of consulting and data analysis shows that a balanced, low-insulin diet with nutrient timing and activity is the best way to lose weight with Type 1 diabetes. It also helps you maintain brain and body function as well as energy levels. If you are reading this you’ve probably already given this some thought and know why it’s important to lose weight and/or lean out, but I maintain it’s all about performance! Performing means living a longer or healthier life or if you’re an athlete, it can also translate to beating out your competition. Nutrient shifting and timing (planning out of meals) Let’s begin with our protein hormone insulin — the center of discussion. Insulin is a hormone in the body that allows the uptake of glucose into the cells for energy metabolism and blood sugar balance. (For those who are Type 1 diabetic, their bodies do not make insulin and take insulin supplementation via injection or insulin pump). Higher doses of insulin in the body, whether Type 1 diabetic or not, will help to build muscle as well as aid in the storage of adipose tissues (a.k.a. fat). If you are a Type 1 diabetic this may seem fairly obvious, that as you increase the carbohydrates in your diet so too does this cause variability in your blood sugar. Consuming 55% or more of your total calorie needs from carbohydrate dramatically increases the insulin that you must take. Increased daily doses and round the clock “insulin on board” (active insulin in the body) can lead to more carbohydrate metabolism from foods you eat and from glycogen stored in your muscles. These higher levels of insulin throughout the day leave little time when fat from the body can be burned and or metabolized. Keep in mind, insulin tells the body to “store” fat and “burn” glucose or glycogen from the muscles (uptake sugar from the blood). This situation will be neither ideal for the Type 1 diabetic, nor active individual seeking a leaner body composition.  Consuming carbohydrate especially prior to being active can cause a rise in insulin levels that burns carbohydrate more exclusively and does a poor job of chipping away at the fat stores we all have. At times, a high carbohydrate diet will provide ample energy, however the blood sugar crashes from insulin spikes also perpetuates a sense of being hungrier due to fast absorption versus slow. This means this nutrient alone is not the silver bullet. So what is the right amount of carbohydrate then? The human body drives much like your car and carbohydrates are the gas tank. Your tank can only hold say 16 gallons (carbohydrate) of gas and trying to put 17 gallons in a 16 gallon tank will only lead to weight gain. The trick is to strike the right balance to fill the tank. For Type 1 diabetics who use a pump or track their total daily dose, this gas tank analogy is equivalent to the total daily dose of insulin. Meaning, the average total daily dose (assuming relatively stable blood sugar and no weight gain) is the baseline for knowing if your body is full up at 16 gallons or half-full at 8 gallons (close to “empty”). Non-diabetics need to monitor the total grams of carbohydrate via an app or other tracking method to do the same. In my experience with our T1 diabetic athletes, it’s rare that they ever “bonk” as most will learn with coaching how to track their total daily doses and make sure they have enough “gas” in the tank to drive across town. Total carbohydrates should flex up on more active days and ramp down for inactive ones, simple as that. Note: For those who are very active (greater than 8 hours + per week of activity) carbohydrates can ramp even up more dramatically and with a greater focus and emphasis on lean proteins (20-30% of daily calorie needs) and modest amounts of good fats (15-25% of daily calorie needs). The high fat/low carbohydrate diet has its positives and negatives, yet as a stand-alone nutrient source it doesn’t hold up. Here are two big time pros to this diet strategy: Lower insulin levels in general are great for balancing blood sugar levels and sustaining energy. When you consume mostly fats, they are VERY slowly absorbed and it can take up to 8 hours for very high fat meals to fully absorb. During this time these fats can slow any carbohydrate absorption and create a slow trickle of energy where the need for insulin is relatively lower. Increased fat burning metabolism due to lower levels of total daily insulin. With a lower amount of insulin circulating through the body, it allows for fat to be burned more readily. Think the lower the amount of insulin in your system, the higher the fat burning contribution. So then why not go all in with fat? Here are two even bigger cons to the singular approach of fat consumption only: Fat has nine calories per gram versus carbohydrate and protein. If the goal is to lose weight and lean out, then total calories must be considered. This is more than double when you compare things side-by-side, gram for gram. In addition to having more calories, they are absorbed in a slow way over time and can actually have a sustained insulin need and or effect for many hours. This is especially so if they are consumed with faster burning/absorbing carbohydrates and proteins. No one wins on a high fat high carbohydrate diet! When you consume good fats, due to how slowly they absorb, you may not receive that energy into the blood stream for many hours. This can leave you tired, irritable, yawning and depleted enough that you cannot be as active or active at all. Using the car analogy, it’s as if the car only receives a little injection of gasoline while you are driving and stalls out from time to time. In addition, fat can satiate and mask hunger which is great, however, at some point the body must receive enough calories and often times this comes in the form of quick energy when we get past hungry and crave sweets and sugar.  Not having enough timely carbohydrate energy leaves you fatigued enough that you may not be as active and hence not burn calories as much as you could have, which is also critical to weight loss. Why a balanced, low-insulin diet with nutrient timing and activity is the best Given that there are positive aspects of both a high carbohydrate and high fat diet, the combination and timing aspect brings together the better of these two approaches and is furthermore enhanced when you introduce activity. The key is to use insulin timing, which is the same as timing carbohydrates, fats and proteins. Insulin has a leveraged effect at various times of our day and especially around activity. Let’s look at an example: You plan to do an activity first thing in the morning, whether it’s a walk, a run or bike ride. How much do you eat?What do you eat? For any activity less than 60 minutes, it’s perfectly okay to eat nothing. The reason for this is that your body has an amount of stored up glucose (glycogen) that it can access for approximately an hour. This means you don’t need to consume carbohydrate immediately to sustain this activity and it also means you won’t need insulin prior to or during which means you can burn more fat. (Insulin tells the body to store fat and burn carbohydrates – a resource you are already carrying stored in the muscles.) If you are in fact hungry and need to eat prior to your activity, you should consume a small amount of good fats (i.e. almonds or sliced avocado) to satiate you until you can have your first meal of the day. Good lean proteins also work well in this way however for Type 1s, some amount of insulin may be necessary which can make the fat burning session less successful. The key is to do the workout slightly fasted and with as little food as necessary to satiate and sustain you.  For Type 1 diabetics the most important factor to consider before being active is how much insulin is on board from both basal rate and boluses. If there is insulin on board, some amount of glucose will need to be consumed to prevent a low blood sugar. Due to the fact that synthetic insulin has a duration of insulin action from 3.5-4.5 hours, timing a meal and when you are going to be active may take planning. When you are done being active, you can now bring carbohydrates and protein into the picture. Carbohydrates to replenish muscle glycogen that was lost and protein to balance blood sugars and repair and develop lean muscles.  Post activity you are highly sensitized to insulin and its effects of “mopping” up glucose for use. The amount of insulin your body needs to absorb glucose prior to exercise may be 50% more versus 50% less (And up to 70% less) when consumed post exercise. This bodes well for trying to reduce ones total daily dose of free floating insulin and leaning out. It’s also at this time you would want to shy away from good fats in favor of protein and carbohydrate due to the insulin timing. Outside of this recovery window you can transition back to a greater balance of all macronutrients including good fats. If the activity is very easy in nature, (defined on a scale of perceived effort 1-10, 10 being a maximum type of effort, less than a 3 would be considered very easy) then its not necessary to have copious amounts of carbohydrates but rather a higher proportion of protein and some good fats post activity with only a modest amount of slow burning carbohydrate. (To see an example of nutrient coaching for low to moderate activity levels, follow .) Whether you are very active or lightly active the balanced approach should mix the macronutrients (proteins, fats, and carbohydrates) as follows. Less Active Individuals % of total daily calorie needs (30 minutes to 2 hours per week of total activity) Highly active Individuals % of total daily calorie needs (8 hours + of activity per week) To pull it all together isn’t easy, but who said it was?! Life will happen fast and timing insulin and nutrition will be tricky as you are locking into insulin over many hours of the day with varied meals. Only practice and learning with repeated steps and planning can lead to greater success. Ultimately, choosing the balanced low insulin approach via nutrient timing will lead to longer-term weight loss and happiness with enhanced blood sugars.

6f69ae68-918f-4c17-b74c-3d1243763141,"Not many can say that they are married to a part-robot, part-warrior that skillfully keeps herself alive due to the absence of a functioning organ (the pancreas), that is both vital & necessary for one to live. This is my wife, a Type 1 diabetic, who is just days away from celebrating her 4 year mark as a T1D. Back in 2012, right around the time we started dating, Marci she said wasn’t feeling well and couldn’t get out of bed, which was very unusual. Over the next few months, her conditions progressively worsened. What should have been a blissful first few months living in Malibu, quickly turned into months of suffering and unbeknownst to us, Marci was moving through life with a chronic illness that was debilitating her each day that she was going undetected. After seeing consistent days of seeing her lying in bed lifeless and unable to move, I told her it was time to go to the hospital, just days before Christmas. Her numbers were above the meter’s ability to read which they think was 800+. She was soon diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes on December 21, 2012. I had ZERO idea about diabetes but I did know that because of the fact I loved her so much, I was going to do all that I could to learn about Type 1 diabetes. All I wanted was to see her get back to her normal, fun-loving, energetic, active, smile-about-everything self. I quickly studied all the books that I could and spent endless hours of research. After learning about diabetes and what diabetics could do to get back to their normal active lifestyle, it quickly dawned on me. This is something that all spouses of diabetics need to hear: It’s NOT about what can I do to help her, It’s about how can I change MY life to help us. It is our combination of diet, exercise and lifestyle that has led to a very smooth transition in adjusting to her diabetes. I realize that she did not have to do this alone. I don’t live my life a certain way and support her from a distance to the best of my ability. I have changed my life in such a way where we do life together, almost as if my brain operates like a T1D. When you make the change together, it just becomes life. Not life with diabetes. Here are some simple and practical ways I have helped make living with T1D less burdensome for Marci, or what I call, How to make a diabetic spouse HAPPY: H- Help your spouse through the highs and lows, even with the mood swings. Be prepared to help them get whatever they need to combat the high or low. Stay updated on the latest T1D technologies that can help simplify T1D management. For example, I love tracking Marci’s BGs on the Dexcom Follow App. A- Appreciate that diabetes takes dedication and is hard work. It requires 24/7 attention & endless decision making. Your spouse is a fighter and needs to be reminded of that. Be there for them in times of hardship. They don’t want pity from you. They just want to know that you are there. When my wife is having a hard day, I encourage her by speaking positivity into her life. Always speak victory and never defeat. Laughter is key. In all things there is room for humor and if you were to ask my wife, humor is unbelievably helpful during those hard times. Most notably, CrossFit. We love the competitiveness of this sport. We’re even competing this coming January. This is a great way to push yourself and keep your numbers under control. Find an exercise routine that works for you! Outdoor activities are always GREAT. Surfing, hiking, even taking a morning walk. We love scoping out new healthy restaurants and make weekend dates out of them. Become a T1D foodie expert! P- Participate in the lifestyle change. Educate yourself. Make the change in YOUR life to make the biggest impact on your loved one and your relationship. Get involved in the T1D Community. My wife has a that has all types of helpful tips and articles. She also draws a lot of encouragement from community support through the as well as other T1Ds through Instagram. Stick to a routine that works for both of you & give yourself grace when you fall off track. Y- Yield to the suggestions of your spouse. They know best! They are their own health advocate. Your loved one wants your support. They don’t need you to be the diabetic police for them. Always listen to your loved one intently. They know how they are feeling and know their body best. Always be loving no matter the circumstance. You are their biggest fan and their #1 supporter. They need to feel that. Although our love story is considered charming and unique by others, it didn’t start out ideal, given Marci’s health circumstances. However, I fell in love with her when she was at her lowest (or I should say, “highest”). I’ve walked alongside her T1D journey from the very beginning and I’ve seen the fight in her grow stronger over the course of our relationship. I admire her strength and courage, something that many people in the T1D community share. Making the necessary changes has not only helped her but also helped me tremendously. Making the lifestyle changes that are necessary for diabetics is a healthy lifestyle change for everybody, diabetes or not. As a spouse of a diabetic, if you remember that then you can have a huge impact on your loved one. You see? I don’t have a diabetic wife, I have a diabetic buddy. We are in this together.

You can find more valuable content about exercising with T1D in There are successful athletes with Type 1 diabetes in every sport, from cross-country cyclists to Olympic body-builders, to pro basketball players and hockey players. People with T1D can do it all and so can you.  If you’re looking to ramp up your physical performance, either for a major event or just to meet a personal goal, here are some tips and tricks to help you get there.  The key? Little things can make a big difference.  Glucose control in particular can have major effects on peak strength, stamina, speed, and agility. It’s best to aim for a pre-activity glucose in the range of 100-180 mg/dL (5.6-10 mmol/L).  Keeping glucose levels below 180 throughout the day is helpful for maintaining good hydration and energy levels. A continuous glucose monitor (CGM) can be helpful for athletes because it allows users to see not only current glucose levels but also the direction levels are heading.  To gain a deeper understanding of your personal patterns, log your workouts using a personal diary or a diabetes-friendly mobile app. See how your glucose levels change during and after activity, and how the trends change over time.  When it comes to the day of a race or competition, things can sometimes be a bit unpredictable. Glucose levels that normally fall may rise, and vice versa. As a result, it’s important to remain flexible with your strategies, to monitor glucose levels more frequently, and to be prepared to handle any situation with time to spare.  Nutrition planning is important for everyone, but especially for athletes with diabetes.  Drink plenty of fluids throughout the day (more if you’re in hot or humid weather). The fluid can either contain carbohydrates or be carbohydrate-free, depending on your glucose levels and energy needs.  Be sure to include adequate amounts of protein in your diet. In general, for those following a balanced meal plan, special supplements are not necessary although people with T1D who are following certain diets might benefit from additional vitamins. For example, those on a strict vegan diet may benefit from vitamin B12 and iron supplementation.  Carbohydrate intake is important for good athletic performance and there are risks associated with very low carbohydrate diets for people with T1D, including elevated ketone levels and vitamin deficiencies. That said, carbohydrate loading, which is where you purposefully consume carb-rich meals before major physical exertion is typically unnecessary and can make overall glucose control a challenge. In general, moderate carbohydrate intake is best for individuals who perform regular physical activity.  Some athletes find caffeine helpful, because it can boost performance a little and limit drops in glucose levels.  After physical exertion, it’s time for the body to recover. During the recovery phase, consider a snack containing a 2:1 ratio of carbs to protein, such as milk or yogurt.  Continue to hydrate well after your workout and try to get to sleep at a reasonable hour. Most adults need 7-8 hours of sleep each night to function well; children typically need 8-10 hours.  Learn more about ramping up your athletic performance in the video below!

0be7e43e-0926-46bd-aa1d-9f53692616e1,"The Scherb Method for Weight Loss and Activity: The T1D Gas Tank This is an update to Cliff Scherb’s previous article, “.”  You spend hours trolling the web for nuggets of information and sidle up to google to find the smoking gun that will help ease your diabetes burden.  Your go-to strategy for finding advice is among your peers in small communities where anecdotal advice is offered by well-meaning individuals.  Yet, after all the research you walk away with what worked for someone else and are unable to cobble together a cohesive strategy that ties it all together. You are capable of so much more; you just have not been given a management roadmap.  In my experience helping others with their blood sugar and health goals, the one maxim is that T1D’s do not lack the desire to improve but rather are missing the resource expertise to unlock their blood sugar and body composition goals. If you were building a house, you would start with a strong foundation.  The diabetes “better” foundation starts with a great total daily dose.  Our Glucose Advisors use this as a starting point and it underpins the Scherb Method.  Understanding the “T1D Gas Tank” as it relates to your total daily dose can help you not only to lean out but also to stay in greater blood sugar control. How total daily dose impacts your “Scherb Method Gas Tank” There may not be a whole lot of advantages when it comes to having Type 1 diabetes versus not having it, however, when it comes to eating well, some Type 1’s will have a leg up! Tracking your total daily dose will represent the “size” of your carbohydrate “gas tank.” Meaning, when looking at the total daily dose average, if you hit the daily average your body’s glycogen stores are generally close to being completely topped off. This allows you to modify your diet, maintain a healthy weight, and keep great energy levels.  Glycogen stored in our muscles is used for daily activities to help our body and brain function normally.  This is a limited resource and needs to be replenished regularly. How can you figure out how many gallons of gas your glycogen tank holds? It is the same as the total daily dose for your current activity level and nutritional habits. This number represents a full tank of muscle glycogen. When you are beneath this number at the end of the day, your body is light on carbohydrates and or calories in total. When you are above this number the tank is full and the potential for weight gain exists. This window within your body offers several key advantages for you to make decisions based on your circumstances. 1. – Calorie deficient: Insulin sensitivity is increased beneath the average total daily dose. This means when you are below the average total daily dose at the end of the day, your sensitivity to insulin will be high. For example, let’s say you play soccer intensely during the day. At night you fuel back up with a solid carbohydrate dinner and just before bed, you check your pump to find that you have only taken 25 units and are -5 units to your normal total daily dose for this activity level of 30 units per day. This would be ~17% beneath the total daily dose for the day and would indicate that you have a higher chance for insulin sensitivity and could even go low overnight. 2. – Fully recovered: If you are at your total daily dose at the end of the day, you are topped off with the glycogen stored in your muscles. Your sensitivity is normal and you can expect less blood sugar swings and changing insulin demands overall. 3. – Calorie surplus: With a higher total daily dose, you have the potential for higher blood sugars and or weight gain. To combat a higher blood sugar you would need to raise your basal rates or doses. Think of it like a car, the gas tank can only hold 30 gallons and if you try to put in 31 it will spill over (aka you go high) or the tank needs to get bigger (gain weight) to hold the extra gallon! Note in some instances due to stress/hormones and or other physiological episodes, higher total daily doses may be appropriate and independent of a caloric surplus and not contribute to weight gain. (Examples would be teenage hormones or the timing of a female’s cycle.) Knowing your total daily dose is valuable for blood sugar control and predictability for what you should or need to be doing with your insulin. It is also very helpful in preventing weight gain which is easy to do when the body receives too much insulin. In many leaning out and weight loss phases you will need to target beneath your average total daily dose in order to lose weight effectively. Note that this total daily dose observation does not always apply to all people and all situations. Remember due to the complex nature of hormones, the timing of your insulin, nutrition, absorption, and other medications, you should apply this logic to your own situation as a “general” rule to follow. We encourage you to start tracking your total daily dose as it is fundamental to blood sugar management and this method. Yes, it is one more thing to track in an already busy day and life.  Anything worth doing takes work!  Practicing your nutrition timing and activity can help you to create greater insulin sensitivity which lowers your total daily dose. Ultimately, when you track the total daily dose this can help lead to longer-term weight loss and happiness with enhanced blood sugars.

78fdff41-19c8-4055-9164-18d50eecc4e0,"The secret to my overall success, both professional and personal, is that I made a conscious choice to live my life by one guiding principle: live life first, and be diabetic second. In the beginning, I’m not sure it was even a conscious choice (I was only 4 years old when diagnosed with T1D), but rather an integral part of my personality. I am not one to let obstacles keep me from reaching my goals. Having diabetes has undeniably been one of the greatest challenges to living my life the way I want to, but it has almost never been an insurmountable one. It’s hard to even imagine life without diabetes when you get it as young as I did. I don’t remember much about being diagnosed other than feeling sluggish and tired all the time. The biggest irony was that my mother had avoided becoming a nurse because she hated needles, but the doctors wouldn’t let me out of the hospital before she learned how to give me shots. Apparently she spent days practicing shooting water into an orange. When she gave me my first shot in my arm, she jabbed the needle so hard it rebounded back out. I am told I said, with tears streaming down my face, “Mommy, go practice on the orange some more.” Diabetes has, in many ways, been a blessing in disguise. It likely had a positive impact on my family’s overall health as we all switched to the same diet prescribed for me at the time—a balanced blend of carbs, protein, and fat, with lots of vegetables, some fruit, and a very limited amount of sweets and refined foods. Having diabetes has been a positive, shaping force in my life when it comes to exercise and physical activity. While many view exercise as a punishment, I fully embrace using diabetes as an excuse to put my workouts first! I was always active as a kid, playing in the woods, building forts, and just being a tomboy. As a preteen, I began exercising regularly on my own and doing organized sports because being active was the only thing that made me to feel like I had any control over my blood glucose. Way back then no one had blood glucose meters (only inaccurate urine testing), but I could tell being active helped. To this day, I still exercise six to seven days a week, and my passion is helping others with all types of diabetes do the same. I personally vary my daily workouts to keep them fun and to stay injury-free. When people ask me how I manage to do all I do in life, I simply tell them, “I work out.” Diabetes also led me to an early calling as a healthy lifestyle and diabetes motion expert. When I was about twelve, I spent a week in Kansas with my grandmother, who had what they called “borderline” Type 2 diabetes. She was on yet another diet to lose weight, and I decided to help her while I was there, acting like a personal trainer or fitness coach. I weighed her in every morning, helped her measure out her food, and made her jog laps around her backyard. At the start of the week, she agreed to pay me $1 for every pound she lost. She lost eight pounds that week — was I ever a rich kid! Little did I know back then that she likely lost a whole lot less after the first week and probably gained it all back over time. My grandmother was the only other person I knew with diabetes. Later on when I was in graduate school working on my first degree in exercise physiology, my grandmother starting suffering myriad complications, including a heart attack, followed two years later by a major stroke and smaller ones that eventually left her incapacitated. She was bed-bound and unable to communicate or feed herself for most her last six years, and she had partial amputations of both of her legs due to chronic ulcers. During one visit, I looked at her and thought, . Most of my life and career I have focused on how to stay healthy with diabetes and avoid complications. To me, what’s most important is living well while you’re alive. That’s why I preach about how important a healthy lifestyle is to maintaining your quality of life. You certainly don’t have to get a PhD in exercise physiology like me to understand the metabolic changes that occur with exercise. You can virtually “erase” overeating mistakes with exercise, and you can keep yourself from getting other health conditions (like heart disease). After 50 years with T1D, I’m sure that my excellent health is completely because of my lifestyle choices. I mean, what’s the point of living longer if you can’t live well and feel your best every day of your life?

Physicians board certified in Cardiovascular Medicine focus on heart and circulatory health as well as Cardiovascular Disease (CVD). is a broad term that includes the following: Heart disease and stroke (CVD) are the leading cause of death both in the US and worldwide, in particular for people with diabetes (PWD).(1,2) T1D increases risk for all CVD. For women, having T1D increases her CVD risk compared with a woman who does not have T1D. Beyond cause of death, CVD is a major cause of disability and impacts quality of life for survivors of heart attack, people with peripheral artery disease (PAD), those who have had a stroke, who have cardiomyopathy, and/or heart failure. Although complications from CVD are primarily seen in the adult population, CVD can start in young people. Risk factors for heart disease are present in adolescence as well. (4) Renal function (renal insufficiency or diabetic nephropathy) For someone with T1D, number of years with T1D increases risk for CVD. T1D associated neuropathy can impact resting heart rate and peak heart rate and add complexity to diagnosis of cardiovascular disease. (3) Smoking accelerates atherosclerosis – and is a bad combination with T1D in particular for PAD, but also coronary artery disease and stroke. Best is never to start/try smoking or stop immediately. Even second hand smoke and third hand smoke increase heart risk. The exposure to chemical residue left from tobacco smoke. Children, especially infants and toddlers who are crawling or teething have risk for third hand exposure. Avoid nicotine products. Symptoms of cardiovascular disease can be as straightforward as the “Hollywood Heart attack” — a man clutching his chest in the cold, or as nebulous as a woman presenting simply with complaint of fatigue. While PWD can present with atypical signs and symptoms of heart issues, even people without diabetes can suffer symptoms of indigestion and it is a cardiac issue or heart attack. It is important to know that not just chest pain, but dizziness, fainting, sweats, nausea, fatigue can be symptoms of heart attack. So how do you know whether to get help or call 911?  There is no easy answer — best is not to ignore any of the above symptoms, especially if concerned.  are best identified by thinking FAST Hypoglycemia can present in ways that could mimic stroke; it’s not always easy to tell. Time from symptom onset is very important in stroke and heart attack so best is to treat a low blood sugar but be ready to activate EMS. Cardiovascular disease in large part is preventable!Prep for heart month (and every month) with the following information about CVD. Know how to protect and promote your cardiovascular health While anyone with T1D (or their family) knows they didn’t choose to have it; you can choose to help your heart and circulatory health in a number of ways. The are good to know and optimize for heart health: Learn about blood sugar and diabetes (or in a case of T1D, the goal is control of blood sugars as best able) Identifying and optimizing risk factors is key for people with T1D . Staying active with exercise – is the ultimate multitask for heart health and has been shown to improve all risk factors for CVD. Regular exercise lowers BP, maintaining goal weight, lowers LDL cholesterol, manages stress, helps stabilize blood sugars. A recent study from Finland supports active lifestyle/exercise. Based on lifestyle questionnaires, exercise correlated to decreased number of first cardiac events and prolonged time to second event in people with T1D, the benefit related to increased intensity of the .

From the birthday party to the end-of-school-year pizza party, these celebratory events often come with a selection of food that is not always the healthiest. While having Type 1 diabetes does not exclude you from eating a confetti-covered cupcake or that slice of pizza that is the staple of most school gatherings; it does mean however that you’ll be presented with foods that can make managing T1D all that more challenging. We wanted to know how these five common party foods affect BGLs, so we looked at the daily nutritional value closely of the following foods: 1 scoop of Baskin Robin’s chocolate chip cookie dough ice cream We found that these typical party foods can make managing Type 1 (or Type 2) diabetes more difficult because of the high amounts of the following ingredients: That is not to say, if you have Type 1 you should only eat raw veggies, while the others enjoy the common treats. You should, however, be aware of what these typical snacks do to blood sugar and why. Knowing more about how food affects physiology will aid you in adjusting insulin and help you prepare for optimal blood sugar control. Most commonly found in the form of sodium chloride or “table salt,” this element is crucial for bodily functions. The explains that “The body uses sodium to control blood pressure and blood volume. Your body also needs sodium for your muscles and nerves to work properly.” But what does high sodium do over extended periods of time? Firstly, it can add to dehydration which can keep your blood glucose levels high. Secondly, it can put you at risk for other complications. Carly Crompton, who holds a Nutrition degree with a focus on physiology and metabolism from University of California, Berkeley,  says that “Type 1 diabetics are already at an elevated risk for hypertension and diets with high sodium increase your risk as well.” Will eating one slice of pizza (with 23% of your daily value for sodium) today increase your child’s risk of hypertension twenty years from now? Probably not — but the typical slice of pizza has additional attributes to consider when it comes to maintaining blood sugar control. In a , clinicians observed how high-fat meals affected glucose levels in adult Type 1 diabetes patients. Howard Wolpert, MD, Senior Physician in the Joslin Clinic Section on Adult Diabetes and the Director of the Insulin Pump Program at Joslin, who also led the study, said that “several hours after eating high-fat meals, glucose levels went up.” More than that though, they stayed up. “Despite the increased insulin, participants had greater hyperglycemia after the high-fat dinner with insulin levels elevated five to ten hours after the meal. The average increase in insulin was 42 percent with significant individual differences.” (). This means higher fat foods can cause prolonged elevated BGLs. It also means that there were high variations on how that affected individuals. What insulin dosage works for one child, will not necessarily be the same for another. That’s why testing and recording what’s successful and what is not is important. Bailey West, a graduate from the University of Florida in Nutrition and Dietetics says, “High fat meals are among the trickiest to account for when bolusing, mainly because fats digest more slowly than carbohydrates. The rate at which our bodies digest meals coincide with our need for insulin. So, as our bodies are trying to process a meal of carbs, proteins and high amounts of fat, more insulin is needed and for a longer period of time.” Check out Tidepool’s  (available in beta) that allows you to record how foods affect your blood sugar. Knowing ahead of time is half the battle. Not all fats are bad fats, of course. Cholesterol (a type of fat) isn’t always bad either. Crompton notes, “Cholesterol is used by the body in different ways. For example, it is necessary in the membrane function of your cells, but when there’s too much cholesterol, (particularly bad ones), it can start clogging up arteries. Because someone with Type 1 is at a higher risk for heart disease and heart attack, they should avoid “bad” cholesterol. Bad cholesterols include saturated fats that you find in all of these common party snack (except for soda). Here is a short list of recognizable fatty foods and what type of fat they contain:  HDL (high density lipo protein) – these are fats with omega 3s such as nuts, chia and flax seeds, avocado, olive oil, fatty fish like salmon, and eggs. LDL (low density lipo protein)  – these are your trans fats and saturated fats, high-fat dairy like butter, ice cream and margarine. It’s true. 30 g of carbohydrates in a cookie will spike your blood glucose level faster than 30 g of carbs in an apple. Why? A cookie is typically made with refined sugar and an apple contains fiber sugar. The glycemic index of these foods vary greatly because of this. The describes the Glycemic Index (GI) as “a measurement of how a -containing food raises .” As someone with Type 1 diabetes or a caretaker of someone with the condition, this glycemic index is vital in helping to determine how a food will affect one’s blood sugar. Carbohydrates with a low GI value (55 or less) are digested at a slower rate, therefore they cause a lower and slower rise in blood sugar levels. Interestingly enough, an orange has a GI value of 40 whereas a grapefruit has a GI value of only 25. That’s a big difference for seemingly similar foods! Nutritionist Caroline Potter explains, “When it comes to sugars, you simply cannot just look at the carbohydrate count, you have to go beyond and take into account the fiber, minerals and nutrients involved in eating and digesting the sugars. Due to the lack of nutrients in refined sugars or artificial sweeteners, they are quickly absorbed into your blood stream, causing your blood glucose to sky-rocket as compared to whole food sources like fruit, raw honey or maple syrup.” Check the glycemic index for  from Harvard Medical School. – raises BGLs slower over a longer period of time and slows down your digestive process – spike BGLs faster and are commonly found in many processed foods, candy and soda beverages. As you probably already know all too well, there is a direct correlation between the amount of carbs you eat and the impact on your blood glucose level. There are some foods, like many vegetables and meat, that have very low carbs. This means, you don’t typically have to administer insulin in order to consume them and maintain blood sugar control. The more carbs you consume, the more insulin you need, (while this varies person to person in terms of what is adequate), it’s something to consider when weighing dietary options. It is not to say that you shouldn’t eat carbs as someone with Type 1 — carbs are also a vital source of energy — it is to say though that less carbs can make diabetes blood sugar management easier. “This is due to a smaller margin of error when determining how much insulin we need,” nutrition expert Bailey West says. “Lower carbohydrate eating helps with that uncertainty.” Of course, the slice of pizza or the ice cream sundae is not forbidden for the person with Type 1, but if you’re indulging, it does take a bit more preparation in order to keep BGLs in safe range. Remember, there are different ways in which to bolus too. On a Medtronic pump, for example, you can administer a where it assists with rapid as well as slow-absorbing carbohydrates. Always talk to your professional healthcare provider to create a plan that works best for your Type 1 lifestyle and dietary needs. Here are some general tips on how to prepare: Know the history of what happened last time the food was eaten (record on an app such as ). Having Type 1 diabetes doesn’t prevent you from participating in important cultural celebrations that sometimes revolve around (not-so-healthy) food. It does though require you to be more aware of what those commonly eaten foods do to blood sugar. If you want to maintain optimal blood sugar control, you just have to know what you’re getting into.

You can find more valuable content about exercising with T1D in If you don’t yet have an exercise routine you love, we understand that starting one with Type 1 diabetes can be daunting. Over the next few weeks – to help you get started or hone in on the best routine for you – we’ll be sharing helpful tips and tricks on how to exercise safely with T1D. Of course, physical activity and exercise are important for everyone – they help keep us healthy and feeling great. Exercise is especially important for people living with diabetes because it can help lower blood glucose levels, which is linked to fewer long term complications.  If exercise is new to you or if you’ve been living with diabetes for more than 10 years, check with your healthcare provider before your new routine. During and after exercising, always have a source of rapid acting glucose, like glucose tabs, gels, or a sweetened beverage. It’s best to wear medical ID and have a cell phone with you in case you need to call for help. When getting started, keep in mind that all physical activity is good! Building in pockets of movement to your day will help you reach the 150 minutes per week of moderate to vigorous intensity exercise that is recommended for all adults.  Everyday activities can be part of your exercise plan – for example taking the stairs or parking on the far end of the parking lot – can contribute to your overall physical activity for the day. Be mindful of breaking up periods of sitting with stretching and walking breaks.  When planning dedicated workouts, intensity matters as much as duration. In general, you can get a similar level benefit from doing a more intense activity for less time as you would get from doing something less intense for a longer period of time.  For kids, 60 minutes of daily physical activity is recommended and all movement counts! Organized sports, P.E., and general play time are all great. Children over the age of 12 can also start doing strength training a few times a week on non-consecutive days.  For everyone with diabetes, it’s important to know that your blood glucose levels can go up or down depending on the type of exercise, intensity, and setting. Consider whether your workout is aerobic, anaerobic, or both to anticipate in which direction your blood sugar may move.  Aerobic exercise like moderate intensity jogging, distance swimming or cycling, tends to cause blood glucose levels to drop during or immediately after the activity. Anaerobic exercise like weight lifting or short bursts of sprinting can increase blood sugar levels during the workout. Some forms of exercise, like soccer or basketball, are a mix of both, so level changes can be a bit less predictable. It’s important to check blood glucose levels before and after activity, as well as midway through for exercise that lasts more than one hour. Continuous Glucose Monitors (CGMs) can be helpful, but keep in mind CGM readings can be delayed by up to 20-30 minutes during some types of exercise. The more you exercise and analyze the results, the more you’ll learn how different types of exercise affect your body and blood sugar levels.  Exercise is key to a healthy lifestyle. You should always consult your doctor before engaging in strenuous exercise to be sure you are physically able though. Even when you keep a close eye on your BGL, the unexpected can affect it.

If you’re going to be caring for a person with Type 1 diabetes with regard to their mental health, there are some important things to know about the various emotional impact of having T1D and the many potential outcomes. First and foremost, it is pertinent to have a strong grasp on what exactly the disease is in order to empathize on an emotional level. is an autoimmune disease which happens when the body’s immune system starts attacking part of its own pancreas, destroying the insulin-producing cells. Insulin is a hormone that regulates blood sugar and without it, sugar stays in the blood and can cause serious damage to organ systems, causing people to experience diabetic ketoacidosis (). Scientists have not yet identified one specific cause. Living with T1D is a full-time balancing act requiring constant attention to avoid long-term damage done by (high blood sugar) and acute, life-threatening (low blood sugar). Unlike certain cases of Type 2 diabetes, people with Type 1 diabetes cannot manage their condition by a simple modification in diet or exercise, or by taking a pill. People with T1D are insulin dependent, which means that they must take insulin every day to survive. This can be done a few different ways. People with T1D must also test their blood glucose levels several times a day with a , sometimes with the aid of a (CGM) to see if they are in range. Counting carbohydrates is a large part of T1D management. Depending on each person’s carb:insulin ratio as recommended by an endocrinologist, a person with Type 1 must always calculate the amount of carbs per meal and give an insulin dose accordingly. This can at times be taxing, confusing and frustrating. People with Type 1 diabetes quite commonly experience both high and low blood sugar levels due to either a lack of insulin in the body (/high blood sugar), or too much insulin in the body (/low blood sugar.) Both scenarios can be stressful and frightening, both physically and mentally. fatigue, nausea, increased thirst, confusion, headache, frequent urination hunger, dizziness, shaking, change in mood, rapid heartbeat, confusion, fatigue, loss of consciousness In severe cases, if not treated, both can lead to coma or death. Mental health issues that can stem from having and managing Type 1 diabetes can include: Managing T1D can make someone feel very isolated, misunderstood and vulnerable.

You can find more valuable content about exercising with T1D in All children need plenty of exercise and children with Type 1 diabetes are no different, but managing blood sugar levels with your child’s activity can be a challenge. In this post and the accompanying video, learn helpful guidelines for when to reduce insulin, increase carbohydrate, and respond to various blood sugar levels.   In general, children should engage in 1 hour of moderate to vigorous physical activity each day. Ideally, that hour should include high intensity activities at least three days per week and strength-building activities at least three days per week as well.  Most children do engage in regular physical activity. In a typical school day, they might participate in gym class, play at recess, walk from class to class, and perhaps take part in after school sports. During childhood though, activity can be unpredictable – recess might depend on the weather, and gym class could be running a mile one day and learning how to throw a ball the next.  Given those challenges, it’s critical to understand the importance of glucose monitoring, the challenges of nocturnal hypoglycemia (overnight low blood sugars), and how you can prevent and manage hypoglycemia associated with physical activity, especially activities that take place during and after school.  Carefully monitoring glucose levels before, during, and after physical activity is key to making decisions about insulin doses and food intake.  To prevent drops in glucose levels that typically occur with physical activity, insulin doses can be reduced or carbohydrate intake can be increased. Insulin adjustments often require advance planning though, which can be challenging with unplanned or variable activity patterns. So it may be easier to provide extra carbohydrates, especially for school-based activities, like recess or gym class.  During a school day, if a child is doing less than 30 minutes of low-intensity aerobic exercise soon after a snack or lunch, like running around the playground, additional carbohydrate typically isn’t needed.  If a child is doing 30-45 minutes of moderate intensity exercise, such as playing soccer, an additional 10-20g of rapid-acting carbohydrates, like a 4oz juice box, 3 glucose tablets, or a packet of apple sauce, may be needed.  For after school sports at predictable schedules, you can reduce the active insulin that is active during the practice. If activity is extended, like running extra laps or a game running long, 10-15g of additional carbohydrate for every 30 minutes of extended time is a good place to start.  Typically during a school day, your child will have their blood glucose checked multiple times with finger sticks or CGM. It’s really important to look at these glucose levels before engaging in physical activity and note the direction the glucose levels are headed if possible.  Talk to teachers and coaches about approaches to avoid low blood sugars. As a rule of thumb for children, it’s great to begin physical activity at a blood glucose level of 100-200 mg/dL (5.6-11.1 mmol/L). If the glucose level is 250-300 mg/dL (13.9-19.4 mmol/L), it may be necessary to check for ketones in the blood or urine.  If the glucose level is above 400 mg/dL (22.2 mmol/L) or if ketone levels are found in moderate to large amounts in urine, then children should not engage in physical activity and should receive extra insulin according to their healthcare plan. If ketone levels are found in small amounts in urine, then children should exercise with caution or as recommended by the healthcare team.  For these and more tips and tricks for managing T1D while ensuring your child gets enough physical activity, watch the video below!

Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease that affects a person’s pancreas. The pancreas is responsible for producing insulin, a hormone people need to get energy from food. Our pancreas, for reasons that have not been identified, does not produce any insulin. As a result, we need to inject or continually infuse insulin through a pump and carefully balance our insulin doses with eating and daily activities. We must also regularly monitor our blood-sugar levels. Type 1 is a non-stop and 24/7 balancing act that we must maneuver every day. There is no way to prevent Type 1 and there is no cure (currently!). We get by with a little help from our friends! These include our glucose meter, insulin, needles and monitors. The glucose meter is a device that measures blood sugar. We use a device that pricks our finger and we put the blood sample onto a test strip. From there, the test strip is read by the meter and gives us a number on the meter screen. We can get insulin into our bodies through multiple daily injections or an insulin pump. are delivered to our bodies through insulin pens and needles. There are two types of insulin that we use: Fast-acting insulin gives our bodies insulin right away and is taken with meals or to correct a high blood sugar. Fast-acting insulin is used multiple times a day, depending on when you eat. The other is long-acting insulin, which is given once a day. Long-acting insulin is a slow release insulin that is given to your body in a span of 24 hours when needed. is a device that is connected to the body, either through a tube or wirelessly. With the control of a device, you are constantly getting insulin through the pump. During meals, we can choose how much insulin to give, and the device is already in our skin and ready to deliver the amount needed. Managing Type 1 and exercise is a constant balancing act. When you add exercise into the equation of blood sugar and insulin, you have to take into consideration a few things. First off, the type of activity can affect blood sugar levels in different ways. Low intensity cardio, such as running, jogging, walking, biking or swimming, can lower blood sugar levels. High intensity interval training can increase your blood sugar levels due to the amount of adrenaline and energy that your body is using. Nonetheless, each person’s body reacts differently. The only way to identify how your body will react to different exercises is to constantly be testing your blood sugar before, during and after physical activity to track trends and changes. A fantastic resource for you is the Diabetic Athlete’s Handbook: Your Guide to Peak Performance by Sheri R. Colberg, Ph.D. This book has tons of sports, pump adjustments and mentions what carbohydrates are needed for different activities. A solid read of this book can give you a foundation to understanding the basics of diabetes management in different types of activity. The day in the life of someone with Type 1 involves frequent blood sugar testing and insulin treatment. Insulin treatment is not a cure for Type 1; insulin is used to control our blood sugar. High or low blood-sugar levels can be common, even on a daily basis. The following indicators of low and blood sugar are general guidelines. It depends on the athlete and what is a typical range for him or her. Depending on the age of your athlete, he or she will have training in a medical protocol to follow or specific instructions for care. Insulin or sometimes physical activity is used to lower blood sugar levels. Make sure to review the medical plan that the athlete has in place and know who is responsible for insulin administration. Treat with sugar immediately (glucose tabs, fruits, fruit candy, gatorade or juice) “Having a low” or experiencing severe  is dangerous and action must be taken immediately. If we are unconscious, call emergency services and you may have to administer emergency glucagon (either nasal glucagon BAQSIMI or injectable glucagon.) If we are conscious, fast-acting glucose needs to be taken immediately. This means juice boxes, candy, glucose tablets, or any other sugary food or drink that can be consumed easily. The unpredictability of Type 1 could affect your athlete’s performance on and off the field. Without calling your athlete out of a group, have a conversation about how they are going to control their levels and keep track of how they are feeling beforehand. Allow them to take water breaks and quick opportunities to test levels when needed. Have a solid understanding of the symptoms of and hyperglycemia so that are you aware if you need to intervene. As a coach, you want to push each member of your team to his or her highest potential. Don’t see Type 1 as a roadblock; see Type 1 as a challenge that your athlete takes on everyday at practice!",8,best apps daily activity exercise diabetes,-10.188191413879395,99

A new study funded has found that taking 500mg of vitamin C twice daily can help those with type 2 diabetes by lowering elevated blood glucose levels . Lifestyle factors such as diet, physical activity, sleep and stress can play a large role in affecting blood glucose levels (BGLs) for people living with type 2 diabetes. People living with type 2 diabetes (who don't use insulin) frequently question whether they need to check their blood glucose levels (BGLs). US researchers report that type 1 diabetes could be delayed following a study on animals where certain defective cells were removed. When you live with diabetes, self-monitoring your blood glucose levels helps you see the effects of food, exercise, medication and illness on your BGLs. Ensuring your blood glucose (BG) meter is reporting your blood glucose level (BGL) accurately is an important part of helping to manage your diabetes effectively.

2d474773-2af4-4a71-be2f-5aa2015833a6,"Diabetes management for health professionals – Webinar Series Training for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Health Workers / Practitioners Regular exercise is a great way to manage  and provides many other benefits to keep us healthy. Why do glucose levels sometimes rise during exercise? Exercise can help insulin work better, lower blood pressure and cholesterol levels, reduce the risk of heart disease, decrease stress and also assists with maintaining a healthy weight.  The effect exercise has on your , however, will depend on the type, intensity and duration of your chosen activity.  Other variables might also include timing of medication and meals eaten before exercise. The general consensus is that exercise will lead to a reduction in blood glucose levels and help with long-term management. However, the short-term response can vary, particularly with high-intensity exercise such as running, interval exercise or resistance training.  With high-intensity exercise, there is an increase in your heart rate and the fast-paced movements cause the release of different hormones, including adrenaline.  This stimulates the release of glucose from places such as your liver to fuel this high intensity movement. As a result, you may see a short-term (over minutes to hours) increase in your blood glucose levels, but the long-term outcome (over one to two days) will bring about a sustained decrease in blood glucose levels.  So, if you’ve ever experienced an increase in your blood glucose levels shortly after this type of exercise, don’t be alarmed, this is a normal response. Alternatively, lower and moderate intensity exercise such as walking or swimming will lead to both a short-term and long-term reduction in your blood glucose levels, as this type of exercise utilises the excess glucose floating around in the bloodstream. This type of exercise is more sustainable for most people and forms part of the with the goal of 30 minutes of moderate intensity activity on most days of the week. It’s important to become familiar with your blood glucose levels in response to exercise. When starting a new exercise, it’s a good idea to check blood glucose levels before, during and after to see how your body reacts to different activities and to help with planning for future exercise sessions.  By understanding your response to exercise, you can avoid adverse events such as hypoglycaemia (lows) and hyperglycemia (highs). If your blood glucose level before exercise is over 15mmol/L, and it is unexplained, check your blood ketone levels. Mild to moderate aerobic exercise can be started if ketones are less than 0.6mmol/L.  Intense exercise should be avoided, however, and it’s recommended that blood glucose levels are checked during and after exercise. For more guidance with exercise, please see your doctor for a referral to an . Switch the type of walking in your routine to stay motivated and active.

While goals can be a great way to get us motivated, they can also be a source of disappointment if we set goals that are unrealistic. When looking at the year ahead, instead of planning 101 things to achieve in a short period of time, you could choose just one activity (one that includes some physical activity is ideal) and commit to doing it once per month. This could be a visit to a beach you’ve always wanted to go to or trialling a new exercise class (many offer the first class for free). By the end of the year you will have experienced 12 new beaches or maybe found a new activity that you really enjoy. By making your goal time-realistic you will be setting yourself up for success. The beginning of a new year brings a wealth of health and fitness deals, including memberships, equipment and gadgets. But will that purchase really be the sure-fire way to get you healthy and fit?

Whether you choose to walk in nature, on your local street, a treadmill,  around the block or your office building – walking is an easy way to stay active. Walking increases your heart rate, which improves blood flow and can lower blood pressure. It helps to boost energy levels by releasing hormones like endorphins and delivers oxygen throughout the body. Brisk walking is considered a moderate-intensity, low-impact workout that does not put excess strain on joints (hip, knee, ankles) that are susceptible to injury with higher-impact workouts. People may think that walking is not as effective as higher-impact workouts like running. Yet studies of runners and walkers have found that when using an equal amount of energy, moderate-intensity walking offered similar benefits as higher-intensity running in reducing the risk of high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and diabetes. The faster the walking pace, the greater the risk reduction observed. Walking is an exercise associated with improving blood pressure and body mass index as well as lowering the risk of diabetes, stroke, and cardiovascular disease. Almost anyone can walk for exercise because walking speed, duration, and frequency can be adjusted to match your fitness level. Physical activity affects various metabolic responses that control Exercise immediately uses glucose for energy and improves the body’s response to insulin. It can prevent or delay type 2 diabetes and improve insulin sensitivity in those with type 1 diabetes. Exercise activates the muscles, which have receptors for insulin to promote the storage of glucose in muscle tissue both during and after exercise. Lowering the amount of glucose in the blood. Longer walks, higher intensity brisk walking or walking up stairs are more effective than a casual stroll in controlling blood glucose levels. Interrupting long periods of sitting with 3-5 minutes of light walking every 30 minutes can also improve blood glucose control. Spacing exercise sessions throughout the week, rather than exercising for longer on only 1-2 days a week, appears to benefit insulin sensitivity. Exercising through walking also improves sleep. A recent walking study conducted with 490 healthy adults who added 30 minutes of walking to their daily routine reported improvements in sleep quality, sleep duration, and sleep latency (time to fall asleep). Walking appears to have a positive effect on , with the most evidence for depression.  Some research also shows benefit for anxiety, stress, and loneliness. There may be positive effects on mental health related to the walking setting, such as in forests, parks, and other outdoor and natural environments. However, research in this area is still limited and few studies have compared different types of walking on mental health (e.g: walking to work versus dog walking, or walking by choice versus for necessity). You’ve probably heard that 10,000 steps a day is a healthy goal. Some apps and pedometers have 10,000 steps earmarked, so that when you reach it, a congratulations screen dings or vibrates. Its nots a simple goal to reach as many of us sit more than stand, thanks to driving cars, sitting at office desks, or reclining in chairs at home. It may surprise you that the benchmark number of 10,000 is not actually based on science but was created as a marketing tactic in the 1960s by a company making pedometers. Generally, research finds that more steps are better but even a lower amount can achieve health benefits. A study following 4,840 men and women 40 years of age and older for about 10 years found that those taking at least 8,000 steps daily had a 51% lower death rate from all causes compared with those taking 4,000 steps or fewer. A large cohort of more than 16,000 older American women (mean age 72 years) from the Women’s Health Study followed for 4 years found that those taking 4,400 steps a day had a 41% lower death rate compared with those taking about 2,700 steps a day. Death rates continued to drop in relation to taking more steps up to 7,500 daily, but steps beyond that did not show additional benefit. Although these studies confirm that taking more steps is good, the exact amount to see a health benefit will vary for individuals.  Having the mindset to “move more and sit less throughout the day; doing some physical activity is better than none” is an appropriate goal for everyone. There’s nothing wrong with aiming for 10,000 steps or even higher, except when it becomes so daunting that you lose motivation, or you feel discouraged that a lesser amount is not good enough. Rather than feeling chained to a specific step count, listen to your body, challenge it, and feel good about what it can accomplish. The fitness benefits of walking are pretty clear, but what you may not realize is that walking also offers psychological perks. These come from increasing our awareness of the sights and sounds like looking trees, flowers or clouds, or paying attention to people or events happening as we walk past. Buddhist monks practice walking meditations, which concentrate on the movement or position of the arms or legs while walking, which leads to increased relaxation. Some studies have shown that this form of mindful walking can reduce blood pressure and depression. One randomized controlled trial lasting 12 weeks observed adults with type 2 diabetes performing a Buddhist walking meditation (walking on a treadmill while concentrating on footsteps by stating “Budd” and “Dha” with each step) or a traditional walking regimen.  Both groups walked at the same moderate intensity with a duration and frequency of 30 minutes 3 times a week. The walking meditation group resulted in lower fasting blood glucose levels, blood pressure, and cortisol levels than in participants doing a traditional walking regimen. Other studies have found that walking in nature, such as in a forest or alongside a river, can decrease negative moods like depression, anxiety, anger, fatigue, and confusion. Now that you know how beneficial walking can be for your physical and mental health why not trying to add more steps to your exercise routine. If you’re not used to walking start slow and build up over time. If you’re already a regular walker you can rest assured that each step you’re taking is supporting your health and wellbeing.

Setting daily, weekly and monthly goals gives you direction and assists with keeping you on track towards greater fitness and improved health and diabetes management. The below example will give you some ideas on how to set goals: (specific), (measureable), (achievable), ealistic (realistic) and (time-based) I will achieve this by getting up in the TV ad breaks, walking around the house while I wait for the jug to boil and by walking to the mail box three times throughout the day, before breakfast, lunch and dinner. FACT: This increase in incidental activity reduces your sitting time which is important to lower your blood glucose levels (BGLs) and help reduce the risk of other health-related conditions such as heart disease. – exercise five days per week for 30 minutes. FACT: 30 minutes of exercise will enable you to match the recommended health guidelines for the Australian population to remain healthy and reduce the risk of health complications. – Reach a total of 20 exercise sessions over the month which accumulate to 30 minutes duration. Increase my step count by an average extra 500 steps per day from my step count on week 1 of my tracking. FACT: 10,000 steps per day is recommended to reduce health risks. It’s extremely important if you are new to exercise or activity that you build up your fitness levels. The best way to do this is start out with a form of activity you and is achievable for you to apply into your day to day routine. Walking is a great way to become healthier and more active. Other forms of activity such as cycling, swimming, dancing/zumba are common examples and just as beneficial to build up your fitness levels. An example of how you can build up your fitness progressively is provided below using walking as an example.

b6fa7654-280f-482c-a6dc-dedb8bb9a498,"Managing your diabetes care plan can help you maintain your health. The three cornerstones in the treatment of diabetes are food, medications, and activity. Of these three, activity is often a first choice for the person who has diabetes. Moving toward a more physically active life is generally inexpensive, convenient, and easy and usually produces great rewards in terms of blood glucose control and a general feeling of well-being. Whenever you actively use a muscle, you burn both fatty acids and glucose. During and after periods of activity, your falling glucose level is sensed by the beta cells in your pancreas, and they relax their output of insulin. This gives your beta cells a break from excessive insulin production. In addition, the lower insulin levels signal your liver to empty its glucose reserves (glycogen) into the blood to supply the muscles with needed energy. As physical activity continues, the liver converts amino acids, lactic acid, and fats into glucose to supply the muscles. If the activity continues long enough, even the body's fat cells get in the game. They compensate for the reduced fatty acid levels in your blood by converting their stored triglycerides into fatty acids. When all of these steps are considered, it's easy to see why using your muscles is the perfect treatment for diabetes. It lowers blood glucose, lowers fatty acid levels in your blood, and reduces the workload of your pancreas. And, unless you are on a medication that can cause hypoglycemia, physical activity won't cause your blood glucose level to fall below normal the way some other diabetes treatments may. In this article, you will learn how exercise can be incorporated into a battle plan for managing diabetes. First, though, you must consider some of the risks, which are outlined in the following section. Becoming more physically active is not completely without risks for people with diabetes. On the other hand, remaining sedentary is no bargain, either; it does nothing to help your glucose control, your weight management, or your overall well-being. To gain the benefits of increased physical activity and minimize potential risks, you need to understand and evaluate those risks up front and take steps to prevent problems before they occur. For people with diabetes who take medication or insulin, hypoglycemia is a concern. Whenever you are physically active, your muscles burn glucose. First, they gobble up the glucose they have stored as glycogen. As the activity continues, glucose from the blood pours into the muscles to supply their energy needs, lowering blood glucose levels. However, this march of glucose from the blood into the muscles doesn't end when the activity stops. The body needs to refill the muscles' glucose storage tanks in preparation for future movement. As a result, a hypoglycemic reaction can occur not only during periods of activity but up to 24 hours later. Some people with diabetes who have frequently experienced hypoglycemia begin to associate any form of activity with a loss of glucose control. For such individuals, a lack of glucose testing may keep them in the dark about how their body reacts to activity. As a result, they are unprepared for the low blood glucose level that can occur when they mow the lawn or when they take a brisk walk through the park. When such a low occurs, they may grab a handful of jelly beans to treat the low, only to find their glucose level skyrocketing as a result. So they take extra insulin or medication at dinner to treat the high, but the blood-glucose roller-coaster ride continues with another low before they go to bed. These fluctuations create great confusion and frustration, leaving these individuals upset and scared. Activity, they may decide, is not worth the seemingly unpredictable swings in glucose. For such individuals, more frequent blood glucose testing can help them better understand their body's response to exercise and prepare for it by adjusting medication or food intake. Before you increase your activity level, you need to consider the possible presence of heart disease. As you've already learned, coronary heart disease is very common in people with diabetes, affecting perhaps as many as 50 percent of them. To assess your risk, you and your doctor need to take into account your age, your blood pressure, your blood fats, whether you have protein in your urine, the length of time you have had diabetes, and your family history. So before you begin increasing your level of activity, consult your doctor and, if appropriate, have an exercise tolerance test. This test is done on a treadmill and reflects your heart's ability to work under stress. Your chances of having a positive result, indicating heart disease, increase with each risk factor you have. Even if you are at increased risk or have a positive test, you will likely still be able to increase your physical activity; you will just need to work more closely with your diabetes care team to set safe guidelines for activity and, perhaps, to determine if medications to lower your risk of heart trouble are in order. Before you increase your activity level, you need to account for any diabetic complications or related conditions that may be present. Some types of activity may not be wise for people with certain medical conditions. Any activity that includes straining, such as weight lifting, can dramatically increase blood pressure during the actual activity, further aggravating any hypertension that is present. To lessen any potential problems, you need to have your blood pressure well controlled before you start increasing your activity level and especially before beginning an activity that involves straining. Proliferative retinopathy is also aggravated by straining, which increases the pressure within some of the weakened blood vessels of the eyes. Activities that require straining or that involve jarring or rapid head motions may also cause an acute hemorrhage in already weakened eye vessels. For this reason, it is important to have your eyes examined for signs of retinopathy before starting an exercise program and have them rechecked annually. If you have significant nerve disease in your feet, you may not be able to feel injuries to your feet, the most common of which are blisters. This does not mean you cannot exercise, but it means that you need to have your feet checked by your doctor first and you must observe good foot care at home, including inspecting your feet for sore spots and minor injuries daily. You'll also want to get expert advice on proper footwear for the activity and be sure that the footwear you choose is fitted properly to your feet. Once you've factored in the risks, you can actually build your exercise program. That is the focus of our next section. The Benefits of Being More Active and Should I Have a Stress Test? Before starting moderate- to high-intensity activity, you should have an exercise stress test if you: are older than 25 and have had type 2 diabetes for more than 10 years or type 1 for more than 15 years Talk to your doctor about having a stress test if any of the above applies to you. ©2006 Publications International, Ltd. The following guidelines can help you increase your activity level safely. Be sure to work with your diabetes care team, too, so they can monitor you and provide specialized advice for your specific situation. First, be screened by your doctor for any possible problems before you start any type of activity. This exam should include a treadmill test for people with diabetes who fit certain criteria, an eye examination for proliferative retinopathy, a urine examination for protein, and a medical evaluation of your feet. Whatever you choose, make sure the activities are enjoyable for you and take into account your abilities and condition. The activities don't even have to be ""exercises"" in the traditional sense, as long as they get you moving. Square dancing, taking your dog on long walks, riding your bike, gardening, and even walking the golf course all count. Vary them so you don't get bored and fall prey to easy excuses. Choose some that can be done with others and some that can be done alone; some that can be done indoors, some that can be done outdoors; some that can be done when your schedule is light, and some that can be fit in when you're strapped for time. Once you've received your team's okay for exercise, you need to choose activities that fit your physical condition, lifestyle, and tastes. Many people with diabetes, especially those who have not been physically active for a while, find that easy, low-impact activities such as walking and swimming are perfect Begin each exercise session with a five- to ten-minute period of low-intensity warm-up activity (such as marching in place) and gentle stretching. The warm-up will prepare your heart for increased activity. The stretching will help you avoid tendon and muscle problems, which are common in people whose tendons have become brittle after years of high blood glucose levels. Elliptical machines provide a great cardiovascular workout with less stress on your knees and other joints. Read Consumer Guide's to find the right model, compare prices and purchase online. To preempt problems with you glucose levels during exercise, there are a number of things you can do -- such as: Plan your activity to follow a meal so that it can help lower the increased blood glucose level that follows eating. Check your blood glucose 30 minutes before and then just prior to activity. This way you can see which direction your glucose level is heading and anticipate a low in time to take preventive action. If you are at risk for hypoglycemia, plan for a possible hypoglycemic episode. Carry glucose tablets with you; if symptoms of low blood glucose develop, stop the activity immediately and use the fast-acting glucose. If you manage your diabetes with insulin, know the peak time of your insulin and plan your activities accordingly. Avoiding the times when your insulin is peaking and at its strongest will help you prevent hypoglycemia. When injecting insulin, avoid the muscle areas that you will be using during the activity. For example, if you will be playing tennis, avoid using your racket arm and even, perhaps, your legs for your injection at the meal prior to your game. Most people find the abdomen or the buttocks work best before exercise. When planning to be extremely active, test your glucose level prior to getting started. If your blood glucose is near normal but you have the potential to develop hypoglycemia, you will need to eat prior to the activity. (If you take insulin, you will either need to eat prior to the activity or lower your insulin dose.) If your blood glucose before the activity is more than 250 mg/dl, check your urine for ketones. If they are present, activity will actually cause your blood glucose level to increase. An elevated glucose level and positive ketones indicate that your diabetes is uncontrolled and you need to contact your diabetes care team for advice immediately. Monitor your glucose during exercise to see what effect activity has on you. Check it every half hour during exercise and again when you are finished. Be sure to drink plenty of fluids. Sweating means you are losing fluids that need to be replaced. Water is usually a great choice. If, during any activity, you ever experience shortness of breath, chest pain, or leg cramps that go away with rest, contact your doctor immediately. These are all possible signs of blocked arteries and require an evaluation by your doctor. If you repeatedly experience episodes of hypoglycemia during and/or after increased levels of activity, you should contact your doctor and discuss the possibility of a change in your medications. Being active needs to be fun. Otherwise, you're much less likely to stick with an active lifestyle. Choose your activities accordingly, then go out and play at least a little every day.

Physical activity is important for health and wellbeing, whether you have diabetes or not. The many benefits of exercise include helping to maintain or lose weight, reduce cholesterol and blood pressure, reduce stress and tension, improve mood, sleep and mental activity and achieve target blood glucose levels. When you have type 1 diabetes, exercise can affect blood glucose levels in a number of ways.The factors that someone with type 1 diabetes needs to consider are:1. Hypoglycaemia (low blood glucose) is more likely to occur with exercise because: The blood stream, liver and muscles ‘burn up’ glucose to release energy The cells of the muscles become more sensitive to insulin for up to 12-16 hours after exercise, particularly after very intense/prolonged exercise Some people may hypo during or immediately after exercise, others hypo many hours later, overnight or the next morning Muscles that are exercised can continue to take up glucose without insulin Extra glucose is moved from the bloodstream to replace liver and muscle stores 2.  Hyperglycaemia (high blood glucose) can occur: Following brief/intense exercise such as competitive sports, the body produces an increased amount of the hormone adrenaline Adrenaline stimulates the release of glucose from the liver - blood glucose may later fall. When blood glucose levels are high (15mmol/L) the body may start producing ketones, indicating that there is not enough insulin in the body In this situation, exercise will not help to reduce glucose levels, in fact it may cause them to increase further Understanding how your body responds to exercise is important and monitoring your blood glucose before, during and after exercise can give you that information. Factors such as the duration and intensity of your exercise and your current blood glucose level can help you work out how much extra carbohydrate to eat and if you need to reduce your insulin dose. You may need to reduce your insulin dose before/after exercise or at bedtime. Speak to your doctor or diabetes educator about how to do this safely Check your blood glucose before, during and after exercise Carry glucose such as jelly beans or Lucozade or sports drink to treat a hypo Make sure your BGL is above 6mmol/L before starting exercise Avoid injecting into the arms or legs as your insulin may work more quickly and increase the risk of a hypo - the rate of absorption is more consistent when injecting into the abdomen or buttocks Replenish your liver glucose stores by eating extra carbohydrates after exercising Prevent delayed hypoglycaemia overnight or on waking by having a carbohydrate snack before bed Tips on how to avoid hypoglycaemia during exercise Never completely omit insulin or hyperglycaemia and ketones could develop If your blood glucose is high (over 15 mmol/L) and ketones are present or blood glucose is over 20 mmol/L do not exercise. Take extra insulin and delay exercise (refer to sick day action plan) If you have diabetes complications you need to take some precautions as your ability to tolerate exercise may be reduced Certain diabetes related complications can be worsened by some types of exercise Speak to your doctor about your exercise program as they can help identify exercises to be avoided/modifyed e.g. straining and jarring exercises should be avoided if you have retinopathy. If you have had type 1 diabetes for 15+ years, are aged over 35, have risk factors for heart disease, or have diabetes complications, schedule a check up with your doctor before starting any new exercise Check ups should include ECG, blood pressure, feet, kidney, eye checks, autonomic nerve function (these checks should also be part of your annual diabetes check) Wear well fitting sports shoes, that have adequate shock absorption - a community network focused on supporting people living with type 1 to get active and healthy. - an online exercise program Exercise or physical activity is important, whether you have diabetes or not. There are many good reasons to exercise and do more activity. Being physically active can help you: For the person with type 2 diabetes, physical activity also helps the insulin that your body makes work better and lowers blood glucose levels. Some people may need less glucose lowering medication to prevent hypos so speak with your diabetes team.In this 'Expert Update' clip, Adele Mackie, dietitian at Diabetes Victoria, discusses why regular physical activity is so important, and how it helps people with type 2 diabetes.To view more clips from Adele and other diabetes experts, download the free RealTime Health type 2 diabetes app from the App Store or Google Play.You need to exercise for a least 30 minutes on most days of the week. This can be broken down into shorter sessions of 10 -15 minutes each 2-3 times per day.To lose weight, you need to exercise for at least 60 minutes on most days of the week.It is important to make your activity fun to keep yourself motivated and not to give up. It is also important to make physical activity a regular part of your daily life. Try using the stairs instead of the lift, getting off the tram a stop earlier or park on the far side of the supermarket carpark.Activity should be done at a moderate intensity that will increase both your heart and breathing rates. When you are working at a moderate intensity, you should still be able to talk, but be puffing too much to be able to sing.There is new research that shows that sitting less and moving more are also very important for good health. Simple things like getting off the couch when watching TV and moving at every commercial break, or standing when answering a telephone call can help.What you need to think about  before starting an exercise program Have a check-up with your doctor and talk about your exercise plan If you experience pain or discomfort to your chest or calves during exercise, stop and rest. Make sure that you have this checked out by your doctor before you start exercising again Carry some form of identification on you in case you are injured or feel unwell If you take diabetes medications or insulin that can cause hypoglycaemia, speak with your doctor or diabetes educator what you need to do to stay safe. Always carry jelly beans or glucose tablets with you in case your blood glucose level drops too low – hypoglycaemia. Stop and treat hypoglycaemia immediately. If you experience hypoglycaemia during or after exercise you should talk with your doctor or diabetes educator.

Hypoglycaemia (low blood glucose) is more likely to occur with exercise because: The blood stream, liver and muscles ‘burn up’ glucose to release energy The cells of the muscles become more sensitive to insulin for up to 12-16 hours after exercise, particularly after very intense/prolonged exercise Some people may hypo during or immediately after exercise, others hypo many hours later, overnight or the next morning Muscles that are exercised can continue to take up glucose without insulin Extra glucose is moved from the bloodstream to replace liver and muscle stores 2.  Hyperglycaemia (high blood glucose) can occur: Following brief/intense exercise such as competitive sports, the body produces an increased amount of the hormone adrenaline Adrenaline stimulates the release of glucose from the liver - blood glucose may later fall. When blood glucose levels are high (15mmol/L) the body may start producing ketones, indicating that there is not enough insulin in the body In this situation, exercise will not help to reduce glucose levels, in fact it may cause them to increase further Understanding how your body responds to exercise is important and monitoring your blood glucose before, during and after exercise can give you that information. Factors such as the duration and intensity of your exercise and your current blood glucose level can help you work out how much extra carbohydrate to eat and if you need to reduce your insulin dose. You may need to reduce your insulin dose before/after exercise or at bedtime. Speak to your doctor or diabetes educator about how to do this safely Check your blood glucose before, during and after exercise Carry glucose such as jelly beans or Lucozade or sports drink to treat a hypo Make sure your BGL is above 6mmol/L before starting exercise Avoid injecting into the arms or legs as your insulin may work more quickly and increase the risk of a hypo - the rate of absorption is more consistent when injecting into the abdomen or buttocks Replenish your liver glucose stores by eating extra carbohydrates after exercising Prevent delayed hypoglycaemia overnight or on waking by having a carbohydrate snack before bed Tips on how to avoid hypoglycaemia during exercise Never completely omit insulin or hyperglycaemia and ketones could develop If your blood glucose is high (over 15 mmol/L) and ketones are present or blood glucose is over 20 mmol/L do not exercise. Take extra insulin and delay exercise (refer to sick day action plan) If you have diabetes complications you need to take some precautions as your ability to tolerate exercise may be reduced Certain diabetes related complications can be worsened by some types of exercise Speak to your doctor about your exercise program as they can help identify exercises to be avoided/modifyed e.g. straining and jarring exercises should be avoided if you have retinopathy. If you have had type 1 diabetes for 15+ years, are aged over 35, have risk factors for heart disease, or have diabetes complications, schedule a check up with your doctor before starting any new exercise Check ups should include ECG, blood pressure, feet, kidney, eye checks, autonomic nerve function (these checks should also be part of your annual diabetes check) Wear well fitting sports shoes, that have adequate shock absorption - a community network focused on supporting people living with type 1 to get active and healthy. - an online exercise program Exercise or physical activity is important, whether you have diabetes or not.

e2f2ece5-de02-4e38-8865-1af19c501aea,"15 Health Benefits of Low-Carb & Ketogenic Diets (I Love No. 9) Remember in the 90s when low-carb diets were getting all the media attention? At the time, for a lot of people, , questioning whether low-carb was healthy at all. Concerns were raised over whether a high-fat, low-carb ketogenic diet could increase the risk of cardiovascular disease. Since then, however, low-carb diets have been studied extensively. Not only is low-carb great for losing weight, but it turns out it is the diet you can eat, including benefits for your cardiovascular health! Low-carb might have been a fad in the 90s, but it isn't 'just another fad diet.' It works. ﻿15 Health Benefits of Low-Carb & Ketogenic Diets﻿ 1. Low-Carb Increases Your HDL ('Good') Cholesterol Levels 2. With Low-Carb, You Can Control Your LDL Cholesterol 8. Suppress Your Appetite, So You Are Less Tempted to Overeat 12. Low-Carb Diets Can Be Used to Effectively Treat Epilepsy 13. Low-Carb May Also Have Benefits for Patients with Alzheimer's Disease and Parkinson's Disease 14. When You Eat a Higher-Protein Diet, You Enjoy All the Added Benefits of Protein for Your Health. Want to use this infographic on your blog? Just copy and paste the code below! The following are the scientifically-proven weight loss and health benefits of low-carb ketogenic diets: 1. Low-Carb Increases Your HDL ('Good') Cholesterol Levels If you have concerns about your cardiovascular health or you are just a health-conscious person, you probably have heard of HDL vs. LDL cholesterol. HDL stands for 'High-Density Lipoprotein,' and is often referred to as 'good' cholesterol, whereas LDL stands for 'Low-Density Lipoprotein,' and is typically called 'bad cholesterol.' Neither term refers directly to cholesterol itself, so the phrases 'HDL cholesterol' and 'LDL cholesterol' are misnomers. Rather, HDL and LDL are names for the specific types of lipoproteins which ferry cholesterol around your bloodstream. LDL moves cholesterol from your liver to other body systems HDL transports cholesterol from areas throughout your body back to your liver Once at your liver, cholesterol can either be used again, or it can be excreted as waste Increasing your HDL levels decreases your risk of heart disease (, , , ). Interestingly enough, one of the best ways you can boost your HDL levels is by eating fat in your , not less (, , ). This may seem counterintuitive to you if you have heard time and again throughout your life, as so many of us have that fat is terrible for your cardiovascular system. : Eating a low-carb, high-fat ketogenic diet is an excellent way to increase your HDL levels and prevent heart disease (, , ) 2. With Low-Carb, You Can Control Your LDL Cholesterol As mentioned previously, HDL is typically referred to as ""good"" cholesterol, while LDL is usually called ""bad"" cholesterol. Elevated LDL levels are associated with a heightened risk of heart disease, but studies have discovered that there are different sizes of LDL particles and that the smallest LDL particles are the ones that increase the risk of heart attack. The larger LDL particles do not seem to significantly increase the risk of heart disease (, , ). ﻿﻿﻿﻿ help you out with your LDL cholesterol in a couple of ways. Eating low-carb both reduces the of LDL in your bloodstream, and raises the of the particles (, , , ). : Low-carb both raises your 'good' HDL cholesterol and controls your 'bad' LDL cholesterol, leading to vast improvements in your cardiovascular health. If you are following your cardiovascular health markers, you are looking at your HDL and LDL cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and triglycerides. It is well-known that higher levels of triglycerides in your bloodstream are associated with an increased risk of heart disease (). You might assume that intuitively, triglycerides would increase the more fat you eat, but ironically this is not the case at all. Many studies demonstrate that eating more increases your triglyceride levels more than anything, so eating fewer carbs can your triglyceride levels (, , , , ). : Eating low-carb is an excellent way to lower your triglyceride levels! This is yet another way low-carb contributes to excellent cardiovascular health. It is a well-known fact that chronic high blood pressure can lead to hypertensive heart disease (). High blood pressure is also a factor which can increase your risk for kidney failure or stroke. High blood pressure is extremely common, so much so it is nearly ubiquitous. , around 1 in 3 American adults suffer from high blood pressure. That is 70 million people. Even young people and children can suffer from high blood pressure. If you are looking for a long-term diet to decrease your blood pressure, low-carb is an ideal choice. Studies demonstrate that low-carb can help to lower chronically high blood pressure, lowering your risk for related diseases (, , ). Additionally, it has been demonstrated that controlling your insulin levels can reduce blood pressure (). Low-carb diets help to control insulin levels (). : Eating a low-carb diet controls your insulin levels, which in turn can help you to reduce your blood pressure. Insulin is an important hormone which controls what your body does with glucose (store it or burn it). When you are healthy, and your insulin is working properly, you do not experience spikes in your blood glucose levels or subsequent 'sugar crashes.' If however, you have , your cells do not properly read the messages that insulin is sending, which can result in blood sugar problems. These problems may even take the form of type 2 diabetes. In type 2 diabetes, your body cannot properly produce the right amount of insulin. This leads to a vicious cycle since you now have an even harder time regulating your blood sugar. This brings us back to carbohydrates. When you eat carbs, your body has to break them down. Carbs are composed of sugars, so they convert to glucose in your digestive system. By eating fewer carbs, you are giving your body less glucose to process. That is why a low-carb diet is so excellent for regulating insulin levels and controlling type 2 diabetes (, , , , ). In fact, are so effective at managing insulin levels that many people with who switch to low-carb can reduce their medications or even stop taking them altogether (, ). : Because low-carb is so great for controlling insulin levels and reducing blood sugar spikes and subsequent crashes, it is an effective natural treatment for type 2 diabetes. We have all heard that we carry extra baggage around in the form of stored water, especially if we are dehydrated. Is this the reason that the scale sometimes reads a few pounds higher than you expect it to? Water weight is a confusing topic because there are forms it can take: Chronic water retention, which is a long-term condition resulting from kidney or hormones malfunctioning Your kidney is involved with both types of water weight. Your kidney is responsible for deciding whether to hold onto the water or flush it out. So you want your kidney to be functioning at its best. There is an important relationship between your kidneys, sodium, and insulin. Sometimes when you have a salty meal, your kidneys will decide to hold onto more water to dilute the sodium content. Insulin plays a key role in blood pressure and nutrient reabsorption. You need your insulin levels to be healthy for your kidney to properly regulate your salt and water levels (, ). In other words, when your insulin levels are properly regulated, your kidney function improves. With the kidney performing more efficiently, your body retains for a briefer period of time. This prevents bloating and may also prevent chronic water retention. The result is that you can shed more of your excess water weight, dropping a few pounds. As previously discussed, low-carb diets are excellent for regulating your insulin levels (, , , , ). This means that low-carb diets are perfect for shedding excess water weight. : If you want to lose weight fast and are carrying around extra baggage in the form of water weight, low carb can help you shed those pounds quickly. If you are concerned about your heart health, you may be familiar with (and even worried about) what is known as 'metabolic syndrome.' Metabolic syndrome is not just one disorder, but a set of risk factors, which combined significantly raise your risk of heart disease, stroke, and diabetes. Low levels of HDL-cholesterol (the 'good' cholesterol) Because more and more people are obese, metabolic syndrome is becoming a particularly pervasive problem in today’s world. In fact, metabolic syndrome is so common that researchers believe it may soon overtake smoking as the number one cause of heart disease. Researchers also emphasize that you can treat metabolic syndrome through lifestyle changes. A is the perfect example of a lifestyle change which can treat and possibly even cure metabolic syndrome. Remember, we have already demonstrated that a low-carb diet can raise your HDL cholesterol, lower triglycerides, control blood sugar levels, and reduce high blood pressure. Next, we are going to address how low-carb helps to control body weight, and may even help you burn fat in the abdominal area. All five risk factors of metabolic syndrome improve significantly on a low-carb diet. : Since low-carb combats all of the risk factors which are part of metabolic syndrome, it is one of the best ways you can prevent cardiovascular disease and associated disorders. 8. Suppress Your Appetite, So You Are Less Tempted to Overeat One of the ways in which a low-carb diet helps you to lose weight is by controlling your appetite. Hunger is one of the reasons it is typically hard to diet, especially if you are sticking with a typical crash diet which involves giving up a lot of proteins and fats. No one likes being hungry all the time, so this is a common reason why dieting fails. Imagine if you could that would help you without being hungry all the time. You are eating more fats and proteins when you reduce your carbohydrate intake on a low-carb diet. * For a ketogenic diet, protein would be moderate and the fat portion higher. For example, the ranges could be 5-10% carbs, 15-30% protein and 60-75% (or even more) fat. By eating more fat (moderate protein) on a low-carb ketogenic diet, your body adjusts to predominately burn fat () for energy. Having access to your body fat for energy, you won't feel the need to snack on carbohydrate foods to top up your blood glucose levels (). Sugar is also highly addictive and may even be more addictive than cocaine (). This causes you to snack more on sugary foods. On a low-carb diet, you eat fewer carbs and hence less sugar so you won't be tempted to snack because of addiction. As a result, you will end up eating fewer calories (yes, even with all those fats) on a low-carb diet than you would if you were eating a low-fat diet. Hunger is one of the reasons that dieters on low-fat plans need to actively restrict calories. On a low-carb diet, do not be surprised if you feel so satisfied after and between meals that you do not even need to count calories to stay on track. : Low-carb helps you to lose weight by controlling your appetite and curbing the urge to overeat. The same study above that demonstrated that low-carb diets improve satiety () also demonstrated another benefit. It turns out that low-carb diets not only help you feel full but also regulate your mood. This means that if you struggle with depression, anxiety, or other mood disorders, you may feel more level-headed, relaxed, and balanced when you eat a low-carb diet. If you suffer from chronic depression or anxiety, you know that these disorders not only reduce your quality of life on activities and relationships but that they can also produce physical symptoms in your body. Over time, these ongoing side-effects can reduce your overall health. For example, depression is strongly linked to cardiovascular disease (). Boosting your mood is thus yet another way in which a low-carb diet protects your overall well-being. Ultimately this includes your physical as well as your psychological health. : Many dieters on low-carb report improvements to their mood. This increase in mental well-being can lead to an increase in physical health. If you want to burn fat quickly, what do you typically do? Many people resort to crash diets. Crash diets, however, are unhealthy, and their weight loss effects are temporary. After you return to a regular diet, that weight comes back fast. A much better way to lose weight fast and is a low-carbohydrate diet. Why does a low-carb diet lead to more rapid weight loss than a low-fat diet? A low-carb diet helps you to shed excess water weight (see point #6). On a low-carb diet, you experience lower insulin levels, which means your kidneys start purging excess sodium. Low-carb is extremely effective for weight loss as a result (, ). Research has demonstrated that a low-carb diet may be very effective for weight loss for at least six months (). Why not longer? The study above states that 'adherence was poor and attrition was high in both groups.' In other words, many study participants gave up after that time period. As a result, studies still need to conduct longer-term studies to know just how effective low-carb may be over the long run. It is entirely possible that low-carb continues to burn fat quickly for longer than six months and anecdotal testimonials suggest this is so. In either case, low-carb is not a crash diet and is sustainable over the long-term if you stick with it. Doing so will give you the best results in the short-term and the long-term, both in terms of and overall health. : Dieters on low-carb find that it is an effective diet for fast weight loss. It is also healthy and easy to maintain for the long-term, which will help you to continue to meet your weight loss goals over the years to come. Earlier we talked about risk factors for metabolic syndrome, one of which is belly fat. While fat distribution patterns may differ from person to person, many of us remember having a 'pear' shape when we were younger, where fat tended to settle around our hips. But as you get older, it is common for your fat to instead gather at your waistline. shows that belly fat is worse for you than other fat distribution patterns.  This is true not only for people who are overweight but for people who have a normal weight as well. Belly fat is visceral fat. This is a type of fat which accumulates around vital organs like the liver. If you have a lot of fat in the abdominal cavity, you can develop a number of different health problems, including metabolic dysfunction, insulin resistance, and inflammation (). You already know that low-carb diets can result in greater fat loss than low-fat diets. But it turns out that they can also lead to a greater percentage of fat loss in the abdominal area (). That means that if you want to get rid of that 'apple' shape, a low-carb diet is one of the best approaches you can take. Once you , you reduce your chances of developing insulin resistance and other diseases. Even if you are not overweight, if you have belly fat which you have been struggling to burn, low-carb is a great approach. Many people believe that they can 'target' fat loss using exercise. This is a myth. : Belly fat increases your risk for disease, but low carb helps you burn away the fat and the risk. 12. Low-Carb Diets Can Be Used to Effectively Treat Epilepsy While most of the research and interest in low-carb diets centers around benefits for weight loss and cardiovascular health, there are other advantages as well. If you have epilepsy, a low-carb diet may help you to reduce your symptoms. The ketogenic diet (KD), which is high in fat, low in carbohydrates, and moderate in protein, has been used as a treatment option for epilepsy in children since 1921. The premise is that the brain can use ketones that are formed on a low carbohydrate diet for energy rather than depend on glucose. In 1998, Blue Cross Blue Shield ran a meta-analysis of 19 different studies on 1084 pediatric patients with epilepsy to evaluate the effectiveness of this low-carb diet. Blue Cross Blue Shield discovered that 16% of patients became seizure-free, while 32% experienced a 90% or greater reduction in seizures. For 56%, seizures dropped by half or greater (). While most research on the low-carb diet and epilepsy centers around children (), research on this promising treatment is also being conducted on adults. : If you are looking for a natural treatment for epilepsy, low-carb ketogenic diet may reduce your symptoms. 13. Low-Carb May Also Have Benefits for Patients with Alzheimer's Disease and Parkinson's Disease The benefits of low-carb diets for epilepsy are also emphasized in yet another study (). This research also indicates that low-carb may be useful in treating 'a broad range of neurological disorders characterized by the death of neurons.' In particular, research has focused on Parkinson’s disease and Alzheimer’s disease. The study above suggests that a ketogenic diet low in carbohydrates could thwart Alzheimer’s disease by delivering more fatty acids than you would get from a regular or high-carb diet. Studies have also demonstrated that taking in higher amounts of unsaturated may help prevent the risk of developing Parkinson’s disease (). A study of 5395 participants found that higher saturated fat consumption reduced the risk of dementia by 9% (). A study that included 937 elderly people over the course of 3.7 years found that those who consumed (): The most carbohydrate had an 89% increased risk of mild cognitive impairment or dementia. The most protein had a 21% reduced risk of mild cognitive impairment or dementia. The most fat had a 44% reduced risk of mild cognitive impairment or dementia. The study reveals that a low carb high fat ketogenic diet reduces the risk of cognitive impairment. : A ketogenic diet like low carb which is high in essential fatty acids may not only help to fight cognitive impairment such as Alzheimer's Disease but may help prevent Parkinson's Disease as well. 14. When You Eat a Higher-Protein Diet, You Enjoy All the Added Benefits of Protein for Your Health. When you eat a diet which is low in carbohydrates, you typically replace those carbs with fats and proteins. Proteins are essential for human health. In fact, if you ignore water, around 75% of your body weight is . Proteins have numerous functions and benefits in the human body: Protein is essential for the process of DNA replication. Enzymes are composed of proteins. Enzymes are responsible for breaking down and releasing to your body. That means that when you eat a diet high in protein, you get more out of all the nutrition you consume. Many types of tissue in your body are made up of protein, including muscles and skin. Protein is vital to immune system function (, ) Protein helps you to feel full and provides you with energy throughout the day. , helping you burn more calories throughout the day (, , ) Since protein makes up the majority of your body tissue mass (not accounting for water), it is vital to all of your body functions. : Low carb diets tend to be high in protein, which is good for your whole body. If you are working out while you are dieting and trying to bulk out, you may have struggled to do so while eating a low-fat, low-protein, high-carb diet. While dramatic increases in protein are not necessary if you do only mild to moderate exercise, that all changes if you are working out extra hard. High protein consumption can prevent the loss of lean muscle mass while dieting (). Additionally, proteins are the building blocks for health muscle tissue. For that reason, eating more protein in your diet provides your body with the nutrition it needs to repair and grow muscle mass. That means that if you eat a low-carb diet which is high in protein while working out, you can build muscle more efficiently. : If you want to get lean muscle, low-carb is the perfect diet to support your workouts. Low Carb Has Numerous Health Benefits: The Evidence Is There Now you know exactly why so many dieters swear by low-carb. Getting used to a ketogenic diet requires an initial adjustment phase, but as you can see, it can be well worth it. Stick with a low-carb diet over the long-term and turn it into a lifestyle choice, and you will be able to take advantage of the full benefits for weight loss, cardiovascular health, neuron function, and more.

adf77b1d-0d3e-4f12-9183-2cbdd805840e,"Ketosis vs. Ketoacidosis (DKA): What Is the Difference? Let’s break it down so that you can understand exactly what ketosis is and how it differs from ketoacidosis. Many people who believe that ketosis is dangerous are mixing it up with another state called ""ketoacidosis."" Profit motives tend to muddy up the works when it comes to getting clear, factual information about your health. Well, there are a lot of individuals and companies which all have their own goals and motivations. Here’s the thing though … that is all misinformation. You then Googled something like, ""low carb dangerous"" and found a list of link-bait articles informing you that low-carb is a ketogenic diet, and ketosis is a dangerous metabolic state which can be fatal. And then maybe someone said something to you like, ""What are you thinking? ."" If you are thinking about , maybe you have mentioned it to some of your family or friends. By the time you finish reading this article, you will understand why low-carb a safe . ​Can Ketosis Ever Lead to Ketoacidosis or Otherwise Harm Your Health? Want to use this infographic on your blog? Just copy and paste the code below! Most of us get the majority of our daily fuel from glucose. Ketosis is a metabolic state where you get most of your daily fuel from fat instead of carbs. Your body becomes ketogenic when it has limited access to glucose and needs to turn to another energy source for primary fuel. If you eat a very , you are restricting the glucose available to your body, which causes your body to turn to . Note that not produce a ketogenic state. It depends on how much you restrict your carbohydrate intake. If you are eating between 20-50 grams of carbohydrates per day, you will generally go into a ketogenic state. If you eat more than that, you may never actually establish ketosis. While you are eating fewer carbs, your insulin levels decrease (). Low-carb causes your body to release . These fatty acids travel to your liver, where they are oxidized. Oxidized fatty acids are converted into molecules called ""ketones."" Your body and brain can use ketones for energy. :  ​Ketosis is a metabolic state where your body’s primary source of fuel is fat instead of carbohydrates. On a very low-carb diet, you enter a state of ketosis. There are several reasons why people think ketosis is a dangerous state. The first reason is simply that the word """" is easy to mix up with the word ""ketoacidosis."" The second reason is that they believe that your brain is literally unable to function if you are not eating carbohydrates. The vast majority of your brain does require glucose as fuel. Some cells do, which is not a problem - more on that in just a moment. As it turns out, most of your brain cells can switch from getting energy from glucose to getting it from ketones (, , ). In fact, this happens naturally when people are starving. After only three days of starvation, the brain gets 25% of its energy from ketones. During long-term starvation, this number rises to around 60% (, ). What about those few cells still depending on glucose? No problem. During ketosis, your body engages in a process called . This process allows it to manufacture that little bit of glucose your brain cells need to function. The third reason that some people think that ketosis is dangerous is simply because of the presence of ketones. Ketoacidosis is characterized by extremely high levels of ketones, far more than what is observed in ketosis. Your body manufactures them because they are useful. It is all a matter of balance - more on that in the next section. : Some people worry that ketosis does not supply the brain with fuel, but this is simply not the case. The brain gets everything it needs to function. While ketosis does lead to the production of ketones, this does not mean that you are in a state of ketoacidosis. Ketosis is a separate, safe, stable metabolic state. Now let’s talk about ketoacidosis, a state you do want to be in. Ketoacidosis is typically associated with type I diabetes (sometimes type II), which is why it is also called ""diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA)."" This happens when patients do not receive sufficient insulin. At this point, their bodies enter a state equivalent to starvation. Ironically, this can happen even when patients have plenty of glucose available in their blood. They are unable to metabolize it. At this point, the body attempts to adapt to survive and begins manufacturing ketones. The idea of course is for the body to use the ketones for energy. The problem is that the patient still cannot produce insulin. Ketosis is regulated by insulin. This prevents your body from going overboard with ketone production. In ketoacidosis, the insulin isn’t there to signal the body to stop producing the ketones. Together with high blood sugar, this can cause the pH level of the blood to become imbalanced. When the pH of blood gets too low, it becomes dangerously acidic, thus the name ""ketoosis."" The reason for this is the fact that ketones themselves are acidic. This acidic state can produce a range of dangerous symptoms. The first sign of ketoacidosis is when your blood sugar reaches over 240 mg/dL (13.9 mmol/L), or you show signs of high blood sugar, such as feeling really thirsty, peeing a lot or dry mouth (). Ketoacidosis can ultimately lead to coma and even death. In fact, diabetic ketoacidosis is the number one cause of death among diabetics under the age of 24 (). The mortality rate for those who suffer ketoacidosis is 2 to 5% (). Ketoacidosis can result from a number of situations, but none of them include a safe, healthy low-carb diet. You can develop ketoacidosis if you are literally starving, or if you seriously over-exercise. It can result from alcoholism as well, and may also be associated with the use of XTC while over-exercising (this has been documented with some ravers). ""But wait,"" you may be thinking, ""if ketones are acidic, doesn’t that mean that a ketogenic state is also acidic?"" While this is true, the safe state of ketosis is far less acidic than the state of ketoacidosis. For comparison, nutritional ketosis produces beta-hydroxybutyrate levels between about 0.5 and 3.0 mM. Contrast this with levels of 15-25 mM for ketoacidosis (, ). : Ketoacidosis and ketosis are two completely different states. Ketoacidosis occurs when your body lacks the insulin to regulate ketone production, leading to acidic blood.  So long as you have the insulin you need, you should not be risking ketoacidosis. Your body is very smart. On a low-carb diet, your insulin regulates the process of ketone production, and your ketogenic state remains healthy and stable. So far we have focused on explaining why ketosis isn’t bad for you. But now let’s take a moment to explore what it is for you. Research supports ketosis as a treatment for a broad array of health conditions (), including: Ketosis also has great benefits for patients suffering from epilepsy. For a child or adult suffering from epilepsy, eating LCHF can help to control seizures. According to the , around half of children who go on the ketogenic diet for epilepsy see a 50% or more reduction in their seizures. While most studies have focused on children (), the diet also has promising results for adults suffering from epilepsy (). This study mentions that the biggest obstacle to this treatment for adults is the high rate of attrition. Some patients find the too restrictive. While there are many apparent obstacles to low-carb, there are also solutions which can help dieters to stick with their new habits (more on this in a future article). So if you have epilepsy or any of the other health conditions listed, or believe you may be at risk, you are actually doing your body a favor by switching to a ketogenic state. On top of that, a ketogenic diet is excellent for weight loss (, , , ). As another bonus, you may feel fewer cravings while you are on a ketogenic diet. Ketosis may increase satiety (, ). For a more detailed look at the health benefits, check out ​what I wrote on the . Ketosis isn’t just a harmless metabolic state, it is a beneficial one. Switching to a ketogenic diet may help you treat or prevent a number of different diseases. ​Can Ketosis Ever Lead to Ketoacidosis or Otherwise Harm Your Health? Are there any documented cases of people developing ketoacidosis while on a low-carb diet? There are, but they are very rare, and there must be another risk factor present. There have been several cases of women breastfeeding on a low-carb diet developing ketoacidosis (, , ). The reality is though, the cases above are debatable. In one of them for example, the woman in question stated that she was suffering from severe loss of appetite, and ""barely consumed any food at all."" In other words, she may very well have been starving. The media of course got hold of this story and chose to emphasize her low-carb, high-fat diet instead of the fact that . With that in mind, you should of course proceed with caution if you decide to do low-carb high fat (LCHF) while or breastfeeding - it is always best to play it safe. But there is no reason to be afraid that a LCHF ketogenic diet will lead to ketoacidosis. You may think that you shouldn’t be experimenting with reducing your blood glucose levels. But low-carb has helped many patients with type 1 diabetes (, , ). Remember, it is high blood sugar plus high ketones in the blood that leads to ketoacidosis. Reducing blood sugar will not worsen the problem. However, diabetics should consult the doctor on their medication adjustments while on a ketogenic diet. Are there any other documented harmful effects? Some children with epilepsy have developed kidney stones while on a ketogenic diet (, , ). Again, ketosis leading to ketoacidosis is extremely rare, and should not happen in a healthy, non-breastfeeding person with sufficient insulin. Harmful effects of ketosis are incredibly rare and have so far only been reported in highly specific situations. You may want to avoid ketosis if you are breastfeeding, but there is no reason to panic about it. It is common for people switching to a low-carb diet to develop what is known colloquially as “low-carb flu.” This is a temporary state which typically lasts for a few weeks while your body adjusts to a ketogenic state. This state is characterized by symptoms such as fatigue, headache, and gastrointestinal disturbances (). Again, this state is nothing to be concerned about. Your body is undergoing a major metabolic shift, and it is normal for that process to be accompanied by some discomfort. Once your body adjusts, the symptoms should pass. Many people quit before they get to this point, and declare that low-carb was “bad” for them. Note that ketosis is not an optimum state for everyone - some people never take to it. But most do, so if you give it a chance and get through ""low-carb flu,"" you will probably come out the other side feeling better than ever. There are things you can do to shorten your experience of low-carb flu and reduce its intensity. and get extra electrolytes. Salt deficiency can cause low-carb flu symptoms, as can dehydration. You will be shedding excess water weight during this time, so it is important to replenish. Be sure you are getting sufficient energy. Remember, this is a diet, not simply “low-carb.” Fat is going to be your primary fuel source when you are ketogenic, so be sure you are eating enough of it. This is a tough psychological transition for many people who have been brought up to believe that fat is evil. Get your exercise. It is the last thing you will probably feel like doing, but it will increase your (, ). This in turn will help your body to adapt faster to a ketogenic state. Low-carb flu is a real, but it is a transitional state and does not indicate anything wrong in your body. It is neither unhealthy nor unsafe. A lot of people avoid trying a low-carb diet because they are afraid of ketosis, and that is a tragedy. Ketosis is the same thing as ketoacidosis. Ketoacidosis is a dangerous, unstable metabolic state; ketosis is safe, natural healthy, and stable. So if you do decide to give low-carb a try, you should soon be feeling and functioning better than you ever have before. And remember, if you still feel unsure about ketosis, you can always try a low-carb diet that isn’t ketogenic!

What should I know about storage and disposal of this medication What special dietary instructions should I follow What is Lactic Acidosis and how can Metformin cause it Does Metformin have any interaction with other drugs? is a biguanide substance with antihyperglycemic properties that is used for treating non – insulin – dependent diabetes mellitus. This drug can improve glucose levels in blood by decreasing the production of glucose in liver, decreasing intestinal absorption of glucose and increasing insulin-mediated glucose uptake. The drug is available under generic names: Apo-metformin and Metformin Hydrochloride and most common Brand names are: Glucophage, Glumetza, Glucophage XR, Fortamet, Metformin Sandoz, Diabex, Diaformin, Siofor, Metfogamma and Riomet. This drug can be also used in combination with other drugs such as: Actoplus Met (containing Metformin and Pioglitazone), Appformin (containing Metformin and L-Tyrosine), Avandamet (containing Metformin and Rosiglitazone), Glucovance (containing Metformin and Glyburide), Glipizide and Metformin HCl, Kazano (containg Metformin and Alogliptin), Jentadueto (containing Metformin and Linagliptin), Komboglyze (containing Metformin and Saxagliptin), Prandimet (containing Metformin and Repaglinide), Xigduo (containing Metformin and Dapagliflozin) and Synjardy (containing Metformin and Empaglifozin). What is the source of the drug (natural or synthetic) Metformin is used alone or in combination with other drugs, such as insulin, for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. It controls the amount of glucose (sugar) in the blood. Metformin decreases the amount of glucose absorption from food and the amount of glucose produced in liver. Metformin also increases body’s response to insulin, a natural substance that controls and lowers the levels of blood glucose. Metformin is not used for the treatment of type 1 diabetes, because it is condition in which pancreas does not produce insulin and therefore cannot control the amount of sugar in the blood. Patients with diabetes and high blood sugar can develop complications that can be serious or life-threatening such as: kidney problems, heart disease, stroke, nerve damage, and eye complications. Taking medicines, making the changes of lifestyle such as: diet, exercise, quitting smoking; and regularly checking the levels of sugar in blood may help to manage diabetes effectively and to improve health. Therapy with metformin may also decrease the risk of having a stroke, heart attack, or other diabetes-related complications. Metformin can induce weight loss and that’s why it is the drug of choice for obese patients with diabetes type two. Metformin administration is associated with modest weight loss. When it is used alone, this drug doesn’t cause hypoglycemia as side effect; but, it may potentiate the hypoglycemic effects of sulfonylureas drugs and insulin if they are used together. Metformin should not be used in patients with severely compromised renal function, where the value of creatinine clearance is lower than 30 ml/min, patients with acute decompensated heart failure, those who have severe liver disease and for 48 hours after administration of iodinated contrast dyes because the risk of lactic acidosis. This drug is also used in women with certain diseases of ovaries such as polycystic ovarian syndrome. Metformin administration may make regular menstrual cycles and increase fertility. Metformin is the first line agent for the treatment of Type 2 Diabetes. Prediabetes: Metformin therapy for patients with high risk for type 2 diabetes may lower their chances of developing the disease, although intensive physical exercise and adequate diet work better for this purpose. Gestational diabetes: Metformin is effective and safe as insulin for the management of gestational diabetes. Women with gestational diabetes treated with metformin have less weight gain during pregnancy compared with those treated with insulin. Babies born to women treated with this drug have been found to develop less visceral fat, making them less predisposed to insulin resistance in later life. Polycystic ovary syndrome: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a condition which is commonly associated with insulin resistance. However, UK and international clinical practice guidelines do not recommend metformin for the first-line treatment or even do not recommend it at all, except for women with glucose intolerance. Pharmacophore structure: Information about the chemical structure of the drug Metformin belongs to the class of organic compounds known as biguanides. These are organic compounds that have two N-linked guanidines. Metformin hydrochloride is a white to off-white crystalline substance It is easily soluble in water and is practically insoluble in acetone, ether, and chloroform. The pKa of Metformin is 12.4. The pH of a 1% aqueous solution of Metformin hydrochloride is 6.68. The inactive ingredients in tablets with metformin are: pregelatinized starch, povidone (K-30), povidone (K-90), and magnesium stearate. What are the different dosage forms and strengths of the drug Metformin is available in form of solution and tablets (film coated and extended release) in the following dosage forms: 500, 850 and 1000mg. Metformin reduces glucose levels in blood by decreasing the hepatic glucose production and intestinal glucose absorption, and by improving cell sensitivity to insulin by increasing peripheral uptake of glucose and utilization. These effects are mediated by the initial activation of AMP-activated protein kinase which is a liver enzyme that plays a significant role in insulin signalization, energy balance, and the metabolism of glucose and lipids. Activation of AMP- protein kinase is needed for inhibitory effect of metformin on liver cell production. Increased peripheral utilization of glucose is caused by improved insulin binding to its receptors. Metformin administration also increases AMP- protein kinase in skeletal muscle cells. AMP- protein kinase is known to cause deployment of GLUT-4 to the cell plasma membrane, which results in insulin-independent glucose uptake. The rare side effect called lactic acidosis can be caused by decreased liver uptake of lactate, which is one of the substrates of gluconeogenesis. Patients who have healthy renal function, the slight excess are simply cleared. However, patients who have severe renal impairment the accumulation of lactic acid can be clinically significant. Conditions such as severe hepatic disease and acute/decompensated heart failure may precipitate lactic acidosis. There is no fixed dosage of metformin for the treatment of hyperglycemia in patients who have diabetes type two. Dosage of metformin must be individualized on the basis of both effectiveness and tolerance, and the maximum recommended daily doses must not be exceeded. The maximum recommended daily dose of Metformin is 2550 mg for adults and 2000 mg for pediatric patients (10 to 16 years of age). Metformin should be given in divided doses during meals. Treatment with metformin should be started with a low dose, with gradual escalation of dose, by reducing gastrointestinal side effects and permitting identification of the lowest dose that is required for appropriate glycemic control of the patient. At the beginning of therapy and during dose titration, fasting plasma glucose should be used to determine therapeutic response to Metformin and for the identification of the minimum effective dose for each patient. Therefore, glycosylated hemoglobin – HbA1c should be measured at intervals of every month. The therapeutic target should be decreasing both fasting plasma glucose and HbA1c levels to normal by using the lowest effective dose of metformin either when used as monotherapy or together with sulfonylurea or insulin. Short-term administration of Metformin may be appropriate during periods of transient loss of control in patients usually well-controlled on diet alone. – Clinically significant responses are not seen at doses below 1500 mg per day in general. However, a lower starting dose and gradually increased dosage is advised for minimization of gastrointestinal symptoms. The usual starting dose of Metformin is 500 mg twice per day or 850 mg once per day and these drugs should be given during meals. Dosage increases should be made in increments of 500 mg weekly or 850 mg every 2 weeks, up to a maximum dose of 2000 mg daily, and it should be given in divided doses. Patients can also be titrated from 500 mg twice a day to 850 mg twice a day after 2 weeks. For those patients requiring additional glycemic control, Metformin may be given to a maximum daily dose of 2550 mg per day. For doses above 2000 mg may have better toleration if they are given three times a day during meals. If higher doses of metformin are needed, Metformin should be used at maximum daily doses up to 2550 mg administered in divided doses. – The usual initial dose of Metformin is 500 mg twice per day, given during meals. Dosage increases should be made in increments of 500 mg by week up to a maximum dose of 2000 mg per day, given in divided doses. What are the pharmacokinetic properties of the drug : Pharmacokinetic studies have shown that absolute bioavailability of a 500mg Metformin tablet given under fasting conditions is around 50% – 60%. Studies that have used single oral doses of Metformin 500 mg to 1500 mg, and 850 mg to 2550 mg, show that there is a lack of dose in proportion with increasing doses, which is because of decreased absorption rather than an alteration in elimination. Food can decrease the extent of and in small amount delays the metformin absorption. : Metformin only slightly bound to plasma proteins, in contrast to sulfonylureas drugs used for the treatment of diabetes type 2, which have more than 90% protein bound. Metformin partitions into erythrocytes, is in a function of time. At usual therapy doses and dosing schedules of Metformin, steady-state plasma concentrations are reached within 24 to 48 hours. Controlled clinical trials of Metformin HCl, showed that maximum metformin plasma levels did not exceed 5 mcg/mL, even at highest doses. : Intravenous single-dose studies showed that metformin is excreted unchanged in the urine and does not have an impact on hepatic metabolism. Renal clearance is approximately 3.5 times greater compared to creatinine clearance, which indicates that the major route of metformin elimination is tubular secretion. : If renal function is normal, there are no differences between single or multiple-dose pharmacokinetics of metformin between patients with type 2 diabetes and healthy patients nor is there any accumulation of metformin in either group at usual clinical doses. : In patients with decreased renal function, the plasma and half-life of metformin in blood can be prolonged and the renal clearance is decreased in proportionally to the decrease in clearance of creatinine. : There are no relevant studies for the patients with hepatic insufficiency. : Studies showed that in healthy elderly patients total plasma clearance of metformin is decreased, and that the half-life is prolonged, so maximal concentrations of metformin in blood are increased, in comparison with healthy adults. From these data, it appears that the change in metformin pharmacokinetics with aging is primarily attributed to a change in renal function. Therapy with metformin should not be given in patients older than ≥80 years unless levels of creatinine clearance demonstrate that renal function is not reduced. What special precautions should I follow/ What should I avoid while using Metformin? Before taking this medicine, patients should tell their doctor or pharmacist if they are allergic to metformin; or if they have any other allergies. Products with metformin may contain inactive ingredients that can cause allergic reactions or other problems. Before using this medicine, patients should tell their doctor or pharmacist their medical history, especially if they ever had or have: breathing problems such as obstructive lung disease and asthma, blood problems such as anemia or vitamin B12 deficiency, kidney or liver disease. Patients should tell their doctors that they are using metformin before having surgery or any X-ray scanning procedure that use injectable iodinated contrast material. Patients may experience blurred vision, drowsiness or dizziness, or due to extremely low or high blood sugar levels. They should not drive, use machinery, or do any activity that requires alertness or clear vision until they are sure that they can perform such activities safely. Patients should limit the usage of alcohol while using this medication because alcohol can increase the risk of lactic acidosis and low blood sugar can be developed. High fever, diuretic such as hydrochlorothiazide, too much sweating, prolonged diarrhea, and vomiting may cause dehydration and increase the risk of lactic acidosis. Patients should stop taking metformin and tell their doctor if they have prolonged diarrhea or vomiting. It may be harder to control your blood sugar when your body is stressed (such as due to fever, infection, injury, or surgery). Consult your doctor because increased stress may require a change in your treatment plan, medications, or blood sugar testing. Geriatric patients may be at higher risk for side effects such as low blood sugar or lactic acidosis. Pregnant patients should use this medication only when it is clearly needed. Patients should discuss the risks and benefits with their doctor. Doctor may direct to use insulin instead of . Metformin can make changes in the menstrual cycle, such as promote ovulation and this drug may also increase the risk of becoming pregnant. , but only in small amounts. Patients should consult their doctor before breast-feeding. Which pregnancy category (A; B; C; D; X) has been assigned to Metformin? Metformin has been given pregnancy category B by the FDA. Recent findings strongly suggest that abnormal concentrations of glucose in blood during pregnancy are associated with a higher incidence of congenital abnormalities. Most health professionals recommend that insulin should be used during pregnancy to maintain blood glucose levels in blood as close to normal as possible. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, Metformin should not be used during pregnancy only if it is clearly needed. There are no relevant and well-controlled studies in pregnant women with Metformin administration. Studies showed that Metformin were not teratogenic in rabbits and rats at doses up to 600 mg/kg per day which is about two and six times the maximum recommended human daily dose of 2000 mg based on body surface area comparisons for rats and rabbits. Studies conducted on lactating rats show that metformin can be excreted into milk and reach levels which are comparable to those in blood. However, similar studies have not been conducted in nursing mothers. Because of metformin can cause hypoglycemia in nursing, a decision should be made whether to withdraw nursing or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mothers health. If Metformin is withdrawn, and if diet alone is unsuccessful for controlling the levels of blood glucose, insulin therapy should be considered. What should I know about storage and disposal of this medication This medication should be kept in the container it came in, out of reach of children and tightly closed. It should be stored at room temperature and away from extra heat and moisture (not in the bathroom). Outdated medications should be thrown away. Patients should talk with their pharmacist about the proper disposal of this medication. What special dietary instructions should I follow Patients should follow all exercise and dietary recommendations made by their doctor or dietitian. It is important to eat a healthful diet. The missed dose should be taken as soon as patients remember it. However, if it is almost time for the next dose, patients should skip the missed dose and continue the regular dosing schedule. They should never take a double dose to make up for a missed one. The table below shows the incidence of side effects after Metformin administration in recommendable doses. The incidence can be increased if this drug is overdosed. Asthenia, Diarrhea, Flatulence, Weakness, Myalgia, Upper respiratory tract infection, Hypoglycemia, GI complaints, Lactic acidosis (rare), Low serum vitamin B-12, Nausea/vomiting, Chest discomfort, Chills, Dizziness, Abdominal distention, Constipation, Heartburn, Dyspepsia Next table shows the incidence of side effects from the clinical study conducted in US. 141 patients received Metformin therapy (up to 2550 mg per day) and 145 patients received placebo. Gastrointestinal side effects are very common after metformin usage; it is most common after metformin initial administration, or when the dose is increased. The gastrointestinal discomfort can be avoided by beginning at a low dose and increasing the dose gradually. Long-term administration of metformin can cause increase levels of homocysteine levels and malabsorption of vitamin B12. Higher doses and prolonged usage are associated with increased incidence of vitamin B12 deficiency, and some researchers recommend screening or prevention strategies. What is Lactic Acidosis and how can Metformin cause it The most serious potential side effect of Metformin and other biguanidines administration is lactic acidosis, a physiological condition that is characterized with low pH value in body tissues and blood (acidosis) accompanied by the accumulation of lactate, especially L-lactate, and is considered a different form of metabolic acidosis. Metformin-associated lactic acidosis has the incidence of 9/100 000 persons a year. Lactate uptake by the liver is reduced after metformin administration because lactate is important substrate for hepatic gluconeogenesis – process which metformin inhibits. In healthy individuals, this lactate is simply cleared by other mechanisms through the kidneys, and there is no significant elevation of lactate in blood. However, when impaired renal function exists, clearance of metformin and lactate is reduced, and this can lead to increased levels of both, and possibly causing an accumulation of lactic acid. Because Metformin decreases liver uptake of lactate, any condition such as alcoholism, heart failure or respiratory disease (due to inadequate oxygenation of tissues) may precipitate lactic acidosis is a contraindication to its use. Typical signs and symptoms of lactic acidosis are: nausea, vomiting, muscle weakness and rapid breathing. Does Metformin have any interaction with other drugs? : Studies showed decreases in glyburide maximal concentrations in blood after concomitant use with metformin. : Furosemide can increase metformin plasma concentration without any significant change in metformin renal clearance. : Nifedipine can increase plasma concetration of metformin and also the amount excreted in the urine. Nifedipine appears to increase the absorption of metformin. Metformin have minimal effects on nifedipine. : Cationic drugs such as: morphine, procainamide, quinidine, amiloride, digoxin, , quinine, ranitidine, triamterene, trimethoprim, or vancomycin that are eliminated by renal tubular secretion theoretically may have the potential for interaction with metformin by competing for common renal tubular transport systems. : Some drugs such as corticosteroids, phenothiazines, thiazides and other diuretics, phenytoin, nicotinic acid, sympathomimetics, calcium channel blocking drugs, thyroid products, estrogens, oral contraceptives and isoniazid can produce hyperglycemia and may lead to loss of glycemic control. : Intravascular contrast iodinated materials can lead to acute alteration of renal function and have been associated with lactic acidosis in patients who were receiving metformin. Thus, patients should temporarily discontinue Metformin at the time of or prior to the procedure. : In patients, with renal dysfunction, renal function should be assessed more frequently and Metformin should be discontinued if evidence of renal impairment is present. : Hypoglycemia does not occur in patients who are receiving Metformin alone under usual circumstances of administration, but could occur when caloric intake is deficient, when exercises are not compensated by caloric supplementation or during concomitant use with other glucose-lowering agents or ethanol. : Cardiovascular collapse from whatever cause, acute congestive heart failure, acute myocardial infarction and other conditions characterized by hypoxemia have been associated with lactic acidosis and may also cause prerenal azotemia. When such events occur in patients on Metformin therapy, the drug should be promptly discontinued. : Metformin HCl therapy should be temporarily suspended before any surgical procedure (except minor procedures) and should not be restarted until the patient’s oral intake has resumed and renal function has been evaluated as normal. : Alcohol can potentiate the effects of metformin on lactate metabolism. Patients, should be warned against excessive alcohol intake, acute or chronic, while receiving Metformin therapy. Impaired hepatic function: Since impaired hepatic function has been associated with some cases of lactic acidosis, Metformin should generally be avoided in patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of hepatic disease. : Clinical studies showed that Metformin can decrease levels of vitamin B12 without clinical manifestations. However, such decrease, possibly due to interference with B12 absorption from the B12-intrinsic factor complex, is very rarely associated with anemia and appears to be reversible with withdrawal of Metformin or with Vitamin B12 supplementation. https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/meds/a696005.html#overdose http://www.chemspider.com/Chemical-Structure.3949.html?rid=0bbee5dc-eade-436f-96d1-7698eeff65ed http://www.druglib.com/druginfo/metformin/warnings_precautions/ http://reference.medscape.com/drug/glucophage-metformin-342717#4 http://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB00331#properties http://www.mayoclinic.org/drugs-supplements/metformin-oral-route/precautions/drg-20067074 http://www.drugs.com/pro/metformin.html https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000391.htm https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/4091 6 Unconventional Weight Loss Tips That Will Actually Work Popular Heartburn Drug Contains Chemicals Linked To Cancer 10 Diet and Weight Loss Products Available at Urban Outfitters Aspirin Linked To Higher Survival Rates For Head, Neck, and Lung Cancers Vitamin D Supplements May Slow Diabetes Progression Eating Between Certain Hours Can Accelerate Weight Loss 3 Mistakes You’re Making When Exercising In the Heat © 2021 All texts are the intellectual property of this site.

It is one of those essential molecules which are important for life and nearly all cells in the body are capable of synthesizing these lipid molecules. It is can also ingested from animal derived foods. Cholesterol is a lipid soluble substance that is even though carried through the bloodstream but does not mix in blood because blood is water soluble. For easy transfer of cholesterol through the blood stream, it is packed in combination with protein molecules. These molecules are called as lipoproteins. Lipoproteins are classified into three types: Low density lipoproteins (LDL) – called as ‘bad’ cholesterol High density lipoproteins (HDL) – called as ‘good’ cholesterol Cholesterol is utilized in the body for a variety of purposes. It acts a precursor in the synthesis of Vitamin D in skin. When exposed to sunlight, through a series of reaction, cholesterol is converted to Vitamin D (Cholecalciferol). It is an important component required for proper nerve functions. Nerves are covered with myelin sheath which is made up of cholesterol and fat. Moreover, adrenal and gonadal hormones are also made up of cholesterol. These hormones are released during stress and are energy handling and reproductive hormones. For the complete and proper development, infant’s brain needs cholesterol. Human breast milk contains a large amount of cholesterol. Recent studies have revealed that it has been helpful in older patients with declining memory. It also helps in making of the digestive bile acids in the intestines. It also helps in the digestion of food in the gastrointestinal tract. To perform many of its functions, the route of cholesterol transfer is that it is transported from liver to cells, tissues and glands on low density lipoprotein carriers. The reverse transport is done by high density lipoprotein carriers. Cholesterol is only found in animal tissues where it is a component of cell membrane. This is the reason why there is more cholesterol in lean tissues rather than in adipose cells. Cholesterol synthesis is increased to a greater extent from the consumption of polyunsaturated fatty acids than those synthesized from the consumption of saturated fatty acids. This is primarily because  the polyunsaturated fatty acids are deposited  in the cell membranes as a result of which body needs to add more cholesterol in these membranes to stabilize them and maintain their fluidity. Cholesterol, when animal derived food is consumed, only about 50% is absorbed. When the synthesis of cholesterol is more or the utilization of cholesterol in places where it is used is less, the blood cholesterol levels are raised. The increase in blood cholesterol levels can also be due to high intake of saturated fatty acids. The condition itself does not present any signs or symptoms which is a major drawback because many people are unaware that their blood cholesterol levels are high. It has been recommended that everyone above 20 years of age should get tested for cholesterol every 5 years. This test is commonly known as ‘Lipid Profile’ which is done after 8-10 hours of fasting. This test gives information on For determining the levels of cholesterol on body, a general range is set, which is as follows: The lipoprotein panel will give your healthcare provider information about your: Total cholesterol is a parameter that measures the total amount of cholesterol in your blood, including low-densitylipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. LDL, or “bad,” cholesterol is the main source of cholesterol buildup and blockages in the arteries. HDL, or “good,” cholesterol helps remove cholesterol from systemic circulation. . Triglycerides are  also a type of fat found in your blood. Some studies suggest that a high level of triglycerides in the blood may raise the risk of causing coronary heart disease, especially in women. Hypercholesterolemia or high levels of cholesterol in the blood can be caused by a number of factors, some of which are modifiable such as obesity, diet, stress, exercise and some are non-modifiable such as genetic factors. Apart from there are a number of medical conditions which increase circulating cholesterol levels such as diabetes mellitus type 2, obesity, alcohol, monoclonal gammopathy, dialysis, nephrotic syndrome, hypothyroidism, Cushing’s syndrome, anorexia nervosa. Finally there are medications which affect cholesterol metabolism and excretion and therefore they may also cause hypercholesterolemia. Usually a person suffering from hypercholesterolemia is at risk due to presence of multiple risk factors. A small proportion of all people suffering from hypercholesterolemia have an inherited form of hypercholesterolemia. The most common cause of inherited high cholesterol is due to mutations of the gene LDLR.  This condition is known as familial hypercholesterolemia. The LDLR gene is translated for making a protein called low-density lipoprotein receptor. This type of receptor binds to particles circulating low-density lipoproteins (LDLs), which are the primary carriers of cholesterol in the blood and removes them from the blood. This way these receptors play a vital role in reducing circulating cholesterol levels. Mutation in this gene will result in either a reduced number of LDL receptors being synthesized or it will disrupt the receptors’ ability to remove low-density lipoproteins from the bloodstream. Other mutations which cause dyslipidemias particularly hypercholesterolemia are mutations in the APOB, LDLRAP1, or PCSK9 gene. Another form of inherited hypercholesterolemia known as familial defective apolipoprotein B-100 (FDB) is due to mutations of the APOB gene. Mutations of the LDLRAP1 gene result in another type of inherited high cholesterol called autosomal recessive hypercholesterolemia (ARH). These genes make proteins which are essential for the normal function of low-density lipoprotein receptors; therefore mutations in any of these genes can alter the receptors’ function or prevent the cell from making functional receptors. Most of these mutations have an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance while the LDLRAP1 gene has an autosomal recessive pattern. Despite the identification of these genes, it has been found that mutations in a single gene usually do not result in high cholesterol and it is also the presence of environmental factors which triggers the effect of these genes. Also there is huge variation in the effect of these mutations and these effects vary person to person. Therefore it has been postulated that other genes might also have an impact on the normal function of the LDL receptors and researchers are trying to find out the complete set of genes which is responsible for metabolism of cholesterol. This way they are hopeful of finding the ‘missing link’ between hypercholesterolemia and genetic factors responsible for it. Obesity has been linked with a derangement of the entire cholesterol panel. It has been linked with a decreased amount of HDL (good cholesterol) and increase and increase in triglycerides and LDL (bad cholesterol). Basically the body’s response to the changes in dietary fats is diminished. Following theories have been suggested for this: The pathways which synthesize, use and excrete LDL are disturbed so that more LDL is produced than is excreted. Ideally it should be the opposite when large amounts of dietary fats are consumed however there is hormonal disturbance in obesity and the close regulation of LDL levels is lost leading to hypercholesterolemia. One of the complications of obesity is inflammation. It has been suggested that the cytokines released during inflammation have a role in blunting the metabolic response to consuming fats. Insulin resistance is another common finding in obesity. While the common understanding is that insulin is responsible for storing carbohydrates in the body, however its function is much more than that. This hormone acts as a regulator for a couple of vital steps in the fat metabolism pathways, so when cells become resistant to insulin, insulin no longer reaches the site of metabolism (which is happening inside the cell) and as a result there is a deranged response of body to consuming fats. The relationship between stress and high cholesterol levels has been studied and while the exact cause is unknown, two well-known and currently accepted reasons for this association are as follows: One study concluded that when a person is under stress he is unlikely to care about himself and then develops poor dietary habits and may even put on some extra weight. Both these factors are known to contribute towards high cholesterol. This was found to be particularly true in men. When under stress, there is an inflammatory response in our body. To overcome this and to prepare for a potential ‘fight or flight’ situation, the adrenal glands of our body secrete adrenaline as well as cortisol. The short term beneficial effect of these hormones is that they increase the blood flow to the brain and provide an increase amount of energy for our body. The do so by breaking down the stores of glycogen in the liver. In the presence of stress, these hormones will be secreted for longer periods of time and this prolonged hyperglycemia will activate the pathway which converts glucose to triglycerides and eventually cholesterol. Another theory which stems out from the same concept is that if these hormones stay in the body for longer periods of time, they start to break the fats as well and this will cause the circulating cholesterol levels in our bloods to rise. Smoking is another environmental factor which has been associated with high cholesterol levels. The most well-known effect of smoking on the body is that decreases the levels of the protective cholesterol, HDL. It does so by putting the cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) into overdrive.  This protein mediates the transfer of HDL to LDL cholesterol. So the net effect is that HDL levels are reduced and converted to a form of cholesterol which is difficult to excrete causing hypercholesterolemia. When the HDL levels are decreased, their beneficial effects are lost and the smoker becomes susceptible to heart disease. Another effect of smoking is that acrolein in cigarettes inhibit the enzyme which keeps the LDL molecule intact. When this enzyme is inhibited the LDL molecule disintegrates and becomes susceptible to oxidation. After oxidation the molecule structure of LDL is changed and our immune system starts treating the oxidized LDL as a foreign agent releasing white blood cells against it. These cells bring about an inflammatory response which damages the blood vessels, particularly coronary arteries of our heart. Regular exercise causes a decrease in LDL levels and increase in HDL levels. Exercise stimulates the transfer of LDL from the blood to the liver from where it is either converted to HDL or excreted into the bile. Therefore a person not doing enough exercise will lose this beneficial affect that exercise brings and will be at high risk of developing hypercholesterolemia. Severe intensity exercise is more beneficial that moderate intensity, however if you have not being exercising for years now you should consult your doctor first so that he can evaluate for cardiovascular fitness through treadmill test. The two most well-known offenders in our diet which cause an increase in cholesterol levels are saturated fats and trans fats. Saturated fat and cholesterol are found in foods that originate from animals, such as meats, egg yolks, whole milk, butter, and cheese. It is found to raise total blood cholesterol levels and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels. They have been linked with an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes. Trans fat is mainly found in packaged foods and fried foods, such as chips, cookies, and crackers and have been linked to increase unhealthy LDL cholesterol and lower healthy high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. Diabetic dyslipidemia is the term given to the lipid profile changes seen in diabetes and is classically characterized by high plasma triglyceride concentration, low HDL cholesterol concentration and increased concentration of small dense LDL-cholesterol particles. Multiple Risk Factor Intervention Trial (MRFIT) studied the relationship between total cholesterol and cardiovascular disease mortality. It was found that hypercholesterolemia and mortality are directly related. However, if a person is also suffering from diabetes, the spike in mortality is rather dramatic and hence worrisome. Patients suffering from non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus or type II diabetes mellitus show increased amounts of free fatty acids in their plasma. These fatty acids are attributed to inhibit insulin-stimulated glucose uptake into muscle and hence cause insulin resistance. Increased amounts of free fatty acids in their plasma would mean that they will now be increased transport of these molecules into the liver. There they are seen to stimulate a cascade of events which will lead to the production and then secretion of VLDL (major source of triglyceride) into the blood. When VLDL is secreted, its triglyceride is exchange for HDL cholesteryl ester. The resultant HDL molecule is triglyceride rich and becomes a substrate for hepatic lipase or lipoprotein lipase. When the TG-rich HDL undergoes hydrolysis by these enzymes, the molecular structure is changed and the major HDL protein, apolipoprotein A-I or apoA-I for short can no longer bind with the lipid-poor HDL. As a result HDL molecule disintegrates and apoA-I is then excreted in the urine. These events are the reason why there is high plasma triglyceride concentration, low HDL cholesterol concentration and increased concentration of small dense LDL-cholesterol particles. Thus, increased free fatty acid transport in plasma which leads to an insulin-resistant states, may be the underlying cause for the lipid abnormalities seen in diabetes collectively called ‘diabetic dyslipidemia’. Hypothyroidism is another endocrine disease which causes an increase in cholesterol levels. It is now a well-documented fact that thyroid hormones stimulate the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase enzyme, which is the first step in cholesterol biosynthesis. Furthermore, triiodothyronine (T) binds with its intracellular receptor and then the hormone-receptor complex binds with the specific thyroid hormone responsive elements on the LDL receptor gene to stimulate the production of LDL receptors. As discussed before, these receptors function to remove the circulating LDL. Therefore hypothyroidism, in which there is decreased plasma thyroid hormone concentration, will lead to hypercholesterolemia. Another interesting idea is that it is actually the high levels of TSH and not a decrease in thyroid hormones which cause increase in cholesterol levels. In this regard, two authentic studies were carried out in China. The inclusion criteria was that only those patients can become part of this who were not taking any medications nor had health problems that could impact the TSH, thyroid hormone or cholesterol tests. Both these studies found that there as the TSH levels rise, the blood cholesterol levels rise too. This holds true even when TSH levels are at the upper limit of the normal range and the patient is not suffering from hypothyroidism. Therefore, these studies hypothesize that TSH levels may also effect on the lipid profile and that this is not dependent on the thyroid hormone levels Nephrotic syndrome is a set of abnormalities in kidney functions that lead to low serum levels of albumin and caused edema in such patients. In patients suffering from such patients there has been, both increased synthesis and has been a decrease in the clearance of lipoproteinemia. This has often complicated the disease and has led to increased lDL molecules. This hyperlipoprotenemia may also be linked with increased levels of triglycerides in blood, thus increasing the concentration of Apo C, Apo E and Apo B molecules. This increase in the synthesis is possibly due to increased availability of mevalonate as a substrate in the synthesis of cholesterol. Moreover, urinary loss of HDL molecules and other major liporegulatory factors causes a decrease in the activity of lipolytic enzymes. All this has led to the impairment in clearance cholesterol and triglyceride thus leading to high blood levels. Anorexia nervosa is an eating disorder leading to disturbance in a person’s body weight and eventually changes in shape. There have been cases where the patients have suffered from dangerous levels in decrease in body weight. However, it has been observed in such patients that these patients have surprisingly high plasma levels of cholesterol in their bodies. People suffering from anorexia nervosa are basically avoiding the intake of food with calories and since these food also contain enough amounts of cholesterol that can contribute significantly to increase in weight. However, there has been an unusual trend. The high cholesterol levels of cholesterol in these patients are possibly due to genetic mutation. Over 150 genes are linked either directly or indirectly with this disorder. Research has shown that mutation in any one of these genes especially that which is linked which is responsible with the production of cholesterol both due to dietary intake and internal cholesterol. This genetic mutation has also largely contributed towards behavioral changes. In anorexic patients, the assumptions are made that their abilities to withstand severe malnutrition is made easier for the patients to survive. Monoclonal gammopathy as a cause of high cholesterol Patient suffering from monoclonal gammopathy have been observed with low HDL phenotype and there have been accumulation of cholesterol molecules. This accumulation of cholesterol was due to the reduction of HDL capacity of promoting cholesterol efflux from macrophages. When high levels of plasma cytokines (TNFα and IL-6), soluble cytokine receptors were observed in patients suffering from necrobiotic xanthogranuloma with monoclonal gammopathy. This revealed a specific xanthoma which correlated with the plasma levels of anti-inflammatory HDL. These xanthomas are yellowish cholesterol rich material present in large sized foam cells. Studies have recently proved that necrobiotic xanthogranuloma is described by impaired lipid macrophage homeostasis associated with a systemic inflammatory profile. This inflammatory may be a result from possible interaction of Mlg (monoclonal immuglobulin) and lipoproteins. Pathalogically this has caused the formation of lesions on skin or in visceral regions which are due to cholesterol accumulation and monoclonal immunoglobulin (MIg). The lesions were mostly nodules or plaques. Monoclonal gamopathy therapy can be thus a very useful treatment. Liver is the center of metabolism for all pathways; hence it is not surprising that when it is suffering from disease, particularly liver cirrhosis, all its metabolic functions will be disrupted. As a result breakdown of triglycerides and LDL will be reduced leading to both hypercholesterolemia and hypertriglyceremia. Other possible mechanisms suggested for this decrease are increased supply in diet (people consuming medicine from non-authentic practitioners are found to have a number of adulterations and since their liver is not functionally correctly, there might be accumulation of those adulterations and nutrients). A rather unusual finding in some of these patients is that while their lipid profile is disturbed, they show no increase incidence of cardiovascular events. One of the reasons is that a diseased liver goes into protective mode and secretes more HDL, which is cardio protective. However other studies have found that while in some cases HDL may rise; people suffering from nutritional deficiency or familial hypercholesterolemia still show a lower HDL level so there must be another reason for this. Primary biliary cirrhosis as a cause of high cholesterol Primary biliary cirrhosis is an autoimmune disease of hepatobiliary tract characterized by slow, progressive destruction of the small bile ducts of the liver, causing bile and other toxins to build up in the liver, a condition called cholestasis. Cholesterol is an important constituent of bile, a fluid produced by liver and stored in the gallbladder which aids in the digestion of fats. Destruction of passages, first extrahepatic and then intrahepatic, and then the acini (secretory cells arranged in glandular form are called acini) will setup a situation where cholesterol is no longer utilized for this purposes leading to its accumulation and casing hypercholesterolemia.  is a collection of symptoms and signs shown by the body due to prolonged exposure to cortisol. Cortisol, a glucocorticoid, causes hyperglycemia and prolonged hyperglycemia will activate the pathways which convert blood sugar into lipids including cholesterol. Starting at puberty, men often have lower levels of HDL cholesterol compared to women. As women and men age, their LDL cholesterol levels in blood often rise. Before age 55, women usually have lower LDL cholesterol levels than men. However, after age 55, women can have higher LDL levels than men. There are a number of drugs which can cause hypercholesterolemia. The pathophysiology is different for each drug. Diuretics: Both thiazide diuretics (hydrochlorothiazide, metalozone) and loop diuretics (furosemide) can cause hypercholesterolemia. The mechanism is unknown but it is thought to be due to worsened insulin sensitivity and/or reflex activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) and sympathetic nervous system in response to volume depletion. Amiodarone: This drug decreases plasma and tissue triiodothyronine (T) due to which there is hypercholesterolemia Beta blockers: β receptors are present on a number of tissues including pancreas and skeletal muscle. So when β blockers without intrinsic sympathetic activity block these receptors, there is a slight metabolic disturbance in some people causing hypercholesterolemia. Steroids: They cause hypercholesterolemia the same way steroidal hormones cause in stress or Cushing’s syndrome. Anticonvulsants: Phenytoin and carbamazepine are two anticonvulsants notorious for causing raised cholesterol levels. They do so by stimulation of hepatic enzymes, one of which is cholesterase. They also increase the hepatic synthesis of bile acids. These acids increase the amount of cholesterol which is being absorbed in the intestines by facilitating micelle formation. Birth pills: Birth pills contain estrogen and progesterone. Progesterone decreases HDL and increases LDL while estrogen does the opposite. Therefore it is recommended that birth pills should contain more estrogen than progesterone but even after this one should take these pills with caution. Others: cyclosporine and protease inhibitors are other drugs which cause high cholesterol however the mechanism by which they do so is still unknown. The main focus in cholesterol lowering treatment is to decrease the levels of low density lipoproteins (LDL) – the bad cholesterol. The higher the number of LDL molecules, the greater the risk for the person to develop heart diseases. There are two main ways to lower the cholesterol levels this includes a diet consists of food have low cholesterol levels, more physical activity, and proper weight management. This strategy of lifestyle changes is the first and on top most priority for those people who have LDL greater than normal range. when the total cholesterol levels or LDL levels are high in category, drugs either single or in combination of more than one are prescribed along with the recommended changes in lifestyle. Treatment is made depending on which category is the patient falls into: Category I, highest risk: when the LDL is less than 100 mg/dl. The plan is to initiate the low cholesterol diet. This will slow down the process of development of atherosclerotic plaque. If the LDL is 100 or above, it is better to start the drug treatment along with modifications made in lifestyle. However in certain cases here the LDL levels are below 100mg/dl but the patient have recently recovered from heart attack or angina then the doctor will recommend drugs too. Category II, Next highest risk: when the LDL levels are 130mg/dl or above, a plan of drug treatment along with lifestyle changes. If the person is only going for lifestyle changes and the goal of 130mg/dl is not achieved even after 3 months, drug treatment is necessary along with lifestyle changes. When the LDL goals are achieved of reaching 130mg/dl, a need for continuing with the healthy diet, which involves a little more intake of saturated fat and cholesterol than with the lifestyle changes. Category III, Moderate risk: goal is to keep the LDL levels below 130mg/dl. If the LDL levels after testing is 160mg/dl or above even after 3 months of continuous changes of lifestyles, drug treatment should be started in conjunction to lifestyle changes. When the levels of low density lipoproteins (LDL) decrease below 130mg/dl, all those who are at a risk with heart diseases should maintain their healthy diet. Category IV, low to moderate risk: when LDL goals is less than 160mg/dl. If the LDL is 160mg/dl or above, there is a need to start with the recommended lifestyle. However it is preferred to start the drug treatment with physical activities and healthy diet chosen for such a patient, especially when the LDL levels is 190mg/dl or more. Lowering cholesterol levels with lifestyle changes Any changes made in ones’ lifestyle for a therapeutic purpose, these are termed as therapeutic lifestyle changes (TLC). TLC include a range of things that can be done to lower the body’s cholesterol levels specifically LDL levels. These include: The TLC diet: for patients with high cholesterol levels a change is diet is required. A saturated fat, low cholesterol plan that only provides less than 7 percent of calories from saturated fat and less than 200mg of dietary cholesterol per day. A proper TLC diet demands to maintain a desirable weight and avoid getting overweighed or obese. If the LDL levels doesnot come to a desirable level only by reducing the intake of saturated or high cholesterol containing foods, an alternate that can be implied is to increase the intake of fiber content in diet. Fiber is rich in peas, beans, lentils etc. Another option to make the diet low cholesterol is to utilize those foods containing plant sterols (a well-known example is margarine) with the aim to lower the LDL levels in body. Protein rich food such as legumes which are full of nutritional riches. Nuts and seeds have shown to lower the LDL levels in blood. However to avoid getting overweighed, one must not consume more than 1 ounce daily. Weight management: when targeting for lowering blood cholesterol levels, taking a maintained diet is not only what it counts, it also depends on how much the person eats. Losing weight is a helpful strategy to lower the risk of heart diseases. Being overweight increases the chances of having a high level of LDL in blood. This is especially recommended to those who have high triglyceride levels or low HDL. Doctors recommend this to those men who have a waist measurement of more than 40 inches and women with more than 35 inches. However other measures can be taken to reduce the weight. While purchasing of food products, one must read the label attached and those giving less calories per serving should be preferred. Having 5-6 meals per day is healthier rather than consuming 3 large meals. Physical activity: a person should on daily basis whether he/she has high cholesterol levels or not, do exercise for at least 30minutes. It not only decreases the body mass but also helps to raise the HDL and lower LDL levels. Medicine is not the first solution to every therapeutic problem. However, when it is necessary the dose of the medicine should be kept as low as possible. However anti-lipids include a variety of drugs. Anti-lipids include statins, bile acid sequestrants, nicotinic acid, cholesterol absorption inhibitors and fibric acids. Depending on the individual cases, a doctor is at the best position to prescribe which drug is best. The statins are most commonly prescribed. They help to lower LDL but the only drawback is that it can cause myopathy. Bile acid sequestrants can be used alone or in combination with statins. Fibric acid are preferentially given to lower the triglycerides in blood and raise HDL. Cholesterol absorption inhibitors are given to those who have a habit of eating more. The first priority when drug treatment is prescribed is to lower the LDL levels. Once it is resolved, then the levels of triglycerides and HDL are considered. The blood cholesterol levels have a lot to cause heart diseases. It is counted as a risk factor. Risk factor is anything that makes a person prone to get a disease. When cholesterol level is higher, it starts accumulating in the arterial walls. This accumulation leads to the hardening of the walls ultimately constricting the lumen of the artery and decreasing the blood flow. The area where the LDL molecules have accumulated is called as plaque. When accumulated in the coronary artery has the highest chances to cause heart attack. If the flow of oxygen rich blood to heart is reduced or blocked, angina or heart attack can occur. Angina is a chest pain or discomfort. It may feel like pressure or squeezing in your chest. The pain may also occur in your shoulders, arms, neck, jaw or back. The pain of angina may be mis understood as indigestion. Heart attack occurs when the blood flow is completely cut off. If not quickly restored, the muscle starves and dies. This can prove fatal also. However, accumulation can also occur in other arteries that are responsible for providing oxygen rich blood to upper and lower limbs as well as to brain. This in turn will lead to other problems such a peripheral artery disease, stroke etc. Peripheral artery disease (PAD) occurs when there is buildup of the plaque in the arterial walls those which are supplying blood to kidneys, arms, stomach, legs and feet. With time as PAD progresses, symptoms start to occur more often even when the patient is at rest. People suffering from PAD are more prone to have stroke, heart attack or even limb amputations. Stroke occurs when the blood flow is reduced or cut off due to blockage by plaque in arterial walls. It is a medical emergency which should be immediately treated. Otherwise the part of brain which that specific nerve is supplying the blood will be deprived and the particular function performed that specific part of the brain is affected. Effects such paralysis, slurring of speech occur. “How far in advance should you start taking prenatal vitamins with minerals?” ““ 6 Unconventional Weight Loss Tips That Will Actually Work Popular Heartburn Drug Contains Chemicals Linked To Cancer 10 Diet and Weight Loss Products Available at Urban Outfitters Aspirin Linked To Higher Survival Rates For Head, Neck, and Lung Cancers Vitamin D Supplements May Slow Diabetes Progression Eating Between Certain Hours Can Accelerate Weight Loss 3 Mistakes You’re Making When Exercising In the Heat © 2021 All texts are the intellectual property of this site.

f506b3f5-273c-442e-89c4-7983b992c609,"Monday, 14 December 2020 Walking is one of the most popular forms of worldwide. It doesn’t require expensive equipment or special skills, and it delivers a wide range of health benefits. Whether you choose to walk outdoors in nature, on a suburban street, a treadmill, or do a few laps around the block or your office building, walking is an easy way to stay active. Walking increases your heart rate. This improves blood flow and can lower blood pressure. It helps to boost energy levels by releasing hormones like endorphins and delivers oxygen throughout the body. Brisk walking is considered a moderate-intensity, low-impact workout that does not put excess strain on joints (hip, knee, ankles) that are susceptible to injury with higher-impact workouts. People may think that walking is not as effective as higher-impact workouts like running. Yet studies of runners and walkers have found that when using an equal amount of energy, moderate-intensity walking offered similar benefits as higher-intensity running in reducing the risk of high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and diabetes. The faster the walking pace, the greater the risk reduction observed. Walking is an exercise associated with improving blood pressure and body mass index as well as lowering the risk of diabetes, stroke, and cardiovascular disease. Almost anyone can walk for exercise because walking speed, duration, and frequency can be adjusted to match your fitness level. Physical activity affects various metabolic responses that control blood glucose. Exercise immediately uses glucose for energy and improves the body’s response to insulin. It can prevent or delay type 2 diabetes and improve insulin sensitivity in those with type 1 diabetes. Exercise activates the muscles, which have receptors for insulin to promote the storage of glucose in muscle tissue both during and after exercise. Lowering the amount of glucose in the blood. Longer walks, higher intensity brisk walking or walking up stairs are more effective than a casual stroll in controlling levels. Interrupting long periods of sitting with 3-5 minutes of light walking every 30 minutes can also improve blood glucose control. Spacing exercise sessions throughout the week, rather than exercising for longer on only 1-2 days a week, appears to benefit insulin sensitivity. Exercising through walking also improves sleep. A recent walking study conducted with 490 healthy adults who added 30 minutes of walking to their daily routine reported improvements in sleep quality, sleep duration, and sleep latency (time to fall asleep). Walking appears to have a positive effect on , with the most evidence for depression.  Some research also shows benefit for anxiety, stress, and loneliness. There may be positive effects on mental health related to the walking setting, such as in forests, parks, and other outdoor and natural environments. However, research in this area is still limited and few studies have compared different types of walking on mental health (e.g: walking to work versus dog walking, or walking by choice versus for necessity). You’ve probably heard that 10,000 steps a day is a healthy goal. Some apps and pedometers have 10,000 steps earmarked, so that when you reach it, a congratulations screen dings or vibrates. Its nots a simple goal to reach as many of us sit more than stand, thanks to driving cars, sitting at office desks, or reclining in chairs at home. It may surprise you that the benchmark number of 10,000 is not actually based on science but was created as a marketing tactic in the 1960s by a company making pedometers. Generally, research finds that more steps are better but even a lower amount can achieve health benefits. A study following 4,840 men and women 40 years of age and older for about 10 years found that those taking at least 8,000 steps daily had a 51% lower death rate from all causes compared with those taking 4,000 steps or fewer. A large cohort of more than 16,000 older American women (mean age 72 years) from the Women’s Health Study followed for 4 years found that those taking 4,400 steps a day had a 41% lower death rate compared with those taking about 2,700 steps a day. Death rates continued to drop in relation to taking more steps up to 7,500 daily, but steps beyond that did not show additional benefit. Although these studies confirm that taking more steps is good, the exact amount to see a health benefit will vary for individuals.  Having the mindset to “move more and sit less throughout the day; doing some physical activity is better than none” is an appropriate goal for everyone. There’s nothing wrong with aiming for 10,000 steps or even higher, except when it becomes so daunting that you lose motivation, or you feel discouraged that a lesser amount is not good enough. Rather than feeling chained to a specific step count, listen to your body, challenge it, and feel good about what it can accomplish. The fitness benefits of walking are pretty clear, but what you may not realize is that walking also offers psychological perks. These come from increasing our awareness of the sights and sounds like looking trees, flowers or clouds, or paying attention to people or events happening as we walk past. Buddhist monks practice walking meditations, which concentrate on the movement or position of the arms or legs while walking, which leads to increased relaxation. Some studies have shown that this form of mindful walking can reduce blood pressure and depression. One randomized controlled trial lasting 12 weeks observed adults with type 2 diabetes performing a Buddhist walking meditation (walking on a treadmill while concentrating on footsteps by stating “Budd” and “Dha” with each step) or a traditional walking regimen.  Both groups walked at the same moderate intensity with a duration and frequency of 30 minutes 3 times a week. The walking meditation group resulted in lower fasting blood glucose levels, blood pressure, and cortisol levels than in participants doing a traditional walking regimen. Other studies have found that walking in nature, such as in a forest or alongside a river, can decrease negative moods like depression, anxiety, anger, fatigue, and confusion. Now that you know how beneficial walking can be for your physical and mental health why not trying to add more steps to your exercise routine. If you’re not used to walking start slow and build up over time. If you’re already a regular walker you can rest assured that each step you’re taking is supporting your health and wellbeing. Check out our helpful for hints and tips. Switch the type of walking in your routine to stay motivated and active.

b4aec922-5bab-43dc-ba73-704c1e963f62,"Friday, 27 November 2020 A new European position statement gives guidelines for optimum blood glucose levels (BGLs) before, during and after exercise for people with type 1 diabetes. The position statement covering children, adolescents and adults highlights the complexity of glucose management for those living with type 1 diabetes. The , from the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) and the International Society for Pediatric and Adolescent Diabetes (ISPAD), focuses on users. Decisions around intake, insulin correction or exercise timing are based on an assessment of the patient’s habitual physical activity, risk of hypoglycaemia and health status along with the type, intensity and duration of exercise, and data from sensor glucose values and trend arrows. “In this position statement, we detailed the use of sensor glucose values accompanied by trend arrows for CGM and (intermittently scanned) isCGM systems for different groups of people with type 1 diabetes and for different sensor glucose responses to exercise,” the statement said. “Of note, in this position statement, recommendations for carbohydrate consumption were stratified with respect to the rate of change in glucose for the pre-exercise phase, during exercise, post- exercise and the nocturnal post-exercise phase.” The recommendations represent initial guidance only and should be tailored for individual patients, the authors said. Co-author Dr Carmel Smart, from the Department of Paediatric Diabetes and Endocrinology at John Hunter Children’s Hospital in Newcastle, said the statement was complicated and put the onus on health professionals to translate for their patients. “From a practical point of view, there are a lot of people who have totally unplanned exercise and I think part of the problem with this paper is it is a mismatch between elite [exercise] people versus everyday people.” For example, the recommendations for sensor glucose targets during exercise were probably not as relevant for most people compared to the recommendations for before and after exercise. “Of those three timings, certainly if you are doing exercise for an hour and you are a kid who is relatively stable, then we would probably say pay attention to the ‘before exercise’. Are you trending down? If the glucose is 5 mmol/L and you are trending down, then you definitely need to have 15 grams of carbs.” “But if the arrow is going straight down, we might say you need to be up around the 20 gram mark [for carbohydrate ingestion] … if the arrow is flat, all good, just have your 10 grams.” “And then at the end of exercise, most people don’t look at it straight afterwards because it still tends to trend down. When they might look at it is going to bed. And if it is still trending down, we need to make sure we drop the [insulin] dose or have some additional carbohydrate then.” Dr Smart said clinical practice in Europe, where the position statement was written, was much more ‘arrows based’ than in Australia. “The feeling in our clinic is we achieve really good outcomes yet we don’t use arrows all the time.” However, she said the overall experience at John Hunter Children’s Hospital during COVID was that more children were using CGM. “We’re asking them a lot more because when you do telehealth, you need data and that is the best way to get data.” She said the key message to patients with type 1 diabetes who were active was that CGM data can help them improve their glycaemia around exercise. “Put it on. Keep it on. It’s fantastic to enable you to get the trends about what happens with blood glucose levels around exercise. If you are doing very high intensity exercise like sprinting or competition, you usually go high then go low later. Expect that. That’s normal. And CGM will show you that.” Switch the type of walking in your routine to stay motivated and active. One in three people over 65 will suffer a fall due to poor balance. It's time to assess your balance and improve it.

ee5f062d-96b5-4021-b146-ed5533de5ab7,"Friday, 25 September 2020 Regular exercise is a great way to manage and provides many other benefits to keep us healthy. Why do glucose levels sometimes rise during exercise? Exercise can help insulin work better, lower blood pressure and cholesterol levels, reduce the risk of heart disease, decrease stress and also assists with maintaining a healthy weight.  The effect exercise has on your blood glucose levels, however, will depend on the type, intensity and duration of your chosen activity.  Other variables might also include timing of medication and meals eaten before exercise. The general consensus is that exercise will lead to a reduction in blood glucose levels and help with long-term management. However, the short-term response can vary, particularly with high-intensity exercise such as running, interval exercise or .  With high-intensity exercise, there is an increase in your heart rate and the fast-paced movements cause the release of different hormones, including adrenaline.  This stimulates the release of glucose from places such as your liver to fuel this high intensity movement. As a result, you may see a short-term (over minutes to hours) increase in your blood glucose levels, but the long-term outcome (over one to two days) will bring about a sustained decrease in blood glucose levels.  So, if you’ve ever experienced an increase in your blood glucose levels shortly after this type of exercise, don’t be alarmed, this is a normal response. Alternatively, lower and moderate intensity exercise such as walking or swimming will lead to both a short-term and long-term reduction in your blood glucose levels, as this type of exercise utilises the excess glucose floating around in the bloodstream. This type of exercise is more sustainable for most people and forms part of the with the goal of 30 minutes of moderate intensity activity on most days of the week. It’s important to become familiar with your blood glucose levels in response to exercise. When starting a new exercise, it’s a good idea to check blood glucose levels before, during and after to see how your body reacts to different activities and to help with planning for future exercise sessions.  By understanding your response to exercise, you can avoid adverse events such as hypoglycaemia (lows) and hyperglycemia (highs). If your blood glucose level before exercise is over 15mmol/L, and it is unexplained, check your blood ketone levels. Mild to moderate aerobic exercise can be started if ketones are less than 0.6mmol/L.  Intense exercise should be avoided, however, and it’s recommended that blood glucose levels are checked during and after exercise. For more guidance with exercise, please see your doctor for a referral to an . Switch the type of walking in your routine to stay motivated and active.

8d4491ca-00b8-46b4-9a58-5b322abbc3e0,"Tuesday, 3 March 2020 Water is important for everyone, but when you are living with diabetes you are more susceptible to dehydration. Even a little dehydration during the day can impact your blood glucose levels. If you don’t drink enough water, the glucose in your bloodstream becomes more concentrated and that leads to higher . Your kidneys then have to work overtime to deal with the excess glucose, eventually expelling it from your body in your urine. The more you urinate the more likely you are to become dehydrated. Our bodies are made up of around 60-65% water, the major component that makes up blood volume is plasma, which is approximately 90% water, and our muscles, around 70%. When you consider these percentages it is quite easy to see the importance of staying hydrated. A major risk for dehydration is exercise – a 4% fluid loss can cause significant impairment to cognitive function. When you exercise your body loses heat through a variety of different ways, one of which includes evaporation (which requires water) in order to give off heat energy via sweat. Sweating is an important process for ensuring temperature regulation during intense bouts of physical activity. General guidelines suggest drinking around 3-3.5 litres per day for males and 2-2.5 litres per day for females. This includes water, food and other beverages. You’ve probably heard the advice that we should be drinking an 8 glasses of water per day, however when you are exercising you might need to consider increasing your total fluid intake to account for the water lost through sweat. It’s important to drink water before, during and after a workout to replenish the fluids lost during exercise, particularly if you’re exercising in hot conditions which can cause further physiological stress. Below are three simples tips you can try to ensure you are drinking enough fluids while exercising. Find yourself a bottle (preferably BPA free) and carry it with you wherever you go. This is great way to stay hydrated when exercising, during outdoor activities, or in the warmer months. Keeping a record of how much you drink is a great way to understand if you are staying well hydrated. There are plenty of mobile apps that can be helpful in tracking your water intake. Alternate between caffeinated and decaffeinated tea, coffee or sodas throughout the day. Caffeine is a diuretic and increases the excretion of water from the body as opposed to hydrating the body. This may be an important consideration if you are big coffee drinker. After 2020, we recommend aiming for achievable, realistic and fun goals in 2021.

Diabetes NSW & ACT, together with Abbott and Novo Nordisk partnered in events around the Sydney Harbour to show support for all people living with diabetes. Sturt Eastwood, CEO Diabetes NSW & ACT said: “We were incredibly excited to have Australia’s icons turn blue for diabetes. It’s such a strong sign of support for our community, especially during National Diabetes Week.” “There are almost 435,000 people in NSW and the ACT living with diabetes. To save lives, this National Diabetes Week, we’re urging everyone to know the signs and symptoms of diabetes, to reduce the number of people being diagnosed too late,” said Sturt Eastwood. A delayed diabetes diagnosis can have very serious consequences. Failure to detect the early signs of type 1 diabetes can be life threatening. Mr Eastwood said, “Diabetes NSW & ACT data shows that one in five people with type 1 are only diagnosed after being admitted to hospital with diabetes ketoacidosis, an acute complication which can be fatal.” Similarly, the signs and symptoms of type 2 are often be missed. It’s estimated that there are as many as 500,000 Australians currently living with type 2 diabetes who don’t know it. “A delayed type 2 diagnosis can seriously impact a person’s health and their life. Type 2 diabetes is the leading cause of blindness, amputation, kidney damage and heart attack in Australia. The best way to avoid these critical health issues is early detection and management. That’s why we’re encouraging everyone over 40 to ask their doctor for a diabetes test at their next appointment,” said Mr Eastwood. Managing any type of diabetes is challenging, for those living with type 1 the ongoing routine of daily insulin injections, regular blood glucose monitoring as well as diet, exercise and regular health checks can take its toll. Tanya Ilkiw, who has been living with type 1 diabetes for 15 years, said: “Dealing with the day to day management of diabetes can be difficult. At times it feels like you can’t catch a break and you feel alone. But tonight we were part of something bigger, part of a community raising awareness about what it’s like to live with diabetes and that felt empowering. It is great to see Sydney lit up in blue for diabetes.” Global healthcare company Abbott, who offer technology solutions to help people better manage their diabetes, sponsored the event. They recently launched the , enabling glucose monitoring through a smartphone synced to the FreeStyle Libre sensor. “The convenience and ease that FreeStyle Libre offers is hard to top, but Abbott’s FreeStyle LibreLink app does exactly that. The app along with the FreeStyle Libre sensor blends in seamlessly with life’s routine. It makes glucose monitoring discreet and hassle-free, helping people with diabetes live their best lives possible. What better way to demonstrate this than by supporting the National Diabetes Week celebrations,” said Peter Chalikias, Regional Director, Abbott. Novo Nordisk Australia, sponsored the lighting of the Sydney Opera House to help raise awareness about the significant health issue diabetes has become. Jamshed Ahmed, Director – Clinical, Medical, Regulatory & PV said, “We were proud to show support for National Diabetes Week in such a visual way. At Novo Nordisk we believe that by working together with health professionals, policy makers, people living with diabetes and the broader community we can reduce the impact of diabetes. However, we need earlier diagnosis and improved access to relevant care.” Mr Eastwood said, “Tonight was an incredibly special night for us and Diabetes NSW & ACT would like to thank everyone who helped us bring these events and activities together. We are extremely grateful to our friends at Abbott, Novo Nordisk, BridgeClimb Sydney, the Opera House, Luna Park and the Shangri-La for helping us to shine a light on the significant impact diabetes can have for individuals and our whole community.” A new European position statement gives guidelines for optimum BGLs before, during and after exercise for people with type 1 diabetes.

ddbeb057-4df5-4537-8f0f-9c318c918a71,"Tuesday, 15 September 2020 A new study published in has found that for people with , both aerobic exercise training (like walking or jogging) and resistance exercise training (strength training) lead to improvements in blood glucose control. And a combination of aerobic and resistance training results in larger improvements. The research conducted by a team at the University of Calgary, analyzed data from a six-month exercise trial in participants with type 2 diabetes. The study explored the links between the dose of exercise (the proportion of the total prescribed exercise sessions that were completed) and the change in control. All participants in the exercise groups were asked to do three exercise sessions per week. The research found that overall, the more exercise completed, the better the improvement in blood glucose control. For aerobic training and combined aerobic and resistance training, but not for resistance training alone, those who completed more exercise sessions had greater improvements in blood glucose control. The links between the dose of exercise and change in blood glucose control were strong for younger people (age 40-55 years), men, and those with worse blood glucose control before participating in the study. In contrast, for older participants (age 55-70 years), women and people with better blood glucose control at the start of the study, there was no strong link between the percent of exercise sessions completed and improvements in blood glucose control. Being more active improves your general health and quality of life. It can also help you to better manage your diabetes. The amount of physical activity that’s right for you will depend on your current level of health and fitness. It’s generally recommended that you do 30 minutes of moderate physical activity on most days of the week, in addition to your normal daily activities. The best exercise for you is one you enjoy, as this will help keep you motivated. Activities that help to build strength, balance and flexibility are the best for your overall health and wellbeing. There are a lot of great options to choose from, including walking, cycling, dancing, swimming and light resistance training. If you are unsure of what activities are suitable or safe for you, it’s important to speak to an accredited for personalised advice. Before you begin any form of physical activity, talk to your GP, an exercise physiologist or a diabetes educator to work out the type and amount of exercise that’s right for your current state of health and fitness. If you have gestational diabetes (or have type 1 or type 2 diabetes and are pregnant) you will need to take extra care when exercising. Ask for an exercise plan that’s also suitable during pregnancy. Test your blood glucose levels before, during and after exercise, particularly when starting a new program. This will help you understand how your body responds to exercise. Wear supportive shoes that fit well and check your feet daily. If you take insulin or certain diabetes tablets, always carry some foods or fluids containing carbohydrate with you. Avoid strenuous physical activity if your blood glucose levels are above 15 mmol/L. If you need help and inspiration to get more physically active, then the Beat It program might be right for you.

71cc95dc-b986-4bcc-8b73-1342f1228016,"Monday, 24 April 2017 Managing blood glucose levels is just one of many key reasons to exercise. But what if you have type 1 diabetes, your levels are erratic and you want to get back into exercise? The benefits of exercise far outweigh the risks, however it is important understand how your levels respond to different types of exercise to reduce your risk of hypoglycaemic episodes.  As the name suggests, the recent invention of the can be of great assistance in this instance. CGM is a blood glucose sensor, which is attached to a site on the stomach allows for 24 hour feedback of blood glucose levels to a transmitter. This allows the user to see what their level is at that moment in time, and information on which way their blood glucose level is trending (up or down). It does require daily calibration with two finger prick tests, but this can be considered a blessing if you usually have to prick your finger at least 10 times a day. Last year, one of our BEAT IT participants living with type 1 diabetes was able to trial a CGM for a week. Lori, a 54 year old female with type 1 diabetes had joined the BEAT IT program hoping to get some more skills around how to exercise and to improve her HbA1c. She had been managing the condition for 48 years, so essentially her whole life!  As a result of diabetes, Lori has some long term complications including peripheral neuropathy and retinopathy “I can’t read print, so I use a computer that talks to me, and I can’t see enough to get around without using a white cane”. Lori was no stranger to physical activity. She spent many years training in Japanese martial arts, walks regularly and kayaks on the ocean a few times a week with friends. “I like challenging myself, especially through developing new skills in physical activity.” Lori’s blood glucose levels were constantly fluctuating, with no clear pattern detected from finger prick tests.  She was not getting the full picture. With the help of Rebecca from Animas, Lori trialled the DEXCOM 4 CGM for seven days. “It was really valuable.  It gave a really clear picture of what my blood glucose levels were doing over the 24 hours. It was great to be able to look at the receiver and see what my levels were at any given time.  For example, if I was in a meeting and I was hungry, was I hungry because my level was low or was I just hungry? It was also great because I didn’t need to do so many finger pricks during the day,” Lori recounted. With regards to diabetes management, the CGM was able to help Lori’s diabetes team to understand medication adjustments that needed to be made. In this instance, “I was able to increase insulin basal rates, which has improved my levels through the day”. By the end of the 8 week BEAT IT program, Lori’s HbA1c dropped from 10.2% to 8.6%. She also reduced her weight by 1.2kg and waist circumference by 3cm. The downside to the CGM? “Having to still do two finger prick tests to calibrate the device daily, but that’s hardly anything to complain about” Speak with your diabetes team for more information around this technology and if it is suitable for you.

Sitting or lying down (with the exception of sleeping) are what we call ‘sedentary’ behaviours. You can be sedentary at work, at school, at home, when travelling or during leisure time.

It helps you stay a healthy weight and can create opportunities for being social.

Or an equivalent combination of both moderate and vigorous activities. “But I am over 65.

Older people should be active every day in as many ways as possible, doing a range of physical activities that incorporate fitness, strength, balance and flexibility. Older people should accumulate at least 30 minutes of moderate intensity physical activity on most, preferably all, days. Older people who have stopped physical activity, or who are starting a new physical activity, should start at a level that is easily manageable and gradually build up the recommended amount, type and frequency of activity. Older people who continue to enjoy a lifetime of vigorous physical activity should carry on doing so in a manner suited to their capability into later life, provided recommended safety procedures and guidelines are adhered to. Being physically active for 30 minutes every day is achievable and even a slight increase in activity can make a difference to your health and wellbeing. Remember – the 30 minutes does not have to be done all at once, but can be accumulated in blocks of 10 minutes.

0f03c27b-ac9b-4fb6-ad69-f6cf9a5f603b,"Thursday, 30 April 2020 Ramadan is the month-long fast that takes place in the ninth month of the Islamic lunar calendar each year. It is one of the five pillars of Islam. It takes place during daylight hours and is compulsory for all healthy Muslims who have reached puberty.  However, there are exceptions to this. Certain groups of people, such as people with diabetes, are exempt. However many people still choose to fast for religious, social and cultural reasons. Studies have shown that as much as 40% of people with and around 80% or those with will fast during the Holy Month; this adds up to over 115 million people worldwide! It is a personal choice whether or not you fast. If you do choose to fast, then you must talk to your doctor or diabetes educator first, to make sure that you know how to look after yourself. Fasting can be dangerous if you have diabetes as it can cause health issues, and this would be contrary to the Qur’an, which states that you must not act in a way that harms your body (Al Baqarah Verse: 195). When we eat, carbohydrates are broken down to glucose and insulin is produced to store the glucose into the liver and muscles. When we don’t eat for a while, some of this stored glucose in released back into the blood stream with the help of glucagon (another hormone which acts like the antidote to insulin). During long periods of fasting, such as during Ramadan, the blood glucose levels may drop as glucose stores in the body are used up. This can cause (low blood glucose levels). You may develop high blood glucose levels during a fast if you do not take your prescribed medication or if you are less physically active than normal. Large meals at suhur (the dawn meal) and iftar (breaking of the fast) can cause blood glucose levels to spike. Hypoglycaemia and hyperglycaemia are the most common risk factors for people with diabetes who are fasting. If you have compilations associated with diabetes, such as , or , the risk of these issues becoming worse during the fast is high, and so you should consider to not fast. Not drinking any fluids during the day, when you fast can cause . If you are a person who sweats easily or if you have excessive perspiration due to hard, physical labour, this could get worse quickly.  Hot and humid climates, such as during Australian summers, are another risk factor, or if your blood glucose levels are high this can further contribute to dehydration and may increase the risk of thrombosis and stroke. Most often the medical recommendation is not to fast. However, many Muslims with diabetes are passionate about fasting. They enjoy the spiritual atmosphere during Ramadan, don’t think of themselves as being sick and don’t want to miss out. If you choose to fast it is important to talk to your doctor about the risks. You will have to be prepared to break your fast if your blood glucose levels drop below 3.9 mmol/L or rise above 16 mmol/L, to prevent symptoms of hypoglycaemia, hyperglycaemia, dehydration or acute illness. It is important to check blood glucose levels more regularly during Ramadan. Checking blood glucose levels will not break your fast, as there is only a minimum amount of blood involved. Never skip suhoor. Long hours without eating increase the risk of hypoglycaemia and it will be much easier to balance your blood glucose levels throughout the fast if you eat a meal at suhoor. Try to eat moderate portion sizes – remember that Ramadan is also about self-control and discipline Include fruit and vegetables at both suhoor and iftar Limit fried or fatty foods. They will make you put on weight, raise your blood glucose levels and make them more difficult to control Limit the intake of salty foods to reduce the risk of dehydration Drink plenty of sugar-free fluids, particularly water, at suhoor and after iftar to replenish fluid loss during the day Limit your intake of high sugary foods (such as dates or juice, often used to break the fast) Ask to see a dietitian who’ll be able to give you more advice about healthy eating. Supper after tarawih can be taken as a replacement of a pre-bed snack. You can continue to do your normal physical activity. However excessive physical activity should be avoided as this can increase your risk of hypoglycaemia, particularly during the few hours before the sunset meal. In some patients with poorly controlled type 1 diabetes, exercise may lead to severe hyperglycemia. Taraweeh (multiple prayers performed after the sunset meal which involve repeated cycles of rising, kneeling, and bowing) should be considered a part of the daily exercise program. Taraweeh can be a tiring activity and you could become dehydrated or be at risk of hypos. To avoid problems during Taraweeh, make sure you: Eat starchy foods with iftar as they are digested slowly Take a bottle of water and glucose treatment with you to taraweeh. Although most diabetes medications require no adjustments, some tablets may need to be switched from the morning to the sunset meal. Some medications need to be stopped or changed to reduce your risk of hypoglycaemia. Medications that you usually take three times per day may need to be adjusted so you only need to take them twice per day during the fast. You should always seek advice from your doctor to Ramadan in regards to any medication changes that may be needed. Basal (sometimes also called background insulin, long or intermediate-acting) insulin doses may need to be reduced by around 15-30%. It is best taken after iftar. Bolus (mealtime, rapid or short-acting) insulin doses should not be taken at lunchtime. The suhoor dosage may need to be reduced by around 25-50%. Usually the regular bolus dosage can be continued at iftar, provided you have a similar sized meal as you would usually have at dinner. If you take premixed insulin once daily the dosage can be taken at iftar. For those taking twice daily premixed insulin, the suhur dosage will need to be reduced by around 25-50%. If you are usually on three lots of premixed insulin at main meals, the lunchtime one should not be taken. The iftar and suhoor doses will need to be adjusted. If you have type 1 diabetes and you are on an insulin pump, generally the basal rates will need to be reduced by 20-40% in the last three to four hours of fasting. You should increase your basal rates by up to 30% after iftar.  Normal carbohydrate counting and insulin sensitivity principles apply in regards to bolus doses at both suhoor and iftar. Of course the above medication and insulin dose adjustment recommendations are a guideline only. You should always seek advice from your doctor to Ramadan in regards to any medication changes that may be needed. After 2020, we recommend aiming for achievable, realistic and fun goals in 2021.

e53db28b-0869-4272-b3d8-c2ee1e82617b,"Pregnancy is a wonderful time to begin exercise, and it is very safe. Women with gestational diabetes have so much to gain from starting a specially prescribed exercise program. Some women may be advised not to exercise, so check with your healthcare team about what you can do. Keep you fit to prepare for the birth of your baby. Help you achieve your target blood glucose levels. Greatly improve yours and your baby’s health, both now and in the future including reducing the risk of the baby growing too big. Reduce or avoid muscle and joint pain like lower back and hip pain. Research has also shown that doing some exercise after meals can help women with gestational diabetes hit their recommended target blood glucose levels more often. Exercise recommendations for pregnancy are the same for the general population. They might need some small changes to make them work for you, depending on the stage of your pregnancy and any pregnancy symptoms you may have. Aerobic exercise like walking, swimming and dancing for about 30 minutes to an hour three to five days per week (at least 150 minutes per week) Strength exercise like Pilates, using weights or resistance bands two to three days per week (have a day off in between sessions) These are the goal amounts to aim for. If you’re not currently active that’s okay. Start off with a ten minute walk around the block or 20 minutes of swimming a few times a week and build up from there. Exercise at a level where you can have a small conversation (i.e. talk for 1-2 sentences), but you can’t sing. Be flexible with what you choose to do, because every day will be different. Do what feels moderate to you at the time. Thirty to sixty minutes a session. If you don’t have time to do 30-60 minutes in one go, you can do ten minutes at a time. Or build up slowly from ten minutes if it has been a while since you have been active. What exercises are good for gestational diabetes?  Use light weights and keep the number of repetitions high around 8-15. Breathe evenly throughout the exercises. Exhale when you’re pushing or pulling the weight and inhale on relaxation. Don’t forget your pelvic floor exercises like Kegel exercises where you contract and relax the pelvic floor muscles. Yoga and Pilates (many gyms and studios will do pregnancy classes) These exercises can help stretch, lengthen and strengthen muscles as well as focus on the abdominal muscles These exercises focus on good breathing techniques and relaxation which are extra benefits Stretching should be slow, controlled and comfortable. Tell your doctor or midwife that you are planning to become more physically active. They can let you know if what you are planning will be safe for you and your pregnancy. Get a referral to an Accredited Exercise Physiologist for tailored advice about gestational diabetes and pregnancy exercise. They can help you work around your pregnancy symptoms like nausea, back pain or fatigue so you can keep active. Find an Accredited Exercise Physiologist at If you take insulin for your gestational diabetes, it’s important to check your blood glucose levels before, during and after exercise. You’ll need to discuss a safe blood glucose range for exercise with your doctor or diabetes educator. Also ask them about the best times to exercise to avoid when your insulin is working at its peak. This will help to avoid any low blood glucose levels, or hypos. Avoid activities that involve physical contact or a high risk of falling like water skiing or horse riding. Avoid exercising in too warm or humid environments especially in the first trimester. The growing fetus cannot regulate its temperature. Avoid holding your breath during exercise as this places stress on your pelvic floor. Avoid doing exercise laying on your back after the fourth month of pregnancy. Modify the exercises to do on your side, or standing. Avoid being still in the same position for too long (standing, sitting cross legged, some yoga positions) as it may lower your blood pressure. Because of pregnancy hormones your ligaments may become more relaxed. Rapid changes in direction and bouncing should be done with controlled movements. Avoid too many one-sided exercises like walking lunges or single leg step ups in the third trimester. and what works for you – your intuition is high during pregnancy – Join our community of over 45,000 people living with diabetes Copyright ©2021 Diabetes NSW & ACT.

9cb7c1ab-d94b-4215-b322-c99880b66e6b,"Wednesday, 15 April 2020 The (COVID-19) pandemic has brought many changes to our lives including the requirement to stay at home. But while we’re at home many of us aren’t staying active and moving as much as we normally would. That’s because we’re getting less of the “incidental exercise” we’d normally get from going about our day-to-day activities, and many of our routine exercise options have been curtailed. While we don’t know for sure how long our lifestyles will be affected in this way, we do know periods of reduced physical activity can affect our health. This places older people and those with chronic conditions like are greater risk of illness. To understand why the consequences of inactivity could be worse for some people, it’s first important to understand the concept of cardiorespiratory fitness. Cardiorespiratory fitness provides an indication of our overall health. It tells us how effectively different systems in our body are working together, for example how the lungs and heart transport oxygen to the muscles during activity. The amount of physical activity we do influences our cardiorespiratory fitness, along with our age. Cardiorespiratory fitness generally peaks in our 20s and then steadily declines as we get older. If we’re inactive, our cardiorespiratory fitness will decline more quickly. As we get older, our cardiorespiratory fitness declines. One study looked at five young healthy men who were confined to bed rest for three weeks. On average, their cardiorespiratory fitness decreased 27% over this relatively short period. These same men were tested 30 years later. Notably, three decades of normal ageing had less effect on cardiorespiratory fitness (11% reduction) than three weeks of bed rest. This study demonstrates even relatively short periods of inactivity can rapidly age the cardiorespiratory system. But the news isn’t all bad. Resuming physical activity after periods of inactivity can restore cardiorespiratory fitness, while being physically active can slow the decline in cardiorespiratory fitness associated with normal ageing. Generally, older people and those who live with chronic conditions (like heart disease or ) have lower cardiorespiratory fitness compared to younger active adults. This can increase the risk of health issues like developing another heart issue, stroke or admission to hospital. While we’ve been encouraged to stay home during the COVID-19 pandemic, it’s still possible for this group to remain . Here are some tips: Set a regular time to exercise each day – when you wake up, before lunch or in the afternoon so it becomes routine. Aim to do 30 minutes of exercise on most days. It doesn’t have to all be done at once and can be spread across the day (for example, in three ten-minute sessions) Use your phone to track your activity. See how many steps you do in a “typical” day during social distancing, then try to increase that number by 100 steps per day. Take any opportunity to add activity to your day. Take the stairs if you can, or walk around the house while talking on the phone. Minimise periods of sitting by getting up and moving every 30 minutes. For example during the TV ad breaks. Incorporate additional activity into your day through housework and gardening.

When we examine what happens to the body during exercise we see activation of muscles, movement of bones and joints and an influx of brain activity triggering systems in the body to work together to accommodate the increased workload. Swimming is one of those activities that particularly challenges your cardiovascular system. It does this by recruiting many muscle groups simultaneously, which usually results in your body working at a moderate to high level of intensity. Working at this moderate intensity (or between 3-4 on an intensity scale of 1-10) is the recommended level to allow for positive changes to take place in your body such as increasing fitness, stimulating weight loss or improving general heart health. It is also the recommended go-to activity if you have chronic joint or pain related issues that make it difficult to walk or perform land-based exercise. Being submerged in the water takes the load off joints and can enable someone with restrictions to meet their daily physical activity requirement, without large flare ups of pain symptoms. So use the opportunity summer offers to improve your health by making a splash in your local swimming hole.

fc64d0c7-f8cb-477e-acea-21ce36658b4a,"Monday, 6 May 2019 We all know that exercise is great for our bodies – it can help us become fitter, stronger and generally healthier. But did you know that it can also improve your brain power? There is a growing body of evidence that indicates regular exercise not only improves cognitive function, but also helps safeguard us against conditions such as dementia and age-related cognitive decline. Research shows that people who spend between three and 15 hours a day sitting typically have less brain volume in the area that is associated with memory and thinking (called the Hippocampus). In many ways prolonged sitting can be likened to smoking in terms of the negative impact on our health. This information further adds to our understanding that being sedentary, or getting little movement throughout the day, is bad for our health and may lead to a more rapid decline in your memory. Exercise is thought to benefit our brain health for a number of reasons. We know that the brain requires a constant supply of oxygen and nutrients in order to function effectively. Exercise is a great way of effectively ‘feeding’ the blood vessels in our brain with nutrient-rich blood due to the effects it has on circulation. Exercise can also make our brains bigger! Aerobic exercise, in particular, has been shown to lead to the growth of new brain cells (called neurons). This can increase our overall brain volume – particularly in the hippocampus. This area of the brain plays an important role with memory and learning. – regular physical activity at all stages of life has be shown to lower your risk of dementia and slow the process of cognitive decline that occurs as we age. In fact, there is strong correlations between someone’s cardiorespiratory fitness and their ability to carry out cognitive tasks. – we know that our memory can become a bit more foggy as we get older, or even when we are younger! Exercise has been shown to help boost our memory through helping preserve our existing brain cells, as well as promoting growth of new brain cells in areas of the brain that we use for memory. research has shown that exercising after learning something new can help you retain this new information or skill in your long-term memory. – exercise is also effective in boosting the amount of “feel good” hormones that are released by our brain such as endorphins, dopamine and serotonin. This not only leaves you feeling great, it can also help in managing the symptoms of depression and anxiety. Essentially any form of exercise that is good for your heart, will also benefit your brain! Aerobic exercise such as brisk walking, jogging, cycling and swimming are great for brain and heart health. Try and exercise at an intensity that is somewhat challenging (moderate) or enough to elevate your breathing rate slightly. This has been shown to offer more benefits in terms of our health. Add variety to your exercise. Mix up your routine and try and incorporate activities that challenge coordination and cardiovascular fitness at the same time, such as dancing or an aerobics class. Try and include a combination of different exercise types such as aerobic and strength-based exercise. Including both exercise modes has been shown to be more beneficial in improving cognitive function and overall diabetes management. Stay active both physically and mentally throughout the day. Try and challenge yourself by including activities that are new, complex and outside your normal routine. This could be as simple as switching to your non-dominant hand for tasks around the house, walking a different route to the shops, taking up a creative hobby or trying to learn a new skill (learning an instrument, gardening, creative writing). There are a host of resources you can access online as well. Here is an example you might like to try –  Why not try one of our programs at Diabetes NSW & ACT! Many people find starting exercise challenging or confusing. These are all common questions when trying to make exercise a regular habit. This is why Diabetes NSW & ACT has designed the and If you are registered with NDSS these programs are for you to attend. is a workshop designed to empower you to take the first step in making exercise a part of your routine.

2cd840f3-79ff-4cd5-9771-0fb6d4d4190e,"Tuesday, 12 November 2019 Adding strength training, push-ups or crunches to your weekly exercise routine could decrease your likelihood of obesity by half. Using data on 1.7 million adults, University of Southern Queensland (USQ) research found that doing muscle-strengthening activities twice a week was just as effective for obesity reduction as the current recommended amount of aerobic exercise. In fact, the research showed that combining the two forms of exercise halved the odds of obesity. The findings were published on November 11 in the journal Obesity. Lead author, Dr Jason Bennie who is a Senior Research Fellow at USQ’s Physically Active Lifestyles Research Group, said the study provided the strongest evidence to date of the best amount of physical activity required to combat or prevent obesity. “It is estimated that almost 40 per cent of Australian adults are obese, and this condition can lead to increased risk of health conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, high blood pressure and depression,” Dr Bennie said. “Until now most population-level evidence on physical activity for reducing the risk of, or preventing obesity is based on aerobic exercise, such as walking, cycling and jogging, but few studies have previously examined the associations between combining aerobic exercise and muscle-strengthening activities with obesity. “From the data we analysed, it’s great news for people who find it hard to get out and exercise, but can potentially do some strength training at home. “The findings will greatly extend our understanding of the complex relationship between physical activity and obesity, and potentially lead to better health outcomes.” Australia’s Physical Activity and Sedentary Behaviour Guidelines recommend 150 to 300 minutes of moderate intensity physical activity or 75 to 150 minutes of vigorous intensity physical activity each week. The Guidelines also recommend doing muscle-strengthening activities at least two days per week. Dr Bennie hoped the results from the study would be good motivation for people to move more. “Physical activity doesn’t need to be complicated or time-consuming,” he said. “Doing any physical activity is better than none and making some changes to your daily routine can make a big difference like body weight exercises such as squats, sit-ups, or push-ups at home; or join a gym to do weights.” New research finds ways to identify people with pre-diabetes most at risk of developing type 2 diabetes All types of diabetes have been found to increase the risk of falls Adapted cancer therapy could treat type 1 diabetes  Researchers have adapted a cancer therapy which has the potential to treat type 1 diabetes Join our community of over 45,000 people living with diabetes Copyright ©2021 Diabetes NSW & ACT.

57845383-1f73-49ab-b412-c423ebcaf0a4,"Friday, 27 November 2020 A new European position statement gives guidelines for optimum blood glucose levels (BGLs) before, during and after exercise for people with type 1 diabetes. The position statement covering children, adolescents and adults highlights the complexity of glucose management for those living with type 1 diabetes. The , from the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) and the International Society for Pediatric and Adolescent Diabetes (ISPAD), focuses on users. Decisions around intake, insulin correction or exercise timing are based on an assessment of the patient’s habitual physical activity, risk of hypoglycaemia and health status along with the type, intensity and duration of exercise, and data from sensor glucose values and trend arrows. “In this position statement, we detailed the use of sensor glucose values accompanied by trend arrows for CGM and (intermittently scanned) isCGM systems for different groups of people with type 1 diabetes and for different sensor glucose responses to exercise,” the statement said. “Of note, in this position statement, recommendations for carbohydrate consumption were stratified with respect to the rate of change in glucose for the pre-exercise phase, during exercise, post- exercise and the nocturnal post-exercise phase.” The recommendations represent initial guidance only and should be tailored for individual patients, the authors said. Co-author Dr Carmel Smart, from the Department of Paediatric Diabetes and Endocrinology at John Hunter Children’s Hospital in Newcastle, said the statement was complicated and put the onus on health professionals to translate for their patients. “From a practical point of view, there are a lot of people who have totally unplanned exercise and I think part of the problem with this paper is it is a mismatch between elite [exercise] people versus everyday people.” For example, the recommendations for sensor glucose targets during exercise were probably not as relevant for most people compared to the recommendations for before and after exercise. “Of those three timings, certainly if you are doing exercise for an hour and you are a kid who is relatively stable, then we would probably say pay attention to the ‘before exercise’. Are you trending down? If the glucose is 5 mmol/L and you are trending down, then you definitely need to have 15 grams of carbs.” “But if the arrow is going straight down, we might say you need to be up around the 20 gram mark [for carbohydrate ingestion] … if the arrow is flat, all good, just have your 10 grams.” “And then at the end of exercise, most people don’t look at it straight afterwards because it still tends to trend down. When they might look at it is going to bed. And if it is still trending down, we need to make sure we drop the [insulin] dose or have some additional carbohydrate then.” Dr Smart said clinical practice in Europe, where the position statement was written, was much more ‘arrows based’ than in Australia. “The feeling in our clinic is we achieve really good outcomes yet we don’t use arrows all the time.” However, she said the overall experience at John Hunter Children’s Hospital during COVID was that more children were using CGM. “We’re asking them a lot more because when you do telehealth, you need data and that is the best way to get data.” She said the key message to patients with type 1 diabetes who were active was that CGM data can help them improve their glycaemia around exercise. “Put it on. Keep it on. It’s fantastic to enable you to get the trends about what happens with blood glucose levels around exercise. If you are doing very high intensity exercise like sprinting or competition, you usually go high then go low later. Expect that. That’s normal. And CGM will show you that.” Switch the type of walking in your routine to stay motivated and active. One in three people over 65 will suffer a fall due to poor balance. It's time to assess your balance and improve it.

0dc6f420-a989-42a5-be64-753457346b03,"Wednesday, 4 April 2018 It’s inevitable…we all get older! And as we age, our bodies change resulting in the decline of both our physical and cognitive function. But why do some people seem to age “better” than others? Obviously differences in our genetic make-up play a big role, but our lifestyle can play an equally important role. Research has shown that the more time you spend sedentary (inactive), the greater the risk for cardio-metabolic disorders. Findings also suggest that sedentary behaviours are strongly associated with  odds of successful ageing. So the first step in “better” ageing is to reduce sedentary time – think of all those activities you do sitting, like watching TV, reading books, driving, knitting…the list can go on and on. How can you reduce time spent on these activities and/or break up these activities over your day? It has been estimated that about half of the physical decline associated with ageing may be due to a lack of physical activity! Without regular physical activity, people over the age of 50 can experience a wide range of health problems. Unfortunately, many adults fall short of achieving the recommended levels of physical activity. In fact, 56% of Australian adults are either inactive or have low levels of physical activity – that is more than 9.5 million adults who are increasing their risk of what may be preventable health problems!

8e184c01-d4aa-4ef2-b8ed-8f218f3c9caa,"Tuesday, 2 July 2019 Alcohol can be enjoyed by any person in moderation, including people living with diabetes. Recommendations for healthy adults choosing to drink alcohol are to consume no more than two standard drinks per day and have two alcohol-free days per week. On any single occasion, the recommendation is to consume no more than four standard drinks of alcohol over several hours. A standard drink of alcohol and the standard serving size of alcohol may vary. The standard serving size of a glass of wine in a restaurant is often 150mL, which is 1.5 standard drinks. A schooner of mid-strength beer is 425mL and is also 1.5 standard drinks. A can of pre-mixed spirit is 375mL and can be up to 1.8 standard drinks. Alcohol is high in kilojoules. Even consumed in small, regular amounts, alcohol can contribute to excess kilojoules in our diet while providing no nutritional value. Regular consumption of alcohol can lead to weight gain. So how do we overcome the excess kilojoules that alcohol provides in our diet? Extra exercise is recommended to help maintain a healthy weight. So how much extra exercise or physical activity is required to burn off kilojoules from alcohol? In the table below, a comparison is provided of the average serving size of different alcoholic beverages, the kilojoules each drink provides and how long you would need to walk at a moderate pace to burn off those kilojoules. Approximate walking time to walk off energy from alcoholic beverage (minutes) ^Note that the energy content of alcoholic beverages can vary significantly depending on alcohol content (%). A person who consumes one glass of wine a day would need to walk at a moderate pace for 35 minutes to burn off the kilojoules from the wine. A person who chooses to drink one schooner of mid-strength beer would need to walk at a moderate pace for 55 minutes to burn off the kilojoules. If there is no exercise or physical activity to burn off the kilojoules, then the excess energy will cause weight gain. What can be done to avoid excessive alcohol consumption? Keeping track of the amount of standard drinks of alcohol you are consuming is a good start to understanding how many kilojoules are being consumed. Measuring the volume of the alcohol you consume and diluting alcoholic drinks with diet soft drink or soda water will help to reduce the kilojoules consumed. Alternatively, walking in the afternoon before dinner may encourage healthier choices in the evening. Ultimately, understanding how many kilojoules are in your alcoholic drink and how many minutes of physical activity is required to burn off the energy from that drink may help you when choosing to drink alcohol. After 2020, we recommend aiming for achievable, realistic and fun goals in 2021.

47424804-7fce-46c3-8daf-0a829cf890e5,"Friday, 25 January 2019 One of the keys to achieving your health and fitness goals is being consistent. One of the keys to achieving your health and fitness goals is being consistent. Creating new exercise routines and physical activity habits is no easy task. While nobody can do your workout for you, thankfully, with a little help from technology, it has become much easier to plan fitness activities and track your progress (without going broke). Here are five of the best (mostly free) health and fitness apps for tracking and planning. Strava is a sophisticated (and free) fitness activity tracker. It records your walk / run / cycle / swim routes via GPS tracking, can map out a route for you, and analyse nearly every performance metric imaginable. Strava can help you to train smarter in three ways: Track and analyse: Get key stats like distance, speed, pace, elevation, and kilojoules burned New routes and maps: Pick from popular walking, running and cycling routes in your local area that local Strava users have used Challenge and compete: Compete with other local Strava users to be the fastest on a particular route Compatible with many different types and brands of devices e.g. smart watches, heart rate monitors Beacon: Turn on Beacon and you can share your location in real time with your friend, partner, parent, child – anyone who might need to know where you are. It’s a social network: Record an activity and it goes to your Strava feed, where your friends and followers can share their own races and workouts, give kudos to great performances and leave comments on each other’s activities. The hardest part of any run is taking that first step. Couch to 5K offers running novices all the advice, support, and help they could possibly need. Couch to 5K runner is an exercise program consisting of three weekly sessions of 30 minutes and goes for eight weeks. It starts with alternating walk / jog intervals, and the intervals of jogging gradually build up over the eight week to a full 5km. A human coach voice is heard through your headphones telling you when to walk / run. It can be used outdoors, or indoors on a treadmill, and is compatible with lots of GPS tracking apps. Great for easing you into your new regime, so you can realistically work your way from a 15-minute route to a 5K run Each workout is guided by a voice over from the likes of Olympian Michael Johnson The voice over works over the top of your own music This app basically pays you to move and exercise, and it is completely free to use! Sweatcoin converts your steps into currency units called Sweatcoins. You can spend Sweatcoins on goods, services and experiences on the marketplace, with Sweatcoin partners, or exchange them with family and friends for whatever you fancy. The fitter and healthier you become, the wealthier you get. For example 0.95 Sweatcoins is equivalent to 1000 steps, and a ‘gift’ which you are given for joining. In the marketplace, there are four ‘marathon’ offers, including an iPhone XS, $1000 cash, and a curved Samsung TV – all of which are achievable with 20,000 Sweatcoins earned over 24 months and invites sent to friends. If you have ever needed an incentive to exercise, this app could be your motivation-boosting answer. The app pays YOU to get fit. Touted as the number one fitness app for beginners. You choose what kind of workout you want and how long you have, and Sworkit shows you what to do with voice and video instructions. You don’t need a gym, or any equipment to do the workouts. Sworkit aims to be suitable for all types of people and abilities e.g. those too busy to workout, beginners, athletes, people with injuries, the young and old, and travellers as it can be done from a hotel room. First you select the level of difficulty from easy, medium and hard, then exercise categories from upper and lower body, core, cardio, yoga / pilates, and stretching. You can then choose your stance from floor-based, standing or seated, followed by impact level from low, normal and high. Seven minute guided workout options for those who are time-poor Access to Sworkit on a web app and Apple TV meaning you can display your workout on the TV Six week programs with goals like ‘leaner’, ‘fitter’, ‘stronger’ for beginner, intermediate, and advanced. Note: Sworkit is free for 30 days. You can then subscribe for $110 per year. An oldie, but still a goodie is sitting at number 2 on Apple’s Health and Fitness Apps. This app allows you to track your exercise, steps, and your diet from a database of over six million foods. Upon sign up, you enter your current weight and choose a goal from weight loss, weight gain, or weight maintenance. The app then allows you to search for and enter in breakfast, lunch, dinner, snacks, and drinks, adding up your kilojoule, protein, fat, carbohydrate, sugar, fibre, and some vitamins and minerals as you go. Physical activities can also be logged, with the app subtracting the “kilojoules burned” from your daily total to illustrate your energy balance for your given goal. Use caution here, as these calculations tend to overestimate true energy expenditure. The food data base includes culturally and globally diverse items and cuisines App offers “food insights” where you learn how to make healthier foods choices It is easy to track your water intake in cups or millilitres (mls). While fitness apps won’t do the work for you, they can help you get motivated, get started, show you how to exercise, and track your progress. Now that you’re armed with some of the best, it’s time to get started! After 2020, we recommend aiming for achievable, realistic and fun goals in 2021.

34b257fd-76a7-49be-b1cc-d982271e0538,"Home MOVES: Staying strong (and sane!) during social distancing Home MOVES: Staying strong (and sane!) during social distancing Tuesday, 5 May 2020 As we come to terms with our current circumstances, it is essential to try and maintain a regular, healthy lifestyle. One of the most important aspects, and also most difficult to maintain given the situation, is maintaining our levels of physical activity. As we have socially distanced ourselves, it has become a challenge to keep active when we’re staying indoors almost all the time. Add in the closure of commercial gyms and suddenly we have very limited exercise options. But is it important to be keeping active during this time? Regular exercise has a host of great benefits that are going to impact you in more ways than one while we isolate. It’s challenging to keep a positive attitude, but exercise is a great natural way to boost your mood and energy levels and keep you feeling better overall. Exercise results in the release of endorphins, which are mood-enhancing hormones. By exercising regularly, we can keep our spirits high! Sitting inside watching TV and lounging around all day might seem great at first, but after a while it loses its attraction. Try and break the repetition by complete some exercises during ad breaks, or go for a quick walk around the house. You can even try and set challenges for yourself to up the ante by aiming for more repetitions, or quicker laps! The less active we are, the less likely we are going to be able to complete those household tasks that might take an extra ounce of strength or fitness. For example, vacuuming the house or doing the gardening. Without maintaining our strength, these tasks will become much more challenging. The less we move, the more likely we are to see our strength and muscle mass decrease over time. Therefore, it’s essential that we keep as active as possible so we can keep doing the things we need or love, and maintain a high quality of life overall. Similar to maintaining our quality of life, our general strength and fitness is incredibly important. Whether or not you’ve exercised before, now is a great opportunity to make the most of the free time that we may not have had before. Not only is exercise an effective mood-booster, but it’s great at improving joint, muscle and bone strength, as well as improving heart health. We’ve included three basic exercises that you can complete at home with no equipment necessary. Keep an eye out for more of our publications over the coming weeks for more exercises to complete at home!

683be9f7-f8b1-4610-a588-3a869d385069,"Friday, 21 September 2018 Sometimes the thought of doing exercise can be demotivating. Changing into workout gear, getting ourselves to the gym or pool can feel like an effort. But did you know that doing every day chores can be a way to boost your physical activity levels? And the more physical effort you put into the task the more kilojoules you will burn. Try these tips to turn your cleaning into a workout that counts: Clean to music – turn the music up loud and dance whilst you’re cleaning. This makes things a little more enjoyable and will increase your intensity level so you’re burning more energy. If you want to take it a step further, set yourself a challenge to finish the task in a set number of songs and this will surely motivate you to work harder and faster. Lunge when you vacuum – we mainly use our arms when vacuuming so to turn this into a real workout try performing some walking lunges to give your thighs and buttocks some attention too (make sure you keep your knees directly above your ankles as you lunge forward, your back straight and your core muscles engaged). Think big movements – for activities like cleaning mirrors, shower screens, windows and glass doors, instead of making small circular movements try and make long swipes up and down instead. Squat with down movements and go up onto your toes for the up movements to give you more of a whole body workout and if you can alternate which arm you use. Batter up – instead of vacuuming rugs or mats, take them outside, hang them up and beat them with a broom. This will use more muscles and energy than vacuuming them would. There are lots of ways to get physical activity into your day. It doesn’t matter how you move the most important thing is that you do. Remember, 30 minutes of moderate exercise every day will help you manage your diabetes and improve your overall health and wellbeing. After 2020, we recommend aiming for achievable, realistic and fun goals in 2021. Three diabetes-related conditions to be aware of when exercising Hyperglycaemia, neuropathy and high blood pressure can have an impact on how you exercise safely.

The top three barriers to exercise reportedly include Everyone feels this barrier from time to time, some of us more than others. If motivation is a mindset, then we need to put a positive spin on movement so we actually WANT to do it. One thing I’ve noticed is the negative mindset exercise can bring with it. It is important to remember it doesn’t need to be long, strenuous or painful for you to reap the health benefits of moving. Here are a few options “I will just go for ten minutes, and stop after this time if I want” Make it easy so you can be consistent. You DO NOT need to be uncomfortable when you move You’ve heard it before- find someone to move with, or join a group to stay on track Try the RAMP to success to get you started with increasing your incidental activity- this requires no motivation at all! What is the RAMP to success and how do I apply it? Reminder- Choose something that happens each day without fail as your CUE EG: Phone rings, send an email, TV ad break, boiling the kettle foe a tea, send a text message Active Movement- Decide what you want your new active movement (habit) to be. Then make that active movement (habit) so easy that you won’t say NO to doing it! EG:  Sit up and down out off a chair, Raise up and down on your toes, walk around the house Praise or Reward- We will continue to do things that make us feel good so give yourself praise or a reward after a few weeks of doing it. EG: After two weeks of doing this daily habit, take yourself to the movies Remember, lasting change is a product of daily habits. It’s a common excuse for not doing movement, but the question is: Have you planned it into your day or just thought about it? Here are a few solutions Write the appointment down in your diary/phone to exercise Those will the busiest schedules can surely fit 10 minutes at some point into their day? Break up your 30 minutes so you can fit at least something in Choose the morning time to get it done, as less excuses can come up throughout the day then If you are not sure how to do something correctly like strength exercises, or you have other pre-existing injuries or illnesses, it is best to get the advice from a trained expert.

ce68df8a-69c5-4e5e-a475-3e8d96dadd3d,"Tuesday, 24 January 2017 Physical activity is good for everyone! The good news is that if you speak with your doctor or specialist and they say it is safe for you to be active then there is no reason why you shouldn’t start today. But before you put on your exercise clothes and tie up your shoelaces there are a few things you need to keep in mind to make sure you’re moving safely. First and foremost you need to get medical clearance to start or change a physical activity program. Make sure you ask your doctor if he/she thinks there are any exercises you should avoid. Next, if you are wondering where to start, make an appointment with an Exercise Physiologist who can help to make sure you know how much, how often and how hard you need to be exercising. If you have a known then there are a few things you may want to consider: If your medication changes you need to ask your doctor how that might impact on your ability to be physically active. Sometimes medications can change how your body responds to physical activity. Changing medications is not an excuse to stop, but an opportunity to review your program and make sure it is right for you. 2. Avoid heavy lifting, pulling or pushing if possible. These activities can cause increases in blood pressure. 3. Avoid isometric or static exercises where your muscle is contracting against an immovable object for example wall squat, plank or stomach crunches (held). 4. Avoid exercises that involve your arms being above your head at the same time. These exercises increase blood pressure unnecessarily. 5. Never hold your breath while exercising, ensure you maintain normal breathing throughout all movements. Breath holding can also increase blood pressure. 6. Try to avoid exercising when it is humid, hot or cold. Humidity can cause undue fatigue, hot and cold environments can interfere with the body’s circulation, cause breathing difficulties and sometimes even chest pain. Extreme temperatures increase the workload on the heart. Exercising indoors is the best option if you have a heart condition. 8. Do not ignore pain and follow angina protocols where prescribed. 9. Aerobic and strength training activities that use large muscle groups are great because they strengthen your heart and lungs, improve blood pressure, heart rate and breathing. 10. Walking up hills may be harder when you have a heart condition. Hills can still be included in your workout but you may need to reduce your pace or include rest periods where needed. 11. Be sure to include a warm up and cool down to reduce the stress on the heart and allow the body to prepare for and recover from exercise effectively. 12. Monitor your heart rate and breathing during exercise to ensure you are staying within your limits and not pushing yourself too hard. 13. Stop exercising if you feel unwell, experience breathlessness or have pressure or pain in the chest, neck, arm, jaw, or shoulder. If you experience dizziness or become lightheaded during exercise slow exercise and then rest. Seek medical assistance if needed. Remember everyone can exercise! Be prepared, know your limitations during exercise and when you should stop in order to be safe. Most importantly have fun and enjoy a healthier you!

Retrieved Jan 22 2021 from https://www.thefreelibrary.com/Diabetes+-+exercise%2c+diet+%26+medications.-a021195454 Diabetes mellitus affects approximately 20 million people in the United States. It is the third leading cause of death and is responsible for approximately five percent of all hospital admissions. Despite an enormous amount of research, the incidence of diabetes is increasing by about six percent per year and there is still no clear understanding as to its cause, nor is there a cure. Diabetes mellitus is a metabolic disease caused by bodily malfunctions in utilizing glucose. Glucose, or blood sugar, is the fuel the body needs for energy. Insulin, which is secreted by the pancreas, helps make cell walls permeable. This promotes the entry of glucose molecules into the cells where it can be used for energy. There are two classifications of diabetes. Type I (juvenile onset) is referred to as insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) and usually develops before age 351 Type II (adult onset) is referred to as non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) and usually affects people over age 40. IDDM diabetics suffer from a malfunction of their pancreas to produce insulin. NIDDM diabetics usually produce insulin from the pancreas, but the secretion levels may be too low and/or there may be a lack of sensitivity in the insulin receptor cells. This leads to elevated blood glucose levels (hyperglycemia). Symptoms of hyperglycemia include increased urination, thirst and unusual fatigue. Either type of diabetes is a chronic systemic disorder and can be fatal if left untreated. Maintaining a normal blood sugar level is critical for persons with diabetes. Normal blood glucose levels are 70-150 mg/dL. Hyperglycemia occurs when the glucose level exceeds 150 mg/dL and hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) occurs when glucose levels are less than 60 mg/dL. Studies demonstrate persons with diabetes can live long, productive lives with reduced risk of secondary problems if the disease is managed carefully. This involves insulin injections (for those requiring insulin) or oral hypoglycemic agents, dietary education, proper exercise programs and self-monitoring. People who monitor their diabetes have shown profound reductions in secondary complications of the disorder. Individuals with diabetes are two to three times more likely to experience high blood pressure. Because a rise in blood pressure may occur during exercise, it is important to monitor blood pressure and select an appropriate exercise activity and intensity level. Controlling Diabetes: Diet Persons with diabetes should eat a high carbohydrate, low fiber, low fat, moderate protein, low sugar, low sodium meal three hours prior to intense exercise or competition. Exercise Regular exercise is the most overlooked and crucial treatment for controlling diabetes. Exercise improves blood glucose control, reduces cardiovascular risk and improves circulation. Each person should engage in a form of exercise recommended by his or her physician. The intensity and duration of exercise will determine the levels of blood glucose and insulin usage within the body. Walking briskly for 20 minutes three times per week can reduce the risk of type II diabetes. Your physician can advise you on medication needed and adequate dietary requirements to assure your safety during exercise. Aerobic exercise should be performed at 55 to 85% of your maximum heart rate three to five times per week for a minimum of 20 minutes. Check with your doctor for your specific heart rate intensity and duration. Strength training should start at 40-60% of one maximum repetition (1 RM), gradually building to 80% of 1 RM. Perform a minimum of one set of eight to 12 repetitions two times per week. Make sure that all major muscle groups are worked. Perform approximately eight to 10 exercises for a total body workout. Check with your doctor for any contraindications regarding resistance training. Insulin For insulin dependent diabetics, there are many factors which influence the body's insulin utilization. Exercise may cause hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia due to an increase in metabolic demands. The following are preventive tips for persons with diabetes who exercise. * Avoid injecting insulin into a part of the body which will be exerted during exercise. This may increase or shorten duration of insulin reaction. * Avoid exercising at the peak of insulin activity. Injection of insulin should be administered one hour prior to the start of exercise. * Avoid alcohol and beta blocker drugs around the time of exercise because they promote hypoglycemia. * Eat a snack just before and during exercise. * Keep simple carbohydrates, such as fruit juice or hard candy, and other food available. If you are a competitor, ask the team physician to carry extra insulin for emergencies. * Always carry emergency cash and identification listing your medical condition and medications used. * If you experience pain in your chest, nausea, heart palpitations or severe shortness of breath during exercise, stop and consult your doctor. * Test blood glucose before, during or after exercise. * Watch for post-exercise hypoglycemia up to 15 hours after activity. * If blood glucose levels are above 240-300 mg/dL, or below 60 mg/dL, don't exercise. Foot Care Since diabetes is the major cause of nontraumatic amputation, proper foot care is important. Exercising leads to sweaty feet and can precipitate foot problems. Follow these tips to prevent foot infections. * Wash your feet daily. * Use foot creams or lubricating oils. * Have a podiatrist show you how to cut toenails correctly. * Never cut calluses or corns. * Never walk barefoot. * Wear appropriate shoes and inspect their insides daily. * Seek medical care for all skin lesions. * Avoid smoking and use of all tobacco products. Hydration Prevent dehydration by drinking two cups of water two hours before exercise. Drink one to two cups 30 minutes before exercise, one-half cup every 15 minutes during exercise and enough afterward to regain any water lost to perspiration while exercising. Behavioral Changes Anxiety, depression and denial are extremely common in diabetics. They are often given prescription medications to combat these psychological problems. These medications frequently have side effects that can influence the diabetic's capacity for a proper exercise routine. Recognizing the differences between side effects which do or do not affect a person's exercise participation is crucial to the value of the exercise itself.

53632d12-52ba-43bc-9a42-e258b7d8c524,"/ Can fitness apps replace doctors/experts? By: | The market is already flooded with more than 30,000 health and fitness applications and more are in the offing. So, there is an app that can measure your calorie intake while another can track your physical activity. Yet another can throw up dietary suggestions after measuring your and still others can provide you with a good cardio chart. People, especially the urban smartphone users whose hectic work life allows them very little time for exercise, are downloading such apps with enthusiasm in the hope of achieving ‘better’ health. But are these apps effective? According to fitness experts, such ‘virtual’ apps can hardly be a replacement for ‘real’ exercise, be it going to the gym or walking in the park. Also Read - Also Read - Health apps you must have on your smartphone in 2020 ‘I do not think a smartphone application can make you healthy until you actually hit the gym. In our gym, not too many people use these apps to track their physical activity or metabolism,’ Vivek Soni, head trainer at Gold’s Gym in New Delhi, told IANS. Fitness apps may be useful for athletes because they have to constantly maintain a certain fitness level and require far more intense physical training than an average person. ‘But for common people, these apps can’t be very useful,’ Soni says. There is another aspect too. Every person’s dietary and training needs are different from anyone else. But the free apps are designed in a ‘one-size-fits-all’ manner. So, it may be counter-productive to use these apps without expert supervision, experts warn. ‘The smartphone apps are effective, but what kind of apps? The internet is flooded with information on health and fitness. But how would you know what is right for you and what is not?’ Roshini Gilbert, transformation and rehabilitation coach at Bangalore-based online health solutions provider Healthifyme.com, asks. ‘For an app to be truly effective, it must be tailor-made according to the specific needs and lifestyle of the user. A general app may be effective for some, but not for all,’ she noted. According to a US-based study, gamification – or applying game design to non-game applications – is currently the popular trend for mobile fitness app makers looking to cash in on helping people get fit. Fitness app enthusiasts, though, would be in for a disappointment if they go by the results of most of the recent studies done to fathom the efficacy of such apps. ‘It has just been assumed that gamified apps will work, but there has been no research to show that they are effective for people in the long term,’ said Cameron Lister from Utah-based Brigham Young University. Lister and health science professor Josh West analysed over 2,000 health and fitness apps and found that the majority of the most popular and widely used ones feature gamification. As part of their study published in the Journal of Medical Internet Research, the duo personally downloaded and used 132 of the apps to examine how well they worked. They found that gamification ignores key elements of behaviour change and could be demotivating in the long run. ‘It is like people assuming that you hate health and you hate taking care of your body so they offer to give you some stuff in order for you to do what they want you to do,’ Lister noted. According to the inaugural ‘2015 State of US Health & Fitness Apps Economy’ report published by US-based research group ARC 360 late last year, many well-known brand apps were not favourites with consumers with some being rated as fair. ‘Health and fitness brands with apps rated as fair need to expand testing out of the lab and into the real world,’ said the authors. The experts believe more research needs to be carried out in an industry projected to hit close to the $3 billion mark by 2016. So, the next time you download a health app, think about giving that early morning jog another thought.

You can also compete with your friends by posting your updates online.   Endomondo has an audio feature that gives feedback after every mile or km. It also has a modern and clean interface which makes it great to use while doing high-intensity work-outs. Despite several user complaints, a problem with the app prevents users from posting to Facebook. A similar problem also exists with its GPS map, and it loses some major points in our book. This is a simple app that tracks all your physical activity, from biking, walking, skating or running on a treadmill! It checks how far you’ve run, your stride length, offers workout playlists, etc. The app also offers advanced GPS, pedometer tools and an interactive heart rate monitor. You can set workout schedules in advance. An interesting feature is a color code that informs whether you’ve completed a workout day, missed a workout day, or had an unscheduled exercise. The biggest drawback of the app, however, is that it stores all the information on your phone; occupying a lot of space. Also there have been multiple reports from users of the GPS that stops to work after a few days. [iOS; Free]: This is a simple app that brings to you 30 ready-made yoga classes and a library of over 280 positions to learn from. You can set your skill level from beginner, intermediate or expert yoga. The workouts are well put together with 15 to 60 minutes practice.

The app opens up an e-deck of cards that come with instructions for yoga poses tailored for desk-workers looking to stretch on the job. You only have to tap to sort and create your own sequence or use only your favourites. A major glitch is that even after the app has been closed, the background music doesn’t stop for a long time. This popular app created by FitnessKeeper, Inc. keeps a track of your pace, distance, time calories burned and more, helping you store and analyse your running session. It also syncs your music library and allows you to create jogging play lists.

It also automatically uploads to nikeplus.com where you can see your runs, including your route and elevation.  Hit a mental wall?The app allows you to activate a Powersong to helps blast you toward a new record. There is also positive feedback from some of Nike’s top athletes. Imagine being cheered on by the likes of Kobe Bryant or Cristiano Ronaldo! Some of its features such as Share Run and Cheer Me On require users to be connected to a wireless network for full functionality which hampers its outdoor experience. Want to start weight training but don’t know how? This app allows you to carry a virtual gym trainer in your pocket. Demo exercises are performed with 3D animation. The app offers three options of morning, home and gym workouts.  Morning workouts of 7 -15 minutes are to get your day started. If you don’t have a gym membership, you can try the home workout. The exercises are well planned, working all of your muscles and starting off with warm ups and ending with cool downs. There are 8 only workouts, there is no logbook and you cannot customize your workouts.  This app allows you to create workout plans; allowing you to customize routines and helping you stick to them. You can plan a multiple set of activities and the number of time of that activity to make your workout plan. A statistics feature compresses all the data collect and even shows which muscles you are working. It’s not for beginners and seems to be for the more advanced gym routines only.

One of the easiest ways to digest that calorie pumped meal would be walking for at least 15-20 minutes after eating. Also Read - Vitamin A induces weight loss in cold conditions: Know how You can walk outside your house for a while or stroll inside your house. It will help break down the meal in your body which further will be easy to digest. Walking one mile a day (one and a half kilometres approximately) with a proper walking gear can burn up to 100 calories. Something as simple as a daily brisk walk can help you live a healthier life. * Indoor exercise: Fixing a quick 15-minute exercise in between your busy schedule will help in diluting those extra carbs. You can schedule it in the morning or in the afternoon, but you need to make sure that you only put those shoes on an hour after the meal. In the 15 minutes of exercise, do three sets of – 15 jumping jacks, six push-ups, 30 seconds plank, five sit-ups and five squats. You can try and complete these activities in the mentioned time or increase the sets depending on your strength and stamina. To add to this, you can also take stairs instead of lifts or walk/cycle to that restaurant/sweet shop instead of driving. * The most common practice is gulping a glass of water just after eating a heavy meal, which causes indigestion. One should either drink water 30 minutes before a meal that later helps in taking a small plate or drink water 30-45 minutes after a meal, this gives the body time to absorb the nutrients and helps in healthy digestion. It’s’also important to sip water before, during and after exercise to keep the body hydrated at all times. * A simple way to keep a regular check on calorie would be to download any fitness app, which logs in all the important details according to your body. After logging in, the fitness app calculates the amount of calorie you can consume in a day, after which you can feed every meal and it shall automatically add the calorie each meal partakes.

Public exercise facilities such as gyms, sports centres and swimming pools have been closed. Regular physical activity is of great benefit to the general population and even more for people living with chronic conditions like diabetes. Daily physical activity is an integral part of diabetes management, helping to maintain blood glucose at recommended levels. Physical activity should be seen as a hobby and a valuable tool to overcome the monotony of the difficult confinement that many people around the world are currently experiencing. Below are a series of daily exercises that can be performed at home, provided by ANIAD, the Italian National Association of Athletes with Diabetes. The exercise intensity of each activity is comparable to one hour of brisk walking, resulting in an energy expenditure of 150-200 Kcal. : one-hour brisk walking (no need to run), which can also be split into three 20-minute sessions. If possible, the slope should be adapted to individual fitness levels, to simulate an uphill walk. (either reclined or classic): two 15-minute sessions at variable intensity (if the equipment allows it). The sessions can be longer on a reclined bicycle since the effort is reduced by the backrest. such as push-ups, squats, deep stationary lunges, sit-ups or crunches (to strengthen the abdomen) and forward flexes (to strengthen the lower-back muscles).

Use small weights and home fitness accessories such as rubber bands, kettlebells, wrist weights, ankle weights and pockets filled with heavy objects. Makeshift objects can also be used, such as buckets, cases, bottles filled with water or even small backpacks filled with objects of different weight. These suggestions can be used to develop short, fragmented or continuous training sessions. Here is an example of a series of “total body” exercises involving all main muscle groups, which anyone can do at home: Two series of 20 Jumping Jacks (on-site jumps with synchronized leg and arm spreading and closing) Two series of 15 forward flexes (lower back muscle strengthening) Two series of 10 rowing exercises using dumbbells and slight forward flexion (back muscle strengthening) Two series of 8 push-ups (pectoral muscle strengthening – knees to floor for beginners) Two series of 8 sitting/standing hand-weight lifts (shoulder muscle strengthening) Five minutes of treadmill training or stationary/reclined bicycle Three series x 15 squats (lower limb strengthening) Make sure to avoid overload and adapt exercise intensity to individual ability and fitness level.

Jessica Migala; Nutrition review by Victoria Seaver, M.S., R.D. August 31, 2020 | Credit: Getty / kali9 Staying active is one of the best things people with diabetes can do to keep blood sugars in check, energy levels balanced, moods boosted and overall health outcomes positive. Understanding how your body reacts to activity can be helpful to keep you feeling your best before, during and after exercise. Here's what happens when you exercise, plus tips on how to start moving and keep moving. How does activity affect blood sugars? "" allows muscles to take up glucose from the bloodstream without the need for insulin,"" says , professor emerita with Old Dominion University. What's more, any insulin you do have in your body will also work better after exercise, she says: ""That means you can get by with less of it."" The exercise effect is particularly powerful: one systematic review and meta-analysis, published in the , found that in people with type 2 diabetes, exercise improved insulin sensitivity (how effective your cells are at utilizing insulin) up to 72 hours after the activity. Ultimately, when you commit to a regular exercise routine, you may be able to manage your condition with lower doses of medication—or none at all. Here's how to get going! Exercise Tips for Diabetes This all sounds great, right? The answer may be ""Yes!"" for some, but not everyone is naturally inclined to love exercise. If you fit into the camp of I don't have time/It's uncomfortable/I haven't a clue what to do, then know that starting a routine (and sticking to it) is actually easier than you might think. Here's what you need to know about exercising with diabetes: Dip your toe in—don't jump Exercise is not something you have to embrace at full speed: it's OK—and recommended—to start slowly, especially if you've been inactive in the past. Rather than decide you're going to run five mornings a week or turn on Zumba videos every afternoon, start lighter. Colberg recommends light to moderate aerobic activity three days per week, with no more than two rest days between workout days. This might be taking a physically distanced walk around your neighborhood with a friend, riding your bike on a beautiful day, or swimming in a pool. Afterward, do some light stretches, which will help you improve your flexibility. Related: Outdoor Exercise Ideas for Diabetes—That You'll Actually Look Forward To Remember: it's OK if you're not dripping with sweat after your activity. Exercising vigorously is not guaranteed to make a good workout, and it can backfire. ""Starting out too hard can be demotivating and also lead to injury, which can keep you sidelined,"" says Colberg. Add strength Building muscle means you can lift that heavy box off the shelf, and it may give you new arm definition, but more importantly, a strength routine will improve diabetes management. Fit this in two times per week. ""Maintaining muscle mass helps your body process and store carbohydrates more effectively,"" says Colberg. Resistance training can be done with weights (such as lunges or an overhead press) or using your own body weight (such as squats or pushups), and many moves will also help you work on your balance. The app is a really good (and quick!) introduction to body-weight exercise. Each exercise is timed, so you can perform it at your own pace. Many gyms aren't open now, due to COVID-19, plus maybe you just don't feel comfortable going for a variety of reasons. That's completely OK. ""Versions of most activities can be done from home, including walking locally in your neighborhood and doing resistance exercises using your own body weight or household items,"" says Colberg. For example, cans of food, water jugs, a case of sparkling water, or resistance bands (which can be purchased inexpensively online) can be used in lieu of traditional weights. Likewise, you don't need to spend a lot of money hiring a personal trainer, either, says Colberg. If you're unsure about how to put together resistance exercises or use the resistance bands you bought, search on YouTube. You can even refine your search further to find workouts specifically catering to people with diabetes. You'll find a ton of videos by qualified professionals (make sure they're a certified personal trainer) who provide instruction based on your experience level. Your blood sugar will respond in different ways, depending on the activity you're doing and time of day, says Colberg. ""It can be motivating to see how much impact being active can have, but also allows you to avoid having your blood glucose go too low or too high from being active,"" she says. Check your glucose before exercise and then again within an hour of stopping. Read More: The Best Fitness Foods: What to Eat Before, During and After a Workout Keep moving Exercise comes with the assumption that it's something you do wearing athleisure and that makes your muscles beg for mercy. Not so! ""Every bit of physical movement you do during the day counts as your daily total, so be as active as you can all day long,"" says Colberg. That might mean walking to do an errand, riding a bike to an outdoor restaurant, or making time for window shopping on foot. That can even mean using a push mower to cut the grass in your yard, raking leaves outside or spending a Saturday morning gardening. Not only does it bump up your calorie burn, but you'll make it through your day high on energy.

Jessica Ball, M.S., R.D. December 29, 2020 https://www.eatingwell.com/article/7882901/fitness-app-motivate-working-out/fitness-app/ | Credit: Getty Images/Westend61 I’m probably not alone in saying that it was tough to find motivation for a lot of things this year, including regular exercise. With gyms, yoga studios and more being closed, there was the additional challenge of finding ways to . Activities like running, biking and walking were some of the only things left on the table. As a former college endurance athlete, it was hard for me to get back into the sports I used to compete in without a specific goal or challenge. All of that changed when I started using the app . I could share my activities with friends, see what they were doing and even sign up for challenges for inspiration. Basically, now I can’t wait for my workouts.  My experience is not an anomaly: There is scientific evidence that using a and sharing fitness data can have some health benefits. A recent study out of took a look at how sharing fitness data impacted people's success in a weight-loss program. Participants wore a Fitbit exercise tracker, weighed themselves and tracked their food intake on a smartphone. Half of the participants shared all of their data weekly with a coach during the 12-week weight-loss period and for the remainder of the year of follow-up. The other half did not share data with a coach. Though weight loss was similar between the groups, researchers found that participants were more likely to keep the weight off if they shared their information with their coach. That extra accountability and motivation could translate to sharing data with friends, as well.  If you don’t have the flexibility to spend money on an expensive tracker (though we have some options for more), there are plenty of free apps that can be downloaded right to your smartphone. My personal favorite so far is Strava. This app works best for those who do endurance activities, like running, cycling and swimming. It tracks time, distance, elevation gain and “achievements,” showing you how you rank compared to others who have done the same routes. All activities are posted to a feed so your followers can see what you do, and you can curate your feed based on those who follow you. Think of it as exercise social media.  Other popular apps include , and . Nike Training Club provides workout inspiration, recipes and nutrition tips as well as holistic wellness guides. It is less interactive with other people than Strava, but has options for virtual trainers and push notifications to keep you accountable. MyFitnessPal is a tracking app where you can input food, exercise and hydration. You can easily create groups in the app to share your information with your friends, a coach or even others in the MyFitnessPal community. The Fitbit app can be used on a smartphone or computer even if you don’t have the watch to match. It can track exercise, steps, heart rate, sleep and more to help you stay on track with your goals. You can also connect with others on this app and even share challenges.  Regardless of your fitness goals, tracking your fitness data and sharing it with friends is a great way to stay motivated and accountable. Personally, I have looked forward to workouts since I started using Strava. I love seeing what my friends are up to and sharing my accomplishments. There are several free apps for smartphones as well as smartwatches available to help you track your improvements this new year.

Metabolic syndrome results in a state. It at least doubles the chance of suffering from cardiovascular disease compared with the normal population. Those with metabolic syndrome have a 5 to 30 times greater chance of type 2 . The metabolic syndrome is also known as syndrome X. This is not to be confused with the cardiac syndrome X, which refers to -like chest pain with normal coronary . According to a consensus statement published in 2009, the metabolic syndrome is present if a person has three or more of the five health problems listed in the table below. 2. Reduced high density lipoprotein (HDL), so-called “good” Raised (), 6 (IL–6) and factor-alpha (α), reflecting Raised or plasminogen activator -1, which may result in blood clots Fatty liver, which may to non-alcoholic Elevated uric acid levels from dietary sugars, which may lead to Dementia with aging, and cognitive decline in the elderly. The greater the number of risk factors, the greater the chance of developing heart disease, diabetes, or stroke. The risk for heart disease is also increased by raised high low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, so-called “bad” cholesterol, and by , but these factors are not part of metabolic syndrome. Important factors contributing to metabolic syndrome include: Certain medications that contribute to weight increase eg, antidepressants It is slightly more common in those on an alcohol-free diet. Metabolic syndrome is present in about 5% of people with normal body weight, 22% of those who are overweight, and 60% of those considered obese. Obesity is a major risk factor for developing metabolic syndrome. Insulin is a hormone that transfers glucose (sugar) out of the bloodstream into the muscle, fat and liver cells. It is required to store glucose for future energy needs. Low insulin levels result in raised blood glucose. High insulin levels are proinflammatory. Insulin resistance is defined as a subnormal response to insulin, in which the body cells resist its effects. Blood glucose may be high despite normal or increased amounts of insulin. Insulin resistance may be subclinical (where the patient does not have symptoms or signs) or result in overt type 2 diabetes. There is debate regarding whether insulin resistance is the cause of the metabolic syndrome or a consequence of it. In the earliest stage, insulin resistance can only be detected with the euglycaemic insulin clamp technique which is considered as the gold standard. This involves measuring insulin-induced glucose uptake whilst the blood glucose concentration is maintained at a steady concentration (via glucose infusion). However, this technique is impractical in everyday clinical practice. Raised blood sugar levels can be detected as insulin resistance increases. Type 2 diabetes usually appears in adults over the age of 45 years, but may arise earlier in those with metabolic syndrome. In contrast, type 1 diabetes usually begins in children and young adults. It often results from destruction of insulin-producing cells in the pancreas by , and is not caused by insulin resistance. It is also associated with genetic factors but is not related to body fat or activity. Abdominal obesity is associated with metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular problems rather than accumulated fat in the buttocks and thighs. Hence the “apple-shaped” body is more likely to cardiovascular disease than the “pear-shaped” body. In clinical practice, the waist to hip ratio is used to diagnose abdominal obesity, and appears to be more important than the body mass index (BMI). Asian Indians have more abdominal fat than caucasians and blacks, due to β3-adrenergic . Women tend to have fat distributed on buttocks and thighs, due to . This is protective. Fat stored in the abdominal region is more likely than fat in other sites to break down into free fatty acids (), which get deposited in the liver. These fat cells produce pro- including TNFα, which induce insulin resistance. Saturated fats, sugars, and fast digesting starches (carbohydrates) in the diet increase the blood levels of triglycerides, which induce fat to be laid down. So the most obvious way to prevent metabolic syndrome is to reduce the intake of saturated fats, sugars and other carbohydrates. Skin problems are common in patients with metabolic syndrome, associated with obesity, diabetes, , and inflammation. Obese patients are prone to in body folds () due to sweating, , the skin surfaces rubbing together, and . tissue increases the production of male hormones () and obese patients are also at greater risk of polycystic ovarian syndrome. Chronic insufficiency, and High blood glucose levels result in infections, damage and poor wound healing. Excess insulin causes the skin cells to grow abnormally. There is a higher of amongst obese patients than the general population; there is twice the risk of psoriasis in patients with BMI > 35 compared to those of normal weight. This is thought to be due to the chronic inflammation associated with metabolic syndrome and driven by excessive levels of insulin. intertrigo may lead to Obese patients with psoriasis have greater compared with those of normal weight. is more likely to result in burns as the lamps are closer to the skin surface Weight loss and medications for diabetes have been shown to improve psoriasis in these patients. Why is it important to treat the metabolic syndrome? Early treatment of metabolic syndrome reduces the risk of developing type 2 diabetes and/or cardiovascular disease. If type 2 diabetes and/or cardiovascular disease have already developed, aggressive lifestyle modifications improve the outlook. The first line treatment is change of lifestyle but drug treatment is frequently required. Lifestyle changes are required lifelong. They may include: Low calorie diet (800-1200kcal/day) to reduce weight and achieve desirable weight (BMI less than 25 kg/m2) Healthy eating habits: low intake of sugars, high-glycaemic index carbohydrates, saturated fat and trans fat Physical activity: at least 30 minutes of moderate-intensity activity on most days of the week A healthy weight loss is 0.5 kg to 1.0 kg a week. Amounts greater than this often involves loss of body water instead of fat. A dietician is important to provide advice on regular meal times, the avoidance of snacking, reducing portion size, and identifying foods that are high in energy. Fad diets are generally avoided as they work in the short term but lack the compliance for the long term. A detailed discussion of diet therapies, pros and cons of various diets is beyond the scope of this article. However, there is now a trend toward the use of a Mediterranean diet – one that is rich in “good” fats (olive oil) and contains a reasonable amount of carbohydrates and (such as from fish and chicken). The Mediterranean diet is palatable and easily sustained. In addition, recent studies have shown that when compared to a low fat diet, people on the Mediterranean diet have a greater decrease in body weight, and also had greater improvements in blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and other markers of heart disease. Exercise has been shown to be of benefit regardless of whether weight loss is achieved or not: Reduces total cholesterol and improved LDL/HDL cholesterol ratio The aim is to increase energy expenditure. This can be by avoiding sitting down (less television) as well as by deliberate visits to a personal trainer at a gym, or by walking, running, or participating in sports. Statins to raise HDL and reduce triglyceride and LDL cholesterol levels Diuretics and ACE to reduce blood pressure below 130/80 The aim of prescribing cholesterol lowering agents is primarily to reduce the LDL cholesterol. Lower triglycerides and higher HDL cholesterol are expected benefits as well. ACE inhibitors have also been shown to reduce the levels of insulin resistance and actually deter the of type 2 diabetes. Metformin and thiazolidinediones (eg, pioglitazone) are used to reduce blood sugar in type 2 diabetes. They also decrease insulin resistance and may prevent the onset of diabetes in people with metabolic syndrome although their use for this is controversial. Thiazolidinediones also reduce the thickness of the walls of the carotid arteries (the supplying the brain), reducing the risk of stroke. normally helps maintain adequate insulin levels. It also reduces cell (particularly in the skin) and has effects. Vitamin D deficiency is common in obese individuals and in those with metabolic syndrome. This is because fat retains vitamin D and because obese patients tend to have less sun exposure. In these patients, vitamin D supplements may be helpful. Insulin levels may increase, reducing blood sugar in diabetics Surgery such as laporascopic banding of the stomach may be offered to well-motivated morbidly obese patients with a BMI >40 kg/m2. These patient are at high risk of surgical complications. However, weight loss may be dramatic after surgery resulting in marked improvement in diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and obstructive sleep apnoea. Cosmetic surgery including tummy tuck (abdominoplasty) and may be performed to reduce sagging skin and achieve a smooth, firm contour. Best results are seen in those who are in good health and have reached target weight. Unfortunately, removal of large amounts of abdominal fat does not seem to improve insulin sensitivity, blood pressure, or cholesterol. The final step of treatment involves maintenance of weight loss.

This can be by avoiding sitting down (less television) as well as by deliberate visits to a personal trainer at a gym, or by walking, running, or participating in sports. Statins to raise HDL and reduce triglyceride and LDL cholesterol levels Diuretics and ACE to reduce blood pressure below 130/80 The aim of prescribing cholesterol lowering agents is primarily to reduce the LDL cholesterol. Lower triglycerides and higher HDL cholesterol are expected benefits as well. ACE inhibitors have also been shown to reduce the levels of insulin resistance and actually deter the of type 2 diabetes. Metformin and thiazolidinediones (eg, pioglitazone) are used to reduce blood sugar in type 2 diabetes. They also decrease insulin resistance and may prevent the onset of diabetes in people with metabolic syndrome although their use for this is controversial. Thiazolidinediones also reduce the thickness of the walls of the carotid arteries (the supplying the brain), reducing the risk of stroke. normally helps maintain adequate insulin levels. It also reduces cell (particularly in the skin) and has effects. Vitamin D deficiency is common in obese individuals and in those with metabolic syndrome. This is because fat retains vitamin D and because obese patients tend to have less sun exposure. In these patients, vitamin D supplements may be helpful.

Metabolic syndrome results in a state. It at least doubles the chance of suffering from cardiovascular disease compared with the normal population. Those with metabolic syndrome have a 5 to 30 times greater chance of type 2 . The metabolic syndrome is also known as syndrome X. This is not to be confused with the cardiac syndrome X, which refers to -like chest pain with normal coronary . According to a consensus statement published in 2009, the metabolic syndrome is present if a person has three or more of the five health problems listed in the table below. 2. Reduced high density lipoprotein (HDL), so-called “good” Raised (), 6 (IL–6) and factor-alpha (α), reflecting Raised or plasminogen activator -1, which may result in blood clots Fatty liver, which may to non-alcoholic Elevated uric acid levels from dietary sugars, which may lead to Dementia with aging, and cognitive decline in the elderly. The greater the number of risk factors, the greater the chance of developing heart disease, diabetes, or stroke. The risk for heart disease is also increased by raised high low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, so-called “bad” cholesterol, and by , but these factors are not part of metabolic syndrome. Important factors contributing to metabolic syndrome include: Certain medications that contribute to weight increase eg, antidepressants It is slightly more common in those on an alcohol-free diet. Metabolic syndrome is present in about 5% of people with normal body weight, 22% of those who are overweight, and 60% of those considered obese. Obesity is a major risk factor for developing metabolic syndrome. Insulin is a hormone that transfers glucose (sugar) out of the bloodstream into the muscle, fat and liver cells. It is required to store glucose for future energy needs. Low insulin levels result in raised blood glucose. High insulin levels are proinflammatory. Insulin resistance is defined as a subnormal response to insulin, in which the body cells resist its effects. Blood glucose may be high despite normal or increased amounts of insulin. Insulin resistance may be subclinical (where the patient does not have symptoms or signs) or result in overt type 2 diabetes. There is debate regarding whether insulin resistance is the cause of the metabolic syndrome or a consequence of it. In the earliest stage, insulin resistance can only be detected with the euglycaemic insulin clamp technique which is considered as the gold standard. This involves measuring insulin-induced glucose uptake whilst the blood glucose concentration is maintained at a steady concentration (via glucose infusion). However, this technique is impractical in everyday clinical practice. Raised blood sugar levels can be detected as insulin resistance increases. Type 2 diabetes usually appears in adults over the age of 45 years, but may arise earlier in those with metabolic syndrome. In contrast, type 1 diabetes usually begins in children and young adults. It often results from destruction of insulin-producing cells in the pancreas by , and is not caused by insulin resistance. It is also associated with genetic factors but is not related to body fat or activity. Abdominal obesity is associated with metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular problems rather than accumulated fat in the buttocks and thighs. Hence the “apple-shaped” body is more likely to cardiovascular disease than the “pear-shaped” body. In clinical practice, the waist to hip ratio is used to diagnose abdominal obesity, and appears to be more important than the body mass index (BMI). Asian Indians have more abdominal fat than caucasians and blacks, due to β3-adrenergic . Women tend to have fat distributed on buttocks and thighs, due to . This is protective. Fat stored in the abdominal region is more likely than fat in other sites to break down into free fatty acids (), which get deposited in the liver. These fat cells produce pro- including TNFα, which induce insulin resistance. Saturated fats, sugars, and fast digesting starches (carbohydrates) in the diet increase the blood levels of triglycerides, which induce fat to be laid down. So the most obvious way to prevent metabolic syndrome is to reduce the intake of saturated fats, sugars and other carbohydrates. Skin problems are common in patients with metabolic syndrome, associated with obesity, diabetes, , and inflammation. Obese patients are prone to in body folds () due to sweating, , the skin surfaces rubbing together, and . tissue increases the production of male hormones () and obese patients are also at greater risk of polycystic ovarian syndrome. Chronic insufficiency, and High blood glucose levels result in infections, damage and poor wound healing. Excess insulin causes the skin cells to grow abnormally. There is a higher of amongst obese patients than the general population; there is twice the risk of psoriasis in patients with BMI > 35 compared to those of normal weight. This is thought to be due to the chronic inflammation associated with metabolic syndrome and driven by excessive levels of insulin. intertrigo may lead to Obese patients with psoriasis have greater compared with those of normal weight. is more likely to result in burns as the lamps are closer to the skin surface Weight loss and medications for diabetes have been shown to improve psoriasis in these patients. Why is it important to treat the metabolic syndrome? Early treatment of metabolic syndrome reduces the risk of developing type 2 diabetes and/or cardiovascular disease. If type 2 diabetes and/or cardiovascular disease have already developed, aggressive lifestyle modifications improve the outlook. The first line treatment is change of lifestyle but drug treatment is frequently required. Lifestyle changes are required lifelong. They may include: Low calorie diet (800-1200kcal/day) to reduce weight and achieve desirable weight (BMI less than 25 kg/m2) Healthy eating habits: low intake of sugars, high-glycaemic index carbohydrates, saturated fat and trans fat Physical activity: at least 30 minutes of moderate-intensity activity on most days of the week A healthy weight loss is 0.5 kg to 1.0 kg a week. Amounts greater than this often involves loss of body water instead of fat. A dietician is important to provide advice on regular meal times, the avoidance of snacking, reducing portion size, and identifying foods that are high in energy. Fad diets are generally avoided as they work in the short term but lack the compliance for the long term. A detailed discussion of diet therapies, pros and cons of various diets is beyond the scope of this article. However, there is now a trend toward the use of a Mediterranean diet – one that is rich in “good” fats (olive oil) and contains a reasonable amount of carbohydrates and (such as from fish and chicken). The Mediterranean diet is palatable and easily sustained. In addition, recent studies have shown that when compared to a low fat diet, people on the Mediterranean diet have a greater decrease in body weight, and also had greater improvements in blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and other markers of heart disease. Exercise has been shown to be of benefit regardless of whether weight loss is achieved or not: Reduces total cholesterol and improved LDL/HDL cholesterol ratio The aim is to increase energy expenditure.

Learn about the types, symptoms, and treatment of diabetes here. Diabetes mellitus is a metabolic disorder. In this disorder, there is increase in blood sugar level. The cause may be lack of insulin or cells fail to respond and utilize insulin. It is considered as one among lifestyle disorders as unhealthy lifestyle is the major cause. Leading a healthy life style is necessary to manage diabetes. Type-1 diabetes: It is also called as insulin-dependent diabetes or juvenile diabetes. In this, there is deficiency in insulin production. Hence, insulin therapy is must for survival. Type-2 diabetes: It is also called as non insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus or adult onset diabetes. Here the cells develop resistance to insulin. Gestational diabetes: This is nothing but high blood sugar levels during pregnancy. Diabetes is diagnosed by testing sugar levels in your blood. My husband had five episodes of hypoglycemia in a single day. What could be causing all these? Tests include: (HbA1c), Fasting Blood Sugar (FBS), Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT), Random Blood Sugar (RBS), Postprandial Blood Sugar (PPBS). Urine test, in which the urine sample is tested for sugar and ketones. There are two types of complications namely the acute and chronic complications. : It includes sudden occurrence of life threatening complications like hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia. Low blood sugar level or is caused due to increased dosage of insulin injection or diabetic medications or may be due to skipping meals after medication or accidental administration of second dose of medicines, excessive physical exercise without proper diet. When there is a diabetic patient in your family, then the members of the family should be in a position to identify and manage hypoglycemia to prevent any fatal conditions. If you are driving, slow down immediately and park the vehicle in a safe place. If you are walking, sit immediately to prevent injuries due to fall. Eat 4 teaspoons of sugar or drink a cup of milk or chew 3-4 candies. This is nothing but inctrease in blood sugar level. Occurs after many years of onset of diabetes. Prolonged elevation in blood sugar causes damage to blood vessels leading to following complications. - Retinal damage leading to blindness. Diabetic nephropathy- Kidney damage causes chronic kidney failure. Diabetic nephropathy- Abnormal or decreased sensation in skin. Cardiomyopathy- Damage to heart leading to heart failure. - Formation of skin ulcers, infection and gangrene. Diabetic encephalopathy- Damage to brain cells may cause dementia. If you are diagnosed as diabetic, you should remember the below key points always. To identify hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia (i.e, high and low sugar levels). Eye care- regular eye check up by ophthalmologist, maintenance of hygiene during eye wash, avoid self medication, in case of eye infection or visual disturbance consult doctor immediately. Foot care- always wear a proper fitting shoes/sandals. Never walk in bare foot. Examine your foot regularly for any cuts, sores, cracks, etc. Cleanse the foot daily with mild soap. Take enough precautions while cutting nails to avoid injuries. Go for regular blood check up and consultation. level at home will also be helpful.

Similar to the way you might decide to get into physical shape, this app is meant to help you get into mental shape. Whether you’re looking to better understand your feelings, or you’re experiencing anxiety, depression, or high levels of stress, Moodfit is designed to help you feel better. Here's the gist of how it works: There’s a questionnaire that will help you determine the severity of the symptoms, as well as many articles and audio files that can help you better understand what you’re experiencing. Moodfit also allows you to track your moods. Over time, you’ll better understand what types of things affect your feelings—like sleep, medication, and exercise. The app offers actionable insights into what affects your mood and provides strategies for feeling better. There’s a cognitive behavioral therapy portion of the app which can teach you how to dispute overly negative thoughts. There’s a thought record that provides strategies for modifying irrational thoughts so you can learn how to think differently.  You’ll also learn new skills, like gratitude and mindfulness, in just a few minutes per day.  You can even use the app to create and test your own experiments. For example, if you suspect a certain food (like gluten) may be affecting your mood, the app allows you to track that. The app also helps you understand your medications and therapy better. It assists in identifying what treatment strategies are working best so you can gain a better understanding of how to improve your symptoms. Mood-boosting activities when you are low or anxious Evidence-based CBT activities for depression and anxiety Requires regular use for increased personalization Some of the activity options may be time-consuming or difficult MoodMission is an app that is meant to help people who are dealing with stress, anxiety, or depression. The app recommends “missions” based on how the user is feeling. Monash University is conducting research on the app and how it affects users. To help them gather data, users are asked to complete six surveys (that take about five minutes each) before unlocking the app. Survey questions cover topics such as emotions and general well-being. Each “mission” is an activity meant to improve your mood or skills. Missions may include things such as: Behavior-based activities like learning how to knit, crochet, or sew Thought-based activities such as learning how to reframe negative thoughts Simply select how you’re feeling (such as anxious, depressed or neither) and then identify how distressing your emotions are. Choose from a list of options to best identify the problem you’re experiencing, such as “I can’t stop thinking about something,” or “I can’t quite put my finger on it.” Based on your responses, the app suggests five different missions. Each mission contains objections and an explanation of how the activity may help.  You can then choose to accept a mission. After completing the mission, rate how distressed you feel. There’s a mission log that shows all completed missions and you’ll be assigned ranks as you progress through the app. The goal is to identify simple but effective strategies for boosting your mood.  Ability to talk to a licensed mental health professional Therapists can diagnose and treat different conditions Therapist communication styles may not suit your needs Talkspace connects you with a licensed mental health professional so you can receive therapy from your digital devices (computer, tablet, or smartphone).

Some key benefits include: : Because mental health apps are convenient and accessible, they can be a great resource for people who may struggle to access other options.  : Most mental health apps have measures that allow people to find information and access treatment in a way that is private and secure. : You can access these tools anywhere and at any time, making them a great option for busy people who are always on the go. : These apps can be an engaging and even fun way to learn about mental health and improve well-being. People are often able to set their own daily reminders, so regular notifications help them to stay engaged.  Research also suggests that mental health apps have a great deal of potential, both as treatment tools and as supplements to traditional therapy.﻿ One important feature that many mental health apps offer is the ability to monitor your anxiety. Such apps may offer informational resources to help you identify times when you are feeling anxious, and then have a quick way to record your mood and the events that preceded those feelings of anxiety.  Monitoring and recording your feelings of anxiety can help you learn to recognize the triggers that often contribute to such feelings. Once you recognize these signs, you'll be better able to manage the situations that cause you anxiety and practice relaxation strategies that can help you regain equilibrium. Moods can fluctuate considerably, but mental health apps allow users to track daily changes in their moods quickly and efficiently.﻿ Perhaps most helpfully, such tools often incorporate journaling tools that also allow users to keep track of the events, situations, or thoughts that played a role in the onset of a specific mood. Such tools can not only be helpful for seeing what factors affect your mood, but they can also help you look for patterns in your moods and emotions over time. You may notice that your mood tends to be lower or higher at certain times. By understanding these patterns, you can incorporate lifestyle changes or treatments into your life in order to boost your mood in both the short- and long-term. One study looked at the type of mood-tracking features offered by many mental health apps. Many apps focus on the collection and reflection on moods but don't do enough to help people take the next steps to actually change their moods.﻿﻿ One way to overcome this is to look for apps that are action-oriented or to incorporate other apps designed to promote preparation and action.

cec3c895-a496-4b61-ac3f-bb8036d6ad57,"Insulin dose lowering with alternative remedies and nutritional supplements, natural remedy July 2 2017 by Insulin, a released from the pancreas, is the primary substance responsible for maintaining appropriate levels. Insulin allows glucose to be transported into cells so that they can produce or store the glucose until it's needed. The rise in blood sugar levels after eating or drinking stimulates the pancreas to produce insulin, preventing a greater rise in blood sugar levels and causing them to fall gradually. Because muscles use glucose for energy, blood sugar levels fall during physical activity. See for a natural way to control this condition and lower the required dosage of insulin for optimal control. There are many medications that are prescribed to patients with high blood sugar levels including Front Biosci (Elite Ed). 2015. Natural supplements for improving insulin sensitivity and glucose uptake in skeletal muscle. Type 2 diabetes is a common metabolic disorder characterized by resistance to the actions of insulin to stimulate skeletal muscle glucose disposal. In light of the staggering financial/human cost of type 2 diabetes, there is considerable need for safe and effective agents that can be used to prevent and/or adjunctively treat the disease. Available evidence suggests that a number of natural supplements, including cinnamon, biotin, fenugreek, ginseng, , and alpha-lipoic acid, have the potential to reduce the risk for type 2 diabetes in the large at-risk population. The evidence also suggests that, when used adjunctively, these natural products are likely to help clinicians achieve optimal glycemic control, improve long-term prognosis, and/or minimize the need for insulin therapy in type 2 diabetics. The first inhalable version of insulin won federal approval, giving millions of adult diabetics an alternative to some of the regular injections they now endure. The Food and Drug Administration said the Inc. insulin, to be marketed as “Exubera,” is the first new way of delivering insulin since the discovery of the hormone in the 1920s. Pfizer jointly developed the drug and dispenser with Sanofi-Aventis and Nektar Therapeutics. Inhalable Insulin -  Is it cost effective? Pfizer Inc's inhaled insulin product Exubera should not be prescribed on Britain's state health service, the country's cost-effectiveness watchdog, NICE, recommended in 2006. Pfizer, the world's biggest pharmaceuticals group, said the preliminary opinion from the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) was ""perverse and short-sighted"". Exubera won marketing approval in both Europe and the United States in January, 2006 as a treatment for patients with Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes. But NICE -- whose function is to assess whether treatments are cost effective for the National Health Service -- said it did not offer sufficient benefits over conventional insulin injections to be worth the money. It estimated the cost of using Exubera to be 1,102 pounds ($1,931) per patient a year. That might be justified for people with severe fear of injections, NICE's appraisal committee said, but there was no way of identifying those who would gain sufficient benefit for the technology to be cost effective. Insulin resistance and how to reduce it, supplements, vitamins, herbal remedies Insulin resistance can be linked to diabetes, hypertension, high cholesterol and , cardiovascular disease and other abnormalities. These abnormalities constitute the insulin resistance syndrome. Because insulin resistance usually develops long before these diseases appear, identifying and treating patients with insulin resistance has potentially great preventive value.      Insulin resistance is a condition in which tissues such as fat and muscle in the body respond poorly to insulin, the major hormone required for glucose metabolism. This condition is present in pre-diabetic states and continues when a person develops diabetes. Research suggests that supplementation with chromium picolinate may help improve insulin resistance. However diet, weight loss, and exercise are the options to reduce insulin resistance.      Insulin resistance is a state in which a given concentration of insulin produces a less-than-expected biological effect. Insulin resistance has also been arbitrarily defined as the requirement of 200 or more units of insulin per day to attain glycemic control and to prevent ketosis. Amino Acids. 2016. Physiological and therapeutic effects of carnosine on cardiometabolic risk and disease. Obesity, type 2 diabetes (T2DM) and cardiovascular disease (CVD) are the most common preventable causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Carnosine (β-alanyl-L-histidine) is a dipeptide with anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, anti-glycation, anti-ischaemic and chelating roles and is available as an over-the-counter food supplement. Animal evidence suggests that carnosine may offer many promising therapeutic benefits for multiple chronic diseases due to these properties. Carnosine, traditionally used in exercise physiology to increase exercise performance, has potential preventative and therapeutic benefits in obesity, insulin resistance, T2DM and diabetic microvascular and macrovascular complications (CVD and stroke) as well as number of neurological and mental health conditions. High-calorie American diet causes insulin resistance within days. Chronic diseases have overtaken acute diseases, such as infections, as the major cause of premature mortality worldwide. Diabetes mellitus, a chronic degenerative metabolic disease, has reached epidemic proportions in the past 30 years, with worldwide prevalence approaching 400 million people. Men aged 20 to 32 years with acne are more likely to have insulin resistance and to have higher fasting plasma glucose levels than age-matched controls. Just one sleepless night can hamper the body's ability to use insulin to process sugar in the bloodstream. I may be no coincidence that while sleep duration has shortened in western societies in the past decade there has also been an increase in cases of insulin resistance and adult-onset diabetes. This is the advantage of getting some physical activity during the day so that you can get a deeper rest overnight. Individuals with high stress and high hostility levels have an increased risk of developing insulin resistance, which occurs when the body's response to insulin begins to slow down and blood sugar levels begin to rise. People with insulin resistance have a high risk of developing diabetes. Insulin resistance is associated with stress and certain personality factors, including hostility. Symptoms The syndromes of insulin resistance actually have a broad clinical spectrum, which includes obesity, glucose intolerance, diabetes, and metabolic syndrome X. Many of these disorders are associated with various endocrine, metabolic, and genetic conditions. These insulin resistance syndromes may also be associated with immunological diseases. Syndrome X, the state of insulin resistance also known as metabolic or dysmetabolic syndrome, has drawn the greatest attention because of the public health importance. In an effort to clinically identify patients with insulin resistance, various organizations have developed diagnostic criteria. The most commonly used criteria in the United States are those of the National Cholesterol Education Program / Adult Treatment Panel III (NCEP/ATP III). Green Tea effect Randomized controlled trial for an effect of green tea consumption on insulin resistance and inflammation markers. J Nutr Sci Vitaminol. 2005. Department of Nutritional Sciences, School of Food and Nutritional Sciences, University of Shizuoka, 52-1 Yada, Shizuoka, Japan To study the effects of the intake of green tea and polyphenols, which are a component of green tea, on insulin resistance and systemic inflammation, a randomized controlled trial was conducted on 66 patients aged 32-73 y (53 males and 13 females) with borderline diabetes or diabetes. Subjects in the intervention group were asked to take a packet of green tea extracts/powder containing 544 mg polyphenols (456 mg catechins) daily, which was a dose that could be taken without difficulty, and were asked to divide the green tea extracts/powder in a packet into 3 or 4 fractions dissolved in hot water everyday and to take a fraction after every meal or snack for 2 mo, in addition to daily food intake. In conclusion, the daily supplementary intake of 500 mg green tea polyphenols did not have clear effects on blood glucose level, Hb A1c level, insulin resistance or inflammation markers. The positive correlation between the level of polyphenol intake and insulin level warrants further studies on the effect of green tea on insulin resistance. An allergic reaction develops in 2% of patients that use insulin. This ranges in severity from erythema and pruritus to life-threatening . Allergic reactions to insulin usually occur within a few hours after an injection and are usually due to a local or systemic type I IgE-mediated hypersensitivity reaction. Despite considerable research into the immunogenicity of insulin, this has not yet been clarified completely and allergic reactions to insulin still occur. A blood test for anti-insulin antibodies and intradermal skin tests are indicated. There are several options available for the treatment of insulin allergy and each patient should be evaluated individually. Digestion of food in the intestines converts the compacted storage carbohydrates, starch and glycogen, to glucose. After each meal, a flux of glucose (more than 200 g) passes through the blood pool (4-6 g) in a short period of 2 hours, keeping its concentration ideally in the range of 80-120 mg/100 mL. Tissue-specific glucose transporters (GLUTs) aid in the distribution of glucose to all tissues. The balance glucose after meeting the immediate energy needs is converted into glycogen and stored in liver (up to 100 g) and skeletal muscle (up to 300 g) for later use. High blood glucose gives the signal for increased release of insulin from pancreas. Insulin binds to insulin receptor on the plasma membrane and activates its autophosphorylation. This initiates the post-insulin-receptor signal cascade that accelerates synthesis of glycogen and triglyceride. A major action of insulin is to inhibit gluconeogensis in the liver decreasing glucose output into blood. Cases with failed control of blood glucose have alarmingly increased in the past few decades coinciding with changed life-styles and large scale food processing. Appetite and satiety are subject to complex regulation, with neuroendocrine mechanisms playing an important role. The central nervous system is attracting increasing attention as a target tissue for many hormones such as leptin, PYY3-36, ghrelin, glucagon-like-peptide 1 and many others. Among its many well-known functions, insulin is also a potent appetite suppressing hormone, and insulin receptors are widely distributed throughout the central nervous system. I was directed to your site by one of my patients, and I noticed that someone had asked a question regarding Insulin and Alzheimer's. FYI, there is a growing body of evidence for diabetes as a risk factor for AD. Furthermore, it is known that beta amyloid is degraded by the insulin degrading enzyme (IDE) in the brain, and in those with insulin-resistant diabetes, this means that the excess insulin is preferentially degraded, leaving the beta amyloid to precipitate and form plaques even earlier than one might expect to see them otherwise. Just thought that info might be helpful. The information came from data presented by Dr. Richard Mayeux of Columbia University at the 9th International Conference on Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders, Philadelphia, July 2004. Sincerely, Amanda G. Smith, MD Assistant Director, USF Suncoast Alzheimer's and Gerontology Center, Tampa, FL 33617 suncoastalzheimers dotcom I am on insulin and have heard good things about acid. Can I take insulin and lipoic acid together?    We are not in a position to advise you on an individual basis, but as a general rule, if the lipoic dosage is low, such as 20 mg or less, then there should be no problems using it with your insulin. If you intend to take more lipoic, you should be monitored by your health care provider since blood sugar may be influenced by lipoic acid. Is a good supplement for a diabetic on insulin to take?    No general statements can be made that apply to everyone, but using 30 mg of CoQ10 a few times a week should be fine for most people, including those on insulin, but your doctor needs to approve. I am curious what supplements are recommended to mitigate insulin insensitivity. I hear that cinnamin tablets are good?     Cinnamon is a good option, so is alpha lipoic acid, banaba, bitter melon extract. 8th Annual World Congress on Insulin Resistance, Diabetes & Cardiovasular Disease (WCIR) Exploring of new frontiers in metabolism - tomorrow's clinical science today, 2010 Hilton Universal City Los Angeles, California Register NOW EARLY BIRD DISCOUNTCall for Abstracts Topics: Clinical topics may include any aspect of insulin resistance and its relationship to the causation and/or natural history of obesity, diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, dyslipidemia, gonadal dysfunction such as PCOS, gestational diabetes, other endocrine abnormality, inflammation, endothelial or other vascular dysfunction, liver disease (NAFLD), malignancy, and sleep apnea and other sleep disorders in childhood, adolescence and adulthood.All abstracts will be published in Diabetes & Vascular Disease Research.

Diabetes Self-Management offers over 900 diabetes friendly recipes to choose from including desserts, low-carb pasta dishes, savory main meals, grilled options and more. The amount of diabetes-related software has exploded in the past few years, fueled in part by the proliferation of applications for mobile phones. Nearly every and blood glucose meter now comes with computer software that can organize data from the device, and there are lots of offerings from independent companies that work with several different glucose meters. At the same time, the rise of smartphones – mobile phones with extensive software capabilities – has opened up a new market for on-the-go diabetes management programs. Some software programs now offer extensive features, while others remain fairly basic. There are programs for graphing blood glucose trends, programs that let you share blood glucose readings with your health-care provider, virtual logbooks, meal-planning aids, restaurant locators, educational guides, and more. This article describes a range of programs for different devices and platforms, varying in their purposes and capabilities. For prices and contact information, see the table There are many Web-based programs that allow the user to directly upload data from a blood glucose meter using a cable connecting it to a computer. These programs provide different views of blood glucose data, such as logbook, report, and graph formats. Some of them have account settings that can be adjusted so that a health-care provider can log in and see the user’s information. This way, the provider can offer recommendations by e-mail or prepare ahead for the next office visit. Some of these Web-based programs also offer educational materials and useful tips. is a blood glucose meter that wirelessly transmits blood glucose readings in real time to the password-protected portal or to the MyTelcare iPhone app. Both the Web site and the app offer a number of different graphs and charts that are constantly updated; you can also add notes to each reading and set goals and blood glucose ranges through the online portal. You can also give health-care providers access to the portal, allowing them to give feedback on your readings. is a free program that lets users upload blood glucose readings directly from a meter and then graph trends in easy-to-read formats. Trends can by viewed by the day, week, or month, or based on events such as exercise or meals. from Novo Nordisk lets users set and track goals in the areas of , physical activity, weight, and frequency of blood glucose monitoring. It also offers educational materials, meal-planning guides, and many other features. is an online system designed to share information between children with diabetes and their parents, teachers, school nurses, and health-care team. Blood glucose readings can be entered by the child, teacher, or school nurse either on the Web site or by text message. Whenever new data is entered – either a blood glucose reading, an insulin or carbohydrate dose, or a note – all designated parties receive a copy by text message or e-mail. The system can be set up so that some people, such as parents, get notified for every data entry and other people, such as the school nurse or members of the child’s health-care team, are alerted only if an out-of-range level is reported. The following software programs will work on most home computers running Windows and on Macs when indicated. Most programs can be downloaded from the manufacturer’s Web site, and many are also available on CD upon request. Lifescan offers the diabetes management software to work with its OneTouch blood glucose meters. Any OneTouch meter with a data port and cable can have its stored blood glucose readings transferred to the OneTouch software using the OneTouch USB Interface Cable. The program has extensive reporting and graphing options designed to help the user spot trends and patterns in blood glucose levels. Reports generated by the program can be printed, faxed, or e-mailed. from Animas accepts data from the full range of Animas insulin pumps and from Lifescan blood glucose meters. Pump and meter data are used to generate reports and logs that can be viewed on-screen, printed, or e-mailed to your health-care provider. One useful feature of this program is the ability to create a graph that compares blood glucose readings with insulin use and carbohydrate consumption. Note that this feature only works if you store insulin and carbohydrate data in your insulin pump or if you manually enter this information into the software. is compatible with both Windows and Mac platforms. The from Abbott Diabetes Care is a Windows-based program that works with Abbott’s line of glucose meters. The software offers graphical trend analysis, detailed reports, and the ability to share data with your health-care team – features similar to those of previously mentioned applications. AgaMatrix, the maker of Wavesense blood glucose meters, offers data management software called As the name implies, its main distinguishing feature is that it loads data and creates charts automatically when you plug your meter into the computer. Most diabetes-related applications, or for smartphones are made for the iPhone (and, therefore, also often work on the iPad and iPod touch). But many apps exist for other devices and platforms, as well. So depending on what kind of phone you have, browse the iTunes App Store, Android Market, Amazon Appstore, or Blackberry App World to see what is available. is an iPhone app from AgaMatrix (the maker of WaveSense meters) that lets you track blood glucose levels, insulin doses, and carbohydrate intake by manually typing in that data. The program color-codes each blood glucose reading so that you can easily see when you are low (red), high (yellow), or in the desired range (white). Data can be viewed in logbook or graphical format. One attractive feature of this app is streaming video from dLife TV, with segments covering diabetes education, cooking, blood glucose control, and much more. According to the AgaMatrix Web site, the company is also working to make it possible to import data to the program using a special cable that connects its blood glucose meters to the iPhone. You can sign up to receive notice of that product’s release. from Sky Health is an iPhone application that allows you to enter glucose numbers, carbohydrates, insulin dosages, and activities. All log entries can be edited with detailed notes and also graphed for visual representations. All data is synced with the user’s account on using the Quick Sync button in the application. You can also use your iPhone to access the Glucose Buddy Forum, where you can read and post articles, post questions, comments, and other information. from Communiteq Systems is an app for the Blackberry line of phones. It lets users manually enter data such as blood glucose levels, cholesterol readings, blood pressure, weight, meal composition, physical activity, and doses of insulin and other drugs. Users can view stored information in a variety of formats and easily share it with anyone by e-mail. The program includes a searchable database of more than 7,000 foods with their nutrition information, and users can configure and save typical foods and meals. This means that whenever you eat a meal you’ve saved in the program, you can just refer to it by name instead of entering all of the foods individually. can also wirelessly receive data from the Bluetooth-enabled MyGlucoHealth glucose meter. Coheso offers a proprietary handheld computer called the to help with diabetes management. It allows users to record blood glucose levels, food intake, physical activity, and drug doses. Also included is a nutrition database of more than 50,000 foods, including the offerings of 250 restaurants and 500 food brands. Some health insurance companies offer Internet-based rewards programs as an incentive to be more health-conscious. One program, for example, offers enrollees a list of activities associated with a healthier lifestyle, such as exercise, weight loss, and tobacco cessation. Each activity is worth a certain number of points, and once you collect enough, you can redeem them for a gift certificate to stores such as Amazon, Best Buy, or Blockbuster. A similar program is by HealthPrize Technologies. This Web-based software lets users record when they take prescribed drugs to track compliance; it is offered by many employers and health insurance companies as a way to motivate individuals to take prescribed drugs as directed. There is also a HealthPrize iPhone app that syncs with the online software. Users receive points for taking medicines regularly and, as in many insurers’ awards programs, can spend these points at an online shopping mall. Many software programs exist to help people with diabetes track the nutrient content of meals. from Sanofi-aventis allows users to search for thousands of foods and menus from popular grocery stores and restaurants, giving the calorie count as well as information on fat, protein, and carbohydrate for each. The program uses the nutrition database, which contains more than 25,000 common foods and menu items from more than 200 restaurants, as well as a restaurant locator. is available for the iPhone and for Android. is designed to help users achieve weight loss by keeping track of calories consumed in meals and burned through exercise. It follows the same concept as the online program, which requires a membership account; by contrast, is a stand-alone computer program. It supports up to five users per computer, and the included food database is updated automatically. The personal profiling feature lets you know how many calories you need each day to reach or maintain your desired body weight. Versions are available for Mac, Windows, and Palm OS devices. an iPhone app, helps keep track of your daily intake of carbohydrate as well as fat, protein, and calories. There is a diabetes feature that lets you keep track of blood glucose levels, insulin doses, and exercise. This information can be viewed in chart form and compared with target levels that you set. a product of Quantia-Care, is a free app that provides daily tips and suggestions for getting more physical activity. It was developed by certified diabetes educator Gary Scheiner, a frequent contributor to magazine, and is available on a number of platforms. Each tip is delivered via voice, text, and images, and most tips take about a minute to listen to. There are lots of software programs that offer diabetes education, both for home computer and for the iPhone. Savvy Knowledge Systems has created Type 1 Diabetes in Children: A Passport to Knowledge. This Windows-based program both entertains and educates children using animated videos and interactive content, helping them understand how diabetes works. It also deals with how to control diabetes and its complications. An educational app for the iPhone is from Medtronic. This app has a guide showing nutritious food choices with common serving sizes and corresponding carbohydrate values. Children can learn to count carbohydrates through interactive games with Lenny the Lion, who is a global ambassador for children’s diabetes education. The Didget blood glucose meter from Bayer HealthCare falls more in the category of motivation than education, but it may help children keep up with their diabetes management. This meter plugs into a Nintendo DS or Nintendo DS Lite system and lets users play games whenever they check their blood glucose. It includes the video game and for use with the Nintendo gaming systems. The number of software applications to help manage diabetes has grown enormously in recent years and continues to grow. More apps for the iPhone, in particular, are appearing every day. While many of these apps simply duplicate the functions of ones that already exist, some have adopted useful features such as compatibility with blood glucose meters and automatic syncing with Web-based software. This typically allows for more data storage and more extensive graphing and reporting capabilities than a phone app would have on its own. How do you figure out which products are right for you? A good place to start is to try out the software supplied by your meter or pump manufacturer for a couple of weeks. If it does what you need it to do, great! If not, then figure out which features you want or need and start looking at other programs. Do you want it to run on your home computer, your smartphone, or the Internet? How much money are you willing to spend on equipment and software? Whatever your situation, chances are there is a program that is right for you.

The news out of the United Kingdom in June 2003 was a call to action for people with diabetes and their physicians. Investigators in the Heart Protection Study had reported a year earlier that the drug simvastatin had lowered levels in study subjects and reduced the risk of heart attack and by 25%. The researchers then looked at the subgroup of subjects who had diabetes, and published their findings in June 2003. They found that lowering levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (often referred to as “bad” cholesterol) by 39 mg/dl resulted in a 22% reduction in the likelihood of a first heart attack or stroke in people with diabetes. Significant cardiac benefits were found even in people who entered the study with no signs of arterial hardening and those whose LDL levels were within ranges that don’t automatically suggest the need for LDL-lowering drugs. These results led the researchers to conclude their report with a declaration that “statin therapy should now be considered routinely for all diabetic patients at sufficiently high risk of major vascular events, irrespective of their initial cholesterol concentrations.” The relationship between heart disease and the various forms of (blood fats such as cholesterol and ) was described as early as the 1930’s and confirmed in the Framingham Heart Study in the 1970’s and by many other studies since then. Cholesterol is a key contributor to , the “hardening of the arteries” that leads to heart disease, stroke, and . This is particularly important to people with diabetes, in whom atherosclerosis is much more prevalent. Three-quarters of people with diabetes will die of complications that arise from atherosclerosis. They have a 2–4 times higher risk of heart attack and stroke and are more likely to die in the hospital undergoing a cardiac procedure. They also do less well following a heart attack or surgery. Atherosclerosis in the peripheral circulation, primarily in the arteries of the legs, is 2–4 times more likely in people with diabetes. This can lead to dangerous clots, pain, and amputation. People with diabetes, in particular Type 2 diabetes, have a characteristic (lipid disorder) that puts them at higher risk of atherosclerosis. They tend to have high blood levels of triglycerides and low levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. HDL cholesterol is often referred to as “good” cholesterol, because it appears to protect against atherosclerosis. Although people with diabetes tend to have levels of LDL cholesterol that are the same (or only slightly elevated) as people who don’t have diabetes, their LDL particles are of a different and more dangerous kind. The LDL particles in people with diabetes are different because they contain more triglycerides. “When you increase the concentration of triglycerides in LDL cholesterol, its structure changes and it becomes a smaller, denser particle,” says Leonard M. Keilson, MD, MPH, a lipids specialist practicing in Portland, Maine. “These dense LDL particles are particularly dangerous, because they can more easily cross the endothelium — the lining of the arteries — and enter the wall of the vessels.” Fatty deposits in arterial walls lead to atherosclerosis. Diet modification and exercise can help with this dyslipidemia, although Dr. Keilson cautions that they are most effective in people who have (a group of problems including cholesterol abnormalities, abdominal obesity, high blood pressure, and that increase the risk of diabetes, heart disease, and stroke) as opposed to full-blown Type 2 diabetes. “You can ‘convert’ a person with metabolic syndrome to what is essentially a nondiabetic state with diet modification and exercise,” Dr. Keilson says. “In true diabetes, though, the risk of heart disease is profound, and many physicians will go directly to pharmaceutical therapy to give their patients maximum protection.” Even with the known benefits of diet and exercise and the existence of a variety of medicines, however, many people with diabetes are still at increased risk. At least half of the people with diabetes in the United States have total cholesterol levels above 200 mg/dl, which is the upper limit of the desirable range. This disturbing report comes from a January 2004 review of data in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 1999–2000. The review found that 51.8% of the people with diabetes in the survey had total cholesterol levels above 200 mg/dl. This was improved from a similar survey conducted between 1988 and 1994, but it means that millions are still above current cholesterol-lowering treatment goals. The primary focus of dyslipidemia treatment in all people, with diabetes or not, is LDL cholesterol. Overwhelming evidence from clinical trials, experimental animals, laboratory research, and epidemiology points to LDL cholesterol as the form of cholesterol most likely to cause atherosclerosis. Current standards call for lowering levels of LDL cholesterol below 100 mg/dl for people with known atherosclerosis. Diabetes is now considered a “coronary heart disease risk equivalent,” so people with diabetes are managed as if they already have atherosclerosis. There are two ways to lower LDL levels: lifestyle changes and drug therapy. The American Diabetes Association (ADA) recommends starting diet and exercise changes if one’s LDL level is over 100 mg/dl and adding drug therapy if it exceeds 130 mg/dl. For people with diabetes who already have cardiovascular disease, however, drug therapy should be started along with lifestyle changes if their LDL levels are above 100 mg/dl. Observational studies have concluded that people who adopt healthier diets and get more exercise have fewer heart attacks and other such cardiac events. Both diet modification and exercise have been shown to improve the dyslipidemia of diabetes, so by extension they are considered the best first-line treatment. The ADA calls diet modification “medical nutrition therapy,” or MNT, and the American Heart Association includes it with exercise in what it calls “therapeutic lifestyle changes,” or TLC. Both recommendations call for reducing saturated fat in the diet and replacing it with an increased intake of carbohydrate or monounsaturated fat. Intensively following such a diet has been shown to result in a 15–25 mg/dl reduction in LDL levels. “Diet and exercise can be expected to reduce LDL levels by no more than about 10%,” Dr. Keilson says. “Appropriate drug therapy, on the other hand, can bring about a 30% to 50% decrease. Exercise and diet are still important, for a variety of reasons, but the risk of heart disease is so high in people with diabetes that most should probably have drug therapy as well.” The first drug of choice to lower LDL cholesterol levels is usually an HMG CoA reductase inhibitor, or These drugs, including pravastatin (brand name Pravachol), simvastatin (Zocor), lovastatin (Mevacor), fluvastatin (Lescol), rosuvastatin (Crestor), and atorvastatin (Lipitor), are well tolerated with few short-term or long-term side effects. The Heart Protection Study used simvastatin and reduced cardiovascular events by 25% in people with diabetes. (The authors of the study note that the 25% reduction was observed in people who didn’t always take their statin properly; taking simvastatin as prescribed 100% of the time, they predict, could reduce cardiac events by 33%.) Trials of the other statins have had similarly convincing results, with mean reductions in cholesterol of 20%, average reductions in the incidence of coronary artery disease of 30%, and average reductions in mortality of 29%. Statins also have the bonus effect of lowering triglycerides as much as 35% and raising HDL levels 10%. The newest statin, rosuvastatin, appears to be the most powerful of all, with significantly greater effect on all the lipids than other members of the family. There are consistent, though uncommon, reports of muscle weakness and aches in people taking statins, though the incidence has been the same in clinical trial participants taking . One in every thousand people taking a statin develops a condition called with an elevated level of the muscle enzyme creatine kinase (CPK) accompanying the muscle aches. Rarer still, about one in every 10,000 people taking a statin progresses to serious muscle disease and acute kidney failure, although the early signal from raised CPK levels should give plenty of time to stop therapy before that happens. The benefits of statins nonetheless far outweigh the rare serious side effects, according to a clinical advisory from the American College of Cardiology, the American Heart Association, and the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute. “Given a one-in-five chance of heart disease in diabetes,” Dr. Keilson says, “the one-in-10,000 chance of serious side effects from the statins shouldn’t keep anyone from reaping the benefits of the therapy.” A five-year study funded by the National Institutes of Health comparing the side effects of simvastatin and pravastatin against placebo is due to be completed this year. The $5 million study is investigating issues such as muscle pains and anecdotal reports of cognitive dysfunction in people taking statins. Alternative LDL-lowering drugs include the bile acid sequestrants, such as cholestyramine (Questran, Questran Light) and colestipol (Colestid). These drugs lower LDL cholesterol and have few serious side effects, though they have been associated with bothersome gastrointestinal side effects. Some may also find cholestyramine and some forms of colestipol unpalatable because they are powders or granules that must be mixed with water. (A tablet form of colestipol is available.) A newer drug in this class, colesevelam (WelChol), comes in tablet form and may be better tolerated and as effective as its predecessors. The bile acid sequestrants can raise triglyceride levels, so in a person with high triglycerides, nicotinic acid, or niacin, is sometimes used instead because it has been shown to decrease levels of LDL cholesterol and triglycerides and to raise levels of HDL cholesterol. The Coronary Drug Project examined the benefits of niacin in people who had had heart attacks and found an 11% lower mortality after 15 years. The side effects of therapeutic niacin treatment include flushing, gastrointestinal upset, and liver damage. Flushing can be reduced by using extended-release (Niaspan) or sustained-release formulations of niacin, but risks of liver damage increase with use of sustained-release (but not extended-release) niacin. Niacin can also cause high blood glucose levels in some people, so there has been concern about using it in people with diabetes. However, a study published in 2000 concluded that niacin could be safely used in people with diabetes, increasing HDL levels by 29% while lowering LDL levels by 8% and triglycerides by 23%. Current guidelines for people with diabetes allow for its use with mindfulness of the potential side effects. Ezetimibe (Zetia) is the first in a new class of drugs called cholesterol absorption inhibitors. In clinical trials, it has significantly lowered LDL levels and moderately lowered triglyceride levels and raised HDL levels. Ezetimibe is much better tolerated than the bile acid sequestrants and may ultimately replace them in routine therapy. Once LDL levels are brought under control, the next step is to address elevated triglyceride levels. The drugs of choice for this therapy are the fibrates: gemfibrozil (Lopid), clofibrate, and fenofibrate (Lofibra, Tricor). In addition to lowering triglycerides, they also moderately lower LDL cholesterol and can change the size of LDL particles from the small, dense type that is more likely to cause atherosclerosis to a larger type. The most common side effects of the fibrates are primarily gastrointestinal symptoms. The Helsinki Heart Study of gemfibrozil demonstrated a 10% drop in total cholesterol, an 11% drop in LDL, a 35% drop in triglycerides, and an 11% increase in HDL. The Diabetes Atherosclerosis Intervention Study (DAIS) used fenofibrate therapy and measured the progress of atherosclerosis using angiography, documenting a 40% reduction in the progress of the disease. Other triglyceride-lowering agents include fish oils that have high levels of . In addition to lowering triglycerides, omega-3 fatty acids also help reduce blood clotting and improve other facets of heart function. Flaxseed oil is also rich in omega-3 fatty acids and has the advantage of not having a fishy taste. There are a number of drugs that are often prescribed for people with diabetes for other purposes but which have some positive effect on lipids as well. Since people with diabetes may be taking these medicines anyway, Dr. Keilson feels they can be an important part of the management of dyslipidemia. The (TZDs), rosiglitazone (Avandia) and pioglitazone (Actos), are used primarily to reduce the insulin resistance common in Type 2 diabetes. In people taking a TZD, the size of LDL particles increases, and HDL levels rise. Pioglitazone also lowers triglyceride levels, but rosiglitazone raises LDL levels. The primary side effects of the TZDs are weight gain and fluid retention. The American Heart Association and the ADA have recommended caution in using them in people with congestive heart failure or risk factors for it and additionally recommend that they not be used in people with advanced congestive heart failure. At higher doses, (Glucophage, Glucophage XR) is able to reduce total cholesterol levels. Metformin is also linked to some weight loss, which can have a beneficial effect on lipids. Acarbose (Precose) is used primarily to slow the absorption of complex starches in the intestine, helping to reduce high blood glucose levels after a meal. It also appears to lower LDL levels and raise HDL levels in the process. The evidence for lipid benefits from miglitol (Glyset), which is in the same drug class as acarbose, is inconclusive. The anti-obesity drugs orlistat (Xenical) and sibutramine (Meridia) are primarily used for weight loss but may have positive effects on blood lipids as well. Orlistat blocks the enzymes that break down fat in food, preventing as much as 30% of the fat from being absorbed. Treatment with orlistat has produced statistically significant lowering of total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and triglycerides in a clinical trial. Sibutramine works through the central nervous system to suppress appetite. The Sibutramine Trial of Obesity Reduction and Maintenance (STORM) found that in addition to its weight-loss benefits, sibutramine lowered levels of triglycerides and increased levels of HDL cholesterol. The complex dyslipidemia of diabetes often calls for a combination of drugs to achieve target levels of cholesterol. Most common are combinations of statins, which are effective for lowering LDL levels, with other drugs that address high triglycerides and low HDL levels. “If you have a person with a low LDL level but who has high triglycerides and a low HDL level,” Dr. Keilson says, “you need to treat him differently than a person with high LDL levels. You can attempt to control his problem with more intensive blood sugar control, which will lower triglycerides, and with dietary modifications that reduce carbohydrates. After that, the next step would be to add a fibrate, fish oil or flaxseed oil, or niacin. The addition of ezetimibe to statin therapy may be especially helpful in raising HDL levels.” In one study that added ezetimibe to statin therapy, for instance, LDL levels were reduced, HDL levels were increased, and triglyceride levels were lowered compared to statin plus placebo therapy. Combination therapy also can have an additive effect on lowering LDL levels. The addition of the bile acid sequestrant colesevelam to statin therapy has been shown to result in an 8% to 12% greater reduction in LDL levels than statin therapy alone. Niacin is also used with statin therapy, because the two drugs have complementary effects. A combination drug that contained both extended-release niacin and lovastatin (Advicor) was put to the test against atorvastatin and simvastatin in the Advicor Versus Other Cholesterol-modulating Agents Trial Evaluation (ADVOCATE). The combination drug lowered LDL levels, increased HDL levels, and decreased triglyceride levels better than atorvastatin or simvastatin alone. Niacin plus statin combination therapy was also explored in the HDL-Atherosclerosis Treatment Study (HATS). Subjects who had already had coronary artery disease were given either placebo or niacin and simvastatin, with or without antioxidant vitamins. The group on niacin and simvastatin that did not receive antioxidants achieved a 42% reduction in LDL levels, a 36% decrease in triglycerides, a 26% increase in HDL levels, and a 90% reduction in coronary events. (The group taking antioxidants with niacin and simvastatin had slightly lesser improvements in cholesterol, but more important, the reduction in cardiovascular events disappeared.) LDL levels in the placebo groups were unchanged. The goal of lipid therapy in diabetes is to return the levels of all lipids to as close to normal as possible. (See ) It is achievable in nearly every person, and the arsenal of drugs that can add to the benefits of diet and exercise is growing steadily.

Whether you consider yourself an athlete or an occasional recreational sports participant, you benefit from any activity that you do, because all exercise can improve your body’s ability to use insulin. If you do not inject or infuse insulin to treat your diabetes, exercise should result in a decreased release of insulin by your pancreas and a more efficient uptake of blood glucose by muscle cells. If you use insulin, however, you may be concerned that exercise can complicate the normal maintenance of your blood glucose level. Active people who use insulin need to make frequent adjustments in their diabetes regimen to maintain blood glucose in target range, especially when doing higher-intensity or longer-duration exercise. But the effort can pay off in improved blood glucose control, reduced , improved cardiovascular fitness, and weight loss. When it comes to managing exercise effectively, continuous, subcutaneous insulin-infusion therapy (or more simply, insulin pump therapy) is an option to consider. Scientists attempting to mimic the insulin delivery of a normal, healthy pancreas first developed insulin pumps in the late 1970’s. Today’s cell-phone–size pumps are much more sophisticated and give both basal insulin doses (background insulin delivered every few minutes in small increments to cover your body’s general need for insulin) and boluses (larger doses given to cover meals and snacks or to lower elevated blood glucose at any time). Currently, roughly 500,000 individuals with diabetes worldwide wear portable insulin pumps, and this number has been increasing each year. Most pump users have Type 1 diabetes, but some people with Type 2 diabetes who require insulin are choosing to pump insulin as well. A main advantage of insulin delivery via an insulin pump is more reliable insulin action through a constant infusion of short-acting insulin, along with precise dosing and timing of insulin to cover food intake. Many insulin pump users experience improved overall blood glucose control, reduced risk of nighttime low blood glucose, and improved awareness of low blood glucose (). Insulin pumps contain a reservoir or cartridge filled with insulin, either Regular or one of the rapid-acting insulin analogs, insulin lispro (brand name Humalog), insulin aspart (NovoLog), or insulin glulisine (Apidra). Compared to Regular insulin, these insulin analogs have a more rapid onset of activity (5 to 15 minutes versus 20 to 30 for Regular) and an earlier peak in activity (90 minutes versus 150 minutes). Their use allows for a blood glucose response following carbohydrate intake that is closer to that of a person without diabetes and for a more rapid correction of hyperglycemia (above-normal blood glucose levels). All insulin pumps currently on the market deliver insulin subcutaneously (under the skin) in the abdomen, buttocks, legs, or upper arms, either through a needle or through a plastic infusion catheter. Pump users replace the needle or catheter infusion set every two to three days with a new set at a new site. Pump users with active lifestyles can experience a metabolic response to exercise that is similar to that of people who do not have diabetes. In part, this is simply because of how an insulin pump works, by delivering small amounts of fast-acting or rapid-acting insulin continually. But it also depends on the user monitoring his blood glucose level frequently, adjusting basal and bolus doses to fit the exercise, and learning from experience. ( to see some sample basal profiles.) The amount of insulin circulating in the blood has an important effect on a person’s metabolic response to exercise. In general, people who don’t have diabetes have less insulin circulating in the blood during exercise. Likewise, research has shown that people who use an insulin pump can program it so that they have less insulin circulating in the blood during exercise than people who use multiple daily injections, putting them at lower risk for hypoglycemia. The explanation for the difference in insulin levels is that exercise causes increased blood flow to the skin, and in people who use multiple daily injections, this causes subcutaneously injected long-acting insulin to enter the bloodstream earlier than it normally would, effectively raising the circulating insulin level. An insulin pump, on the other hand, does not deliver insulin more rapidly than usual when blood flow to the skin increases. In fact, if desired, an insulin pump can be programmed so that it delivers less insulin than normal prior to exercise or it can be disconnected ahead of time so that no additional insulin enters the bloodstream. The time of day you exercise can also affect your circulating insulin levels. In the morning, blood glucose levels tend to decrease less with exercise because of naturally higher levels of certain at that time of the day that help raise blood glucose levels. Pump users may choose to exercise before breakfast and before bolusing any insulin to ensure low circulating insulin levels. However, some may be able to perform 30 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise two to three hours after breakfast without a high risk of hypoglycemia, despite slightly higher insulin levels after eating. Later in the day, levels of counterregulatory hormones fall, so you will likely need to reduce your pump’s basal insulin delivery for perhaps 60–90 minutes prior to moderate or strenuous activities lasting longer than 30–45 minutes. Basal rates may also need to be lowered during the exercise to reduce insulin levels sufficiently. To achieve optimal control, you will also need to make appropriate insulin-bolus reductions for any exercise closely following a bolus to minimize circulating free insulin levels and the risk of hypoglycemia during and following the activity. Even with insulin pump use, your metabolic control with exercise can worsen under certain conditions. If your blood glucose level is elevated (250 mg/dl or higher) and you have ketones in your blood or urine, you are insulin-deficient and are at risk of developing diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), a life-threatening condition that may require emergency treatment in a hospital. Exercising when you are insulin-deficient is likely to raise your blood glucose level even higher and hasten your progression toward DKA. It is therefore not recommended in this circumstance. The type of exercise you do can also cause blood glucose level to rise (albeit temporarily). A short period of intense exercise, such as heavy weight lifting or sprinting, especially when done before breakfast, can cause your blood glucose level to rise during the activity and stay elevated for two or more hours afterward. High blood glucose after intense activity is found both in people who have diabetes and in those who don’t; it is attributed to an exaggerated hormonal response to intense activities. For such activities, pump users may need to elevate basal insulin rates during and for a period after the exercise, or give an additional small bolus of insulin. The insulin pumps currently for sale in the United States provide a variety of features. With regard to exercise, the most important features to consider are the following: The number of basal profiles that can be programmed and saved in a pump’s computer memory. Being able to program several different profiles could be particularly useful for people who participate in several sports or who alternate intense workouts with less intense workouts.   The degree to which basal and bolus doses can be fine-tuned. Some pumps allow the user to fine-tune doses to the nearest one-tenth of a unit, whereas others allow the user to fine-tune doses to the nearest one-fortieth of a unit. Being able to make very small changes in insulin delivery may be particularly important to insulin-sensitive individuals, such as those on a total daily insulin dose of 30 units or less.   How a pump handles temporary basal settings. Pumps vary in the degree to which a temporary basal setting can be fine-tuned and the length of time a temporary setting can be maintained.   The ability to deliver extended boluses. If insulin must be bolused shortly before exercise, giving a bolus over a period of time can help lower the risk of hypoglycemia during the activity by keeping circulating insulin levels lower.   Some possible drawbacks of insulin pump use with exercise are important to know about. Excessive sweating can cause your subcutaneous infusion set to dislodge, which may result in elevated blood glucose or ketoacidosis if you fail to notice the displacement for some time. To prevent infusion set displacement due to sweating, try using a liquid skin preparation such as Skin-Tac-H to anchor the set more firmly to your skin, or apply additional tape below the infusion set. You can also apply antiperspirant to your skin around the infusion site to minimize sweating beneath it. Or you can try wearing the infusion set in an area of the body that experiences less movement with activity, such as the buttocks. A potential problem for those using metal needles is irritation of the infusion site as a result of movement or contact. Flexible plastic infusion sets do not cause this problem. Especially when you exercise vigorously, you must adhere to the recommendation to replace your insulin infusion set every two to three days to prevent displacement or irritation at the insertion site. It is also recommended that you check the integrity of your infusion site following vigorous exercise, sweating, or water contact. Another potential problem is that insulin is temperature-sensitive. Exercise in hot or cold environments can potentially cause insulin to degrade and lose effectiveness. When an insulin pump is placed close to your body during exercise in the heat, the insulin may become overheated; if the pump is placed outside your clothing in the cold, the insulin may freeze. If unexpected high blood glucose arises following such conditions, replace both the infusion set and the insulin in the reservoir as a precaution. Especially with the use of rapid-acting insulin analogs in your pump, DKA can begin as few as five hours following the displacement of your infusion set. When you become insulin-deficient due to any interruption of insulin delivery, exercise can exacerbate this situation and cause DKA to occur even more rapidly. Due to the severity of DKA, insulin pump users must be especially vigilant about maintaining the integrity of their infusion sites during exercise to prevent it from occurring. In general, pump users should replace their entire cartridge and infusion set at the first sign of any unanticipated high blood glucose that does not respond to additional boluses. To keep your blood glucose in the target range during and after exercise, follow some basic guidelines: Some activities, such as weight lifting, use mainly anaerobic energy sources and can have a markedly different effect on blood glucose level than prolonged or moderate-intensity aerobic exercise such as walking. Short-term, high-intensity anaerobic exercise can stimulate hormones that counteract the effects of insulin and often cause an increase in blood glucose level that can last for an hour or more after exercise. Mild to moderate aerobic exercise, on the other hand, tends to cause a decrease in blood glucose level. Predict your blood glucose response and make regimen changes. Based on the type of activity you do, time of day you exercise, and amount and timing of your insulin delivery, you can often predict the effect of exercise on your blood glucose level and make appropriate changes. Of paramount importance are the length and intensity of the exercise and your training level. Each time you try a new activity, check your blood glucose level frequently (before, during, and several times after an activity) to establish your usual response to the exercise, as well as variations from your predicted response. Make regimen changes (increased carbohydrate consumption and/or decreased insulin) based on your previous blood glucose response to an activity. You may also make regimen changes based on whether physical fitness or weight loss is a goal of the exercise. If you want to train hard and frequently for fitness, you will have to eat to replace the calories you are using. If weight loss is your goal, you may want to lower your insulin doses (instead of snacking) to maintain blood glucose control. Learn to adjust your insulin doses to prevent hypoglycemia from occurring during exercise and for up to 24 hours afterward. Consider leaving your basal rate lowered for a longer period of time following more strenuous or prolonged activities. Once you have been doing an activity consistently for two to three weeks, you will experience a training response that will alter your blood glucose usage. Training increases your capacity for fat utilization, which has the potential effect of sparing blood glucose. For prolonged aerobic activities, training may result in your blood glucose level dropping less during an activity, resulting in the need for smaller regimen changes. In addition, as your muscle mass increases in response to training, your overall insulin sensitivity may increase, lowering your basal and bolus insulin needs. The American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) and the American Diabetes Association (ADA) have established general clinical practice recommendations for exercise and diabetes that apply to insulin pump users as well. According to these guidelines, people with diabetes should avoid exercising if their fasting blood glucose level before exercise is above 250 mg/dl and there is an elevated level of present in the blood or urine. A blood glucose level above 300 mg/dl with no ketones indicates the need for “caution.” A third guideline is to ingest some carbohydrate if one’s blood glucose level before exercise is below 100 mg/dl. The problem with these recommendations is their generality, so before beginning an exercise regimen, talk with your health-care provider about what you personally should do in these situations. It is a good idea for all people with diabetes to check their preexercise blood glucose level. However, contrary to the ACSM and ADA guidelines, pump users with a blood glucose level below 100 mg/dl before exercise may not require a carbohydrate snack since they can simply reduce or suspend basal insulin during an activity. The insulin reductions and/or carbohydrate intake you require for aerobic activities will depend on the intensity and duration of your activity. You should be able to compensate for shorter, less intense activities with a change in either your insulin (basal and/or bolus doses) or carbohydrate intake. For short, intense activities such as weight training, you may not require any immediate regimen changes, but you will need to anticipate and prevent delayed-onset hypoglycemia from occurring later on. For longer, more intense exercise, you will generally require a combination of carbohydrate intake (15-60 grams per hour) and insulin reductions (25%-100%) to maintain normal blood glucose levels. To effectively use your insulin pump during exercise, learn to program it according to your needs, understand the basic guiding principles for exercise, and follow the general recommendations for regimen changes presented here. If you have decided to get a pump, keep in mind that choosing one is mainly a matter of your preference: All of the current models can be used effectively for most types of physical activity. The benefits of exercise far outweigh the risks, so don’t use your diabetes as an excuse to avoid exercise. Stay fit!

By , Laura Hieronymus, DNP, MSEd, RN, MLDE, BC-ADM, CDCES, FADCES “The only exercise some people get is jumping to conclusions.” –Fred Allen If jumping to conclusions is your only form of physical activity, you are overlooking one of the top tools available to improve your diabetes control! Healthful eating, medicine if you need it, and blood glucose self-monitoring are important basics of diabetes management, but only physical activity provides a host of benefits for your quality of life, blood glucose control, and overall health. In addition to lower blood glucose readings and decreased body fat, regular exercisers report increased self-esteem, reduced stress, and enhanced clarity of thought. Routine physical activity also improves your self-efficacy, which is confidence in your ability to change and control your behavior. Despite these and other potential benefits, more than 60% of American adults are not regularly active, and 25% of the adult population are not active at all. Take a moment to learn more about the magic of movement, then get ready, get set, and go! Make a commitment to improving your health by including more physical activity in your life. Simply put, exercise lowers blood glucose. To perform physical activity, the muscles burn glucose for energy and absorb glucose from the blood during and after exercise to replenish their stores. However, most people with Type 2 diabetes have , in which muscle, fat, and liver cells do not respond normally to insulin. As a result, it takes more insulin than normal to admit glucose into the cells. Exercise, in addition to simply burning glucose, improves the body’s ability to use insulin. This improvement in insulin sensitivity may allow some people with Type 2 diabetes to reduce or even discontinue blood-glucose-lowering medicines with increased physical activity. In addition, for those with either Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes, resistance exercise builds muscle mass, which may continue to burn glucose even when a person is not actively exercising. Regular physical activity increases a person’s aerobic fitness level, reducing his resting heart rate as the heart pumps more efficiently. Lower blood pressure, total , LDL (“bad”) cholesterol, and levels, as well as increased HDL (“good”) cholesterol levels, are additional benefits that are of special concern to those with diabetes because of their increased risk of heart disease. And if you are trying to lose a few pounds, consider this: Physical activity not only helps people lose weight, but it has been proven to help them keep weight off for months and even years. It’s really not magic at all. Science supports the recommendation that regular physical activity is one of the most important things you can do to improve your diabetes control and sense of well-being. If you’re making a commitment to physical activity, start your efforts off on the right foot by meeting with your doctor to discuss any limitations or restrictions you may have. Formal exercise testing prior to beginning a training program can be helpful in many ways, including identifying undiagnosed heart disease and determining your pulse and blood pressure responses to various levels of exercise intensity. In addition, screening for diabetes complications that may be worsened by certain exercises is essential. This evaluation is also valuable in designing an individualized exercise prescription and opening up a discussion about important factors to consider before beginning your program. If you are planning to begin a moderate- to high-intensity physical activity program, you may be a candidate for a graded exercise test (“stress test”) if you meet any of the criteria established by the American Diabetes Association (ADA). (For the ADA’s criteria, see ) Diabetes complications can affect your choice of physical activities, making some safer for you than others. For example, if you have (diabetic eye disease) you may want to avoid activities that dramatically elevate blood pressure (such as power weight lifting), involve pounding or jarring (such as jogging or boxing), bring the head level with or lower than the heart, or are very strenuous, because of their potential to cause retinal detachment or a vitreous hemorrhage (in which blood leaks from vessels in the retina, blocking vision). Those with (diabetic nerve disease) may have lost the protective sensation in their feet. They should limit weight-bearing exercise such as step aerobics or prolonged walking or jogging because repetitive exercise on insensitive feet can lead to ulcers and fractures. However, most exercises can be enjoyed by most individuals with diabetes. Low-impact activities such as swimming, chair exercises, or stationary cycling are good alternatives for those with complications. When you consider an exercise program, don’t feel as though you’ll be required to run a marathon to improve your health and diabetes control. The Surgeon General’s Report on Physical Activity and Health (1996) states that significant health benefits can be obtained by including a moderate amount of physical activity (such as 30 minutes of brisk walking or raking leaves, 15 minutes of running, or 45 minutes of playing volleyball) on most if not all days of the week. A moderate amount of physical activity is equivalent to physical activity that uses approximately 150 calories of energy per day, or 1,000 calories per week. Greater health benefits can be achieved by increasing the amount (duration, frequency, or intensity) of physical activity. If you’re not able to set aside at least 30 minutes at a time for physical activity, you’ll be happy to know that research has shown that cardiorespiratory fitness gains are similar when physical activity occurs in several short sessions (10 minutes at a time, for example) as when the same total amount and intensity of activity occurs in one longer session (30 minutes all at once). Think in terms of accumulating physical activity over the course of the day. Walking, gardening, and washing windows are as important to your fitness efforts as a formal exercise class. (For more about walking, see ) If you do choose to start a structured exercise program, plan to include proper warm-up and cool-down periods. A warm-up should consist of 5—10 minutes of aerobic activity, such as walking or cycling, at a low intensity, which gets your body ready for the more intense activity to follow. Gently stretch your muscles for another 5—10 minutes, then begin your chosen activity. Afterward, do a cool-down session that lasts 5–10 minutes and is similar in structure to your warm-up. Your goal is to return your heart rate to preexercise levels. The benefits of physical activity are immense, but you also should give consideration to staying safe while exercising with diabetes. Obtaining medical clearance if needed, and developing an appropriate exercise plan are important steps to safe fitness. In addition, consider the following issues: Properly fitted shoes are essential if you are participating in aerobic physical activity. The ADA recommends using shoes with cushioned midsoles (gel or air) as well as polyester or blend (cotton—polyester) socks to prevent blisters and keep the feet dry. Monitor your feet closely for blisters and other potential damage both before and after physical activity, particularly if you have neuropathy in your feet. A diabetes identification bracelet or shoe tag should be clearly visible when you exercise. People who use insulin or certain diabetes drugs that cause the pancreas to increase insulin production are at risk for low blood glucose, or , when they exercise. For this reason it is important to carry a source of carbohydrate to raise low blood glucose levels if necessary during and after physical activity. Most people are advised to treat themselves if their blood glucose falls below 70 mg/dl by consuming at least 15 grams of carbohydrate. These foods provide 15 grams of carbohydrate per serving: 3 glucose tablets, 1/2 cup fruit juice, 2 tablespoons raisins. Because the major effect of physical activity is lower blood glucose levels, monitoring before, during, and after exercise is important. Be sure you are familiar with the symptoms of low blood glucose and the steps for treating it. It is possible to develop exercise-induced hypoglycemia several hours after the activity has ended because your muscles continue to take up glucose from the bloodstream, so be prepared to check your blood glucose level and have a source of carbohydrate available in the hours after exercise. The effect of activity on your blood glucose level depends on many factors, including the time of day you exercise, the timing and dosage of your insulin or pills, when you last ate, your level of fitness, and the duration and intensity of your exercise session. You may need to eat additional carbohydrate before or during exercise if you plan to engage in vigorous or prolonged activity (lasting more than 45 minutes). In these situations, an intake of 15 to 30 grams of carbohydrate every 15 to 30 minutes should be enough to keep hypoglycemia from occurring. Each person’s reaction to exercise is different, though, so it is important to check your blood glucose level regularly during prolonged activity. Hypoglycemia with physical activity is generally not as common in people with Type 2 diabetes as in those with Type 1, particularly if they don’t take blood-glucose-lowering medicines. These individuals probably won’t need extra food when participating in physical activity. Indeed, the extra calories can prevent a person with Type 2 diabetes from losing weight and reaching his blood glucose goals. If a person’s blood glucose level is high before exercising, it may be dangerous to exercise. The ADA recommends that people with Type 1 diabetes avoid physical activity if fasting blood glucose levels before exercise are greater than 250 mg/dl and ketones are present in the blood or urine. They should also use caution if preexercise blood glucose levels are greater than 300 mg/dl and no ketones are present. are a sign that the body doesn’t have enough circulating insulin. When this is the case, the muscles don’t have access to enough glucose for the extra energy demands of exercise, causing the liver to produce more glucose and the body to break down fat stores for energy. If ketones – potentially toxic by-products of this process – build up in the bloodstream faster than the body is able to process them, a person is at risk for diabetic ketoacidosis, a serious condition that can lead to coma and even death. People who have Type 2 diabetes, on the other hand, can often exercise safely with elevated blood glucose levels. In fact, since physical activity tends to lower blood glucose, a little exercise may be “just what the doctor ordered.” However, it is still prudent for people with Type 2 diabetes who begin exercise with high blood glucose to check their level after about 15 minutes of activity to see whether it is going up or down. If you’ve carefully considered your exercise options and planned ahead for safety issues, it’s time to jump in and begin enjoying the benefits of physical activity. Start your exercise program gradually. Some soreness is common in the early stages, particularly if you have not been physically active in recent years. There are several ways to tell if you are overdoing physical activity while you are exercising. One is to do the “talk test.” You should be able to talk comfortably with someone while you are participating in an activity. If you are so short of breath that you can’t converse with your exercise buddy, you need to slow down to avoid becoming overtired or injured. Another way to determine if you are exercising at an intensity that is appropriate for you is to think about how much effort you are putting into the activity. This method is called the Borg RPE (Rating of Perceived Exertion). Using this scale, you rate your level of effort from 0 (“feels like nothing at all”) to 10 (“very, very hard/maximal”). A Borg rating of 3 to 5 (“moderate” to “hard”) is probably the right spot for you to improve your health and fitness without endangering yourself. Anytime you experience pain, shortness of breath, dizziness, weakness, or other discomfort, stop exercising and direct your attention to resolving the problem. It’s easy enough to make well-intentioned New Year’s resolutions aimed at improving your physical fitness. The trick is to stay motivated to reap the rewards of a healthy lifestyle and better diabetes control. Making physical activity a regular part of your life means planning ahead. Set a specific fitness goal for yourself with very detailed and realistic terms. For example, your goal might be “to walk at lunchtime for 30 minutes three days per week.” Mark your walk days on your calendar so you won’t forget them, and give yourself a pat on the back for each week you reach your goal. Inviting your friends and significant others to exercise with you can make your physical activity plan more enjoyable and easier to stick to. Even if they don’t have diabetes, this fact may convince them to join in: Published research has shown that lifestyle modification (weight loss and regular moderate physical activity) can reduce a person’s risk of developing Type 2 diabetes, delaying or even preventing the onset of the condition. The benefits of physical activity are amazing. Take them to heart and get moving!

By Laura Hieronymus, DNP, MSEd, RN, MLDE, BC-ADM, CDCES, FADCES, When you were diagnosed with diabetes, your doctor probably told you that your blood glucose levels were too high. Indeed, high blood glucose, or is the hallmark of diabetes. Regardless of your knowledge of diabetes at that time, you may have wondered what the significance of high blood glucose levels was for you. The answer is that hyperglycemia is linked to the development of long-term , which include (kidney disease), (eye disease), (nerve damage), and skin problems, and blood vessel disease, and . That’s why individual treatment plans for people with diabetes focus on preventing hyperglycemia and keeping blood glucose levels as close to the normal range as possible. Keeping blood glucose levels close to normal requires learning how to balance food intake, physical activity, and the effects of any diabetes medicines your doctor may prescribe to lower your blood glucose level. For some people, the balancing act also involves learning to avoid , or low blood glucose. In healthy people who don’t have diabetes, blood glucose levels typically run in the range of 65–110 mg/dl and may rise to 120–140 mg/dl one to two hours after eating. A diagnosis of diabetes is made when a person’s (a measure of glucose control over the previous 2–3 months) is 6.5% or higher, his fasting blood glucose level is above 126 mg/dl on two separate occasions, or when he has symptoms of diabetes (such as excessive thirst and urination) and his nonfasting blood glucose level is greater than 200 mg/dl on two separate occasions. Until several years ago, a diagnosis of , a condition in which blood glucose levels are high but not high enough for a diagnosis of diabetes, was made when a person’s fasting blood glucose level was between 110 mg/dl and 126 mg/dl. In 2004, an international expert committee on diabetes recommended diagnosing prediabetes when a person’s fasting blood glucose level is 100 mg/dl, and the American Diabetes Association (ADA) has adopted this recommendation. On the basis of research showing that maintaining near-normal blood glucose levels significantly reduces the risk of diabetes-related complications, both the ADA and the American College of Endocrinology (ACE) have established recommended goals for blood glucose control for most adults with diabetes (see ). These goals may be modified for certain populations. For example, the goals for blood glucose control are typically lower for women with diabetes who are pregnant. For children and the elderly, particularly those who take as part of their treatment plan, the goals may be higher for safety reasons. Because each person’s situation is different, it is important to work with your diabetes care team to set individualized blood glucose goals that are right for you. Two significant studies that paved the way toward today’s blood glucose goals are the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT) and the United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS). Both demonstrated that the closer blood glucose levels are kept to normal, the less likely a person with diabetes is to develop complications. The DCCT followed 1,441 people with Type 1 diabetes for an average of about seven years. The subjects were divided into two groups: the “conventional” treatment group, and the “intensive” treatment group. While the group that was treated intensively did not achieve normal, nondiabetic blood glucose levels, they were able to achieve an average blood glucose level of 155 mg/dl. The conventionally treated group’s blood glucose level averaged 231 mg/dl. During the study period, the intensively treated group had an approximate 60% reduction of risk for neuropathy, nephropathy, and retinopathy. Intensive therapy not only delayed the onset of complications but it also slowed the progression of complications in those who already had them, regardless of age, sex, or duration of diabetes. The UKPDS examined the effects of varying levels of blood glucose control in 5,102 individuals with Type 2 diabetes, who were followed for an average of 10 years. The intensively treated group achieved an average blood glucose level of 150 mg/dl, while the conventionally treated group’s average blood glucose levels were approximately 177 mg/dl. In this study, intensive blood glucose control resulted in a 25% reduction of risk for neuropathy, nephropathy, and retinopathy. Furthermore, the study concluded that for every percentage drop in glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), there was a 35% reduction in the risk of complications. As these studies make clear, it is worth the effort to take steps to control your blood glucose, but how do you do that? And how do you know if you have hyperglycemia in the first place? The best way to identify hyperglycemia is to routinely monitor your blood glucose levels on a schedule determined by you and your health-care team and to get regular HbA1c tests, also on a schedule agreed on by you and your health-care team (usually two to four times a year). That’s because hyperglycemia may not cause any symptoms until blood glucose levels are much higher than recommended ranges. So just because you feel OK doesn’t necessarily mean your blood glucose level is well controlled. When they do occur, symptoms of hyperglycemia may include frequent urination, hunger, dry mouth, thirst, blurred vision, numbness or tingling in the hands and feet, decreased sexual function, and fatigue. All of these symptoms should prompt immediate action, starting with checking your blood glucose level with your meter to see if it’s high. What you do next will depend in large part on how you normally treat your diabetes. Because regimens for treating diabetes vary widely, there is no “one size fits all” plan for treating hyperglycemia. If you currently treat your Type 2 diabetes with meal planning and exercise, for example, you may be instructed to add several minutes to your usual exercise routine or to decrease your carbohydrate intake at your next meal when your blood glucose level is high. If you have Type 1 diabetes and use an , you may be instructed to take more insulin (possibly via syringe or insulin pen), and your diabetes care team will teach you how to determine how much insulin to take based on your blood glucose level. It’s extremely important to work with your diabetes care team to develop an individualized hyperglycemia action plan for you. No matter what type of diabetes you have or how you treat it, part of your hyperglycemia action plan will likely be more frequent , at least temporarily, to help determine why your blood glucose is high and what you can do to avoid future episodes of hyperglycemia. Indeed, prevention is the best and most effective way to treat hyperglycemia. Many variables, some of which are described here, can upset the delicate balance that is necessary for the best diabetes control. When dealing with diabetes, you will inevitably experience some if not all of the following issues. If you eat more food than is balanced with your physical activity and, in some cases, diabetes medicines, your blood glucose level may rise above your goal range. Carbohydrate-containing foods directly affect your blood glucose level after eating, so reviewing the amount of carbohydrate in your meals and snacks may be helpful in determining the cause of hyperglycemia. Carefully reading on food products and measuring portions will help you to meet your carbohydrate goals. On packaged foods, the total carbohydrate per serving is listed on the Nutrition Facts panel of the label. Meals that are high in fat may contribute to prolonged elevations in blood glucose after eating. Working with a registered dietitian, preferably one with experience in diabetes management, can be helpful in fine-tuning your meal-planning and skills. If you experience hyperglycemia in spite of sticking to your meal plan most of the time, it may indicate that the medicines included in your diabetes regimen need adjusting. If this is the case, undereating will not help lower your blood glucose level; you should consult your physician. Exercise usually lowers blood glucose levels because it improves your cells’ sensitivity to insulin and helps cells burn glucose for energy. But if your blood glucose level is high before you exercise, it may go higher during exercise. When you begin exercising, your liver pumps out extra glucose to fuel your muscles. If your body has too little insulin circulating in the bloodstream to allow the cells to use the extra glucose, your blood glucose level will rise. High blood glucose levels with exercise can also be a sign that you are working too hard and your body is under stress. If this is the case, you need to slow down and gradually work up to a more strenuous level of activity. For people with Type 1 diabetes, the ADA advises avoiding exercise if fasting blood glucose levels are above 250 mg/dl and are present in blood or urine; caution should be used if blood glucose levels are above 300 mg/dl and no ketones are present. People with Type 2 diabetes may wish to consult their diabetes care team for individual recommendations. Insulin and diabetes pills are taken to lower blood glucose levels, so forgetting a dose, taking the wrong dose, or taking the right dose at the wrong time can contribute to hyperglycemia. If you develop hyperglycemia, here are some questions you may want to ask yourself regarding your medicine(s): Double-check to make sure your dose was accurate. Sometimes different doses of the same oral diabetes medicine or insulin are prescribed at different times of day. Did the correct dose coincide with the correct time? It is only human to forget things from time to time, even parts of your daily routine. If you think you may have forgotten to take your medicine, ask yourself if you specifically remember taking it. Can you backtrack to determine if you took it? If you seem to forget to take your medicine regularly, look for patterns: Are you having difficulty remembering a certain dose? If so, you may want to brainstorm some ways to remember it, such as setting an alarm for dose time or posting a note to yourself in a place you can’t miss. Insulin pumps generally have a review screen that allows you to see whether doses have been delivered. Check the expiration date on your medicine to see if it is still good. Most pills have a long shelf life, but insulin does not. In addition, the expiration date on the insulin packaging is for unopened, refrigerated vials, disposable pens, or pen cartridges. Once opened, most vials of insulin last for 28 days, but many pens and pen cartridges are good for only 7, 10, or 14 days. Pump users should change their infusion set and the insulin in the pump reservoir every two to three days. These limits should be noted in the insulin package insert. If you’re not sure how long your opened container of insulin will last, ask a member of your diabetes care team or your pharmacist or call the manufacturer’s customer service number. Is your technique for taking your medicine adequate? If you take pills, be sure you’re taking them at the right time of day. Some pills must be taken right before meals to work effectively; others do not. If you take insulin by pen or syringe, review your injection technique with your diabetes care team. You should be aware that if you switch to a different syringe or insulin pen or from one to the other, the injection technique may differ. Insulin, as well as oral medicines, can lose potency if exposed to heat, cold, or moisture. Your best bet is usually to store opened containers of medicines you are currently using at room temperature. Unopened pills can also be stored at room temperature. Insulin that has not been opened should be stored in the refrigerator. Be careful not to place insulin in the particularly cold areas of the refrigerator — typically the meat compartment and at the backs of the main shelves — where it may freeze. If you use an insulin syringe or insulin pen, do you always use the same size needle? Some people find that a change in the needle length can disrupt their control. If you use an insulin pump, review the set-up of your infusion set with your diabetes care team to assure accurate insulin delivery. If you order pump supplies by mail, double-check your order when it arrives to make sure you received the correct supplies. Using a different size catheter or a different tubing length than usual may change the amount of priming necessary. (All pump users should have alternative methods of insulin delivery on hand should their pump malfunction or stop delivering insulin for any reason.) In addition, check your injection or infusion sites periodically. If toughening or scarring of the skin is present, this may affect absorption of your insulin. If you use an insulin pump, is the battery power sufficient? Avoid going to sleep at night or becoming preoccupied with other things when your battery is low. Be attentive to low battery warning alarms, and change your batteries promptly when they sound. Don’t wait until you’ve used the last drop of energy in your battery. Are you taking any other medicines that could affect your blood glucose level? Certain types of drugs — including prescription drugs, over-the-counter drugs, and herbal preparations — may contribute to hyperglycemia. Common prescription drugs that have a tendency to increase blood glucose levels include corticosteroids (used to treat inflammation) and thiazide (used to treat high blood pressure). Any time you receive a prescription for a new drug, whether for a diabetes-related condition or not, ask your doctor if it may have any effects on your blood glucose levels. In addition, tell your health-care team about any over-the-counter medicines or alternative therapies you use so that together you can determine whether those substances or practices are having an effect on your blood glucose control. During periods of stress, the body releases so-called stress hormones, which cause a rise in blood glucose level. In the short term, this gives the body the extra energy it needs to cope with the stress. But if a person doesn’t have adequate insulin circulating in his bloodstream to enable his cells to use the extra energy, the result will be hyperglycemia. And if stress becomes chronic, hyperglycemia can also become chronic. Stress hormones may be released during physical, mental, and emotional stresses. Injury, illness, infection, and surgery are some examples of physical stresses that often cause hyperglycemia. In fact, hyperglycemia may be a clue that an otherwise symptomless infection is present. Resolving hyperglycemia caused by physical stress generally involves both treating the underlying cause and treating the hyperglycemia itself with changes to the usual diabetes treatment regimen. Because everyone can expect to be ill at some point, people with diabetes are encouraged to work out a sick-day plan in advance with their diabetes care team. Your sick-day plan should have specifics on what to eat and drink when you’re sick, over-the-counter products that are safe to use, as well as details on taking your usual medicines and adding supplemental insulin if needed. It should also indicate when to call your health-care provider. Psychological stresses such as difficulties with relationships, job pressures, financial strain, and even concerns about self-worth can contribute to hyperglycemia. If these issues become overwhelming, decreased attention to the diabetes treatment plan may also contribute to hyperglycemia. Learning stress-reduction techniques may help over the long term, and your diabetes care team may be able to help you identify other resources that can help you deal with feelings of overwhelming stress. Hormones other than stress hormones can affect blood glucose levels, as well. Premenopausal women may experience higher-than-usual blood glucose levels about a week prior to menstruation, when levels of progesterone, estrogen, and other hormones involved in ovulation are changing. In addition, some women find that they have a tendency to eat more during this phase of the menstrual cycle, which may further increase blood glucose levels. It can be useful to track your menstrual cycle along with your blood glucose levels to determine whether your cycle is affecting your blood glucose levels and to learn to make adjustments to your diabetes regimen when needed. During perimenopause, which can last for several years before the complete cessation of menstruation, the menstrual cycle becomes less and less consistent. This can upset the balance of blood glucose control due to the unpredictability of hormonal levels. Pregnancy hormones also affect blood glucose control. In fact, insulin adjustments are often necessary every 7–10 days during pregnancy, especially during the second and third trimesters, to adjust for changes in hormone levels as well as for the weight increases that come with pregnancy. Because hyperglycemia can contribute to a number of complications during pregnancy, close monitoring of blood glucose control is essential during and ideally before pregnancy. In men with diabetes, low testosterone levels may contribute to increased insulin resistance, which can contribute to hyperglycemia. However, while testosterone replacement therapy has become a topic of great interest among both consumers and medical professionals, few studies have examined the long-term effects of testosterone replacement. Men concerned about low testosterone should seek individual guidance from their doctors. Some people with diabetes allow their blood glucose levels to run higher than recommended because they are afraid of developing hypoglycemia (low blood glucose). This fear is certainly normal, since hypoglycemia can cause a person to lose bodily control, but a better response to this fear is to learn to prevent episodes of hypoglycemia while keeping your blood glucose levels in the best possible control. If fear is causing you to let your blood glucose level run high, talk with your diabetes care team to work out a plan that will help you avoid both lows and highs. Another potential cause of hyperglycemia is the intentional or deliberate omission of insulin doses. This behavior is often linked to the presence of an eating disorder. Omitting needed insulin allows blood glucose levels to run high enough to cause the body to eliminate glucose through the urine and therefore decrease calorie absorption. This practice can enable a person to control his weight and, over time, to lose weight, which may be the desired result. However, repeated omission of insulin can lead to diabetes complications, worsen existing complications, and even lead to coma and death. If you or someone you know is intentionally omitting insulin doses as a means of weight control, it is urgent that you seek help from your diabetes care team or a qualified mental health professional. Eating disorders can be treated; left untreated, they can cause devastating health consequences. Managing hyperglycemia is important both to avoid long-term complications and to avoid the acute hyperglycemic states known as ketoacidosis and hyperosmolar hyperglycemia. These disorders can occur in people with Type 1 diabetes as well as those with Type 2 diabetes, although the risk of ketoacidosis is higher among people with Type 1 and the risk of hyperosmolar hyperglycemia is higher among elderly people with Type 2. Ketoacidosis is characterized by high blood glucose levels (over 250 mg/dl), the presence of ketones in the blood or urine, and dehydration. In hyperosmolar hyperglycemia, blood glucose levels are typically extremely high (over 600 mg/dl), and small amounts of ketones may be detectable in blood or urine. Emergency care in the hospital may be needed to reverse ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar hyperglycemia. Infection, which, as noted earlier, causes the release of stress hormones, is the most common precipitating factor in the development of both problems. An interruption in insulin delivery from a pump or taking inadequate amounts of insulin by pen or syringe is also a common underlying factor in the development of ketoacidosis. Other factors that may lead to acute hyperglycemia are , alcohol abuse, pancreatitis, heart attack, trauma, and certain drug therapies. Preventing episodes of severe hyperglycemia involves knowing the causes and symptoms of hyperglycemia, monitoring blood glucose levels often enough to catch hyperglycemia in its early stages, and having a plan to deal with hyperglycemia should it occur. The fact that infection is what commonly leads to ketoacidosis and hyperosmolar hyperglycemia underscores the importance of discussing sick-day management with your diabetes care team before you become sick. The only way you can truly know your blood glucose level is to check it with your meter. You should discuss when and how often to monitor with your diabetes care team. A diabetes educator can help you determine the type of equipment that is best for you, as well as make sure you are familiar with how the equipment works. More important, with your doctor’s help, your diabetes educator can help you learn to self-manage your diabetes by working through the challenges of managing hyperglycemia. Keep in mind that even with your best efforts in managing your diabetes, you may still experience high blood glucose from time to time. But if your blood glucose levels remain higher than your treatment goals on a regular basis despite your attempts to follow your diabetes treatment plan, talk to your physician. You may need to update your plan to meet your diabetes control needs.

c99a0a45-f633-44cf-9771-643faddb72e4,"Research shows that physical activity has numerous health benefits for people with diabetes and prediabetes[1]. Indeed, it can improve blood glucose[2] management as well as overall health. Many people with diabetes focus their exercise goals on aerobic exercise, such as cycling[3] or walking[4] at a brisk pace. But while aerobic exercise is important, resistance training (strengthening your muscles) is another significant part of achieving maximum health benefits when you have diabetes. The term resistance training, or strength training, often conjures images of buff men and women in the gym lifting heavy weights. The truth is that routine strength training is appropriate and beneficial for most people with diabetes. Resistance training consists of exercise movements that put tension on your muscles using some type of resistance. This resistance helps build muscle and increase strength. A common kind of resistance training is the use of free weights, but that is not the only way to strengthen your muscles. You can also use resistance bands, weight machines and even exercises that rely on your own body weight to get the same results. The good news is that you certainly do not have to be a bodybuilder to reap the benefits of resistance training, and you don’t even have to step foot in a gym. With just a few items, you can develop and maintain an effective strength-training routine from the comfort of your own home. To get cutting-edge diabetes news, strategies for blood glucose management, nutrition tips, healthy recipes, and more delivered straight to your inbox, sign up for our free newsletter[5]! As noted earlier, resistance training has many health benefits for people with diabetes. Such training can provide a safe and effective way to optimize blood glucose levels, increase strength and improve quality of life. It can also lead to lowered insulin resistance[6], fat mass and blood pressure[7], as well as improvements in lean body composition, bone density and cardiovascular health. Having diabetes can put you at risk for decline in both muscle strength and functional status (the ability to perform normal daily activities) as you age. Incorporating strength training into your exercise routine can help combat those effects of aging. Improved mood and well-being are also great benefits when you add resistance training to your exercise regimen. When you do strength-training exercises, your body uses glucose from your bloodstream to power your muscles. Think of your muscles as a lot of little “gas tanks” that store glucose. Since glucose from food is absorbed largely by muscle tissue, exercise that improves muscle mass is particularly good at improving blood glucose levels. Because of this, you may actually see an improvement of your hemoglobin A1C (HbA1c[8], a measure of glucose control over the previous two to three months). If you have type 2 diabetes, your body’s cells have become resistant to insulin. Insulin is the hormone needed to move glucose from the bloodstream into your body’s cells to be used for energy. If you have insulin resistance, this process does not work correctly, and your blood glucose becomes elevated over time. Studies have shown that resistance training makes your body sensitive to insulin for about 24 hours. Thus, adding strength training to your routine can help improve your body’s sensitivity to insulin. Another benefit of resistance training is that you use a lot of energy to build and maintain muscles. The more muscle you have, the more calories you burn, even when you are not exercising. This makes strength training an excellent strategy for weight loss and maintenance. While aerobic exercise can result in loss of both fat and lean body weight, strength training actually helps preserve and build lean body weight as you lose fat. Resistance training helps improve overall functional status for people with diabetes. A strength routine of any intensity is recommended for improvement in strength, balance[9] and the ability to do activities of daily living. Training can improve bone density and lower the risk of developing osteoporosis[10], as well as strengthen your joints, which is important to maintain mobility as you age. If you have never done strength training before, it is best to start slowly and progress gradually. Resist the urge to do too much too quickly. A strength routine should be individualized for your age, fitness level and specific health issues. Working with a fitness professional, particularly one who is knowledgeable about diabetes, is a great way to develop a safe and effective exercise prescription to learn proper form and avoid injury. The intensity and duration at which you begin will vary, so concentrate on making progress. Steady progression is the key. The American Diabetes Association recommends that people with diabetes start with two to three nonconsecutive weekly sessions[11] of resistance-training exercises. Each session should consist of five or more different strength-training exercises. A good starting point is one to three sets per exercise. (A set is simply a group of consecutive repetitive exercise motions.) Start with a weight that you can do eight to 10 repetitions with in each set. Focus on doing exercises that use large muscle groups, such as your thighs and upper arms, versus those that use smaller ones. Using resistance bands or body weight to strength train is a great option if you do not have free weights. These methods are inexpensive and can be done anywhere. It is essential to take time for a proper warm-up before you begin your strength routine. A five-minute warm-up with a combination of stretching and light aerobic exercise (such as walking in place) is all it takes to warm up your muscles. Strength training without a proper warm-up can lead to injury. In addition, always rest between sets. A 30- to 60-second rest period is appropriate in most situations. Finally, set aside five minutes at the end of your workout for a cool-down period. Resistance training should be done on nonconsecutive days, meaning you will need to rest your muscles at least one day between strength-training sessions. Muscle fibers develop microscopic tears during a workout. Don’t worry — this is how they grow, but it is important that you let your muscles rest between sessions. If you feel sore, take it easy until you feel better. Forget the old motto “no pain, no gain.” It is no fun to work out in pain, and doing so increases your risk of injury. As with any exercise, resistance training affects blood glucose levels, so you should monitor your glucose level before, during and after exercise. Glucose monitoring is how you can see the effect training has on your body. Individual response to exercise is different based on fitness level, duration and intensity of the activity, as well as pre-exercise blood glucose levels. If you take insulin[12] or glucose-lowering medications that can cause hypoglycemia[13] (low blood glucose), the risk can increase during exercise. It is important to know the warning signs of hypoglycemia. In some cases, it may be good to have a light meal or snack before your exercise session. You may need to adjust your insulin dose and/or carbohydrate intake based on the intensity and duration of your workout. Low blood glucose levels can happen for several hours after exercise, so it is important to continue to monitor. For those with type 1 diabetes[14], exercising with hyperglycemia[15] (high blood glucose) and elevated blood or urine ketones[16] is not recommended. If you are new to resistance training, it is a good idea to consult with your diabetes provider to see if there are any precautions you need to take. Ask if you might benefit from an exercise stress test before starting a new exercise routine. Especially if you have uncontrolled blood pressure, heart problems[17], severe neuropathy[18] (nerve damage) or other serious illnesses or conditions, you should check with your diabetes care provider before beginning a strength-training regimen. Resistance training is not recommended in anyone with severe nonproliferative or unstable proliferative diabetic retinopathy[19] because the condition may worsen. Make sure to wear proper, well-fitting footwear[20] and examine your feet daily for any sign of injury. Lastly, stay hydrated[21] and avoid exercise in extreme weather conditions. Adding resistance training is a great way to improve blood glucose control, strength and ability to participate in activities of daily living. Ideally, a well-rounded fitness program for someone with diabetes includes both aerobic and resistance exercises. In addition to two to three resistance training sessions per week, at least 150 minutes of weekly moderate-intensity aerobic exercise is recommended. Research shows that the greatest health benefits come from a combination of aerobic exercise and strength training. Start today with a new and improved fitness routine!

Thyroid disorders are very common in the general U.S. population, affecting up to 27 million Americans, although half that number remains undiagnosed. It is second only to as the most common condition to affect the endocrine system — a group of glands that secrete hormones that help regulate growth, reproduction, and nutrient use by cells. As a result, it is common for an individual to be affected by both thyroid disease and diabetes. Since the thyroid gland plays a central role in the regulation of metabolism, abnormal thyroid function can have a major impact on the control of diabetes. In addition, untreated thyroid disorder can increase the risk of certain and can aggravate many diabetes symptoms. Luckily, abnormal thyroid function can easily be diagnosed by simple blood tests, and effective treatment is available. For all of these reasons, periodic screening for thyroid disorder should be considered in all people with diabetes. The thyroid is a butterfly-shaped gland located in the neck, just below the Adam’s apple and above the collarbone. It produces two hormones, thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3), which enter the bloodstream and affect the metabolism of the , liver, muscles, and other organs. The thyroid gland operates as part of a feedback mechanism involving the hypothalamus, an area of the brain, and the pituitary gland, which is located within the brain. First, the hypothalamus sends a signal to the pituitary through a hormone called TRH (thyrotropin-releasing hormone). When the pituitary gland receives this signal, it releases TSH (thyroid-stimulating hormone) to the thyroid gland. Upon receiving TSH, the thyroid responds by producing and releasing the two thyroid hormones (T3 and T4). The pituitary gland “monitors” the level of thyroid hormone in the blood and increases or decreases the amount of TSH released, which in turns regulates the amount of thyroid hormone produced. Thyroid hormone regulates the way the body uses energy. It works by attaching to specific proteins called receptors that are present in cells throughout the human body. Therefore, thyroid hormone exerts wide-ranging effects in regulating the function of virtually every organ. Consequently, any changes in the blood level of thyroid hormone can affect many body systems and cause a wide range of symptoms. The extent to which each organ is affected varies widely between individuals, which is why thyroid dysfunction causes very different symptoms in different people. In general, the severity of symptoms of abnormal thyroid function depends on the severity of the actual condition, the length of time it has been present, and the person’s age. As a result, it is difficult to correctly diagnose thyroid disorder based only on symptoms. Fortunately, precise measurement of thyroid function is now possible with the TSH blood test, a test that directly measures the amount of TSH produced by the pituitary gland. There are two basic disorders of the thyroid: hypothyroidism, or an underactive thyroid gland, and hyperthyroidism, or an overactive thyroid gland. The most common disorder of the thyroid is an underactive thyroid gland, or hypothyroidism. Some studies have shown that up to 10% of women and 3% of men in the United States have hypothyroidism and receive thyroxine replacement therapy. Although hypothyroidism can occur at any age and in either sex, it is most common in older women. It is estimated that up to 1 in 5 women over the age of 65 may have hypothyroidism. At the other end of the age range, 1 out of every 4,000 babies in the United States is born without a properly functioning thyroid (congenital hypothyroidism). (For more information about populations in which thyroid disorders are more likely, see ) The symptoms and effects of hypothyroidism can vary greatly depending on the age and sex of the affected individual. The lack of thyroid hormone in an infant with untreated congenital hypothyroidism may cause cretinism, a condition resulting in severe growth delay and mental retardation. Routine screening for hypothyroidism in all newborns by a heel prick blood test has decreased the incidence of cretinism. In older children, signs of hypothyroidism can include unexplained daytime fatigue, changes in school grades, difficulty concentrating, and inattentiveness in school. Sometimes, however, an unexplained change in growth rate is the only evidence of thyroid failure in children. In women of reproductive age, hypothyroidism can impair fertility and increase the risk of miscarriage during the second trimester. Other symptoms may include a goiter (an enlarged thyroid gland), fatigue, weight gain, mood swings, , dry skin, brittle hair, fluid retention, muscle weakness, and constipation. In the elderly, the symptoms can be very vague and are often mistaken for depression or dementia, since thyroid failure can cause sleep disturbance and poor memory. Worldwide, the most common cause of hypothyroidism is dietary iodine deficiency. However, since iodine has been added to salt and other foods in the United States, hypothyrodism caused by iodine deficiency is very rare among Americans. The most common cause of hypothyroidism in the United States is an inherited autoimmune condition called Hashimoto thyroiditis, which affects up to 14 million people. Autoimmune disorders are caused when the body’s natural defenses against “foreign” or invading organisms begin to attack healthy tissue for unknown reasons. These natural defenses use proteins called antibodies. Hashimoto thyroiditis produces antibodies that damage the thyroid tissue, resulting in thyroid failure. Other common causes of hypothyroidism include the surgical removal of the thyroid, exposure to radiation such as radioactive iodine therapy, or external radiation used to treat some forms of cancer. Certain drugs such as lithium carbonate (for treatment of bipolar disorder) and amiodarone (brand names Cordarone, Nexterone, Pacerone, a drug prescribed for certain heart conditions) can cause hypothyroidism. Rarely, abnormalities of the hypothalamus or pituitary gland may result in hypothyroidism. Overactive thyroid, or hyperthyroidism, is less common than hypothyroidism. It tends to affect all age groups equally, but it is nine times more common in women. Like hypothyroidism, the symptoms of hyperthyroidism are varied and can be vague, particularly if the disease progresses slowly over a prolonged period. In children, it can result in accelerated growth, hyperactivity, loss of concentration, poor handwriting, and short-term memory loss. In young women, it may result in absent or irregular periods, recurrent miscarriages, and infertility. In older women, hyperthyroidism can cause hot flashes, mood swings, sweating, and weight changes, symptoms that may be confused with signs of menopause. Other typical symptoms of hyperthyroidism include irritability, fast heart rate, weight loss despite increased appetite, frequent bowel movements, insomnia, decreased energy level, and shaky hands. In addition, a goiter may be present. (To learn more about symptoms of thyroid disorders, see ) The most common cause of hyperthyroidism in people under age 40 is Graves disease, a type of autoimmune thyroid disease. In this case, the antibodies stimulate the thyroid to enlarge and overproduce thyroid hormone. Some people with Graves disease develop eye problems that can cause the eyes to protrude and that may threaten vision. Other causes of hyperthyroidism include thyroid nodules, which are overactive (usually noncancerous) growths in an otherwise normal thyroid gland, and thyroiditis, or inflammation of the thyroid gland. (See for more information about thyroid disorders.) People with diabetes have an increased risk of developing thyroid disorder. In the general population, approximately 6% of people have some form of thyroid disorder. However, the prevalence of thyroid disorder increases to over 10% in people with diabetes. Since people with one form of autoimmune disorder have an increased chance of developing other autoimmune disorders, people with Type 1 diabetes have a higher risk of autoimmune thyroid disorder. Up to 30% of women with Type 1 diabetes have some form of autoimmune thyroid disease. Postpartum thyroiditis, a form of autoimmune thyroid disease that causes thyroid dysfunction within a few months after delivery of a child, is three times more common in women with diabetes. Although Type 2 diabetes is not an autoimmune disorder, there have been many reports showing a higher occurrence of thyroid diseases, particularly hypothyroidism, among people with Type 2 diabetes. The association between Type 2 diabetes and thyroid disorder, however, remains unexplained. Since normal thyroid function is essential to regulate energy metabolism, abnormal thyroid function may have profound effects on blood glucose control in diabetes. Both hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism can affect the course of diabetes, but their effects are somewhat different. Hyperthyroidism is typically associated with worsening blood glucose control and increased insulin requirements. The excessive thyroid hormone causes increased glucose production in the liver, rapid absorption of glucose through the intestines, and increased (a condition in which the body does not use insulin efficiently). It may be important to consider underlying thyroid disorder if a person has unexplained weight loss, deterioration in blood glucose control, or increased requirements. Sometimes hyperthyroidism may even unmask latent diabetes. Having diabetes increases a person’s risk for heart disease, and many people with diabetes have a heart condition such as coronary heart disease or heart failure. Since hyperthyroidism causes rapid heart rate and increases the risk of abnormal heart rhythm, it may also bring on angina (chest pain), worsen heart failure or interfere with the treatment of heart failure, as well as further increase the risk of other heart problems. Prolonged, untreated hyperthyroidism can cause excessive bone loss, leading to , or bone thinning. Osteoporosis raises the risk of bone fractures, making falling much more dangerous. People with diabetes who have peripheral are at an increased risk for falls due to poor foot sensation and sometimes loss of or loss of the stimuli that tell the brain where a body part is in space, in relation to other objects. Therefore, the combination of hyperthyroidism and diabetes, particularly when neuropathy is present, increases the risk of fractures that may result in disability, especially in the elderly. Hypothyroidism rarely causes significant changes in blood glucose control, although it can reduce the clearance of insulin from the bloodstream, so the dose of insulin may be reduced. More important, hypothyroidism is accompanied by a variety of abnormalities in blood lipid levels. This includes increased total and LDL (low-density lipoprotein or “bad”) cholesterol levels, and increased levels. The abnormal lipid pattern typical of Type 2 diabetes (low HDL, or “good” cholesterol; high triglycerides; and a high proportion of small, dense LDL particles) is usually worsened by hypothyroidism. These changes further raise the already high risk of cardiovascular diseases such as heart disease and among people with diabetes. Pregnancy-related thyroid dysfunction is three times more common in women with diabetes and should be anticipated in every pregnant woman with Type 1 diabetes. Postpartum thyroiditis may cause fluctuating thyroid hormone levels in the months following delivery. In addition to symptoms such as fatigue, depression (the “baby blues”), irritability, and heart palpitations, blood glucose control and insulin requirements may be affected during this period of thyroid dysfunction and profound reproductive hormonal changes. Continued monitoring of thyroid function is necessary in all women who experience postpartum thyroiditis, since roughly one-third will develop permanent hypothyroidism within three to four years and will require thyroxine replacement. Women who have diagnosed hypothyroidism and already take thyroxine before pregnancy often need to increase the dose of thyroxine during pregnancy. Adequate thyroxine replacement is vital for the baby’s neurological development. Women with active Graves disease may enter a period of remission during pregnancy, when the disease becomes less active, but they can expect a recurrence following delivery. If hyperthyroidism is poorly controlled during pregnancy, the risk of maternal complications such as preeclampsia (a serious condition characterized by high blood pressure) and fetal problems such as prematurity increases. The maintenance of normal thyroid function and is therefore of utmost importance during pregnancy to ensure a successful outcome. As mentioned earlier, the diagnosis of abnormal thyroid function based solely on symptoms can be difficult. In people with diabetes, it may be even more difficult because of the complex interrelationships of thyroid function and diabetes. Both chronically high blood glucose and hyperthyroidism can cause weight loss despite good appetite, weakness, and fatigue. Likewise, severe can produce symptoms such as swelling, weight gain, and hypertension, which may be confused with hypothyroidism. The most reliable method used to diagnose thyroid disease is the simple, relatively inexpensive, yet highly sensitive TSH blood test. This test measures directly the amount of TSH produced by the pituitary gland. Since the pituitary is the first organ to recognize abnormal thyroid function, testing its function is the most sensitive way to monitor thyroid function. In addition to diagnosis, the TSH test is also used to monitor and adjust the dosage of thyroxine therapy. Before the introduction of the TSH test in the late 1960s, blood tests for thyroid function measured only the levels of the thyroid hormones, T3 and T4. However, these hormone levels can appear relatively normal even when the thyroid is not functioning normally, because the pituitary gland will compensate for thyroid dysfunction. When the thyroid starts to fail (a sign of early hypothyroidism), the pituitary responds by producing higher levels of TSH to stimulate the thyroid to produce more thyroid hormones, thereby maintaining normal circulating T3 and T4 levels. Conversely, when the thyroid gland produces too much thyroid hormone (a sign of early hyperthyroidism), the pituitary responds by producing less TSH, thereby reducing T3 and T4 production from the thyroid. Therefore, prior to any changes in the thyroid hormone levels, there is a detectable change in the TSH level, which indicates abnormal thyroid function. A normal TSH level ranges from 0.4 mU/ml to 4.0 mU/ml (microunits per milliliter). A below-normal TSH level indicates hyperthyroidism, and an above-normal TSH level indicates hypothyroidism. An elevated TSH level accompanied by normal thyroid hormone levels is known as subclinical hypothyroidism. People with subclinical hypothyroidism often do not have any symptoms. However, they do face the increased risks of cardiovascular disease associated with hypothyroidism, due to the abnormalities in blood lipid levels. Some doctors have even suggested that a TSH level in the upper-normal range (2.5–4.0 mU/ml) should be considered as evolving thyroid failure. Thyroid antibodies that are produced in autoimmune thyroid diseases can also be measured by blood testing. The presence of these antibodies can help determine the underlying cause of thyroid disorder. The most specific antibody test is called the anti-TPO antibody test. Nearly all thyroid diseases are treatable. Hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism often require long-term or lifelong treatment, depending on the specifics of the diagnosis. The treatment for hypothyroidism is to replace the missing thyroid hormone. The most common form of thyroid hormone is a synthetic derivative, levothyroxine, which is usually taken as one pill daily. This is a simple yet very effective treatment of hypothyroidism. Once the treatment is started, TSH testing every two or three months is necessary to adjust to the correct dose. When a stable dose is achieved, annual TSH testing is generally adequate for monitoring purposes. The symptoms of hypothyroidism may take several months of therapy to resolve. Often, lifelong treatment is necessary. Natural thyroid extract derived from animal sources is a less commonly used form of thyroid replacement and has the disadvantage of inconsistent dosage that varies from one batch of pills to another. Certain supplements, including supplements, calcium supplements, and that contain iron or calcium, can interfere with the absorption of thyroxine. For this reason, these pills should be taken at least two hours apart from thyroxine. In addition, it’s a good idea to let your physician know of any supplements or other medicines you take in addition to levothyroxine. There are several options for treatment of hyperthyroidism, with the choice dependent on the cause of the disorder; it must be individually determined. Long-term oral antithyroid medicines such as methimazole (Tapazole) and propylthiouracil (PTU) are effective in controlling the production of thyroid hormone. Regular blood test monitoring is necessary throughout the course of treatment. Radioactive iodine therapy is the most common treatment used in the United States for hyperthyroidism. It has a very high cure rate but often results in permanent hypothyroidism. Surgery offers an alternative, particularly in people with very large goiters. All these treatments are effective in controlling or curing hyperthyroidism. Abnormal thyroid function can have a major impact on diabetes control and increase a person’s risk of developing diabetic complications. Because of the complications that can result from untreated thyroid disorder, regular screening is recommended to allow early detection and treatment. For people with Type 1 diabetes, annual screening is advisable. For people with Type 2 diabetes, screening should be done at the time of diagnosis and then repeated every five years thereafter. The frequency of screening should increase with advancing age, since the incidence of thyroid disorder increases with age. For people over the age of 60, annual screening is recommended.

By , Laura Hieronymus, DNP, MSEd, RN, MLDE, BC-ADM, CDCES, FADCES “The only exercise some people get is jumping to conclusions.” –Fred Allen If jumping to conclusions is your only form of physical activity, you are overlooking one of the top tools available to improve your diabetes control! Healthful eating, medicine if you need it, and blood glucose self-monitoring are important basics of diabetes management, but only physical activity provides a host of benefits for your quality of life, blood glucose control, and overall health. In addition to lower blood glucose readings and decreased body fat, regular exercisers report increased self-esteem, reduced stress, and enhanced clarity of thought. Routine physical activity also improves your self-efficacy, which is confidence in your ability to change and control your behavior. Despite these and other potential benefits, more than 60% of American adults are not regularly active, and 25% of the adult population are not active at all. Take a moment to learn more about the magic of movement, then get ready, get set, and go! Make a commitment to improving your health by including more physical activity in your life. Simply put, exercise lowers blood glucose. To perform physical activity, the muscles burn glucose for energy and absorb glucose from the blood during and after exercise to replenish their stores. However, most people with Type 2 diabetes have , in which muscle, fat, and liver cells do not respond normally to insulin. As a result, it takes more insulin than normal to admit glucose into the cells. Exercise, in addition to simply burning glucose, improves the body’s ability to use insulin. This improvement in insulin sensitivity may allow some people with Type 2 diabetes to reduce or even discontinue blood-glucose-lowering medicines with increased physical activity. In addition, for those with either Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes, resistance exercise builds muscle mass, which may continue to burn glucose even when a person is not actively exercising. Regular physical activity increases a person’s aerobic fitness level, reducing his resting heart rate as the heart pumps more efficiently. Lower blood pressure, total , LDL (“bad”) cholesterol, and levels, as well as increased HDL (“good”) cholesterol levels, are additional benefits that are of special concern to those with diabetes because of their increased risk of heart disease. And if you are trying to lose a few pounds, consider this: Physical activity not only helps people lose weight, but it has been proven to help them keep weight off for months and even years. It’s really not magic at all. Science supports the recommendation that regular physical activity is one of the most important things you can do to improve your diabetes control and sense of well-being. If you’re making a commitment to physical activity, start your efforts off on the right foot by meeting with your doctor to discuss any limitations or restrictions you may have. Formal exercise testing prior to beginning a training program can be helpful in many ways, including identifying undiagnosed heart disease and determining your pulse and blood pressure responses to various levels of exercise intensity. In addition, screening for diabetes complications that may be worsened by certain exercises is essential. This evaluation is also valuable in designing an individualized exercise prescription and opening up a discussion about important factors to consider before beginning your program. If you are planning to begin a moderate- to high-intensity physical activity program, you may be a candidate for a graded exercise test (“stress test”) if you meet any of the criteria established by the American Diabetes Association (ADA). (For the ADA’s criteria, see ) Diabetes complications can affect your choice of physical activities, making some safer for you than others. For example, if you have (diabetic eye disease) you may want to avoid activities that dramatically elevate blood pressure (such as power weight lifting), involve pounding or jarring (such as jogging or boxing), bring the head level with or lower than the heart, or are very strenuous, because of their potential to cause retinal detachment or a vitreous hemorrhage (in which blood leaks from vessels in the retina, blocking vision). Those with (diabetic nerve disease) may have lost the protective sensation in their feet. They should limit weight-bearing exercise such as step aerobics or prolonged walking or jogging because repetitive exercise on insensitive feet can lead to ulcers and fractures. However, most exercises can be enjoyed by most individuals with diabetes. Low-impact activities such as swimming, chair exercises, or stationary cycling are good alternatives for those with complications. When you consider an exercise program, don’t feel as though you’ll be required to run a marathon to improve your health and diabetes control. The Surgeon General’s Report on Physical Activity and Health (1996) states that significant health benefits can be obtained by including a moderate amount of physical activity (such as 30 minutes of brisk walking or raking leaves, 15 minutes of running, or 45 minutes of playing volleyball) on most if not all days of the week. A moderate amount of physical activity is equivalent to physical activity that uses approximately 150 calories of energy per day, or 1,000 calories per week. Greater health benefits can be achieved by increasing the amount (duration, frequency, or intensity) of physical activity. If you’re not able to set aside at least 30 minutes at a time for physical activity, you’ll be happy to know that research has shown that cardiorespiratory fitness gains are similar when physical activity occurs in several short sessions (10 minutes at a time, for example) as when the same total amount and intensity of activity occurs in one longer session (30 minutes all at once). Think in terms of accumulating physical activity over the course of the day. Walking, gardening, and washing windows are as important to your fitness efforts as a formal exercise class. (For more about walking, see ) If you do choose to start a structured exercise program, plan to include proper warm-up and cool-down periods. A warm-up should consist of 5—10 minutes of aerobic activity, such as walking or cycling, at a low intensity, which gets your body ready for the more intense activity to follow. Gently stretch your muscles for another 5—10 minutes, then begin your chosen activity. Afterward, do a cool-down session that lasts 5–10 minutes and is similar in structure to your warm-up. Your goal is to return your heart rate to preexercise levels. The benefits of physical activity are immense, but you also should give consideration to staying safe while exercising with diabetes. Obtaining medical clearance if needed, and developing an appropriate exercise plan are important steps to safe fitness. In addition, consider the following issues: Properly fitted shoes are essential if you are participating in aerobic physical activity. The ADA recommends using shoes with cushioned midsoles (gel or air) as well as polyester or blend (cotton—polyester) socks to prevent blisters and keep the feet dry. Monitor your feet closely for blisters and other potential damage both before and after physical activity, particularly if you have neuropathy in your feet. A diabetes identification bracelet or shoe tag should be clearly visible when you exercise. People who use insulin or certain diabetes drugs that cause the pancreas to increase insulin production are at risk for low blood glucose, or , when they exercise. For this reason it is important to carry a source of carbohydrate to raise low blood glucose levels if necessary during and after physical activity. Most people are advised to treat themselves if their blood glucose falls below 70 mg/dl by consuming at least 15 grams of carbohydrate. These foods provide 15 grams of carbohydrate per serving: 3 glucose tablets, 1/2 cup fruit juice, 2 tablespoons raisins. Because the major effect of physical activity is lower blood glucose levels, monitoring before, during, and after exercise is important. Be sure you are familiar with the symptoms of low blood glucose and the steps for treating it. It is possible to develop exercise-induced hypoglycemia several hours after the activity has ended because your muscles continue to take up glucose from the bloodstream, so be prepared to check your blood glucose level and have a source of carbohydrate available in the hours after exercise. The effect of activity on your blood glucose level depends on many factors, including the time of day you exercise, the timing and dosage of your insulin or pills, when you last ate, your level of fitness, and the duration and intensity of your exercise session. You may need to eat additional carbohydrate before or during exercise if you plan to engage in vigorous or prolonged activity (lasting more than 45 minutes). In these situations, an intake of 15 to 30 grams of carbohydrate every 15 to 30 minutes should be enough to keep hypoglycemia from occurring. Each person’s reaction to exercise is different, though, so it is important to check your blood glucose level regularly during prolonged activity. Hypoglycemia with physical activity is generally not as common in people with Type 2 diabetes as in those with Type 1, particularly if they don’t take blood-glucose-lowering medicines. These individuals probably won’t need extra food when participating in physical activity. Indeed, the extra calories can prevent a person with Type 2 diabetes from losing weight and reaching his blood glucose goals. If a person’s blood glucose level is high before exercising, it may be dangerous to exercise. The ADA recommends that people with Type 1 diabetes avoid physical activity if fasting blood glucose levels before exercise are greater than 250 mg/dl and ketones are present in the blood or urine. They should also use caution if preexercise blood glucose levels are greater than 300 mg/dl and no ketones are present. are a sign that the body doesn’t have enough circulating insulin. When this is the case, the muscles don’t have access to enough glucose for the extra energy demands of exercise, causing the liver to produce more glucose and the body to break down fat stores for energy. If ketones – potentially toxic by-products of this process – build up in the bloodstream faster than the body is able to process them, a person is at risk for diabetic ketoacidosis, a serious condition that can lead to coma and even death. People who have Type 2 diabetes, on the other hand, can often exercise safely with elevated blood glucose levels. In fact, since physical activity tends to lower blood glucose, a little exercise may be “just what the doctor ordered.” However, it is still prudent for people with Type 2 diabetes who begin exercise with high blood glucose to check their level after about 15 minutes of activity to see whether it is going up or down. If you’ve carefully considered your exercise options and planned ahead for safety issues, it’s time to jump in and begin enjoying the benefits of physical activity. Start your exercise program gradually. Some soreness is common in the early stages, particularly if you have not been physically active in recent years. There are several ways to tell if you are overdoing physical activity while you are exercising. One is to do the “talk test.” You should be able to talk comfortably with someone while you are participating in an activity. If you are so short of breath that you can’t converse with your exercise buddy, you need to slow down to avoid becoming overtired or injured. Another way to determine if you are exercising at an intensity that is appropriate for you is to think about how much effort you are putting into the activity. This method is called the Borg RPE (Rating of Perceived Exertion). Using this scale, you rate your level of effort from 0 (“feels like nothing at all”) to 10 (“very, very hard/maximal”). A Borg rating of 3 to 5 (“moderate” to “hard”) is probably the right spot for you to improve your health and fitness without endangering yourself. Anytime you experience pain, shortness of breath, dizziness, weakness, or other discomfort, stop exercising and direct your attention to resolving the problem. It’s easy enough to make well-intentioned New Year’s resolutions aimed at improving your physical fitness. The trick is to stay motivated to reap the rewards of a healthy lifestyle and better diabetes control. Making physical activity a regular part of your life means planning ahead. Set a specific fitness goal for yourself with very detailed and realistic terms. For example, your goal might be “to walk at lunchtime for 30 minutes three days per week.” Mark your walk days on your calendar so you won’t forget them, and give yourself a pat on the back for each week you reach your goal. Inviting your friends and significant others to exercise with you can make your physical activity plan more enjoyable and easier to stick to. Even if they don’t have diabetes, this fact may convince them to join in: Published research has shown that lifestyle modification (weight loss and regular moderate physical activity) can reduce a person’s risk of developing Type 2 diabetes, delaying or even preventing the onset of the condition. The benefits of physical activity are amazing. Take them to heart and get moving!

I don’t need to remind you that having diabetes (or any chronic condition, for that matter) is hard. It’s said that having diabetes is pretty much like having a full-time job, given everything you’re supposed to do to manage it. And that’s all on top of your “other” life, which probably includes working, going to school, taking care of family, chores, and maybe trying to fit in some fun time, too. When you have too much on your plate, it’s natural that things slide. For some people, it’s keeping up with healthful eating. For others (and this probably includes a fair number of folks), it’s exercise. Unfortunately, it’s all too easy to skip the walk at lunch because of work deadlines, or to forgo the yoga class because you have to stop by the grocery store. And, let’s face it: Sometimes you’re just too tired to move. I’ve always wondered what drives people to exercise. Running in a snowstorm or getting up super early to work out is admirable, but what drives people who do this? And why don’t other people do the same (including myself, I should add)? Interestingly, it’s not as simple as telling yourself to “Just Do It,” as Nike might have us believe. Sure, some people have that determination, but as it turns out, there’s a lot of behavioral science behind motivation and physical activity. Here are a few things that I’ve learned. • Men are more active than women. And being overweight or obese makes it more likely a person will not stick with a physical activity regimen. • Self-efficacy — a person’s confidence in her ability to achieve specific results — is the main factor linked with adherence. In other words, the more confident you are that you can start and stay with an exercise plan, the more likely you’ll carry it through. • For women, self-worth plays a role, too. So, if you believe that you can exercise, you’re more likely to do it. • Research shows that consistent exercisers aim to be healthy, and they make time in their schedules to exercise. They believe that exercise makes them feel good and that they are worth the time. • Support for being physically active is important. Whether it’s from a spouse, a friend, or a workout group, support from others (kind of like your own personal cheering squad) can keep you going. That’s why group classes, or walking or biking clubs, for example, can be so helpful. • Environment is key. Having access to, say, a gym or a personal trainer definitely helps with adherence. Even having a place to go walking helps. On the flip side, people are if: • They have unrealistic expectations — for example, expecting to lose a large amount of weight in a short period of time. • They have low self-esteem and low self-efficacy (“I can’t do this”). • They have a poor body image (“I’m too heavy and everyone is looking at me”). • They choose a type of physical activity that perhaps isn’t the best choice for them. For example, walking may not be the best choice of activity for someone with diabetic in his feet. • Being physically active leads to frequent low blood sugars for them. You probably don’t need to be told how important being physically active is when you have diabetes. Knowing this generally doesn’t motivate people, though. Your motivation needs to come from within, and unfortunately, others typically can’t do the motivating for you. But there are a few tried and true tips that can and do work. • First, make sure it’s safe for you to start an activity program. Talk with your doctor or . You may need special tests, such as a stress test or eye exam, for exercise “clearance.” • Think about what may appeal to you — walking with a friend, joining a bicycling group, taking a dance class, or working out at home with an exercise video. There’s no one right way to be active. • Set goals for yourself. If it’s been a while since you’ve been active, start low and go slow. So, for example, go for a 10-minute walk, five days a week. Then, build up to 20 minutes, then 30. Maybe even set a goal to walk or run in a 5K race. Check out the app called C25K (couch to 5K) if you foresee a 5K in your future. • Pick an exercise that you enjoy (or, at least, can tolerate). • Learn how to manage your diabetes around physical activity. Don’t let swings in blood sugars sideline you. You may need to adjust your diabetes medication and/or your eating plan. And remember that checking your blood sugars regularly before and after exercising is important. • Make time to be active and then schedule in your activity. It’s too easy to forgo activity unless you block out time in your day to make it happen. • Find someone to be active with. If that proves to be a challenge, let someone — or maybe a bunch of people — know that you’re aiming to be active, and then tell them what you did. Maybe post your achievements on Facebook or tweet them out on Twitter. Getting support and encouragement can keep you going. • Banish the black-and-white, all-or-nothing thinking. There will be times when you may not have time to go for your 60-minute walk or get to your ballroom dancing class. Not all is lost. Do even a little bit of something. Walk for 10 minutes, climb the stairs, or pick up a resistance band to give your arms and legs a workout. • Have a plan B. If it’s raining out and going for a walk or a bike ride is out of the question, then what? Make sure you have a backup plan, such as walking at the mall, or hopping on your exercise bike. • Reward yourself. For some people, noticing how good they feel after a workout is reward enough. If that won’t cut it, give yourself an external reward: Buy yourself some new workout clothes, an exercise DVD, or treat yourself to a few sessions with a personal trainer. Rewards don’t have to cost money. Treat yourself to a well-deserved nap or time spent reading a juicy novel. • Keep a journal. Studies show that “self-monitoring,” or keeping a record of both food intake and physical activity, helps people in their weight-loss efforts. Monitoring your physical activity also helps you to measure your progress, identify barriers, and (hopefully) fuel your motivation to keep going. Tracking your activity using an app can be a big help, too. Try an app like MyFitnessPal. Or invest in a fitness tracker, such as a Fitbit, a Garmin, or a Misfit. There are plenty of apps that provide workout routines and workout music to keep you going. What keeps you motivated to be active?

Picking the Right Activity to Meet Your Fitness Goals Picking the Right Activity to Meet Your Fitness Goals If you have not exercised in a while, getting moving again can seem intimidating, especially if you equate working out with performing a punishing routine in a gym full of super-fit people. “I’m not one of them,” you may think; “I’m too weak, too old, too heavy, or simply not obsessed with my body image the way ‘they’ are. Why bust myself to lose just a bit of weight, which I might gain back anyway?” In reality, though, there are many different reasons to exercise other than weight loss, and countless ways to do it without setting foot in a gym. Many relatively simple activities can improve your balance, flexibility, energy level, and general feeling of well-being, helping you to accomplish tasks in your daily life more easily. These activities can be done at home or in a neighborhood park, and many can be done either alone or with an activity partner or group. Once you have received your doctor’s go-ahead to start exercising or to increase the intensity of what you’ve already been doing, try a few of the exercises described here to help you meet specific fitness goals, such as increasing your strength or reducing pain. You may be surprised by how much better you feel. It’s hard to feel comfortable doing any type of exercise when you feel wobbly doing it. This means that improving your balance can help you get fit in other ways, as well. To boost your balance, Karen Kemmis, a physical therapist and who works at the Diabetes Center of the State University of New York’s University Hospital, recommends trying to balance on one foot while standing near the kitchen counter, so that you can hold on if you feel unstable. Build up to holding this pose for 10–20 seconds on each foot. It can help to focus your eyes on an object in the distance while you try to balance. Kemmis also recommends walking as if you were on a tightrope, putting one foot directly in front of the other. At first, take steps with your feet a comfortable distance apart. As your balance improves, place your feet closer and closer together until eventually, each step is only the length of your foot. Try doing this across a room. If you need to, extend your arms out like a tightrope-walker to help keep your balance. One excellent way to improve your balance is to practice tai chi, the ancient Chinese system of exercises that has been called “meditation in motion” because of its gentle movements. Most communities have tai chi classes, or you can follow a tai chi video at home. “Tai chi has been shown to improve balance, and it’s quite safe for almost everyone,” Kemmis says. “Even if someone has joint pain because of knee arthritis, or hip or back pain, they can do tai chi quite well.” Kemmis recommends leg-strengthening exercises to address balance issues, too. Good options include climbing stairs or repeatedly standing up from a chair without using your hands to push yourself up. “Try to work up to three sets of about 10 repetitions,” says Kemmis. For best results, perform these exercises two to three days per week. It’s tough to get in shape — or to do much of anything — if you feel like you have no zip left. The key to feeling more energetic is maintaining muscle tone. Assess what activities fatigue your body, and use those activities for exercise. If you tire from climbing stairs or walking out to the mailbox, do each more often to build up your leg muscles. “As people get tired, they do less, so we have to make an effort to push ourselves a bit,” says Kemmis. “It makes things easier, so it’s worth it in the end. “People often think it has to be a 30-minute walk all at once. But even 5 or 10 minutes at a time that total 30 minutes at the end of the day will help. Don’t get discouraged. Just try to build up.” Stiffness can hamper both regular daily activities and attempts at exercising. The best way to decrease stiffness is to stretch properly. While many people have been taught that stretching should precede exercise, that’s not so. “The most important thing is to do stretches when the muscles are warm,” says Jackie Shahar, manager of the exercise physiology department at the Joslin Diabetes Center in Boston. “That will most likely happen after someone has done some aerobic activity or resistance training.” Don’t try to stretch immediately after getting out of bed or after sitting still for a while, because your muscles will be cold. A few minutes of walking with your arms pumping will do the trick to warm them up. Then stop to stretch before continuing your walk or whatever activity you have planned. You can also perform stretches at the end of your workout if you prefer. While stretching, don’t bounce, bob, or jerk. Slowly and gently move into a position that puts gentle pressure on the muscle and hold the position for 20 seconds. Then relax and repeat; you may be able to stretch a little farther the second time, but don’t force it. Stretch each muscle group or whatever body parts feel like they need to be stretched. If your calves habitually cramp, try a stretch that Shahar recommends: Lean your palms against a wall at shoulder height with one leg under you and one leg extended behind you. Bend the “front” leg. Keep your “back” heel flat on the floor. Bend your elbows so that your nose gets closer to the wall. Hold the position for 20 seconds and then switch legs and repeat. For the lower back, Shahar advises lying on your back on a bed or on the floor with your knees bent. Slowly and gently lower both knees to one side, twisting at your waist. Hold the position for 20 seconds, then lower your knees to the other side. If your quadriceps (thigh muscles) are tight, try another move from Shahar: Place one hand on the wall, and bend the knee of opposite leg so that you can grasp your ankle behind you with the other hand. Gently pull your heel toward your buttock. You can also perform this stretch using a chair back (or seat, if you are shorter) as a support for the foot that’s behind you. If chronic aches and pains are robbing you of your ability to perform daily activities, a couple of strategies can help you stay active. “Warm muscles are happy muscles,” says Shahar. “They feel better. Use a heating pack for 10 to 15 minutes. Put a towel or sheet between the skin and the heating pack.” You may be able to improve your performance by using a heating pack before a workout. Choosing your exercises strategically can also help. “Identify those ‘safe’ exercises that reduce the risk of joint pain and the chance for discomfort during and after exercise,” Shahar says. She recommends a recumbent stationery bike, aquatic exercise to decrease weight and pressure on the joints, and resistance training. “Exercises that help increase the strength of the muscles around the joint will decrease joint pain,” she says. “If the knees feel weak and wobbly with exercises and have pain, exercises to strengthen the quads and hamstrings will help, not trigger more pain.” If you lose flexibility, you lose the complete range of motion in your joints. To increase your flexibility for everyday movements, incorporate stretching and strengthening exercises that mimic activities you find difficult. For example, if bending at the waist to pick up a pencil from the floor is hard, try exercises that work the hamstrings, such as slowly reaching for your toes while seated on the ground with your legs extended. Hold for several seconds, relax, and then repeat. Practicing yoga or tai chi is also a good way to maintain, and often increase, your flexibility. “Some people teach tai chi specifically for people with diabetes,” says Sheri Colberg-Ochs, professor of exercise science at Old Dominion University and a member of the American Diabetes Association’s Prevention Committee. “When you have or reduced function this can help.” Increasing your flexibility won’t happen overnight — and you shouldn’t try to make that happen. “The most critical thing is to not start out too intensely if you’re new to exercise,” says Colberg-Ochs. “There is no right or wrong way to progress unless you do it too quickly.” The American Society for Exercise Physiology and the American Diabetes Association have released new exercise guidelines recommending that most people with diabetes not only get 150 minutes of moderate aerobic exercise per week, but also perform resistance training on two or three days per week. “It’s important to at least maintain your current level of muscle mass,” says Andrew S. Rhinehart, MD, medical director of the Johnston Memorial Diabetes Care Center in Abingdon, Virginia. “Age in and of itself will steal [strength] from us. If you can get stronger, that’s even better.” You don’t have to buy a weight bench or dumbbell set to get stronger. Using inexpensive resistance bands, small hand weights, or even soup cans to exercise your muscles can make a dramatic difference. “Hit the whole body from head to toe in order to maintain that muscle mass,” Rhinehart advises. “Resistance training helps [preserve] muscle mass in men and women and prevent osteoporosis.” He cautions people with (eye disease) to avoid lifting very heavy weights because of the risk of breaking blood vessels in the eyes. “If you’re overly straining and you bear down, you’re lifting too much,” says Rhinehart. Instead, lift light weights and do a high number of repetitions — 15 to 30 — in a set. Perform two to three sets per muscle group. Calisthenics — those old gym-class standards that include squats, calf raises, and push-ups — can also help you build strength. However, as Rhinehart advises, go “low and slow” when beginning. Start with a low number of repetitions, and consider using modified poses, since calisthenics involve lifting your own body weight. At first, you may only be able to do knee-assisted push-ups. “But in six months, maybe you can do 10 push-ups from your toes,” Rhinehart notes. “There is no reason to hurt yourself,” he adds. “Be careful.” Calf raises appear simple but can be difficult. Stand near a sturdy chair (or something else you can hold on to) in case you have any difficulties with balance. Rise up onto the balls of your feet, hold this position for a few seconds, and then slowly return your heels to the floor. At first, you may not be able to raise yourself up completely, but that’s OK. Go as high as you can and work up to a full calf raise. Squats work the entire leg and trunk area. Stand with your back against a wall and your feet shoulder-width apart and about 1 1/2 to 2 feet from the wall. With your abdominal muscles engaged, slide downward by bending your knees. Make sure your knees are behind or directly above your ankle joints. Hold for a few moments and then go back up. Over time, you will find that you can hold the squat longer, but when you’re just starting out, don’t push yourself too hard. (For resources that show how to do exercises and stretches correctly, .) In addition to its muscle-building benefits, resistance training — along with some forms of aerobic exercise — can also increase bone strength. “Muscle pulling on bone builds bone, so any weight-bearing exercise will help build bone,” says Preethi Srikanthan, MD, an assistant clinical professor at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA. This includes all activities that “require your muscles to work against gravity, including jogging, hiking, stair climbing, and dancing.” One reason many people give up on exercising is that they feel bored while doing it. But the truth is that these people simply have not found the fitness activity that is right for them. If you like what you’re doing, you will stick with it and incorporate it into your routine instead of finding excuses to avoid it. Joining a class or club that revolves around a physical activity can help keep you motivated, since the others participating will expect you to show up. And most people won’t quit halfway through an exercise session if others are watching. For some people, though, exercise is more enjoyable as a solitary way to unwind. They find it relaxing to listen to music on a stationary bike, hike nature trails alone, or watch TV while pedaling on an elliptical machine. Regularly engaging in a few different types of exercise can help keep things fresh and let you adapt easily in case traveling prevents you from attending your fitness class, bad weather keeps you indoors, or you get involved with a seasonal activity. For example, if you briskly walk around the neighborhood a couple of times each week, you could work out with resistance bands or an exercise video on alternate days — and whenever heat, cold, or rain keeps you indoors. Variety will also help ensure that you are working different parts of your body. Walking can be great for working the lower body, but it does not do much for the upper body. Swimming provides a good overall workout, but it is not a weight-bearing exercise and so won’t do much to strengthen your bones. If you are not sure what type of exercise activity you would like, recall what you did for fun during your childhood. If you enjoyed playing kick the can and tag with other children, you might enjoy an informal group-based activity such as walking with friends. If you loved gym class and other structured group environments, joining a fitness class or taking physically active lessons may be a good option. If you preferred competitive sports as a youngster, try joining a community league that caters to your fitness level and age. Remember that there are many different reasons to exercise. If an activity or exercise helps relieve pain, improves your mobility, or gives you joy, then count it as a success. By focusing on the areas of fitness in which you’d most like to see yourself improve, you can choose activities that fit your goals, your life-style, and your unique personality.

6e4ff9ce-1f38-4cba-96bd-be74b8d97899,"By Laura Hieronymus, MSEd, RN, BC-ADM, CDE, and Lindsay Hieronymus It is no secret that exercise and physical activity can help keep the body in a healthier state. Regular physical activity can help improve the circulation of your blood, maintain muscle tone, and keep your joints flexible. Your heart, muscles, and bones benefit by being stronger and less likely to become diseased or injured. Studies show that regular physical activity can help you sleep better, improve your overall energy level, and provide some stress relief by boosting your feel-good endorphins and diverting attention away from daily worries. When you have diabetes, regular physical activity can also help with blood glucose control, both by lowering your blood glucose level directly, and by lowering your level of insulin resistance[1] (which contributes to high blood glucose levels). It also helps to lower your blood pressure[2], and it keeps your lipids (blood fat levels) in check by increasing your “good” (HDL) cholesterol and lowering your “bad” (LDL) cholesterol and triglycerides. All of these benefits together help to prevent the long-term complications of diabetes[3] such as retinopathy (eye disease), nephropathy (kidney disease), and neuropathy (nerve damage). In people who are at increased risk of Type 2 diabetes – a group that includes all blood relatives of people who have Type 2 diabetes – research has shown that performing regular physical activity can help prevent or delay the onset of Type 2 diabetes. With all of these benefits for people with and without diabetes, doesn’t it make sense to make engaging in physical activity a family affair? As you consider how to get more active yourself, also think about how to include your family members in your efforts. What might help to motivate your spouse, children, or other family members to be more active? And what sort of preparation or equipment might they need to participate in the activities you enjoy? Experts agree that those who exercise and are physically active have an easier time of staying at a healthy body weight. While being active admittedly burns more calories than being sedentary, the real benefit in regular exercise is its role in maintaining weight loss achieved through dietary and other lifestyle measures. For people who have diabetes and are overweight, a weight loss of 5% of body weight is associated with improvement in blood glucose control and blood pressure and lipid levels. For people with prediabetes[4], a 7% weight loss combined with regular physical activity has been shown to significantly reduce the chances of developing Type 2 diabetes. (Prediabetes is diagnosed when blood tests show a blood glucose level that is higher than normal but not high enough for a diagnosis of diabetes.) Physical activity and exercise are also associated with a decrease in visceral fat (fat that surrounds the inner organs in the abdominal region). This is important, because visceral fat is associated with insulin resistance and a higher risk of heart disease. Losing visceral fat is considered “heart healthy” whether or not you have diabetes. There are four types of activity that are commonly included in a complete exercise routine. This is movement that is not formal exercise. Examples include walking, climbing stairs, and doing housework or yard work. In general, finding ways to move more and to sit less is good for your health. This type of exercise uses your large muscle groups and causes you to breathe faster and more deeply. Examples include brisk walking, jogging, bicycling, and swimming. The effect of aerobic exercise is to increase the amount of oxygen in your blood and to increase blood flow to your muscles and back to your lungs. Many experts recommend performing at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity a week (such as brisk walking) and/or at least 90 minutes of vigorous aerobic exercise (such as taking an aerobics class) a week. The activity should be distributed over at least three days of the week, with no more than two consecutive days without aerobic physical activity. People with Type 2 diabetes are additionally encouraged to do resistance exercises, such as weight lifting, which target all major muscle groups, at least two times weekly, as long as they have no contraindications, or medical reasons not to perform resistance exercise. Stretching can help keep your muscles and joints limber, and that can help to minimize your risk of getting hurt. It’s best to stretch after your muscles have warmed up, so stretching after a few minutes of light activity or even at the end of your workout is preferable to stretching at the very beginning of your exercise session. When you stretch, focus on your major muscle groups (calves, thighs, lower back, etc.), and also stretch muscles and joints that you routinely use when you’re active. Hold each stretch for about 30 seconds until you feel mild tension; feeling pain means you’ve stretched too far. Don’t bounce while you stretch; it can cause small tears in the muscle that will make you less flexible. Repeat each stretch three or four times. People who have diabetes are encouraged to discuss their exercise plans with their health-care provider before increasing their level of physical activity or starting a formal exercise plan. Your health-care provider may want to conduct certain medical tests prior to your starting to exercise, especially if you have been sedentary or have any diabetes-related complications. Such complications or other medical conditions may mean that certain types of exercise are better for you than others. In addition, you and your diabetes care team should talk about how to control your blood glucose levels during exercise and when to make adjustments to your usual diabetes regimen. If you are at risk for hypoglycemia[5] (low blood glucose), be sure to carry a portable form of carbohydrate such as glucose tablets, glucose gel, or hard candy. Exercising with other people can also make your workouts safer if you’re at risk of hypoglycemia. Be sure to tell your exercise partners what your symptoms of hypoglycemia are so they can recognize it and assist you with prompt treatment, if necessary. Encouraging your family members to join you in your activities can be beneficial to everyone’s health. (For tips on encouraging your family members to join you, click here[6].) But exercising as a family can have more than just physical benefits. It can be a time to talk, show support for one another, and have some fun together, particularly if you choose activities your family members enjoy. For some ideas on how to get everyone involved, see “How One Family Got Active.”[7] You might also motivate your family members by using family exercise sessions as training for a desired outing such as a special hike, a day of skiing, or a trip to a climbing gym. Be sure to set realistic goals, keep track of your progress, and above all, relish the family time together.

It may seem counterintuitive or even impossible to feel grateful while managing diabetes, especially when it is such a huge part of your life. However, practicing gratitude can help you cope with and manage your diabetes better. According to Christina Massey, PhD, licensed clinical psychologist at , “Research has shown that positive psychological states such as gratitude are associated with improved physical health in individuals with diabetes. The relationship is not yet fully understood, but there is research showing that the mechanism through which this relationship occurs is increased adherence to health behaviors. In other words, positive affect (emotion) is linked to healthier behaviors such as and , which in turn are related to improved overall general health.” • increase self-esteem. The overall positive outlook on life that comes from gratitude is associated with increased self-esteem, which in turn is linked to better self-management; and • . Gratitude has been linked to better sleep quality, which can improve . Positive thinking benefits all of us, whether we have diabetes or not — and the easiest way to think positively is through gratitude. This is because unlike other emotions, which are often based on the past or future, gratitude involves being thankful for what you already have; it is based on your current reality, which is easier for the brain to access. It may be hard to feel grateful when managing diabetes or when, despite trying your best, test results show no improvement in your health. However, this is when it is even more important to focus on the positives. Instead of feeling badly that your tests haven’t improved, be grateful that they aren’t worse. You may not be making the progress you want, but you are clearly doing something right. Focusing on this will help illuminate what you are doing well so you can build on that. Shifting your mindset in this way can be a powerful component of effective diabetes self-management. How do you get started with gratitude? This can be particularly difficult for those who take a glass-half-empty approach to life. The right tools can help . “The research group of which I am a member, the Cardiac Psychiatry Research Program at Massachusetts General Hospital, believes that gratitude can be cultivated in individuals with diabetes (and others) through performing various exercises and activities,” Massey says. “For instance, we ask participants to focus on gratitude in their daily lives by actively reflecting on positive events for which they feel grateful and expressing gratitude to others in the form of a gratitude letter. We find that by bringing more awareness to positive versus negative events throughout the day, people start to endorse increased gratitude as well as other positive emotions.” The key to cultivating gratitude is to start small and work your way up. These suggestions can help you include gratitude in your life. Make a detailed list of what you have been grateful for over the past week. One study showed that people who kept a gratitude journal for as little as three months learned to express gratitude more readily and started to find more things to be grateful for. Your gratitude may be for simple pleasures, such as a nice cup of coffee, or larger aspects of your life, such as the company of a loved one. Keep a jar filled with notes or photos of moments and people you are grateful for. Pick one out occasionally to get an instant boost of gratitude. Each night, before going to sleep, write down three things that occurred during the day for which you are grateful, taking time to reflect on each one. Focus on how these events made you feel and why you appreciate them so much. This may seem counter-productive, but studies show that remembering some of the difficult times from our past helps us appreciate how far we have come. Take some time to reflect on how you have tackled past problems and be thankful for your personal growth. Don’t be afraid to experiment until you find a practice that works for you. Everyone will have his or her own special way of letting gratitude into his or her life. Embarking on a life of gratitude is one thing, but maintaining it is another. Fortunately, you don’t have to do it alone — multiple forms of help are available to keep you motivated and strengthen your practice. Sharing your positive experiences and listening to the experiences of others in a similar situation can give you a psychological boost and get you more involved in the art of gratitude. Check out for support group information. Listen to recordings and read articles and books by professionals who have dedicated their lives to the science of gratitude. Louise Hay, motivational author, has written 17 books on positive psychology and produced multiple audio and video affirmations that are available . Gratitude is all about the present, making it go hand-in-hand with mindfulness.

The app allows you to organize happy memories via photos, journaling and small reflections, so not having enough time is never an appropriate excuse. Some people wonder whether being grateful when faced with such a difficult condition is merely denial of the reality. “We aren’t dismissing or ignoring the very real difficulties and negative aspects of such a life-impacting condition,” Massey reassures. “Instead, we strive to encourage a more balanced perspective where the difficulties are acknowledged but don’t overshadow the positive moments that help foster gratitude.” In other words, gratitude isn’t about living outside of your reality, but broadening your perspective of your reality and helping you recognize the good in your life.

Diabetes Self-Management offers over 900 diabetes friendly recipes to choose from including desserts, low-carb pasta dishes, savory main meals, grilled options and more. One of the main goals of any control regimen is keeping blood glucose levels in the near-normal range. The cornerstones of most plans to achieve that goal include following a healthy diet, getting regular exercise, and taking or other medicines as necessary. However, it’s not uncommon for people with diabetes to have other medical conditions that also require taking medicines, and sometimes these drugs can interfere with efforts to control blood glucose. A few medicines, including some commonly prescribed to treat high blood pressure and heart disease, have even been implicated as the cause of some cases of diabetes. This article lists some of the medicines that can worsen blood glucose control, the reasons they have that effect, the usual magnitude of the blood glucose changes, as well as the pros and cons of using these drugs in people who have diabetes. To understand how various medicines can worsen blood glucose control, it helps to understand how insulin, the hormone responsible for lowering blood glucose, works in the body. Insulin is released from the of the pancreas in response to rising levels of glucose in the bloodstream, rising levels of a hormone called GLP-1 (which is released from the intestines in response to glucose), and signals from the nerve connections to the pancreas. The secretion of insulin occurs in two phases: a rapid first phase and a delayed second phase. Both of these phases are dependent on levels of potassium and calcium in the pancreas. Insulin acts on three major organs: the liver, the muscles, and fat tissue. In the liver, insulin enhances the uptake of glucose and prevents the liver from forming new glucose, which it normally does to maintain fasting glucose levels. In muscle and fat tissue, insulin stimulates the uptake of glucose and prevents the flow of glucose-forming metabolites (products of metabolism) from these tissues to the liver. Insulin does this by interacting with the insulin receptor, a protein that extends from the outside to the inside of liver, muscle, and fat cells. Once insulin travels from the pancreas via the bloodstream to the target cell, it binds to the receptor on the outside of the cell and starts off signals on the inside of the cell. These signals initiate several of the ultimate actions of insulin, including increasing the number of glucose-transport proteins (proteins that help bring glucose into cells, thereby lowering blood glucose) and increasing the number of enzyme proteins that help break down and use glucose. The glucose-transport proteins are highly dependent on potassium, and any reduction of potassium in the blood will interfere with the transport of glucose into the cell as well as inhibit insulin secretion in the pancreas, resulting in higher blood glucose. The liver, muscles, and fat tissue are important “sinks” for glucose storage, and anything that interferes with the delivery of glucose to those tissues will tend to raise blood glucose. As mentioned earlier, the liver can both absorb and produce glucose. Several hormones, as well as drugs, may stimulate the liver’s production of glucose. Quite a few medicines have been associated with the onset of diabetes or with diminished blood glucose control, but many of them are not commonly used, or the evidence that they raise blood glucose has not been firmly established. However, the following are a few widely used medicines that have been studied extensively and are firmly associated with elevated blood glucose. One class of medicines that has been shown to raise glucose levels is called the glucocorticoids. This includes such drugs as prednisone, dexamethasone, and triamcinolone. These drugs are called glucocorticoids because they have a profound effect on carbohydrate metabolism. They also have very powerful anti-inflammatory effects and are usually reserved for serious medical conditions that require a substantial reduction in inflammation, such as rheumatoid arthritis, severe asthma, or inflammatory bowel disease. Glucocorticoids counteract the effect of insulin on the liver and stimulate the production of glucose. They also block the entry of glucose into the muscles and fat tissue by preventing glucose-transport proteins in the cells of those tissues from reaching the cell membrane, where they normally serve to remove glucose from the blood. These drugs have many other serious side effects, including , suppression of the adrenal glands, and cataracts. For these reasons, they are only used when the possible benefits outweigh the risks. Many of these drugs are now available in an inhaled form for asthma or an intranasal form for allergies. These forms of delivery are associated with far fewer side effects than oral forms, including those related to the body’s use of glucose. High blood pressure is itself a significant risk factor for Type 2 diabetes, but some of the drugs used to treat it also appear to raise the risk of developing diabetes. Thiazide diuretics are a class of drugs that treat high blood pressure by blocking the reabsorption of sodium in the kidneys. As part of this process, potassium is also lost in the urine. This results in a lower level of potassium in the blood, a condition known as Many people who take this type of blood-pressure-lowering drug also need to take potassium supplements to keep their blood levels of potassium in the normal range. As noted earlier, potassium levels are closely linked with both insulin secretion and glucose uptake into muscle and fat tissue. Multiple studies have looked at the effect of thiazide diuretics on blood glucose levels, and the majority suggest that these drugs tend to raise blood glucose. One relatively recent study was ALLHAT (Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial). In this trial, whose results were published in 2006, participants were given one of several different types of medicine to treat their high blood pressure, to try to determine the best type of therapy. Based on a subgroup analysis of approximately 18,000 people without diabetes who were treated and followed for an average of five years, the risk of developing diabetes was slightly higher in those who took a thiazide diuretic (14%) compared to those who took two other types of blood-pressure-lowering drugs, a calcium channel blocker (11.1%) or an angiotensin-converting enzyme (9.5%). While this difference may seem small, when these percentages are applied to the millions of people with high blood pressure, many more will develop diabetes on a thiazide diuretic than on a different type of drug. However, choosing a drug to treat high blood pressure is not a simple issue, since ALLHAT also showed that thiazide diuretics were superior to or equally as effective as other classes of blood-pressure-lowering drugs in people with diabetes. When ALLHAT investigators specifically looked at study participants who had diabetes, they found that these people tended to do well on thiazide diuretics but also had, on average, a small increase in blood glucose (5 mg/dl). Many other large studies have also noted this effect. The risk of developing diabetes while taking a thiazide diuretic was also evaluated in the Nurses’ Health Study I and II as well as the Health Professionals Follow-Up Study. Between the two studies, a total of 74,816 people who initially did not have diabetes were evaluated. Over the course of treatment with a thiazide diuretic, the risk of developing diabetes was 20% higher in older women (average age 62), 51% higher in younger women (average age 40), and 31% higher in men compared to those in the studies not taking a thiazide diuretic. However, there is evidence that when hypokalemia (low blood potassium) in these people is corrected, blood glucose control improves. The takeaway message is that thiazide diuretics are considered a good first choice for treatment of high blood pressure because they are effective, cause few side effects, and are inexpensive, but certain individuals may develop diabetes or experience difficulty controlling blood glucose while on a thiazide diuretic. Potassium levels should be monitored and corrected when necessary. Beta-blockers are the other major class of blood-pressure-lowering drugs that have been implicated in causing diabetes or worsening diabetes control. The several large studies that have looked at the risk of diabetes associated with beta-blockers include the Nurses Health Studies I and II and the ongoing ARIC (Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities) study. In these two studies, the risk of developing diabetes in people originally without it who took beta-blockers was approximately 20% to 28% greater than in those who did not take beta-blockers. This may seem counterintuitive since people with diabetes are often warned that beta-blockers can cause problems with low blood glucose, not high blood glucose. Beta-blockers cause these two problems in distinct ways. First, they may harm a person’s ability to recognize and respond to low blood glucose, mainly by keeping the heart rate slow, which can dampen symptoms of . They may also inhibit the release of glucose from the liver. But beta-blockers also block the release of insulin by interacting with nerve signals to the pancreas and can thus lower insulin levels even when blood glucose is high. There is some evidence that not all beta-blockers affect insulin secretion. Beta-blockers work by interacting with proteins in the body called beta receptors. There are several distinct types of beta receptors in the body. Beta-1 receptors are predominantly in the heart, while beta-2 receptors are in the heart as well as the arteries, muscles, liver, and pancreatic beta cells. This means that beta-1–selective drugs are less likely to interfere with the secretion and regulation of insulin. Several studies have shown that a combination of beta-blockers and thiazide diuretics, as expected, also produces an increase in the risk of developing diabetes, by approximately 20%. The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence in the United Kingdom, an advisory group that develops national health policy, has placed a limited caution against the combined use of beta-blockers and thiazide diuretics for people at high risk for diabetes (because of family history, impaired glucose tolerance, or obesity, for example). While the risk of diabetes-related complications for the population as a whole is relatively low, these drugs may be a source of preventable diabetes or of diminished blood glucose control in individual cases. Of note, ACE inhibitors and calcium channel blockers have not been strongly linked to diabetes. Nicotinic acid, or niacin, is a B vitamin commonly used to lower blood lipids (fats). It can reduce low-density lipoprotein (LDL, or “bad”) and and also raise high-density lipoprotein (HDL, or “good”) cholesterol. The combination of elevated LDL cholesterol and triglycerides with low HDL cholesterol is a common lipid profile in people with diabetes. While the drug has many side effects, one of the more important ones is worsening blood glucose control. However, data on the effect of niacin on blood glucose control is not as plentiful as data on diuretics and beta-blockers. One well-controlled study of 148 people with diabetes evaluated the effects of several different doses of niacin on both blood lipids and blood glucose control. The goal of the study was to evaluate the common medical practice of avoiding prescribing niacin to people with diabetes. Fasting blood glucose levels as well as glycosylated hemoglobin (, another measure of blood glucose control) levels were evaluated over a 16-week period. While the doses of 1,000 mg and 1,500 mg of niacin were effective for blood lipids, the higher dose resulted in an average increase in HbA1c of 0.3 percentage points, and four people on niacin left the study due to its worsening of blood glucose control. The conclusions of the study were that niacin can be safely used in people who have diabetes, but that once again, in select individuals it can have an adverse effect on blood glucose control. In another study, niacin was tested in combination with simvastatin, another blood-lipid-lowering drug, in 160 people who had low HDL cholesterol but normal LDL cholesterol. The investigators looked mainly at the progression of lesions in coronary arteries, but they also evaluated blood glucose and insulin levels. Participants who received these two drugs demonstrated a significant reduction in coronary artery lesions and heart attacks. They also, however, had elevated insulin levels but not elevated blood glucose. This suggests that niacin may cause , a condition in which the body does not use insulin efficiently. In a review article that examined trials of niacin for both cardiovascular benefits and risks pertaining to diabetes care, it was clear that niacin has significant and positive benefits for cardiovascular health (namely, reduced heart attacks) but that small increases in blood glucose and insulin levels occur that may require adjustments to diabetes therapy. Antipsychotic drugs are used to treat severe psychiatric conditions such as schizophrenia. While schizophrenia is not a common disease among people who have diabetes, among people with schizophrenia, there is a 15% prevalence of diabetes and a risk of developing it two to three times that of the general population. Some of this risk may be due to family history, poor diet, and physical inactivity. But recent evidence suggests that some drugs used to treat schizophrenia may increase the risk of developing diabetes. A consensus statement from the American Diabetes Association and the American Psychiatric Association recognizes that antipsychotic drugs, and in particular olanzapine and clozapine, can elevate blood glucose, cause weight gain, and increase blood lipids. These drugs also raise the risk for diabetic ketoacidosis, an uncommon but extremely serious complication of diabetes. Several hypotheses have been proposed regarding how these drugs may cause diabetes, from simply inducing weight gain to impairing insulin secretion; but so far, no strong evidence explains why these drugs have this effect. There is a longer list of drugs associated with diabetes, but the evidence for each of these is not very strong, or the medicine is only used rarely. For the more commonly used drugs that are known to worsen diabetes control, it is important to note that there remains a balance between intended benefits and unwanted side effects. Glucocorticoids can stop an inflammatory process like asthma, thiazide diuretics have been shown to be very successful at reducing high blood pressure and its complications, beta-blockers do protect against heart attacks, niacin does reduce coronary artery disease, and antipsychotic medicines can make the difference between hallucinating and perceiving reality. If you suspect that your blood glucose control may be adversely affected by a medicine you’re taking, speak with your health-care provider before making any changes. There may be an overall benefit to remaining on a drug that slightly increases blood glucose in some cases, or there may be alternatives that can be substituted. Unfortunately, no medicine is without its drawbacks, but by knowing what these drawbacks are, you can participate in an informed discussion with your health-care provider about the specific risks and benefits of a drug in your unique situation.

When a person’s pancreas cannot produce enough insulin to sustain good health, insulin can be injected into the body with a needle, inhaled with an inhaler, or infused with a . One of the main functions of insulin is to lower blood glucose levels by enabling glucose to enter the cells of the body, where it is used for energy or stored for future use. A person who is insulin-sensitive needs only a relatively small amount of insulin to keep blood glucose levels in the normal range and to keep the body’s cells supplied with the glucose they need. A person who is , on the other hand, needs a lot more insulin to get the same blood-glucose-lowering effects. Insulin resistance is associated with numerous health risks. For one thing, it causes or high circulating insulin levels, which may be directly damaging to blood vessels. Hyperinsulinemia is also associated with high blood pressure, heart disease and heart failure, obesity (particularly abdominal obesity), osteoporosis (thinning bones), and certain types of cancer, such as colon, breast, and prostate cancer. In contrast, having low circulating insulin levels is associated with greater longevity; most centenarians without diabetes have low circulating insulin levels. Insulin resistance is a hallmark of Type 2 diabetes, but it can occur in Type 1 diabetes as well. In fact, there is a growing number of people who are said to have “double diabetes” because, in addition to having Type 1 diabetes, they also have the insulin resistance characteristic of Type 2. The good news is that you can lower your level of insulin resistance — and raise your level of insulin sensitivity — by modifying your lifestyle choices, particularly your exercise and eating choices, regardless of the type of diabetes you have. Physical activity has a significant positive effect on insulin sensitivity. Indeed, it may have the biggest effect of any measure you could take to improve your insulin sensitivity. Any type of physical activity has the potential to make your insulin work better, and combining aerobic activities — such as brisk walking, swimming, and cycling — with resistance training, or weight training, appears to have the greatest effect. Aerobic activities burn more calories (and glucose) per session, but resistance training builds muscle, which is what burns glucose during exercise, so having more is better. Numerous studies bear out the value of physical activity and exercise in improving insulin sensitivity. In a study of lean, sedentary, young adult women (ages 18–35), both six months of thrice-weekly aerobic training and six months of resistance training improved glucose use in the body. In another study, sedentary, insulin-resistant, middle-aged adults who engaged in 30 minutes of moderate walking three to seven days per week for six months succeeded in reversing their insulin resistance — without changing their diets or losing any body weight (although their body proportions of fat and muscle likely changed for the better). In a study of older adults in their 70’s, low- to moderate-intensity “walking” on a mini-trampoline for 20–40 minutes four days per week over a four-month period enhanced their glucose uptake by cells without any additional insulin release by the pancreas or loss of abdominal fat. No matter what your age, weight, or current level of physical fitness, studies have shown that exercise training can improve your insulin sensitivity within just one week of training without weight loss. While combined aerobic and resistance training is recommended for everyone, the benefits you will reap from any given activity will depend on how fit you currently are. If you’re completely sedentary now, starting a walking program or moderate resistance training program will initially be effective enough. If you’re already doing regular aerobic exercise, you will likely benefit more from adding some interval training or resistance training to your exercise routine. In interval training, you intersperse periods of intense exercise with periods of slower, easier activity. For example, on a stationary bike, you might pedal faster and harder for 30–60 seconds, then pedal at a moderate pace for a few minutes, then repeat this pattern throughout your exercise session. Once again, research confirms that this approach works. In a recent study of previously sedentary people with Type 2 diabetes, four to six weeks of moderate-intensity resistance training improved their insulin sensitivity by 48%, even without causing any significant changes in their body fat or muscle mass. Similarly, unfit men who were newly diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes who did 16 weeks of “progressive” resistance training (meaning that the weight they lifted was increased over time) just twice a week gained muscle mass, lost body fat (particularly in the abdominal region), and greatly enhanced their insulin sensitivity — all despite a 15% increase in the amount of calories they consumed. For older women with Type 2 diabetes, studies have shown that the combination of aerobic and resistance training may afford even greater improvements in insulin sensitivity and a more significant decrease in abdominal fat than aerobic training alone, with increased muscle mass to boot. The exercise studies mentioned so far all examined the effects of longer-term training, but each bout of exercise also exerts its own effect. During exercise, your body burns , a form of glucose that is stored in your muscles. After exercise, your muscles replenish their glycogen stores with glucose from the bloodstream. The more glycogen that is burned during a bout of activity, the longer the body’s insulin sensitivity is improved. More intense and longer-duration activities can improve insulin sensitivity for up to one to two days, as muscle glycogen that was used during the exercise is being restored. A short, low-intensity activity such as weeding a small garden, however, may not have any lasting impact on insulin sensitivity since very little glycogen is used during it. Therefore, to improve insulin sensitivity on a continuing basis, you should plan on exercising at least every other day, with near-daily workouts exerting an even more beneficial effect. In addition, you should try to do some more intense workouts (like brisk walking and resistance work) in addition to normal, less strenuous daily activities. For example, in a recent study of older individuals with diabetes, even when they were already walking at least 10,000 steps a day, their fitness and diabetes control benefited from doing “pick up the pace” training that consisted of walking at a 10% faster pace for 30 minutes three days a week. For a person who usually takes 90 steps per minute, walking 10% faster would mean taking 99 steps per minute instead. Given that the effects of more intense or longer-duration exercise may last slightly longer, the best plan is to intersperse these types of workouts throughout your week, or to do a more intense activity every other day to maximize its insulin-enhancing effects. Alternating between more challenging activities and easier or more moderate activities is a good way to keep yourself motivated, prevent athletic injuries, and keep your exercise training on track. The major reasons that people stop (or fail to begin) regular exercise are perceived lack of time, injuries from workouts, inconvenience, loss of motivation, and difficulty of workouts. By varying your activities from day to day, you can fit in whatever you have time for more easily, you’re less likely to injure yourself, you can pick activities that are convenient for you on any given day, your motivation is likely to stay higher, and the exercise won’t feel too hard for you since you’ll have plenty of time to recover between more intense workouts. To improve your insulin sensitivity, aerobic training should either be more intense for an extended period of time (such as during the “pick up the pace” training mentioned earlier) or just during interspersed intervals (like periodically walking faster between two mailboxes or telephone poles) during the whole activity. Resistance work (with weights or rubber resistance bands) will benefit you the most if you build up to a weight or resistance that you can lift with good form at least 8 times but not more than 12 times in each set. (Plan to do one to three sets of 8–12 repetitions per exercise.) When you’re first starting out with resistance training, however, it’s OK to work with lighter weights or less resistance while you familiarize yourself with the equipment and exercises. See the for an example of an alternating schedule of activities that can help to optimize insulin sensitivity. How does intermittent fasting improve insulin sensitivity? , or fasting every other day,  more than calorie restriction in adults with overweight or obesity and insulin resistance, according to . Among alternate-day fasters, the was a 52% reduction in fasting insulin and a 53% reduction in insulin resistance compared to 14% and 17% reductions, respectively, in those on a calorie-restricted diet. In addition to performing more physical activity, losing excess body fat is well known to improve insulin sensitivity, and other factors can help, too. For instance, avoiding elevated blood glucose levels after meals can improve your insulin sensitivity. You can prevent such elevations by choosing foods with a higher fiber content and lower (such as vegetables and legumes) and, if you take insulin, adjusting your premeal doses according to the amount of carbohydrate in the meal. Exercising just before meals can also help to lower after-meal blood glucose levels since insulin sensitivity is heightened right after exercise. You can also lower your insulin resistance by getting enough sleep, moderating your stress levels (exercise can help with this), and reducing your body’s level of inflammation (which can also be accomplished through physical activity and better food choices). For more ways to increase insulin sensitivity, see “.” You can exert a large amount of control over how effectively your insulin works in your body, and being insulin sensitive has many health benefits. If you take insulin, a heightened sensitivity may allow you to lower your insulin doses. If you take insulin-sensitizing oral medicines, these prescriptions will work more effectively, and you may also end up requiring smaller doses. Regardless of any medicines you take, improving your insulin sensitivity — particularly when you accomplish this goal through increased and varied physical activity — is a winning proposition for your diabetes control and your overall health.

4152e0d8-634f-4cc7-a62f-7a6ea6c25aaf,"By Kristina Ernst, RN, CDE, and Marian A. Minor, PT, PhD Daily physical activity is essential for good health and blood glucose control in people with diabetes[1]. But what if you also have arthritis[2]? One in five American adults has been diagnosed with arthritis, and half of all adults with diagnosed diabetes also have arthritis. Symptoms of arthritis can make it difficult to be active. But don’t let that stop you in your efforts: Frequent physical activity can help reduce the pain and stiffness of arthritis by improving muscle strength, endurance, and flexibility. Routine exercise also increases energy levels and helps with weight control. Other benefits include lowered blood pressure[3], a lower risk of heart disease[4], and sometimes improved sleep patterns. If you have arthritis as well as diabetes, it is important to keep your muscles as strong as possible, because the stronger the muscles and tissues are around the joints, the better they will support and protect those joints. When you don’t exercise, your muscles become weak and your bones become more brittle, which leads to a worsening of arthritis symptoms and to other health problems such as osteoporosis[5], the decrease in bone density that can lead to bone fractures. The most common form of arthritis is osteoarthritis, in which cartilage in the joints deteriorates. Cartilage is the tough but flexible tissue that normally covers the ends of bones where they meet in a joint, allowing for easy movement. Over time, as cartilage deteriorates in an affected joint, the space between the bone ends may narrow, extra bits of bone may develop on the bone ends, and the joint may change shape. These changes can lead to friction, pain, stiffness, and further joint damage. Osteoarthritis often affects more than one joint, and while it can affect any joint in the body, some joints are affected much more often than others. These include the knees, hips, and joints in the neck, lower back, and fingers. The primary cause of osteoarthritis is unknown, but excess weight and a family history of arthritis raise the risk of developing it. So does aging. Osteoarthritis can also be a result of overuse, trauma, or injury. Osteoarthritis of the hips and knees often causes people to limit their physical activity. However, regular moderate exercise does not make arthritis worse in these or other joints. In fact, regular moderate exercise such as walking, swimming, and biking can reduce pain and improve strength and flexibility in affected joints. Research shows that most people with osteoarthritis feel better and can do more when they exercise regularly. Regular exercise can also be beneficial for people with rheumatoid arthritis, an autoimmune disease that is characterized by inflammation in the lining of the joint. The inflammation causes swelling and pain, and over time it can destroy the cartilage and bone within the joint. Eventually, the joint can lose its shape and become unstable and misaligned. Rheumatoid arthritis can affect just a few joints or many, and if it affects a joint on one side of the body, it usually affects the corresponding joint on the other side, too. Most often, rheumatoid arthritis begins in the hands and feet, but it can affect many other joints, including the hips, knees, elbows, and shoulders. People with rheumatoid arthritis also often have body-wide symptoms, such as fatigue. What causes rheumatoid arthritis is not known. Contrary to what people may believe is the case, exercise does not make rheumatoid arthritis worse. Instead, it increases strength and flexibility and helps people feel better. It also decreases fatigue. However, caution and moderation when exercising are in order. This is particularly the case during flare-ups, or times of acute joint inflammation. For those with rheumatoid arthritis who plan to start exercising, it is best to ask a doctor or physical therapist for advice about what is appropriate first. A comprehensive exercise program has three parts: flexibility training, aerobic exercise, and strength training. Flexibility training, or stretching, helps to keep joints and muscles limber, make movement more comfortable, and may reduce the risk for strains and injury. A simple stretch for your shoulders and elbows is to raise both hands over your head and stretch your arms as far as you can. You will feel the stretch the most where you are least flexible. Aerobic exercise improves your heart health and increases your endurance for daily activities. Any activity that requires the continuous movement of the large muscles of your body, such as walking, bicycling, swimming, or aerobics classes, is considered aerobic exercise. You can get the health benefits of aerobic exercise by doing 30 minutes of moderate-intensity activity on most days of the week. Benefits are the same whether you do the 30 minutes all at once or in two or three shorter sessions. You are considered to be working at a moderate intensity when you are breathing a little harder than usual, your heart is beating a little faster, and you are warmer than usual. However, you should be able to carry on a normal conversation while you are exercising and feel that you could continue the activity for at least 30 minutes. On a scale of 1—10, you should feel you are working at about a 5 (somewhat hard). If you have not been physically active for a while, it is best to start your aerobic activity at a low intensity and to do it for short periods. As your body adapts to being more active, you can increase both the intensity and the time you spend being active. A rule of thumb is to increase aerobic activity by 10% to 20% each week. For example, if you can do 10 minutes of activity, increasing to 12 minutes the next week is enough. Strength training, which is often called resistance training, increases the strength in the muscles you exercise. For example, using a leg press machine strengthens your leg muscles. Strength exercises should be done no more than two or three days a week. A good rule of thumb when starting out is to use a weight or resistance band that you can lift (or push or pull) with good form for at least 12—15 repetitions. You want the weight to feel easy in the beginning in case you have any underlying injuries that you don’t know about; too tough a workout may make them worse. Once you know your joints and muscles are healthy, you can start gradually increasing the weight. When you can do an exercise easily for 12 or more repetitions, increase the weight or resistance of the band by 3—5 pounds. Remember to allow at least 48 hours of rest between strength-training sessions. Adopting any new healthy habit takes work, and regular exercise is no exception. Many people start with high expectations and overly ambitious plans, then quickly get discouraged and give up. Some ways to avoid this are the following: Think about which activities you like. What have you done in the past that you enjoyed? It may be a sport, walking with a friend or dog, taking a dance class, doing yard work, or volunteering for a job where you walk or are physically active. See if you can include these activities in your new exercise plan. Make a plan that makes sense for your life. Think about easy ways to work exercise into your current daily routine. Big plans to “turn over a new leaf” are often too much of a change to keep up. Make sure your plan is something you really believe you can do. Use the 0—10 confidence scale to check how sure you are that you can carry out your plan. On a confidence scale of 0—10, if you are not at least an 8, you are unlikely to follow through. Rework your plan to make it less difficult. For example, you may feel very little confidence in the likelihood that you’ll go to the gym for an hour before work every day. You may feel more confident that you’ll be able to walk for 30 minutes every day during lunch or after work. But if walking for 30 minutes a day still ranks below an 8 on your confidence scale, you need to come up with another plan. Perhaps walking for 30 minutes three times a week is a better place to start. Whatever you start with, try it for a couple of weeks and see how you do. You may decide to stick with your plan for a few more weeks, to add more time or other activities to it, or to scale back to something a little easier. (This action plan strategy is explained in the book ; see “Exercise Resources”[6].) When you start an exercise program, try being active at different times of the day to determine what time works best for you. Pick a time that fits into your lifestyle and does not interfere with your diabetes control efforts. You may also find you have more or less pain and stiffness in your joints at certain times of day. Remember that your most important goal is developing the habit of being physically active on a regular basis, not running a particular distance or being able to lift a particular amount of weight. It’s common to have some discomfort when you ask your body to do new activities. Signs that your workout is too strenuous include joint pain that lasts for more than an hour, increased joint swelling, or increased weakness or persistent fatigue. Muscle pain following exercise is usually a sign that your muscles did more than they are used to doing. Muscles that feel sore or tight a day or two after exercise are telling you that they are responding to the training and will get stronger. Doing some gentle aerobic activity to warm up the muscles followed by some gentle stretching may help them feel better. However, if muscle pain following exercise is so severe that it prevents you from doing normal activities like brushing your hair, contact your health-care provider for advice. Joint pain after exercise probably means that you overdid it and that you need to move less vigorously and for shorter periods in the future. If a particular activity seems to increase joint pain, try a different activity for a while to see if it helps. It usually takes some trial and error to figure out what works for you. To avoid injury, start slowly and don’t push yourself too hard. If you have tried to exercise in the past and have stopped because of increased pain, if you have trouble standing or walking because of lower-body limitations, or if, as noted earlier, you have rheumatoid arthritis, it would be wise to consult your doctor or a physical therapist before starting an exercise program. One of these professionals may be able to help you select activities, exercises, or classes that would suit your abilities. Your doctor may also be able to refer you to an occupational therapist or sports medicine specialist for more help. Some diabetes complications may be worsened by some types of physical activity. It is therefore recommended that people with diabetes have a medical exam that screens for the presence of any complications[7], including cardiovascular disease and diabetic retinopathy[8] (eye disease), before beginning an exercise program. This is especially important for people over 35, those with Type 2 diabetes[9], and people who have had Type 1 diabetes[10] for more than 15 years. People younger than 35 whose blood glucose levels are usually in their target range can safely take part in most moderate-intensity exercise programs. However, anyone who feels chest tightness, shortness of breath, or nausea during exercise, or who feels dizzy or likely to faint should stop exercising and seek medical help right away. If you take insulin[11] or oral pills[12] that lower your blood glucose, be sure to check your blood glucose level before you exercise. If your blood glucose is less than 100 mg/dl, eat or drink something containing 15 grams of carbohydrate to raise your blood glucose to a safe range before exercising. Anticipate the need to consume at least 15 grams of carbohydrate for each 20—30 minutes of moderate-intensity activity to avoid hypoglycemia (low blood glucose) during exercise. When you first start an exercise program, check your blood glucose before and after the activity to see what effect exercise has on your blood glucose level and to determine whether a change in your usual food intake or medication is needed. Be particularly careful if you exercise during the peak action time of your insulin. (The peak action time is when insulin lowers blood glucose the most, and it differs from one type of insulin to the next. Check the literature that comes with your insulin for information on how quickly it starts working and when it reaches its peak action.) Exercising around the same time each day may have a more predictable effect on your blood glucose than exercising at different times, but there may still be instances when your blood glucose does not respond the way you expect it to. Avoid exercise if your blood glucose level is higher than 250 mg/dl and you have ketones in your blood or urine. Use caution if your blood glucose level is 300 mg/dl or higher and you have no ketones. A blood glucose level over 250 mg/dl means there may be a lack of available insulin in your system, which in turn means that some of the glucose in your bloodstream may not be available to be used as fuel by your muscles. In addition, exercising when your blood glucose level is this high can cause it to go even higher. If you start exercising with a high blood glucose level, stop 15 minutes into the activity and check your level again. If it has gone up further, stop exercising and continue to check your blood glucose periodically for the next 90 minutes. If it has gone down from your pre-exercise level, it’s safe to continue exercising. Remember to watch for signs of hypoglycemia[13], as usual. People with Type 2 diabetes who control their diabetes with diet and exercise are less likely to develop hypoglycemia during exercise or to experience large swings in blood glucose levels as a result of exercise. In fact, for these people, exercise has a predictable lowering effect on blood glucose level and is an important part of diabetes treatment. Before you start any exercise program, you need a good pair of shoes that provide support and cushioning. For most activities, you’ll need some type of sneaker or walking shoe; for water aerobics or swimming, wearing water shoes is recommended to reduce the risk of injury. It’s important that the shoes you buy have adequate arch support and fit in both the heel and toe areas. Your heel should not be able to lift more than half an inch, and you should have wiggle room for your toes. These precautions are especially important for people with peripheral neuropathy[14] who have lost feeling or sensation in their feet. Wearing socks is also important for foot protection. The best time to purchase shoes is in the afternoon, when your feet are swollen and at their largest. To ensure you have a good fit, look for the shape of the shoe to match the shape of your foot. Make sure that you have at least one thumb’s width of space between your longest toe and the end of the shoe, and make sure the arch in the shoe matches the arch in your foot. Shoes should fit comfortably when you buy them. However, you should start by wearing new shoes for no more than 30 minutes at a time. Gradually increase the time you wear your shoes by five minutes each day. Once they have conformed to the shape of your feet and the way you move, you can wear them for as long as eight hours at a time. After each exercise session, check your feet for blisters, areas of redness, and callus buildup. Be sure to check the spaces between your toes for any redness or broken skin. Use a mirror to inspect the bottoms of your feet, or have someone else inspect them for you. You can avoid serious foot problems by inspecting your feet every day and reporting any unusual symptoms that don’t disappear in a day or two to your diabetes care provider. Are you ready to start a physical activity routine? If so, take a minute to think about the specific, concrete actions you need to take – such as buying a good pair of walking shoes or signing up for an exercise class – to make your plans a reality. Then write down an achievable goal for activity, such as, “I will attend a twice-weekly aerobics class,” or “I will stretch for 15 minutes every afternoon, then take a 2-mile walk.” Make sure you specify at what time you’ll do this, and where you’ll do it, and jot down some thoughts on what you’ll do if it’s raining or if the phone rings just as you’re about to start your stretching routine or head out the door to class or to take your walk. When you exercise, remember to pace yourself, and stay tuned in to your body’s signals so you know when you need to slow down or take a break. Performing regular physical activity can help to relieve the pain and stiffness caused by arthritis and help you control your diabetes, but not if you overdo it and get injured or burned out. In addition, find ways to vary your routine so you don’t get bored, but always include stretching, strengthening exercises, and aerobic activity in your plan. By keeping yourself active in a variety of ways, you’ll be on your way to greater mobility and better health.

People with diabetes, particularly those with , have been at least vaguely aware of the word for a long time. With the recent resurgence of popular interest in , however, just about everyone seems to be talking about ketones these days. But does anyone really know what ketones are? Are they a danger to your health (as in ), or a sign that you have lowered your carbohydrate intake enough to cause weight loss (as some people who follow low-carbohydrate diets believe)? Ketones are end-products of fat metabolism in the body. That is, they are formed when fat is burned for energy by the muscles. Chemically, they are acids known as and there are three types: beta-hydroxybutyric acid, aceto-acetic acid, and acetone. But you don’t have to be a chemist to understand what role they play in the body. To get to know ketones, it’s helpful to understand how your body burns fuel. A simple analogy is that of an automobile. For a car engine to run, the engine must burn fuel (gasoline), and when the fuel is burned, exhaust (carbon monoxide) is created. The carbon monoxide is the end-product of gasoline combustion. Your body also has an engine that must burn fuel to operate. The engine is muscle, and the fuel is fat, carbohydrate (glucose) and, in certain conditions, protein. When fat is burned, the “exhaust” is ketones, and when glucose is burned, the “exhaust” is lactic acid. Fat is more desirable as a fuel than glucose because there are more calories in a gram of fat (9 calories per gram) than there are in a gram of glucose (4 calories per gram), so you get more energy per gram of fat burned. In a sense, you could call fat a high-test fuel. But there is one catch to burning fat: To burn it efficiently, with little “exhaust,” you have to burn glucose at the same time. If you don’t have glucose available for fuel (because you are on a low-carbohydrate diet, for example), you will form ketones when your muscles burn fat. For most people, the ketones that form as a normal product of fat burning and weight loss are nothing to be concerned about because they are simply burned for energy by the body, and any excess are passed out of the body in the urine. In fact, while the brain normally uses glucose for energy, during — and particularly during long-distance events like marathons, when glucose reserves may drop very low — the brain can use ketones for energy. Your liver makes extra ketones when glucose reserves are low so that your brain has enough energy. For people with Type 1 diabetes, however, having measurable amounts of ketones in the urine or blood is cause for concern. Ketones in a person with Type 1 diabetes may be a sign that his diabetes is out of control, he is ill or has an infection or he is under extreme stress. Because above-normal levels of ketones in the blood can lead to diabetic ketoacidosis, a life-threatening condition, people with Type 1 diabetes who have measurable ketones in their blood or urine should speak with their or doctor promptly. Low-carbohydrate diets are sometimes called “ketotic” diets because they cause the body to burn mostly fat for energy (since the intake of carbohydrate is so low), which in turn causes the formation of ketones. Some people who follow low-carbohydrate diets periodically test their urine for ketones to see if fat-burning is indeed taking place. However, people who are losing weight on any diet might have a trace of ketones in their urine since a person who is losing weight is almost certainly burning and losing fat. With all the talk of ketones, some people have the mistaken impression that ketones are a sort of magic bullet that melt fat from the body, no matter how much a person eats. That’s simply not the case. Ketones are only by-products of the metabolism of fat and are markers that show that you are burning fat. They have no active role in burning fat or weight loss. In fact, ketone levels in people who are on low-carbohydrate diets are just barely above baseline, indicating they have no role in producing weight loss. The reason people lose weight on low-carbohydrate diets is not because of ketones; it’s because they have cut out a large food group from what they eat, and as a result, they end up eating fewer calories. Another unproven belief about both ketones and low-carbohydrate diets is that they suppress appetite, and that’s why people lose weight. Some scientists believe that the excess fat a person eats while on a low-carbohydrate diet has a satiating effect, causing people to eat less. Other experts believe that an elevated level of ketones causes a decrease in appetite, while still others believe that a high protein intake suppresses appetite. There are some studies in rats to suggest that elevated levels of protein during low-carbohydrate diets can cause a decrease in appetite, but so far, research on the effect of ketones and fat on appetite is inconclusive. The jury is still out on the long-term safety and effectiveness of diets that are low in carbohydrates for the general population, although some nephrologists link a growing incidence of kidney stones to high-protein diets. (Low-carbohydrate diets tend to be high in protein.) Most diabetes experts, however, agree that a low-carbohydrate, high-protein diet is not worth the risk for people with diabetes because they have a high risk of developing , and a high protein intake can be stressful on the kidneys in those with kidney disease. Diabetes is the leading cause of kidney failure in the United States, accounting for approximately 43 percent of all Americans who start treatment for kidney failure each year. According to Joslin Diabetes Center, as much as 40 percent of people with Type 1 diabets and 20 percent to 30 percent of people with have . You may find it easier to control your blood glucose if you severely restrict your carbohydrate intake, but keep in mind that even in people without kidney disease, no one knows the effects of a high-protein diet on the kidneys over the long term. If you’re considering a low-carbohydrate, high-protein diet for weight loss or blood glucose control, check with your doctor or diabetes educator first. During exercise, both fat and glucose are burned for fuel by the muscles. If your glucose stores are low, fat will be your body’s primary fuel. If you exercise and burn lots of fat without glucose, you will make ketones. People who are very lean and efficient at burning fat, people who are losing weight, and people who do lots of endurance exercise (like training for a marathon) use up their stores of glucose rather quickly, and when they do, they frequently develop ketones in the blood. The type of ketone they develop is acetone, and it’s not unusual for their breath to smell fruity or like alcohol as the acetone leaves the body through their breath. For people with diabetes, exercise typically lowers blood glucose. But sometimes exercise can raise blood glucose. This can happen when you are low on insulin. As you exercise, your liver converts stored glycogen into glucose to use for energy and pumps it into your bloodstream. If there’s little insulin available, your muscles can’t use the glucose and your blood glucose level will rise. If you have even a trace of ketones when you begin your exercise and your blood glucose rises as you exercise, the amount of ketones in your blood may rise as well, particularly if you have Type 1 diabetes. Although diabetic ketoacidosis as a result of exercise is very rare, it is possible, so precautions need to be taken. The American Diabetes Association guidelines for exercise, blood glucose, and ketones are as follows: • People with Type 1 diabetes should avoid exercise if blood glucose levels are greater than 250 mg/dl and ketones are present. • They should use caution if blood glucose levels are greater than 300 mg/dl and ketones are not present. • People with Type 2 diabetes should avoid exercise if blood glucose levels are above 400 mg/dl. If your blood glucose level is higher than 250 mg/dl, you do not have ketones in your blood or urine, and you want to exercise, I recommend starting your workout then stopping after 15 minutes to see if your blood glucose level is rising or dropping. If it’s dropping, it’s OK to continue exercising. If it’s rising, you should stop exercising and follow your doctor’s recommendations for treating high blood glucose. As stated earlier, for most people, ketones are nothing to worry about. But when you have diabetes, particularly Type 1 diabetes, they may signal that your diabetes is out of control. Your body may make ketones when you are sick, have an infection, are injured, or are experiencing high levels of stress. They can appear in your urine () and in your blood (). The problem with high levels of ketones is that they are relatively strong acids, and because of their acidity, their presence in the blood can reduce the ability of oxygen to bind to hemoglobin, the molecule that transports oxygen to cells that need it. That means muscles and other organs might not function as well as they should. In addition, high levels of ketones for people with Type 1 diabetes can lead to dehydration and diabetic ketoacidosis (sometimes called DKA). Diabetic ketoacidosis is rarely seen in people with Type 2 diabetes because their pancreases usually still produce some insulin, which means that the body is able to burn some glucose. People with Type 1 diabetes have most likely been asked by a doctor or diabetes educator to test their urine for ketones at one time or another. x make it possible to check blood levels of ketones at home. Two other home analyzers, the CardioChek and the CardioChek/PA (which also measure blood cholesterol levels), can also measure blood ketone levels. It’s a good idea to review ketone testing guidelines with your doctor or diabetes educator, but here are some general guidelines for who should test and when: • People with Type 1 diabetes whose blood glucose level is over 250 mg/dl for two readings in a row or who are sick should always test for ketones. • Pregnant women with diabetes are usually advised to check their urine for ketones every morning before eating and additionally if their blood glucose level is above 200 mg/dl or if they are ill. • People with diabetes who are ill. ( can cause sudden high blood glucose levels.) • Most adults with Type 2 diabetes don’t need to worry about ketones, but check with your doctor or diabetes educator for specific instructions. • Most of the time, children with Type 2 diabetes don’t need to check for ketones, but ask your doctor, especially if your child experiences unexplained weight loss or his blood glucose level consistently remains over 200 mg/dl. Ketones are usually tested with urine test strips, which change color based on the presence and concentration of ketones in the urine. The results are usually expressed as “negative,” “trace,” “small,” “moderate” or “large.” If the test result is positive, you should call your doctor or diabetes educator. You may need to take extra insulin, and your health-care provider will instruct you on how much. You should also drink lots of water or other calorie-free beverages to flush out excess ketones, continue to check your blood glucose level every three hours, and continue to test for ketones if your blood glucose level is over 250 mg/dl. If you are losing weight, you may have a small amount of ketones in your urine. This is OK for people with Type 2 diabetes, as long as their blood glucose level is in a normal range, but people with Type 1 diabetes should check with their doctor. The mild ketosis (the presence of small amounts of ketones in the body) that occurs in people on low-carbohydrate diets should not be confused with the life-threatening levels of ketosis that someone who has Type 1 diabetes can develop. Diabetic ketoacidosis is a serious medical emergency that requires immediate medical attention. The Foracare Fora 6 Connect, Foracare Test N’ Go Advance, Foracare Test N’ Go Advance Voice and Nova Max Plus meters can measure ketones in your blood with special strips that take a fingerstick blood sample, just like the procedure for blood glucose monitoring. Blood testing for ketones is superior to urine testing because it measures beta-hydroxybutyric acid, the primary ketone that’s formed in diabetic ketoacidosis, while urine testing measures acetoacetic acid. Urine testing can lead to a false negative result (which means it might show negative ketones when in fact you do have ketones), and there is a time delay to diagnosis of ketosis with urine testing since it takes some time for ketones to get from the blood to the urine. Another possible advantage to blood ketone testing is convenience. In a study of teenagers with Type 1 diabetes, teens preferred and were more likely to test their blood for ketones than they were to test their urine. Here’s what the results mean when testing blood for ketones: • Greater than 3.0 millimoles per liter (mmol/liter) is a serious metabolic condition and emergency medical care is necessary. • 1.6–3.0 mmol/liter is a high level of ketones and means you are at risk for diabetic ketoacidosis. Your doctor or diabetes educator should be contacted immediately. • 0.6–1.5 mmol/liter is a moderate level of ketones and probably indicates fat metabolism and weight loss, but not a deficiency of insulin. You should speak with your doctor or diabetes educator about what to do when ketones are in this range. • Below 0.6 mmol/liter is a normal blood level of ketones. While low-carbohydrate diets are usually discussed as tools for weight loss, that is not their only role. So-called ketogenic diets (diets that intentionally cause ketosis) have been used to treat epileptic seizures in children since the 1920s. The diets, which do not work in adults, are high in fat, low in protein, and virtually carbohydrate-free. The precise mechanism of how ketones work to prevent epilepsy is unknown, but for some children with difficult cases of epilepsy that do not fully respond to medication, the ketogenic diet is another treatment option. There are several centers in the United States that provide the diet. You can find out more at the following website: Ketogenic diets are also being tested for treatment of Parkinson disease. Some evidence suggests that ketones in the brain may help resolve some of the symptoms that people with Parkinson disease experience. Like epilepsy, the mechanism of action has not been discovered, and much more work needs to be done in this area. Understanding how your body works — and why it sometimes breaks down — puts you in the driver’s seat when it comes to your health and diabetes care.

ca6dfa96-6c8b-4971-b8e3-969eca0ab7af,"By By Sheri Setser-Legg, MS, RD, LD, MLDE, CDE, and Laura Hieronymus, DNP, MSEd, RN, MLDE, BD-ADM, CDE, FAADE [1] Getting more physically active is one of the biggest steps that you can take toward a healthier lifestyle. But what happens after those first few weeks or months of motivation pass? Life becomes busy, as it always does, and your dedication to physical fitness falters. You don’t feel you have the time, energy or, in some cases, finances to maintain this new commitment. So, yet again, your treadmill starts collecting dust, the gym membership goes unused and your running shoes get pushed back to the dark corners of your closet. So the question is, how do you combat what seems like the inevitable end to your new and improved lifestyle? What can you do to ensure you stay committed to your exercise routine? There are some important and useful tips and resources that you can utilize to stay laser-focused on physical activity and also improve your overall health. The newest resource is literally in the palm of your hand — your smartphone or other device. This is the age of technology for people with diabetes to use these resources for physical fitness, and overall health is improving every day. It is no secret that physical activity is vital for overall health but, particularly, for people with prediabetes[2] and Type 2 diabetes[3]. Recent Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reports indicate that 84.1 million people have prediabetes, which is one out of every three American adults. And in fact, nine out of 10 individuals with prediabetes don’t even know that they have it. The Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) clinical study demonstrated that people with prediabetes or at risk for Type 2 diabetes could reduce their risk of developing diabetes by 58 percent by participating in a structured lifestyle change program incorporating weight loss[4] and regular physical activity[5]. An additional 30 million U.S. adults already have Type 2 diabetes, and the positive benefits of weight loss and regular physical activity have long been established for this population as well. There are multiple exercise and physical activity benefits for those with prediabetes and Type 2 diabetes. The most important is obviously that exercise improves insulin sensitivity[6] and makes it easier to control blood glucose levels. Whether a person’s elevated glucose is a result of insufficient insulin production or the inability to use insulin effectively (insulin resistance[7]), physical activity will help lower blood glucose levels. In addition to the glucose-lowering effects, regular physical activity has long-term benefits in that it decreases the risk for chronic complications[8] for those with Type 2 diabetes. It helps maintain good cholesterol levels (high-density lipoproteins, or HDL), protects your heart and lowers blood pressure. Last, but certainly not least, regular exercise is essential to weight loss. Weight loss is directly related to a reduction in insulin resistance. The American Diabetes Association (ADA) recommends daily exercise or, at the very least, no more than two elapsed days between exercise sessions. Ideally, people with Type 2 diabetes should perform both aerobic and resistance exercise training for optimal glycemic and health outcomes, according to the ADA. Based on the DPP, individuals with prediabetes or at high risk for developing Type 2 diabetes should get at least 150 minutes per week of physical activity. So you know about the important role exercise plays in the prevention of Type 2 diabetes as well as improved glycemic control in individuals with Type 2 diabetes. Now we need to translate that knowledge into practice — better yet, a practice that you maintain indefinitely. There are several keys to developing and sustaining a successful exercise program. The first step toward your commitment to physical activity is setting specific goals and having reasonable expectations. Too often, we set lofty but unachievable goals for exercise and are discouraged when we cannot meet them. The American Council on Exercise (ACE) outlines the SMART guide to goal setting for your new exercise program. With the SMART[9] method, your goals should be clearly defined: S=specific; M=measurable; A=attainable; R=relevant; T=timebound. The goals should be important to you and achievable. Finally, your exercise goals should have specific time frames that will motivate you and give you a sense of accomplishment. For example, a SMART fitness goal might be, “I will walk at least 10 minutes three times per week for the next three weeks.” This may not seem like a very ambitious goal to some, but for an individual new to exercise, this is usually a very realistic and achievable goal. With regard to being specific about your exercise goal, using the FITT principle to design your exercise program can be extremely helpful. Many people do not feel they have the knowledge to design a fitness program, and the FITT principle is a reasonable guide. FITT stands for frequency, intensity, time, and type. All of these components are equally important to create exercises that fit your goals and fitness levels and can help keep your goals reasonable for you. How often will you exercise? Frequency depends on a variety of factors, including your fitness level, exercise goals and type of physical activity. How hard will you work during exercise? For beginners, it is best to start with a low-intensity program. Using a heart rate monitor is a great way to monitor your intensity. How long will you exercise? The duration of your activity will again depend on your fitness level. It may be easier to complete smaller, more frequent exercise bouts than one longer duration activity. As time passes, you can slowly increase how long you exercise. What kind of activity are you going to do? It could be a cardio activity such as walking, some type of resistance training or a combination of both. Talk with your diabetes care team, especially your diabetes educator[10], to determine the right fitness goals for you. Mobile fitness applications or “apps” can be great assistants in meeting your health, fitness, and weight loss goals. They are always with you and can be personalized to fit your specific needs. Staying motivated in your fitness goals requires daily attention to your eating habits and exercise routine, and fitness apps can provide that extra support to move you in the right direction. Some fitness apps function more as trackers to help you log your exercise and track your progress while others provide actual workouts and exercise plans. Although these apps can vary in the tools they provide, they share a common goal: to promote physical activity and improve your fitness level and overall health. Using a fitness app to help you achieve your physical activity goals can be a great motivator. However, the fitness app is only an aid. Personal accountability is key for any fitness program or lifestyle change. Here are a few tips to get the most out of whatever fitness app you choose. Your fitness app should be on the home page of your phone or electronic device. If it is buried on the third or fourth page, you are less likely to use it. After all, the apps you see on the first page of your device are typically the ones you use the most. If you see it each time you power on your device, it is likely to trigger a subconscious reminder to make it happen. Most apps include a logging feature as part of their design. Immediately after a workout, get in the habit of logging it. This benefits you because you can constantly track your progress, and that, in itself, is a great incentive to keep up the good work. Better yet, plan your day of exercise and log it ahead of time so you are more likely to find time for it. Schedule your physical activity just as you would that important meeting. On most apps, you can manually input your workout and it will help calculate calories burned. Some apps include workouts that can be personalized to meet your fitness level and goals. It is easy to shy away from exercise simply because you lack confidence. With detailed instructions and examples, these apps can be great for beginners and allow people to work at their own pace. Since they can be done virtually anywhere, apps can eliminate the typical excuses that you don’t have time to go to the gym. A large majority of fitness app users stop using their app within the first week because they aren’t using the app consistently every day. That means that only a small portion of users stay on track with their app and exercise routine. Fitness apps only really work if you use them every day. Furthermore, most apps offer graphing features to visualize your progress and see if you are on track with your goals. Quite simply, seeing your progress is a foolproof way to keep you moving in the right direction. The bottom line is: Embrace technology and let it work for you in the new year. With individualized workouts, progress tracking capabilities and inspirational virtual communities, fitness apps can motivate you and turn exercise into a fun and rewarding experience. Choose a fitness app that can work with your lifestyle, and use these tips to stick with the program. Keep in mind that using a fitness app does not replace the professional advice of your health-care provider or trained fitness professional. Always check with your health-care provider before beginning any exercise program. Talk with your diabetes educator to see what plan may be right for you. Be SMART, set a realistic goal.

Exercise May Reduce Impact of Diabetic Neuropathy Pain on Daily Life Exercise May Reduce Impact of Diabetic Neuropathy Pain on Daily Life As many as 70% of people with diabetes are estimated to have , and pain from the condition is notoriously difficult to treat. But a small new study from researchers at the University of Kansas Medical Center suggests that aerobic exercise may reduce the degree to which pain from the condition interferes with daily life. Although the benefits of exercise for diabetes management and general health are well known, the effects of physical activity on diabetic peripheral neuropathy specifically have not been thoroughly researched. To examine the effect of aerobic exercise (activities such as walking or swimming in which oxygen fuels muscles) on pain in people with diabetic neuropathy, the investigators enrolled 14 sedentary people in a 16-week, supervised aerobic exercise program. The participants had an average age of 57, and all had painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy. Pain intensity and the effects of that pain on daily life in areas such as activities, mood, walking, normal work, relationships, sleep, and enjoyment of life were assessed at the beginning and end of the study. The researchers found that, although pain intensity had not changed by the end of the program, participants reported significant reductions in how much pain interfered with their walking, normal work, relationships with others, sleep, and how much pain interfered with their life overall. “These preliminary results suggest that perceived pain interference may be reduced following an aerobic exercise intervention program among people with painful [diabetic peripheral neuropathy], without a change in pain intensity,” the researchers note. “Further validation by a randomized controlled trial is needed.” For more information, see the article, “Exercise Cuts Diabetic Neuropathy Pain Perception,” or see the in the journal And to learn more about dealing with painful neuropathy, see the piece “Controlling Neuropathic Pain: Tips From an Occupational Therapist.” Disclaimer of Medical Advice: You understand that the blog posts and comments to such blog posts (whether posted by us, our agents or bloggers, or by users) do not constitute medical advice or recommendation of any kind, and you should not rely on any information contained in such posts or comments to replace consultations with your qualified health care professionals to meet your individual needs.

Socializing with family and friends is different, too. And it’s probably safe to assume that the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted how you have been managing your diabetes. To get cutting-edge diabetes news, strategies for blood glucose management, nutrition tips, healthy recipes, and more delivered straight to your inbox, ! One of the diabetes self-care behaviors that has likely taken a “hit” this year is . Perhaps going to the gym or with friends has gone by the wayside. Financial concerns, increased , and even worsening are other reasons that may have thrown you off your usual physical activity regimen. And now that is just about here, the inclination is to hunker down and hibernate, further decreasing the chances of staying active. For many people (diabetes or no diabetes), the thought of aiming to fit physical activity into their day is much less of a priority at this time. , figuring out how to pay for medicine and supplies, social distancing and budgeting money tend to be first and foremost on people’s minds. But now is exactly the time to stick to and even start a physical activity routine. Physical activity and exercise provide a number of benefits, both short term and long term. Here’s a look at some of the immediate benefits of being active: With everything that is going on now, we can all reap the rewards of being active and feel better right away. But the shorter-term health “perks” of getting up and moving don’t end there. Physical activity provides longer-term, sustained health benefits that can improve your quality of life and even help you live a longer life! · Ability to do your daily activities and decrease the risk of falls · Lower risk of and high blood pressure · Lower risk of certain cancers, including breast, colon, bladder, kidney and lung cancers · Better brain health, such as and cognition While being physically active doesn’t necessarily prevent you from getting COVID-19, studies show that regular, moderate-intensity exercise , helping you to fight off infections that may include COVID-19. One of the hardest parts about doing just about everything is getting started. This is certainly true for starting an exercise program, especially in the midst of a pandemic. It’s not uncommon to automatically throw up barriers to why you can’t or shouldn’t be active. Let’s take a look at things that can get in the way — and how you can overcome them. Life is busy for many people, yet, some of the busiest people manage to squeeze in time to exercise or be active. How? · Take a look at your week ahead and look for time slots — even 10 minutes — when you can do some activity. Use a calendar or even a sheet of paper to indicate when and how often you’ll do some form of activity. The goal is to aim for 150 minutes of activity each week — challenge yourself to find ways to fit them in (you can do it!). · We all make time to sleep, work, clean, go grocery shopping, keep medical appointments…why not make time for physical activity? · The day can easily get away from you, so plan to do exercise shortly after you wake up for the day. Being active in the morning gets your blood sugar levels off to a good start, too. · If catching up on the day’s news is a must, position your stationary bike in front of the TV or use hand weights or resistance bands. You can even march in place! Being active doesn’t have to mean hitting the gym or doing countless sit-ups. Remember, the goal is to be active. · It could be going out for a walk, maybe with your partner or a neighbor. Investing in a piece of exercise equipment might appeal to you. Treadmills are an option, as are exercise bikes. If you like music, turn on some tunes and ! · It’s normal to have some soreness or achiness after being active (those area signs of mild inflammation or microtears in your muscles). But true discomfort or pain isn’t normal and is a warning to stop. You might also be limited in the type of activity that you do if you have certain , such as or . Check with your doctor or even a physical therapist for activities that are safe and comfortable for you to do. · You’re more likely to stick with your exercise routine if you add variety. For example, go walking when the weather is nice, but use an exercise video on cold or rainy days. Life’s demands can throw off anyone’s resolve to stay active — other things can get in the way, such as work or illness. Plus, if you are hunkering down at home or even quarantined, the isolation and stress of the situation can quickly thwart your plans to stick to your physical activity routine. Before you know it, you’ve stopped being active altogether. Here’s how NOT to let that happen. · Sometimes people lose their motivation when they’ve been doing too much physical activity or pushing themselves to the point of exhaustion. Ease up a little on the duration or intensity of your workouts if this is the case. · Telling yourself, “I’ll walk more” really isn’t useful. Be more specific: When? Where? How long? How often? Then, write your plan down and track your progress. Try a fitness tracker, such as a Fitbit or a smartphone app. . · If you find yourself binge-watching rather than getting your steps in, enlist the help of a trusted family member or friend to coach you and remind you of your goals. Consider a little friendly competition, too — who can get the most steps? · Checking your blood sugar before and after your activity session can be motivating, especially when you see it heading down (remember to keep treatment for low blood sugar handy if you take insulin or pills that can raise the risk of ). If you’re feeling derailed with your physical activity goals because of the quarantine, you’re not alone. What can you do if you can no longer swim laps at the local pool or attend your weekly class? Don’t give up — find other options to help keep you active. · Work out virtually, either with a friend or using a streaming exercise class or You Tube video. · Plan to stand up and move every 30 minutes during your day, especially when you are working or watching TV. · If you have stairs nearby, make a point to climb a few flights during the day. · Get outside as much as possible, unless you are in quarantine. · Set up a . You don’t need fancy equipment. Invest in some resistance bands or inexpensive hand weights. Bring your laptop or tablet to your home “gym” and use that area to workout with an exercise video. Include a chair if you need to do seated exercises. · Consider using an exercise ball in place of your desk chair periodically; an exercise ball can help strengthen your “core” muscles. Here are some .  · Look into ways that you can squeeze in activity even if you are tied to your desk! Look into a foot bicycle or foot elliptical. Check out other exercises you can do at your desk here. Finally, go easy on yourself. This has been a stressful year for everyone in more ways than one, and everyone is out of their usual routine. If you get off track or just need a break, no worries. Tomorrow is another day and another opportunity to start again. Want to learn more about exercising at home?

This is an area that has not had much research, but information on it would be helpful in making recommendations on diabetes care. To get cutting-edge diabetes news, strategies for blood glucose management, nutrition tips, healthy recipes, and more delivered straight to your inbox, ! Now, however, in a just published in the journal researchers at the University of Virginia of just this matter. The researchers collected data from 37 patients with from two clinical studies, both of which had the same method of data collection. The information they gathered included four weeks of , injections, intake of carbohydrates, and physical activity as measured by a wearable activity tracker, such as the Fitbit. They employed a measurement tool called the glucose area under the curve (GAUC), which is widely used for evaluating how effective medications are for reducing . It measures what are known as postprandial glucose excursions (PPGEs). A PPGE is the change in blood sugar concentration from before a meal to after it. The researchers were able to account for the meals, the insulin levels, and the subjects’ current state of blood sugar. According to lead researcher Basak Ozaslan, PhD, “I do statistical analyses to understand the factors and their relationship to blood glucose control in everyday life. Then, I use that understanding to build computer models capable of enhancing and individualizing treatment strategies.” In 2019, Ozaslan and her colleagues published research showing how step count data, as measured by a self-monitoring activity tracker, could shed light on the blood-sugar-lowering effects of “recently performed (structured or unstructured) physical activity” and thus lead to improved insulin dosing in people with type 1 diabetes. This new paper built upon that research by leading to information on how to adjust the mealtime insulin dose for blood sugar fluctuations that are related to a patient’s everyday physical activity instead of structured exercise. The datasets used by the researchers gave 845 total days of data from the 37 subjects. They determined that the higher the total daily physical activity as measured by step counts, the lower the GAUC measurements taken after meals. The same applied for the “total time spent performing higher than light-intensity PA [physical activity].” To sum up, the researchers wrote, “Patients with higher medical total daily PA exhibited lower average postprandial GAUC. Additional analyses indicated that daily PA likely presents an immediate and delayed impact on glucose control. Daily PA assessed by commonly available sensors is significantly associated with glycemic exposure after an evening meal, indicating that quantitative assessment of PA may be useful in mealtime treatment decisions.” The conclusion is consistent with a position statement from the American Diabetes Association that says, “Increasing unstructured physical activity (e.g., errands, household tasks, dog walking, or gardening) increases daily energy expenditure and assists with weight management. Unstructured activity also reduces total daily sitting time. Increasing nonexercise activity, even in brief (3-15 min) bouts, is effective in acutely reducing postprandial hyperglycemia and improving glycemic control in those with and type 1 and type 2 diabetes, most prominently after meals. Increasing unstructured physical activity should be encouraged as part of a whole-day approach, or at least initially as a stepping stone for individuals who are sedentary and unable/reluctant to participate in more structured exercise.” Want to learn more about managing after-meal blood sugar levels?

By , Are you someone who’s living with diabetes and working from home? If so, it’s essential to learn how to stay organized and manage your time in order to be efficient and successful at your job and best manage your diabetes. Building routines and habits may help improve your daily diabetes care and significantly increase your workflow and productivity. Where to begin? We have you covered! Here are six of our no-fail tips and strategies to help you manage your diabetes while working from home. First, it’s critical to understand the rhythm of your day. Ask yourself the following questions: • Is your schedule predictable? Or does it change daily? • Do you have regularly scheduled online meetings, virtual appointments or phone calls? • Are parts of your day more routine than others? (A daily morning team meeting, for example.) • Do you eat your meals and snacks around the same time each day? Once you understand how your workdays progress, you’ll be able to establish set times to check your or check your , take your or medications, and eat meals and snacks. If your workdays are predictable, these times will be fairly repetitive and will likely be about the same time each day. If your workdays vary, scheduling will take a bit more effort. We spoke to Toby Smithson, RDN, CDCES, owner of , about managing her type 1 diabetes while working from home as a coach for a digital health company. According to Smithson, “My diabetes management schedule is a priority. I block my work breaks at mealtimes to stay on a healthy eating schedule, stock my kitchen with nutritious and tasty food choices, and plan out meals for the week, so we have the foods we need at the ready. I switched to a Dexcom CGM, which makes it much easier to keep a close eye on my readings. Now I can easily check my blood glucose without interrupting a conversation. Sometimes I need to address a or . Although it is a disruption, it’s a self-care necessity.” Just like Smithson says, skipping meals and snacks may lead to hypoglycemia, or low blood sugar, while working. Always try to check your blood sugar and eat as planned. Make sure to factor in home-related or outside distractions. Stay acutely aware of scheduled home-maintenance appointments, repair work or deliveries that might interfere with your work or self-care needs. While working from home tends to give you flexibility, it also allows for more blurred lines. Make sure you have the proper boundaries in place. 2. Treat your diabetes-related activities as appointments. Once you’ve mapped out your daily schedule and figured out the best times to check your blood glucose, eat, take medications, etc., input those times in your calendar as non-negotiable appointments. While diabetes is often unpredictable, it’s helpful to include your planned diabetes-related activities in your daily calendar to serve as a reminder and to protect that time. As the rest of your schedule starts to take shape with meetings and appointments, you’ll already have time set aside to manage your diabetes. Most smartphones and computers have alerts that can remind you 10 to 15 minutes before your appointment starts. Make sure to learn how to set these important reminders. This step is critical. Give your diabetes-related tasks the same importance as your team meetings, work to-do list or client conference calls. This is key for improved diabetes management while working from home. Here’s an example: Let’s say that your calendar has an entry to check your blood sugar at 11 a.m. If your boss asks you to participate in a conference call at 11 a.m., you’ll see the “Check Blood Sugar” entry and be reminded to make sure you check before the call. Now think about the same situation where you hadn’t entered the time. Your calendar shows a conference call at 11 a.m. for which you need to prepare. Your morning is busy, but you get everything finished for the call. However, the call runs over an hour, and toward the end you become unfocused, lightheaded and miss key parts of the discussion. Just then, you realize you never checked your blood sugar, which you should have done about an hour before. Had your calendar said “Check Blood Sugar” at 11, you would have included that as one of the non-negotiable tasks to get completed prior to the call and could have potentially avoided an out-of-range blood sugar. Smithson shares, “Recently, I had an aha moment of how to plan my insulin dosing more accurately. I only have a 30-minute break for lunch. Since I have type 1 diabetes and use an with rapid-acting insulin, I realized I shouldn’t be waiting until ‘lunch break time’ to check my blood sugar and bolus for my meal. Instead, I have been checking my blood sugar 10 to 15 minutes before lunch break, so I can bolus and be ready to eat my lunch at lunchtime.” We also spoke to Julie Bestry, certified professional organizer, speaker and author, about managing her while working from home. She had this to add: “Most of my health-related tasks [that are] built into my schedule are second nature to me now. I have a timer on my Fitbit set to 50 minutes past the hour to remind me to get up and walk at least 250 steps before the hour is up. I also have a weekly Fitbit “Workweek Hustle” challenge with my best friend from college, where we cheer each other on to get 10,000 steps a day, Monday through Friday.” Do you have limited input over your work schedule? Time to bring your boss on board. Explain what you need and when. Keep it simple and direct. If you are feeling unsure of how to communicate, ask your doctor, , or a person with diabetes in a to provide some guidance. While it is sometimes difficult, try not to stack meetings and appointments one on top of another. Invariably, things run over, and schedules get out-of-whack. That makes tackling your diabetes-related activities, even those in your calendar, that much harder. Try to leave gaps of time (or padding, as we like to call it) in between items in your calendar. This will serve as a natural pressure relief valve and help you accomplish all of your tasks. Based on the type of work you do, you might have certain customers or clients who take priority over others, ones who are so important that, when they are scheduled, you make every effort to stick to the schedule and not cancel. Your diabetes-related activities need to be treated the same way. If you do have to make some time adjustments, that’s OK. Just remember that if you build some buffer time into the schedule between your appointments, you and your health will be the priority. Here’s an example: Let’s say you have an 11 a.m. meeting with a colleague to discuss a presentation. You are aware that you have a repeat appointment reminder in your calendar to check your blood sugar every day at noon. In addition, you have another meeting with a potential client at 12:30 p.m. Set up “padding” before and after each meeting (about 10 minutes) to take care of your diabetes needs, such as checking your blood sugar and treating it if it’s low. Based on the above example, put in appointment reminders at 10:50 a.m. and 12:10 p.m., which will build the padding into your schedule. This gives you the precious time you need take care of yourself before your next appointment. Don’t forget about your virtual team. If you are comfortable, think about letting a co-worker (or your boss) know your parameters for scheduling meetings as well as any essential information necessary when it comes to your diabetes care. Type up a “one sheet” with detailed instructions for what to do if you are feeling unwell while on a group Zoom call or Skype meeting, and share it accordingly. Make sure to include emergency contact numbers, doctor information and any other pertinent information. during the day to help improve your blood sugar levels and gain more mental focus. If you have a sedentary job, move your feet up and down while you sit at your desk. up and down stairs or around your home (or outside, if possible) a few times a day. Take a walk after you eat lunch or during breaktime. If possible, outfit your workspace with either an adjustable or standing desk. Do you get 3 p.m. cravings and find yourself drifting to your kitchen? Be aware of what triggers you and prepare for it. Keep light weights or Pilates bands underneath your desk (or work area) and lift them over your head every so often (or every time you feel a craving coming on) for a nice stretch. You’ll keep your arms toned and your hands out of the pantry closet, and you’ll burn a few calories at the same time. What a great way to stay healthy! Bestry offers this terrific tip to get her steps in every day (and ): “Every time the alarm on my Fitbit goes off, I walk at least 250 steps, and then I drink a glass of water. I used to use a water-tracking app, but I found myself ignoring it, so tying it to the end of the hour, after my mini-walk, works better.” Repurpose the time you previously spent commuting if you had been working outside the home. Plan to go on a walk or after work hours or during a well-deserved break. Try , meeting a friend for a walk or doing a free online exercise or . Remember to check your blood glucose more often if you embark on a new exercise program. 5. Keep diabetes supplies organized where you work. Now that you have your workday schedule in place, it’s time to think about how to organize your diabetes supplies while working at home. If the location of your home office or designated work area is far from where you typically house your diabetes supplies, consider creating a “supply storage station” consisting of all your essential needs. Most people don’t want to have to take time to walk a flight of stairs to check their blood sugar or grab a snack. Have your supplies close at hand to provide you with a much-needed visual cue and reminder that it’s time to tend to your needs around your diabetes care. Take a few minutes on Sunday evening to restock your home office diabetes supply station for the week. If you work on weekends, restock your supply station after a day off. You’ll feel refreshed and able to better assess your inventory for the week ahead. Remember to set a reminder on your smartphone calendar to “restock your diabetes supply station.” Do you miss your morning routine of stopping at your local coffee shop to pick up your daily brew? Or the daily 9 a.m. in-person team meeting to discuss the pressing work matters at hand? Rituals and routines are important to our daily lives. They allow us to move through our tasks without thinking about what’s next. And, when we give our brains a break from consciously planning and preparing certain to-dos, it allows fewer things to get in our way of accomplishing the work that requires effort. Try to replicate those routines and rituals at home. Put much-needed structure in your day by setting up a daily team web call to review priorities and projects, “commute” to work each morning by taking a walk around the block while FaceTiming with a friend, or stop at your local coffee shop to pick up a cup of coffee. Routines can make life easier, save you time and provide a sense of calm. Bestry builds control into her day by keeping her work environment separate from the kitchen. “The problem with snacking is that once I start, I have trouble stopping, so I don’t start, at least during the workday. I’ve turned my dining room into an office. During the workday, to make it easier to attend webinars and virtual meetings without a distracting background, I have a three-panel divider behind me, separating my office from the kitchen. It’s not convenient to keep closing the divider to go into the kitchen, so increasing the activation energy just a teeny bit keeps me from going into the kitchen to mindlessly graze.” Need help building daily habits? Time to head to the . It’s an app that helps you create daily habits by reminding you to perform a task and tracking when you complete it. The app creates a visual “chain” showing each day the task was completed. As the chain gets longer, it serves as an incentive to keep at the task, so you don’t break the chain. You can organize your tasks into categories and then customize each one according to how often you’re supposed to do it. It’s incredibly flexible and makes setting up and staying in a routine a breeze.    ** An accountability buddy is someone who works alongside you to help you get things done. However, that’s not always a reliable option. Enter ! Using online video calls, the folks at Focusmate automatically pair you with a partner who makes sure you show up, get to work, limit distractions and accomplish your goals. Schedule a work period through the app’s online calendar. Show up at the time you scheduled to meet your “buddy.” Begin working. There’s video (but no audio), so your buddy can see that you are on track and on task. After the 50-minute session, you share your progress and you’re done. Now, that’s a true partner! ** Want to learn more about working remotely?

f71515a1-3bea-414d-84cb-8154d7b17234,"To maintain a healthy weight[1], you need to work on your fitness. This will require a concerted effort to integrate exercise into your daily schedule — no matter how busy you are. The first place to start is choosing the best exercise for you and your needs. According to fitness coach Eric Stevens, the key to finding the right fitness program is to match it to your personality. Are you an extrovert — outgoing and socially confident? You are likely to enjoy high-energy exercises such as Zumba[2] and high-intensity interval training (HIIT), team sports and social get-togethers like group hikes[3]. To get cutting-edge diabetes news, strategies for blood glucose management, nutrition tips, healthy recipes, and more delivered straight to your inbox, sign up for our free newsletter[4]! Are you an introvert who is more focused on your internal world? Quieter physical activity might be more for you, including activities that allow you to clear your head, such as mind–body disciplines (yoga[5] and Pilates), countryside walks, golf[6] and endurance sports (cycling[7], swimming and running). According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)[8], your weekly exercise routine should include 150 minutes of moderate aerobic exercise or 75 minutes of vigorous aerobic activity. If this level of exercise seems daunting, start slowly and increase gradually. For instance, you could start with one 10-minute walk[9] five days a week, moving up to two 10-minutes walks, and then three 10-minute walks. This would eventually amount to 150 minutes of walking each week via achievable, bite-size sessions. It is also advisable to include at least two weekly strength-training sessions in your routine. Building muscle really is a win-win situation since you will burn calories while you train, but muscle also increases your fat-burning ability while at rest. If you get into strength training, ensure you have a minimum of 48 hours of rest between sessions to let your muscles recover. Your time is an important asset when trying to make exercise a habit. However, exercise doesn’t have to be time-consuming to be effective. In other words, you can plan your exercise routine around your schedule — even integrating it into your journey to work or your time with friends. Meeting a friend for coffee? Why not find a location where you can chat over your drinks and finish with a walk? Or maybe you could go for a swim and then finish with a healthy lunch together? If you want to integrate fitness into your life, you can make it work without having to disrupt your usual daily activities. While diet or physical activity alone may help you either lose or maintain weight, a combination of the two will propel you to your goals faster. In one study[10] that included 40 women with overweight or obesity, four groups were formed: resistance training only, diet only, resistance training plus diet, and a control group (a non-intervention group). At the end of the study, all three intervention groups showed a decrease in fat mass, but the largest decrease was recorded for the resistance training plus diet group. So, are you ready to commit? Tell at least one person your fitness plans, as spreading the word will help make it a reality. You’ve got this! Want to learn more about exercising with diabetes?

I am an occupational therapist. In my line of work, I see many clients with neuropathic pain stemming from diabetes. I have never experienced myself, but I know from working with my clients that it is often an unrelenting, terrible kind of pain. The burning, the pins and needles, the stabbing sensations, the numbness — peripheral neuropathy is hard to live with and can also be hard to treat. The causes of peripheral neuropathy (neuropathy affecting the legs, feet, arms or hands) are not well understood, although it is clear that the condition can have a number of triggers, including physical trauma, infections and toxins. In people with diabetes, neuropathy is usually the result of elevated blood glucose levels, which in many cases leads to permanent nerve damage. However, many people with diabetes find that — especially if their blood glucose far exceeds recommended levels — can lead to a reduction or even elimination of neuropathy symptoms. In part because of the unknowns surrounding the physical mechanisms of neuropathy pain, conventional drug treatments can be hit or miss when it comes to getting relief. You may have to be zonked out on pain medicine to get any substantial effect, and even then you may still feel pain. It can be hard to find the balance between pain relief and quality of life. However, we therapists have a few techniques up our sleeves for “tricking” the nervous system into perceiving less pain. As a disclaimer, everyone responds differently to each of these techniques. You may have to try several approaches before you find one that works for you. The word “works” also carries some ambiguity, since none of these approaches is a cure-all for neuropathic pain. However, one or more of them may help you get your pain to a more manageable level, so you can go about your daily routine and spend more time living again. The good news: None of these techniques will make your pain any worse — at least not in a lasting way — so what do you have to lose? Most people find warmth soothing. When is the last time you didn’t feel relaxed in a warm bath or while lying in the sun? Warmth provides the body with a pleasant, comfortable sensation that might just be enough to provide some relief from neuropathic pain. The body only has so many sensory nerve receptors, so why not give some of them something nice to do for a change? Heat can be applied in a number of ways. You can purchase a plug-in heating pad in almost any pharmacy; many pads have temperature controls to make them adjustable to your needs. Place the heating pad on the body part that needs soothing, taking care to place a layer or two of fabric (such as folded dish towel) between yourself and the heat source. Leave the heat on the affected area for a maximum of 10 minutes; remove it earlier if it becomes uncomfortable. (For more on applying treatments safely, see ) If you want to experience a spa-like treatment at home, you can purchase a paraffin wax warmer, which is also available at many pharmacies. This device is slightly messier and hotter than a heating pad, but using it can feel nice for your hands. If you use one, be sure to follow the package instructions and to check the temperature of the wax before putting your hand in it. Use a candy thermometer to ensure the wax temperature is no higher than 100°F, and continue to monitor it as you use the bath. Temperatures over 120°F can cause serious burns. Another option — and the least expensive — is simply to use warm water. Again, make sure the temperature of the water is no higher than 100°F. Run your hands under the faucet, submerge your hands or feet in a basin of warm water for several minutes, or soak towels in warm water and wrap them around the affected area. Add some scented oil or shower gel to the water for an even more pleasant sensory experience. In general, ice is not as soothing as heat. However, it does have the advantage of being an analgesic: It can provide a mild numbing effect, which can relieve pain. Ice is also anti-, meaning it helps reduce swelling. This can be useful if your hands or feet are prone to edema (fluid buildup), which can increase sensations of pain. Ice may also be the key for someone whose pain does not respond to heat. Using ice is as simple as going to your freezer: Fill a large freezer bag about halfway with ice cubes and seal it. Place a doubled-up towel over the area you are treating, then mold the bag of ice to the area and keep it in place for no more than 10 minutes. Some people prefer using bags of frozen vegetables such as peas, which are easy to shape to various body parts and can simply be thrown back into the freezer when done to reuse later. Just be sure to label your “cold pack” so that no one cooks it for dinner. You can also buy different sizes of reusable cold packs — filled with gel or pellets — at a drugstore and keep them in your freezer; having options can be helpful if you use ice frequently or for more than one area of your body. Contrast baths are a little messy, but they may offer some relief from both pain and swelling in the hands or feet. Start with two basins: one filled with ice water, the other with warm water. Starting with the ice water, submerge your hand or foot for 30 seconds — if you can tolerate it — and then immediately switch to the warm water for 2 minutes. Repeat the process about five times. If you can’t tolerate the entire 30 seconds of cold, you can cut the time for each bath in half. Contrast baths are nice for people who get good results from ice but cannot tolerate using it for long periods of time. Like ice, contrast baths can keep edema under control. If you decide to try this method, be sure to keep several towels handy — no matter how careful you are, water tends to get everywhere. Have you ever had a or some other kind of pain, then forgotten about it? Later you might realize the headache or pain has gone away or is less bothersome somehow. Sometimes you only notice the pain again when you remember that you felt it before. Did your pain actually go away and then come back? Probably not; more likely, you were just distracted. Distraction works under the principle that pain is all in your head. It’s not that you are imagining your pain; it’s that your brain — where feelings of pain are processed — only has so much attention to give. The more it focuses on pain, the less likely it is to notice much else. The flipside, however, is that if you can direct some of that attention elsewhere, your brain will have to turn down the “noise” caused by the pain. Anything can be grounds for distraction: music, a good book, television, calling up a friend to chat. Whatever you enjoy and can focus on, do it. Distraction can be especially helpful when your pain is holding you back from a task that needs to be done. This applies most often to physical tasks such as or mundane housework — although if a mental task does not demand all of your focus, it may benefit from distraction, too. Sometimes the pain caused by peripheral neuropathy gets worse with overuse of the affected area. Just as your body would ache after a heavy workout, your hands may ache when you demand too much of them. But how to avoid this? Can you name a household activity that doesn’t use your hands? Most likely, you have a daily routine that includes holding, lifting and carrying objects. If you can find a way to make those tasks easier, it might lessen the burden on your hands and spare you some pain. There are two ways to approach reducing the physical burden of tasks: joint protection and work simplification. Joint protection means performing daily tasks in ways that lessen the load on your joints, particularly those in your hands and wrists. Joint protection is all about physics: using larger-handled objects, for example, or replacing knobs with levers, which require less force to operate. There are joint-protecting tools for just about any task or hobby, from eating to gardening. (See ) Work simplification also involves making tasks easier. Rather than focus on reducing the stress on joints, however, work simplification aims to eliminate some of the steps or effort required in routine tasks. Some examples of this strategy include switching to wrinkle-free clothing, using automatic cleaning devices (such as those for showers and toilet bowls, or a robotic vacuum cleaner) and choosing pre-chopped vegetables for cooking. Both of these strategies may require some monetary investment — after all, new gardening equipment and a new wardrobe generally don’t come cheap. But if a purchase helps you get back to a hobby that you love, or even if it makes your daily routine a bit less strenuous, it’s probably worth it. Pain has a tendency to make people feel grumpy and edgy — meaning that the frustration caused by neuropathic pain can be about far more than the pain itself. Holding this frustration inside is almost always a bad idea, and it can be enormously therapeutic just to vent. One excellent way to do this — even though it may sound a bit hokey — is to write about your feelings. A major advantage of using a journal over, say, a good friend to vent is that the journal never gets tired of listening to you gripe. It never judges you. You can use the strongest language you want, and no one ever has to hear it. A journal is a safe place to write anything you need to get out of your system — just be sure to keep your journal locked or hidden away if you want to keep your thoughts private. After you have vented in your writing, you can then call a friend and talk about something more pleasant. Another advantage of journaling is that you can track your pain. By noting what you are doing when your pain gets worse (or better), including what time of day it is and details such as what you’ve been eating, you may discover patterns that you might not otherwise notice. Relaxation is a powerful pain-fighting tool. Think about it: When you’re in pain, do you feel relaxed or tense? Are your muscles at rest, or clamped up? Is your nervous system calm, or do you feel anxious and edgy? By consciously working to control these reactions to pain, you can sometimes reduce your perception of the pain itself. To use an analogy, the fire alarm may be disturbing you as much as the fire — and you’ll feel better if you manage to turn it off. Naturally, different people find different activities relaxing. If you have a tried-and-true method of relaxation, that activity may be a good remedy when your pain starts to act up. If you don’t have an activity in mind, though, here are a few ideas. Go to a gentle class. Yes, you will be moving, and moving hurts. But in yoga, you focus on the breath (distraction!) and slowly relax the muscles and the mind. You finish by lying down and simply breathing. Be sure to choose a class for beginners (avoid any class with the word “power” in the title) and to inform the teacher of your condition beforehand. He may help you modify a few poses to increase your comfort. Don’t have time for a whole yoga class? Turn on some peaceful music. Use headphones if you can, to help block out the rest of the world. You can also look for a CD or a free podcast that provides guided imagery, in which you slowly let go of all of your tension while imagining you are somewhere peaceful and safe. Using guided imagery — or any other form of guided relaxation — at home may be an attractive alternative to a public class. You may be skeptical of exercise as a remedy for neuropathic pain — and such skepticism would be justified, since some exercise can make pain worse. But exercise can also help; you just have to do it the right way. This means, above all, exercising gently — no grunting, heavy lifting or sweating bullets. People with peripheral neuropathy may experience more than just nerve pain; they can also have motor nerve damage, which affects how the muscles function. Exercise won’t repair damaged motor nerves, but it can help your muscles compensate for any damage. Specialized strengthening exercises can help you reclaim muscle function and thereby lessen the burden of day-to-day tasks. If you are new to exercise or if you haven’t exercised in a while, it is a good idea to consult an experienced occupational or physical therapist before embarking on any program. Unlike a personal trainer, therapists have specialized education in treating a wide range of health conditions. A therapist knows how muscles and nerves function, and what can interfere with their performance. By seeing a therapist, you can get an exercise program that is tailored to your particular needs. Neuropathic pain can range from annoying to practically debilitating, and sometimes the available remedies may seem troublesome or inadequate. But many people find at least partial relief from one or more of the treatments and strategies described in this article. If one attempt to soothe your pain doesn’t work, it is important to keep trying.

Thyroid disorders are very common in the general U.S. population, affecting up to 27 million Americans, although half that number remains undiagnosed. It is second only to as the most common condition to affect the endocrine system — a group of glands that secrete hormones that help regulate growth, reproduction, and nutrient use by cells. As a result, it is common for an individual to be affected by both thyroid disease and diabetes. Since the thyroid gland plays a central role in the regulation of metabolism, abnormal thyroid function can have a major impact on the control of diabetes. In addition, untreated thyroid disorder can increase the risk of certain and can aggravate many diabetes symptoms. Luckily, abnormal thyroid function can easily be diagnosed by simple blood tests, and effective treatment is available. For all of these reasons, periodic screening for thyroid disorder should be considered in all people with diabetes. The thyroid is a butterfly-shaped gland located in the neck, just below the Adam’s apple and above the collarbone. It produces two hormones, thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3), which enter the bloodstream and affect the metabolism of the , liver, muscles, and other organs. The thyroid gland operates as part of a feedback mechanism involving the hypothalamus, an area of the brain, and the pituitary gland, which is located within the brain. First, the hypothalamus sends a signal to the pituitary through a hormone called TRH (thyrotropin-releasing hormone). When the pituitary gland receives this signal, it releases TSH (thyroid-stimulating hormone) to the thyroid gland. Upon receiving TSH, the thyroid responds by producing and releasing the two thyroid hormones (T3 and T4). The pituitary gland “monitors” the level of thyroid hormone in the blood and increases or decreases the amount of TSH released, which in turns regulates the amount of thyroid hormone produced. Thyroid hormone regulates the way the body uses energy. It works by attaching to specific proteins called receptors that are present in cells throughout the human body. Therefore, thyroid hormone exerts wide-ranging effects in regulating the function of virtually every organ. Consequently, any changes in the blood level of thyroid hormone can affect many body systems and cause a wide range of symptoms. The extent to which each organ is affected varies widely between individuals, which is why thyroid dysfunction causes very different symptoms in different people. In general, the severity of symptoms of abnormal thyroid function depends on the severity of the actual condition, the length of time it has been present, and the person’s age. As a result, it is difficult to correctly diagnose thyroid disorder based only on symptoms. Fortunately, precise measurement of thyroid function is now possible with the TSH blood test, a test that directly measures the amount of TSH produced by the pituitary gland. There are two basic disorders of the thyroid: hypothyroidism, or an underactive thyroid gland, and hyperthyroidism, or an overactive thyroid gland. The most common disorder of the thyroid is an underactive thyroid gland, or hypothyroidism. Some studies have shown that up to 10% of women and 3% of men in the United States have hypothyroidism and receive thyroxine replacement therapy. Although hypothyroidism can occur at any age and in either sex, it is most common in older women. It is estimated that up to 1 in 5 women over the age of 65 may have hypothyroidism. At the other end of the age range, 1 out of every 4,000 babies in the United States is born without a properly functioning thyroid (congenital hypothyroidism). (For more information about populations in which thyroid disorders are more likely, see ) The symptoms and effects of hypothyroidism can vary greatly depending on the age and sex of the affected individual. The lack of thyroid hormone in an infant with untreated congenital hypothyroidism may cause cretinism, a condition resulting in severe growth delay and mental retardation. Routine screening for hypothyroidism in all newborns by a heel prick blood test has decreased the incidence of cretinism. In older children, signs of hypothyroidism can include unexplained daytime fatigue, changes in school grades, difficulty concentrating, and inattentiveness in school. Sometimes, however, an unexplained change in growth rate is the only evidence of thyroid failure in children. In women of reproductive age, hypothyroidism can impair fertility and increase the risk of miscarriage during the second trimester. Other symptoms may include a goiter (an enlarged thyroid gland), fatigue, weight gain, mood swings, , dry skin, brittle hair, fluid retention, muscle weakness, and constipation. In the elderly, the symptoms can be very vague and are often mistaken for depression or dementia, since thyroid failure can cause sleep disturbance and poor memory. Worldwide, the most common cause of hypothyroidism is dietary iodine deficiency. However, since iodine has been added to salt and other foods in the United States, hypothyrodism caused by iodine deficiency is very rare among Americans. The most common cause of hypothyroidism in the United States is an inherited autoimmune condition called Hashimoto thyroiditis, which affects up to 14 million people. Autoimmune disorders are caused when the body’s natural defenses against “foreign” or invading organisms begin to attack healthy tissue for unknown reasons. These natural defenses use proteins called antibodies. Hashimoto thyroiditis produces antibodies that damage the thyroid tissue, resulting in thyroid failure. Other common causes of hypothyroidism include the surgical removal of the thyroid, exposure to radiation such as radioactive iodine therapy, or external radiation used to treat some forms of cancer. Certain drugs such as lithium carbonate (for treatment of bipolar disorder) and amiodarone (brand names Cordarone, Nexterone, Pacerone, a drug prescribed for certain heart conditions) can cause hypothyroidism. Rarely, abnormalities of the hypothalamus or pituitary gland may result in hypothyroidism. Overactive thyroid, or hyperthyroidism, is less common than hypothyroidism. It tends to affect all age groups equally, but it is nine times more common in women. Like hypothyroidism, the symptoms of hyperthyroidism are varied and can be vague, particularly if the disease progresses slowly over a prolonged period. In children, it can result in accelerated growth, hyperactivity, loss of concentration, poor handwriting, and short-term memory loss. In young women, it may result in absent or irregular periods, recurrent miscarriages, and infertility. In older women, hyperthyroidism can cause hot flashes, mood swings, sweating, and weight changes, symptoms that may be confused with signs of menopause. Other typical symptoms of hyperthyroidism include irritability, fast heart rate, weight loss despite increased appetite, frequent bowel movements, insomnia, decreased energy level, and shaky hands. In addition, a goiter may be present. (To learn more about symptoms of thyroid disorders, see ) The most common cause of hyperthyroidism in people under age 40 is Graves disease, a type of autoimmune thyroid disease. In this case, the antibodies stimulate the thyroid to enlarge and overproduce thyroid hormone. Some people with Graves disease develop eye problems that can cause the eyes to protrude and that may threaten vision. Other causes of hyperthyroidism include thyroid nodules, which are overactive (usually noncancerous) growths in an otherwise normal thyroid gland, and thyroiditis, or inflammation of the thyroid gland. (See for more information about thyroid disorders.) People with diabetes have an increased risk of developing thyroid disorder. In the general population, approximately 6% of people have some form of thyroid disorder. However, the prevalence of thyroid disorder increases to over 10% in people with diabetes. Since people with one form of autoimmune disorder have an increased chance of developing other autoimmune disorders, people with Type 1 diabetes have a higher risk of autoimmune thyroid disorder. Up to 30% of women with Type 1 diabetes have some form of autoimmune thyroid disease. Postpartum thyroiditis, a form of autoimmune thyroid disease that causes thyroid dysfunction within a few months after delivery of a child, is three times more common in women with diabetes. Although Type 2 diabetes is not an autoimmune disorder, there have been many reports showing a higher occurrence of thyroid diseases, particularly hypothyroidism, among people with Type 2 diabetes. The association between Type 2 diabetes and thyroid disorder, however, remains unexplained. Since normal thyroid function is essential to regulate energy metabolism, abnormal thyroid function may have profound effects on blood glucose control in diabetes. Both hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism can affect the course of diabetes, but their effects are somewhat different. Hyperthyroidism is typically associated with worsening blood glucose control and increased insulin requirements. The excessive thyroid hormone causes increased glucose production in the liver, rapid absorption of glucose through the intestines, and increased (a condition in which the body does not use insulin efficiently). It may be important to consider underlying thyroid disorder if a person has unexplained weight loss, deterioration in blood glucose control, or increased requirements. Sometimes hyperthyroidism may even unmask latent diabetes. Having diabetes increases a person’s risk for heart disease, and many people with diabetes have a heart condition such as coronary heart disease or heart failure. Since hyperthyroidism causes rapid heart rate and increases the risk of abnormal heart rhythm, it may also bring on angina (chest pain), worsen heart failure or interfere with the treatment of heart failure, as well as further increase the risk of other heart problems. Prolonged, untreated hyperthyroidism can cause excessive bone loss, leading to , or bone thinning. Osteoporosis raises the risk of bone fractures, making falling much more dangerous. People with diabetes who have peripheral are at an increased risk for falls due to poor foot sensation and sometimes loss of or loss of the stimuli that tell the brain where a body part is in space, in relation to other objects. Therefore, the combination of hyperthyroidism and diabetes, particularly when neuropathy is present, increases the risk of fractures that may result in disability, especially in the elderly. Hypothyroidism rarely causes significant changes in blood glucose control, although it can reduce the clearance of insulin from the bloodstream, so the dose of insulin may be reduced. More important, hypothyroidism is accompanied by a variety of abnormalities in blood lipid levels. This includes increased total and LDL (low-density lipoprotein or “bad”) cholesterol levels, and increased levels. The abnormal lipid pattern typical of Type 2 diabetes (low HDL, or “good” cholesterol; high triglycerides; and a high proportion of small, dense LDL particles) is usually worsened by hypothyroidism. These changes further raise the already high risk of cardiovascular diseases such as heart disease and among people with diabetes. Pregnancy-related thyroid dysfunction is three times more common in women with diabetes and should be anticipated in every pregnant woman with Type 1 diabetes. Postpartum thyroiditis may cause fluctuating thyroid hormone levels in the months following delivery. In addition to symptoms such as fatigue, depression (the “baby blues”), irritability, and heart palpitations, blood glucose control and insulin requirements may be affected during this period of thyroid dysfunction and profound reproductive hormonal changes. Continued monitoring of thyroid function is necessary in all women who experience postpartum thyroiditis, since roughly one-third will develop permanent hypothyroidism within three to four years and will require thyroxine replacement. Women who have diagnosed hypothyroidism and already take thyroxine before pregnancy often need to increase the dose of thyroxine during pregnancy. Adequate thyroxine replacement is vital for the baby’s neurological development. Women with active Graves disease may enter a period of remission during pregnancy, when the disease becomes less active, but they can expect a recurrence following delivery. If hyperthyroidism is poorly controlled during pregnancy, the risk of maternal complications such as preeclampsia (a serious condition characterized by high blood pressure) and fetal problems such as prematurity increases. The maintenance of normal thyroid function and is therefore of utmost importance during pregnancy to ensure a successful outcome. As mentioned earlier, the diagnosis of abnormal thyroid function based solely on symptoms can be difficult. In people with diabetes, it may be even more difficult because of the complex interrelationships of thyroid function and diabetes. Both chronically high blood glucose and hyperthyroidism can cause weight loss despite good appetite, weakness, and fatigue. Likewise, severe can produce symptoms such as swelling, weight gain, and hypertension, which may be confused with hypothyroidism. The most reliable method used to diagnose thyroid disease is the simple, relatively inexpensive, yet highly sensitive TSH blood test. This test measures directly the amount of TSH produced by the pituitary gland. Since the pituitary is the first organ to recognize abnormal thyroid function, testing its function is the most sensitive way to monitor thyroid function. In addition to diagnosis, the TSH test is also used to monitor and adjust the dosage of thyroxine therapy. Before the introduction of the TSH test in the late 1960s, blood tests for thyroid function measured only the levels of the thyroid hormones, T3 and T4. However, these hormone levels can appear relatively normal even when the thyroid is not functioning normally, because the pituitary gland will compensate for thyroid dysfunction. When the thyroid starts to fail (a sign of early hypothyroidism), the pituitary responds by producing higher levels of TSH to stimulate the thyroid to produce more thyroid hormones, thereby maintaining normal circulating T3 and T4 levels. Conversely, when the thyroid gland produces too much thyroid hormone (a sign of early hyperthyroidism), the pituitary responds by producing less TSH, thereby reducing T3 and T4 production from the thyroid. Therefore, prior to any changes in the thyroid hormone levels, there is a detectable change in the TSH level, which indicates abnormal thyroid function. A normal TSH level ranges from 0.4 mU/ml to 4.0 mU/ml (microunits per milliliter). A below-normal TSH level indicates hyperthyroidism, and an above-normal TSH level indicates hypothyroidism. An elevated TSH level accompanied by normal thyroid hormone levels is known as subclinical hypothyroidism. People with subclinical hypothyroidism often do not have any symptoms. However, they do face the increased risks of cardiovascular disease associated with hypothyroidism, due to the abnormalities in blood lipid levels. Some doctors have even suggested that a TSH level in the upper-normal range (2.5–4.0 mU/ml) should be considered as evolving thyroid failure. Thyroid antibodies that are produced in autoimmune thyroid diseases can also be measured by blood testing. The presence of these antibodies can help determine the underlying cause of thyroid disorder. The most specific antibody test is called the anti-TPO antibody test. Nearly all thyroid diseases are treatable. Hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism often require long-term or lifelong treatment, depending on the specifics of the diagnosis. The treatment for hypothyroidism is to replace the missing thyroid hormone. The most common form of thyroid hormone is a synthetic derivative, levothyroxine, which is usually taken as one pill daily. This is a simple yet very effective treatment of hypothyroidism. Once the treatment is started, TSH testing every two or three months is necessary to adjust to the correct dose. When a stable dose is achieved, annual TSH testing is generally adequate for monitoring purposes. The symptoms of hypothyroidism may take several months of therapy to resolve. Often, lifelong treatment is necessary. Natural thyroid extract derived from animal sources is a less commonly used form of thyroid replacement and has the disadvantage of inconsistent dosage that varies from one batch of pills to another. Certain supplements, including supplements, calcium supplements, and that contain iron or calcium, can interfere with the absorption of thyroxine. For this reason, these pills should be taken at least two hours apart from thyroxine. In addition, it’s a good idea to let your physician know of any supplements or other medicines you take in addition to levothyroxine. There are several options for treatment of hyperthyroidism, with the choice dependent on the cause of the disorder; it must be individually determined. Long-term oral antithyroid medicines such as methimazole (Tapazole) and propylthiouracil (PTU) are effective in controlling the production of thyroid hormone. Regular blood test monitoring is necessary throughout the course of treatment. Radioactive iodine therapy is the most common treatment used in the United States for hyperthyroidism. It has a very high cure rate but often results in permanent hypothyroidism. Surgery offers an alternative, particularly in people with very large goiters. All these treatments are effective in controlling or curing hyperthyroidism. Abnormal thyroid function can have a major impact on diabetes control and increase a person’s risk of developing diabetic complications. Because of the complications that can result from untreated thyroid disorder, regular screening is recommended to allow early detection and treatment. For people with Type 1 diabetes, annual screening is advisable. For people with Type 2 diabetes, screening should be done at the time of diagnosis and then repeated every five years thereafter. The frequency of screening should increase with advancing age, since the incidence of thyroid disorder increases with age. For people over the age of 60, annual screening is recommended.

7240e88e-bd28-4a84-b400-c6580fe837c1,"Coronavirus: Diabetes Self-Care in a Time of Uncertainty Life as we knew it has certainly been upended over the past month or so[1]. Social distancing, working from home — or not working at all — wearing masks and celebrating holidays with others over phone or video is not the norm for most of us. And there’s the unknown: When will it all end? When will we go back to “normal,” or will our new normal look very different? Living during a pandemic can cause a number of feelings and emotions to rise to the surface, including fear, anxiety, and depression, along with stress[2] and boredom. On top of all the craziness that’s going on, you still have diabetes. During times of crisis and stress, your day-to-day schedule and routine can get disrupted, and that’s to be expected. Unfortunately, your diabetes management can get disrupted, as well, and that can lead to a set of other issues, such as hyperglycemia (high blood sugar)[3], hypoglycemia (low blood sugar)[4], illness, and possibly weight gain[5]. How can you use this time to your advantage? The Association of Diabetes Care & Education Specialists (ADCES; formerly AADE) has identified seven key areas of diabetes self-management[6] for successful and effective diabetes self-management. These are behaviors that you’ve likely been practicing. But if you’ve been thrown off a bit (and who hasn’t?), here are some suggestions for helping you get back on track. To get cutting-edge diabetes news, strategies for blood glucose management, nutrition tips, healthy recipes, and more delivered straight to your inbox, sign up for our free newsletter[7]! If finding and/or affording your usual foods has been a challenge, or if food preparation has been a struggle, try these tips: · Come up with a plan for meals and snacks[8] to help ensure that you and your family are eating healthfully and regularly. If you need inspiration, check out quick meal ideas on our website[9] or www.diabetesfoodhub.org[10]. · If finding adequate fresh fruits and vegetables is a challenge, it’s okay to turn to canned and frozen produce. Choose vegetables that are “no salt added” and that aren’t packed in butter or cheese sauce. Good fruit choices are those packed in fruit juice or water, not syrup. · Stay with a regular eating schedule to help with your blood sugars and your weight. · Tracking your food with a food app or even pencil and paper can help you stick with your goals to eat healthfully and manage your blood sugars[11] and your weight. You can still be active[12], even if you’re not able to get to the gym or to your usual exercise class. Doing just 10 minutes of physical activity can lower stress and anxiety, give your mood a boost, and make it easier to manage your blood sugars. · Set a timer to get up every 30 minutes to march in place, climb stairs, dance[13] or do some stretching. · Go out for a walk[14]. If you walk with others, be sure to stay at least six feet apart. · Check out exercise videos on sites such as You Tube. Some gyms are offering free streaming classes[15]. · Gardening and yard work can help you burn calories and tone muscles. Keeping up with your blood sugar checking[16] is important, especially when there’s a change in your routine. But monitoring can also mean keeping tabs on other aspects of your health, such as your blood pressure[17], weight, sleep[18], medications and mood. · If you like doing puzzles, try tracking your glucose levels using a logbook or a spreadsheet, or download your glucose values from your meter or CGM[19]. Look for patterns of high or low glucose levels. Then, think about what may have caused them and what you could try to do differently next time. · Step on the scale. Weighing yourself at regular intervals is a way to increase your awareness; doing so can keep you on track to reach your weight goal or to help you maintain your current weight. If weighing yourself daily makes you feel anxious or stressed, check your weight once or twice a week — whatever works best for you. · Use a sleep tracking device or app if you’re having trouble sleeping or feeling tired all the time. These devices and apps can give you insight into your sleep habits. For suggestions, visit the website of the National Sleep Foundation[20]. One of the biggest concerns that people have during this time is being able to afford medications and diabetes supplies. · If you’re having difficulty affording medications and/or diabetes supplies, read “Resources & Financial Assistance Programs to Help with the Cost of Managing Diabetes”[21] on the AgaMatrix website for resources. · A shake-up in your daily routine can mean that you get off track with taking your medications as prescribed. Use a pill organizer or set a reminder on your calendar or phone to prompt you to take your medication. · If you think you need more or less of your diabetes medicines, or have questions about them, make a virtual appointment with your doctor, diabetes educator[22] or pharmacist — either by phone or telemedicine visit. Problem solving has never been more important during this time. If things aren’t working out for you as they should around managing your diabetes, take some time to figure out what needs changing. · Enlist the help of others in your household to help with chores, meal preparation or food shopping, for example, or even to encourage or remind you to stick with your self-care routine. · If you’re feeling stuck on how to figure out a tricky situation, try this worksheet to get you going[23]. · Reach out to a diabetes educator if you feel like you’re struggling to discuss your concerns. Your doctor may be able to refer you to one in your community or you can visit ADCES’s website[24]. Managing diabetes is more than simply taking your medication and checking your blood sugar. It also involves behaviors that can help you prevent or delay problems down the road. Fortunately, there are steps that you can take now to minimize the risk of complications[25]. · Make a point to give your feet some attention[26]. This means washing, drying and moisturizing your feet (except between your toes), looking for cuts, sores or redness, and trimming your toenails straight across. If you usually have a podiatrist do this for you, reach out to their office for guidance. · Keep tabs on your dental health[27]. Brush your teeth at least twice a day and floss every day. Let your dentist know if you have bleeding gums or loose or painful teeth. · Be nice to your heart[28]. Eating healthy foods and being active will help, as will getting enough sleep, doing something (healthy) that you enjoy, and if you smoke, working on stopping smoking. Find help for quitting smoking here[29]. Finding ways to boost your mental and emotional health is especially important at a time like this. If you are struggling with feelings of depression, stress and/or anxiety[30], it can take a toll on your health in many ways, including affecting your ability to take care of your diabetes. There’s a lot that you can do to cope with stress. · Go easy on yourself. Try not to set your expectation too high right now — you don’t need to clean your entire house or learn a new language. Do the best you can and think about what is working and what isn’t, and then move on. Plus, make time in your day to do something just for you: take a nap, read a book, or work on a hobby, for example. · Stay in contact with others. This is especially important if you live alone. Try meeting a friend or neighbor for a walk outside (staying, as noted above, at least six feet apart), call someone on the phone, and, if you have the technology, use apps like FaceTime, Zoom or Skype to talk and catch up with family and friends. · If you’re feeling alone as a result of having diabetes, you’re not alone! There are a number of online diabetes peer support communities. Check them out here[31]. · Visit the CDC’s website[32] for other ways to cope with stress.

A cluster of interrelated conditions that greatly increases the risk of developing and heart disease. Metabolic syndrome is commonly characterized by , high blood pressure, obesity, abnormalities in blood levels of lipids (such as and ), increased blood clotting, and a tendency toward . Other conditions that may be associated with the syndrome include (brown or black velvety patches on the back of the neck or elsewhere), hyperuricemia (high blood levels of uric acid), and, in women, . Metabolic syndrome is also known under a variety of other names, sometimes reflecting slight differences in definition. Among these names are insulin resistance syndrome, dysmetabolic syndrome X, cardiovascular metabolic syndrome, and Reaven syndrome (after Stanford University researcher Gerald Reavan, who provided a description of the syndrome in 1988). Some authorities believe that insulin resistance is the primary problem that leads to the other conditions involved in the syndrome. Simply stated, insulin resistance is a condition in which insulin doesn’t work as well as it should. One of insulin’s jobs is to allow glucose in the blood to enter the cells of the body, where it can be used for energy. In people who are insulin resistant, more and more insulin is required to make this happen. Another of insulin’s jobs is to signal the liver to secrete less glucose into the bloodstream. In many insulin-resistant individuals, the liver may continue to secrete a lot of glucose into the bloodstream despite the presence of lots of insulin. Up to one-third of American adults are estimated to have some degree of insulin resistance. Insulin resistance may lead to hyperinsulinemia, or too much insulin in the bloodstream. As the body becomes less and less efficient at using insulin, the pancreas must secrete more and more insulin to keep blood glucose levels in the normal range. Some scientists think that insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia, independent of their effects on blood sugar levels, can promote heart disease through insulin’s effects on blood vessel walls and the blood’s tendency to clot. Other components of metabolic syndrome that increase the risk of heart disease are high blood pressure, obesity, and blood lipid abnormalities, such as increased triglyceride levels, decreased levels of “good” high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, and increased levels of small low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol particles. The syndrome was a major concern of treatment guidelines issued in 2005 by the National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP). The NCEP was established by the US National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute to help lower the toll in illness and death caused by heart disease. According to the NCEP, metabolic syndrome raises the risk of heart disease as much as cigarette smoking does. A person should be regarded as having metabolic syndrome, say the guidelines, if any three of the following risk factors are present: Abdominal obesity (defined as a waist circumference of over 40 inches in men and over 35 inches in women) Low HDL-cholesterol level (less than 40 mg/dl in men and less than 50 mg/dl in women) The NCEP guidelines give priority to treating the root causes of the metabolic syndrome that are susceptible to change — namely, excessive weight and physical inactivity. (Genetic factors that contribute to the syndrome cannot be reversed.) Lifestyle measures such as diet control and exercising can often reduce insulin resistance and other conditions associated with the syndrome. In some cases drug treatment of specific conditions is recommended to reduce the risk of heart disease. The guidelines accordingly advise treating abnormal blood levels of lipids with lipid-altering drugs, high blood pressure with antihypertensive drugs, and blood clotting with aspirin.

By Laura Hieronymus, DNP, MSEd, RN, MLDE, BC-ADM, CDCES, FADCES, When you were diagnosed with diabetes, your doctor probably told you that your blood glucose levels were too high. Indeed, high blood glucose, or is the hallmark of diabetes. Regardless of your knowledge of diabetes at that time, you may have wondered what the significance of high blood glucose levels was for you. The answer is that hyperglycemia is linked to the development of long-term , which include (kidney disease), (eye disease), (nerve damage), and skin problems, and blood vessel disease, and . That’s why individual treatment plans for people with diabetes focus on preventing hyperglycemia and keeping blood glucose levels as close to the normal range as possible. Keeping blood glucose levels close to normal requires learning how to balance food intake, physical activity, and the effects of any diabetes medicines your doctor may prescribe to lower your blood glucose level. For some people, the balancing act also involves learning to avoid , or low blood glucose. In healthy people who don’t have diabetes, blood glucose levels typically run in the range of 65–110 mg/dl and may rise to 120–140 mg/dl one to two hours after eating. A diagnosis of diabetes is made when a person’s (a measure of glucose control over the previous 2–3 months) is 6.5% or higher, his fasting blood glucose level is above 126 mg/dl on two separate occasions, or when he has symptoms of diabetes (such as excessive thirst and urination) and his nonfasting blood glucose level is greater than 200 mg/dl on two separate occasions. Until several years ago, a diagnosis of , a condition in which blood glucose levels are high but not high enough for a diagnosis of diabetes, was made when a person’s fasting blood glucose level was between 110 mg/dl and 126 mg/dl. In 2004, an international expert committee on diabetes recommended diagnosing prediabetes when a person’s fasting blood glucose level is 100 mg/dl, and the American Diabetes Association (ADA) has adopted this recommendation. On the basis of research showing that maintaining near-normal blood glucose levels significantly reduces the risk of diabetes-related complications, both the ADA and the American College of Endocrinology (ACE) have established recommended goals for blood glucose control for most adults with diabetes (see ). These goals may be modified for certain populations. For example, the goals for blood glucose control are typically lower for women with diabetes who are pregnant. For children and the elderly, particularly those who take as part of their treatment plan, the goals may be higher for safety reasons. Because each person’s situation is different, it is important to work with your diabetes care team to set individualized blood glucose goals that are right for you. Two significant studies that paved the way toward today’s blood glucose goals are the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT) and the United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS). Both demonstrated that the closer blood glucose levels are kept to normal, the less likely a person with diabetes is to develop complications. The DCCT followed 1,441 people with Type 1 diabetes for an average of about seven years. The subjects were divided into two groups: the “conventional” treatment group, and the “intensive” treatment group. While the group that was treated intensively did not achieve normal, nondiabetic blood glucose levels, they were able to achieve an average blood glucose level of 155 mg/dl. The conventionally treated group’s blood glucose level averaged 231 mg/dl. During the study period, the intensively treated group had an approximate 60% reduction of risk for neuropathy, nephropathy, and retinopathy. Intensive therapy not only delayed the onset of complications but it also slowed the progression of complications in those who already had them, regardless of age, sex, or duration of diabetes. The UKPDS examined the effects of varying levels of blood glucose control in 5,102 individuals with Type 2 diabetes, who were followed for an average of 10 years. The intensively treated group achieved an average blood glucose level of 150 mg/dl, while the conventionally treated group’s average blood glucose levels were approximately 177 mg/dl. In this study, intensive blood glucose control resulted in a 25% reduction of risk for neuropathy, nephropathy, and retinopathy. Furthermore, the study concluded that for every percentage drop in glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), there was a 35% reduction in the risk of complications. As these studies make clear, it is worth the effort to take steps to control your blood glucose, but how do you do that? And how do you know if you have hyperglycemia in the first place? The best way to identify hyperglycemia is to routinely monitor your blood glucose levels on a schedule determined by you and your health-care team and to get regular HbA1c tests, also on a schedule agreed on by you and your health-care team (usually two to four times a year). That’s because hyperglycemia may not cause any symptoms until blood glucose levels are much higher than recommended ranges. So just because you feel OK doesn’t necessarily mean your blood glucose level is well controlled. When they do occur, symptoms of hyperglycemia may include frequent urination, hunger, dry mouth, thirst, blurred vision, numbness or tingling in the hands and feet, decreased sexual function, and fatigue. All of these symptoms should prompt immediate action, starting with checking your blood glucose level with your meter to see if it’s high. What you do next will depend in large part on how you normally treat your diabetes. Because regimens for treating diabetes vary widely, there is no “one size fits all” plan for treating hyperglycemia. If you currently treat your Type 2 diabetes with meal planning and exercise, for example, you may be instructed to add several minutes to your usual exercise routine or to decrease your carbohydrate intake at your next meal when your blood glucose level is high. If you have Type 1 diabetes and use an , you may be instructed to take more insulin (possibly via syringe or insulin pen), and your diabetes care team will teach you how to determine how much insulin to take based on your blood glucose level. It’s extremely important to work with your diabetes care team to develop an individualized hyperglycemia action plan for you. No matter what type of diabetes you have or how you treat it, part of your hyperglycemia action plan will likely be more frequent , at least temporarily, to help determine why your blood glucose is high and what you can do to avoid future episodes of hyperglycemia. Indeed, prevention is the best and most effective way to treat hyperglycemia. Many variables, some of which are described here, can upset the delicate balance that is necessary for the best diabetes control. When dealing with diabetes, you will inevitably experience some if not all of the following issues. If you eat more food than is balanced with your physical activity and, in some cases, diabetes medicines, your blood glucose level may rise above your goal range. Carbohydrate-containing foods directly affect your blood glucose level after eating, so reviewing the amount of carbohydrate in your meals and snacks may be helpful in determining the cause of hyperglycemia. Carefully reading on food products and measuring portions will help you to meet your carbohydrate goals. On packaged foods, the total carbohydrate per serving is listed on the Nutrition Facts panel of the label. Meals that are high in fat may contribute to prolonged elevations in blood glucose after eating. Working with a registered dietitian, preferably one with experience in diabetes management, can be helpful in fine-tuning your meal-planning and skills. If you experience hyperglycemia in spite of sticking to your meal plan most of the time, it may indicate that the medicines included in your diabetes regimen need adjusting. If this is the case, undereating will not help lower your blood glucose level; you should consult your physician. Exercise usually lowers blood glucose levels because it improves your cells’ sensitivity to insulin and helps cells burn glucose for energy. But if your blood glucose level is high before you exercise, it may go higher during exercise. When you begin exercising, your liver pumps out extra glucose to fuel your muscles. If your body has too little insulin circulating in the bloodstream to allow the cells to use the extra glucose, your blood glucose level will rise. High blood glucose levels with exercise can also be a sign that you are working too hard and your body is under stress. If this is the case, you need to slow down and gradually work up to a more strenuous level of activity. For people with Type 1 diabetes, the ADA advises avoiding exercise if fasting blood glucose levels are above 250 mg/dl and are present in blood or urine; caution should be used if blood glucose levels are above 300 mg/dl and no ketones are present. People with Type 2 diabetes may wish to consult their diabetes care team for individual recommendations. Insulin and diabetes pills are taken to lower blood glucose levels, so forgetting a dose, taking the wrong dose, or taking the right dose at the wrong time can contribute to hyperglycemia. If you develop hyperglycemia, here are some questions you may want to ask yourself regarding your medicine(s): Double-check to make sure your dose was accurate. Sometimes different doses of the same oral diabetes medicine or insulin are prescribed at different times of day. Did the correct dose coincide with the correct time? It is only human to forget things from time to time, even parts of your daily routine. If you think you may have forgotten to take your medicine, ask yourself if you specifically remember taking it. Can you backtrack to determine if you took it? If you seem to forget to take your medicine regularly, look for patterns: Are you having difficulty remembering a certain dose? If so, you may want to brainstorm some ways to remember it, such as setting an alarm for dose time or posting a note to yourself in a place you can’t miss. Insulin pumps generally have a review screen that allows you to see whether doses have been delivered. Check the expiration date on your medicine to see if it is still good. Most pills have a long shelf life, but insulin does not. In addition, the expiration date on the insulin packaging is for unopened, refrigerated vials, disposable pens, or pen cartridges. Once opened, most vials of insulin last for 28 days, but many pens and pen cartridges are good for only 7, 10, or 14 days. Pump users should change their infusion set and the insulin in the pump reservoir every two to three days. These limits should be noted in the insulin package insert. If you’re not sure how long your opened container of insulin will last, ask a member of your diabetes care team or your pharmacist or call the manufacturer’s customer service number. Is your technique for taking your medicine adequate? If you take pills, be sure you’re taking them at the right time of day. Some pills must be taken right before meals to work effectively; others do not. If you take insulin by pen or syringe, review your injection technique with your diabetes care team. You should be aware that if you switch to a different syringe or insulin pen or from one to the other, the injection technique may differ. Insulin, as well as oral medicines, can lose potency if exposed to heat, cold, or moisture. Your best bet is usually to store opened containers of medicines you are currently using at room temperature. Unopened pills can also be stored at room temperature. Insulin that has not been opened should be stored in the refrigerator. Be careful not to place insulin in the particularly cold areas of the refrigerator — typically the meat compartment and at the backs of the main shelves — where it may freeze. If you use an insulin syringe or insulin pen, do you always use the same size needle? Some people find that a change in the needle length can disrupt their control. If you use an insulin pump, review the set-up of your infusion set with your diabetes care team to assure accurate insulin delivery. If you order pump supplies by mail, double-check your order when it arrives to make sure you received the correct supplies. Using a different size catheter or a different tubing length than usual may change the amount of priming necessary. (All pump users should have alternative methods of insulin delivery on hand should their pump malfunction or stop delivering insulin for any reason.) In addition, check your injection or infusion sites periodically. If toughening or scarring of the skin is present, this may affect absorption of your insulin. If you use an insulin pump, is the battery power sufficient? Avoid going to sleep at night or becoming preoccupied with other things when your battery is low. Be attentive to low battery warning alarms, and change your batteries promptly when they sound. Don’t wait until you’ve used the last drop of energy in your battery. Are you taking any other medicines that could affect your blood glucose level? Certain types of drugs — including prescription drugs, over-the-counter drugs, and herbal preparations — may contribute to hyperglycemia. Common prescription drugs that have a tendency to increase blood glucose levels include corticosteroids (used to treat inflammation) and thiazide (used to treat high blood pressure). Any time you receive a prescription for a new drug, whether for a diabetes-related condition or not, ask your doctor if it may have any effects on your blood glucose levels. In addition, tell your health-care team about any over-the-counter medicines or alternative therapies you use so that together you can determine whether those substances or practices are having an effect on your blood glucose control. During periods of stress, the body releases so-called stress hormones, which cause a rise in blood glucose level. In the short term, this gives the body the extra energy it needs to cope with the stress. But if a person doesn’t have adequate insulin circulating in his bloodstream to enable his cells to use the extra energy, the result will be hyperglycemia. And if stress becomes chronic, hyperglycemia can also become chronic. Stress hormones may be released during physical, mental, and emotional stresses. Injury, illness, infection, and surgery are some examples of physical stresses that often cause hyperglycemia. In fact, hyperglycemia may be a clue that an otherwise symptomless infection is present. Resolving hyperglycemia caused by physical stress generally involves both treating the underlying cause and treating the hyperglycemia itself with changes to the usual diabetes treatment regimen. Because everyone can expect to be ill at some point, people with diabetes are encouraged to work out a sick-day plan in advance with their diabetes care team. Your sick-day plan should have specifics on what to eat and drink when you’re sick, over-the-counter products that are safe to use, as well as details on taking your usual medicines and adding supplemental insulin if needed. It should also indicate when to call your health-care provider. Psychological stresses such as difficulties with relationships, job pressures, financial strain, and even concerns about self-worth can contribute to hyperglycemia. If these issues become overwhelming, decreased attention to the diabetes treatment plan may also contribute to hyperglycemia. Learning stress-reduction techniques may help over the long term, and your diabetes care team may be able to help you identify other resources that can help you deal with feelings of overwhelming stress. Hormones other than stress hormones can affect blood glucose levels, as well. Premenopausal women may experience higher-than-usual blood glucose levels about a week prior to menstruation, when levels of progesterone, estrogen, and other hormones involved in ovulation are changing. In addition, some women find that they have a tendency to eat more during this phase of the menstrual cycle, which may further increase blood glucose levels. It can be useful to track your menstrual cycle along with your blood glucose levels to determine whether your cycle is affecting your blood glucose levels and to learn to make adjustments to your diabetes regimen when needed. During perimenopause, which can last for several years before the complete cessation of menstruation, the menstrual cycle becomes less and less consistent. This can upset the balance of blood glucose control due to the unpredictability of hormonal levels. Pregnancy hormones also affect blood glucose control. In fact, insulin adjustments are often necessary every 7–10 days during pregnancy, especially during the second and third trimesters, to adjust for changes in hormone levels as well as for the weight increases that come with pregnancy. Because hyperglycemia can contribute to a number of complications during pregnancy, close monitoring of blood glucose control is essential during and ideally before pregnancy. In men with diabetes, low testosterone levels may contribute to increased insulin resistance, which can contribute to hyperglycemia. However, while testosterone replacement therapy has become a topic of great interest among both consumers and medical professionals, few studies have examined the long-term effects of testosterone replacement. Men concerned about low testosterone should seek individual guidance from their doctors. Some people with diabetes allow their blood glucose levels to run higher than recommended because they are afraid of developing hypoglycemia (low blood glucose). This fear is certainly normal, since hypoglycemia can cause a person to lose bodily control, but a better response to this fear is to learn to prevent episodes of hypoglycemia while keeping your blood glucose levels in the best possible control. If fear is causing you to let your blood glucose level run high, talk with your diabetes care team to work out a plan that will help you avoid both lows and highs. Another potential cause of hyperglycemia is the intentional or deliberate omission of insulin doses. This behavior is often linked to the presence of an eating disorder. Omitting needed insulin allows blood glucose levels to run high enough to cause the body to eliminate glucose through the urine and therefore decrease calorie absorption. This practice can enable a person to control his weight and, over time, to lose weight, which may be the desired result. However, repeated omission of insulin can lead to diabetes complications, worsen existing complications, and even lead to coma and death. If you or someone you know is intentionally omitting insulin doses as a means of weight control, it is urgent that you seek help from your diabetes care team or a qualified mental health professional. Eating disorders can be treated; left untreated, they can cause devastating health consequences. Managing hyperglycemia is important both to avoid long-term complications and to avoid the acute hyperglycemic states known as ketoacidosis and hyperosmolar hyperglycemia. These disorders can occur in people with Type 1 diabetes as well as those with Type 2 diabetes, although the risk of ketoacidosis is higher among people with Type 1 and the risk of hyperosmolar hyperglycemia is higher among elderly people with Type 2. Ketoacidosis is characterized by high blood glucose levels (over 250 mg/dl), the presence of ketones in the blood or urine, and dehydration. In hyperosmolar hyperglycemia, blood glucose levels are typically extremely high (over 600 mg/dl), and small amounts of ketones may be detectable in blood or urine. Emergency care in the hospital may be needed to reverse ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar hyperglycemia. Infection, which, as noted earlier, causes the release of stress hormones, is the most common precipitating factor in the development of both problems. An interruption in insulin delivery from a pump or taking inadequate amounts of insulin by pen or syringe is also a common underlying factor in the development of ketoacidosis. Other factors that may lead to acute hyperglycemia are , alcohol abuse, pancreatitis, heart attack, trauma, and certain drug therapies. Preventing episodes of severe hyperglycemia involves knowing the causes and symptoms of hyperglycemia, monitoring blood glucose levels often enough to catch hyperglycemia in its early stages, and having a plan to deal with hyperglycemia should it occur. The fact that infection is what commonly leads to ketoacidosis and hyperosmolar hyperglycemia underscores the importance of discussing sick-day management with your diabetes care team before you become sick. The only way you can truly know your blood glucose level is to check it with your meter. You should discuss when and how often to monitor with your diabetes care team. A diabetes educator can help you determine the type of equipment that is best for you, as well as make sure you are familiar with how the equipment works. More important, with your doctor’s help, your diabetes educator can help you learn to self-manage your diabetes by working through the challenges of managing hyperglycemia. Keep in mind that even with your best efforts in managing your diabetes, you may still experience high blood glucose from time to time. But if your blood glucose levels remain higher than your treatment goals on a regular basis despite your attempts to follow your diabetes treatment plan, talk to your physician. You may need to update your plan to meet your diabetes control needs.

34605933-e998-4c4e-ad54-d9b4086e2cfd,"Use of Diabetes-Related Applications and Digital Health Tools by People With Diabetes and Their Health Care Providers St. Mark’s Hospital and St. Mark's Diabetes Center, Salt Lake City, UT Corresponding author: James J. Chamberlain, The proliferation of smartphones over the past decade has led to the development of a seemingly endless number of digital applications (apps) designed to improve users’ health and fitness. This article addresses the regulation of these apps and provides details about the apps most commonly used by patients in the primary care and diabetes settings. Those described in detail include the American Diabetes Association’s Standards of Care app, apps for blood glucose monitoring and tracking and continuous glucose monitoring, lifestyle apps, a glucagon use app, prescription cost-saving apps, and apps for do-it-yourself automated insulin delivery. The first Apple iPhone was released in June 2007, and the Apple App Store became available 1 year later, offering 500 applications (apps). Worldwide, >3 billion people now have smartphones (), and ∼500 million people are using mobile apps for diet, exercise, and chronic disease management (). In 2019, there were 2.2 million apps available for Apple’s iOS operating system and 2.6 million for Android smartphones (), with >2 billion app downloads (). Consumers worldwide spent $120 billion on apps in 2019, including $1.5 billion on health and fitness apps, which was up 130% from 2017. One health app (Fitbit) was the sixth most downloaded app in the United States in 2019. There are now >40,000 health care apps available online from both the App Store and Google Play (,). The term mobile health (mHealth) seems to have first been used by Robert Istepanian in 2005, who described “emerging mobile communications and network technologies for health care” (). With the explosion of health and fitness apps and their rapid increase in use worldwide, the World Health Organization (WHO) decided to publish a statement in 2011 to better define mHealth technologies. The WHO adopted the mHealth definition used by the Global Observatory for eHealth in its worldwide survey on electronic health: “medical and public health practice supported by mobile devices, such as mobile phones, patient monitoring devices, personal digital assistants . . . and other wireless devices” (). This year, the European Association for the Study of Diabetes and the American Diabetes Association (ADA) jointly published a consensus report on diabetes digital app technology (). Their report focuses on the role of regulation in diabetes digital health apps, the accuracy of and clinical validation of diabetes apps, data on the safety and efficacy of diabetes apps, and recommendations to help resolve some of the deficiencies in the diabetes health app space. Diabetes apps focus on one or more diabetes self-management tasks such as blood glucose monitoring, medication or insulin dosing, obtaining diabetes or general health education, and tracking nutrition or physical activity. The Association of Diabetes Care & Education Specialists provides an app review library () as part of its technology initiative. This resource offers reviews from an independent organization, DHX Laboratories, which assesses apps on their security and privacy, operability, usability, functionality, performance, data management capabilities, and the quality of the behavior science behind the app. Quantitative trust scores with direct links for app download are available through this platform. The data-sharing capabilities of apps focused on glucose data may provide further insight in diabetes management, providing health care providers (HCPs) with an easy way to visualize patterns to inform medication adjustments. Information on the most widely used diabetes apps is provided below (). The European Medicines Agency (EMA) and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) are responsible for pharmaceutical regulations for traditional health products and software. In the European Union, the European Commission regulates medical devices under the standards set by the E.U. Medical Devices Directive, and each member country maintains its national pharmaceutical regulatory authority. The EMA classifies mobile apps as medical devices if they are used “specifically for diagnostic and/or therapeutic purposes.” These apps include those used for diagnosing, preventing, monitoring, and alleviating or treating disease (). Devices that meet the standards set by the Medical Device Regulation policy standards (more recent guidelines that expand those in the Medical Device Directive) are given the CE (Conformité Européene) mark. This process has generally had fewer obstacles compared with the device approval process of the FDA (). In the United States, the FDA regulates medical devices and pharmaceuticals, including some medical mobile apps. Higher-risk apps such as those that calculate insulin dosing are regulated by the FDA, whereas low-risk medical apps that offer only diabetes support and health tracking are not regulated (). Digital therapeutics, or digiceuticals, are clinically validated health technologies intended to treat a medical or psychological condition, with a focus on improving clinical outcomes. These apps require regulatory approval from the FDA similar to prescription drugs (). The FDA published a Digital Health Innovation Action Plan with the goals of providing clarity on medical software, launching a precertification program for digital health technology oversight (referred to as the “FDA Pre-Cert for Software”), and building agency expertise. This action plan program offers a pathway for the development and potential approval of safe and effective, high-quality digital health tools (). With the rapid expansion of digital health apps have come both potential benefits and challenges for primary care providers (PCPs), who must be familiar with commonly used apps to advise patients with diabetes on their use of these products. There are limited randomized controlled trials, cohort studies, or case-control studies on app-based interventions and their effects on health behaviors and outcomes. Apps are constantly being updated, and this evolution limits the ability to carry out long-term, well-conducted studies. There are also obstacles for clinicians with respect to adequate education and training, as well as issues with app accuracy, clinical validity, and quality of information. Technological challenges such as interoperability on Apple iOS or Android platforms, frequent app updates and revisions, lack of standardization of information, and variable shareability of data are additional barriers. Other concerns for HCPs include the endorsement or recommendation of specific apps by professional organizations and the quality of data and privacy security with app use. However, there are also benefits of using apps in diabetes care. Health apps allow PCPs to communicate about glycemic data and improve health outcomes and quality of care for their patients with diabetes in ways that were not previously possible. There are financial incentives for spending time interpreting mobile app data. Interpretation of >72 hours of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) data collected via mobile app or receiver can be billed monthly using Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) code 95251 (). Since 1 January 2018, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services has allowed eligible practitioners to bill for reimbursement for time spent interpreting and collecting health data generated by patients remotely. These data must be recorded and transmitted to the provider, with a minimum of 30 minutes of time spent outside of the patient visit, and billed using CPT 99091 (). , which summarizes details of some of the most commonly used apps for diabetes, includes information, where appropriate, on specific costs and billing codes. The ADA first published its Clinical Practice Recommendations in 1988. Now known as the Standards of Medical Care in Diabetes, these guidelines are published each January in the journal and made available for free online (). The Standards of Care is a comprehensive guide to diabetes treatment, therapeutic goals, and tools to evaluate quality of care. An abridged version of the Standards of Care for PCPs is also published annually in the journal and made available for free online (). The ADA now also offers a Standards of Care app, available from the App Store and Google Play. A Web app is also available for online use (). The app provides access to all 16 sections of the Standards of Care. In addition, it includes interactive tools that provide easy, evidence-based decision support for HCPs. These interactive tools provide recommendations for hypertension treatment in patients with diabetes, drug class-specific information (i.e., efficacy; hypoglycemia risk; weight change effects, cardiovascular and renal effects, cost, route of administration, and other important clinical considerations), recommendations for glucose-lowering medication selection based on a patient’s individual clinical characteristics, practical advice for intensifying from oral to injectable therapies, help setting A1C targets based on a patient’s characteristics and preferences, guidelines for diabetes screening in asymptomatic adults, and a tool for entering patients’ blood test results to help clinicians diagnose diabetes and identify prediabetes. There is also a general information section providing quick access to the summary of the latest revisions to the Standards of Care. A comprehensive section on improving care and promoting health in certain populations also adds a tremendous amount of practical information for HCPs, including strategies for caring for patients with food insecurity, homelessness, migrant or seasonal employment, and language barriers. Finally, the app provides a thorough review of the classification of diabetes, including type 1 diabetes, type 2 diabetes, cystic fibrosis–related diabetes, post-transplant diabetes, monogenic diabetes syndromes (e.g., categories of maturity-onset diabetes in the young), diabetes from pancreatic disease, and gestational diabetes. Several blood glucose meters with Bluetooth capability are available that can connect and transmit data to a smartphone app. The OneTouch Verio Flex meter synchronizes data automatically to the OneTouch Reveal mobile app, which is available from the App Store and Google Play. The app allows patients to track blood glucose averages; enter food, medication dosing, and activity data; set personalized lifestyle goals; share their data with others, including HCPs; get alerts for repeated high or low blood glucose readings; and integrate data into the Apple Health app (). The Accu-Chek Guide, Guide Me, and Aviva Connect meters can all be paired wirelessly with the mySugr app, also available from the App Store and Google Play. This app allows users to enter diet and medication information, provides glucose analysis and motivational feedback, shows predicted A1C, and can integrate information into the Apple Health and Google Fit apps (). The iHealth Smart meter can be paired with the iHealth Gluco-Smart app, available from the App Store and Google Play. Similar to the other apps, this one provides statistical glucose data, allows users to enter diet and activity information, and can export data to HCPs and family members (). One Drop provides a Bluetooth-enabled glucose meter that synchronizes with the One Drop mobile app, available from the App Store and Google Play. The app tracks and analyzes blood glucose data, medications, food, and activity levels. Real-time decision support is provided based on blood glucose readings, and personalized coaching is available to users. Data can be synchronized with many other health apps, including Apple Health, GoogleFit, FitBit, and Dexcom, among others (). (See for specific cost information.) Use of the One Drop system resulted in a 0.96% improvement in A1C levels among active users of both the app and a coaching program during 3 months in 93 patients with type 2 diabetes (). Other apps allow patients to enter diabetes health information manually or connect to glucose meters via audio jacks and charging ports but do not connect wirelessly to meters. Health2Sync is an app that allows patients to input information such as blood glucose and blood pressure readings, daily activities (i.e., food, exercise, and medications), and weight (). The app then provides comprehensive statistical glucose information and blood pressure and weight trends. The app is available from the App Store and Google Play. The BeatO SMART (for iPhone and Android) and BeatO Curv (for Android only) meters connect to smartphones via the 3.5 mm audio jack or charging port. The data are then synchronized to the BeatO app available from the App Store and Google Play. The app provides glucose trends and statistics, connects users with in-house specialists, tracks fitness levels, and provides a digital store for diabetes-friendly food products (). Patients’ data can also be shared with family, friends, and HCPs. Dario Health provides a meter that connects to smartphones via charging ports and synchronizes with the Dario Smart Diabetes Management app that is available on the App Store and Google Play. This diabetes management system requires a subscription, some portion of which may be covered by insurance. (See for specific cost information.) The app records and tracks blood glucose levels, carbohydrate intake, insulin and medication dosing, and physical activity. It also provides a 500,000-item food library and provides global positioning system (GPS) location identification in the event of a diabetic emergency (). Data can be shared with HCPs and others. The Dario system showed a reduction in high blood glucose events (180–400 mg/dL) by 19.3% (from 28.4 to 22.9%) and an increase in normal glucose readings (80–120 mg/dL) by 11.3% (from 25.6 to 28.5%) with use of the app during 2017 in 17,156 people with type 2 diabetes (). Glooko is a diabetes data management software platform that is compatible with roughly 100 different diabetes devices, including glucose meters, insulin pumps, CGM systems, fitness apps, and smart insulin pens. Patients can download the Glooko Mobile app to a smartphone from the App Store or Google Play. They can then synchronize or upload devices to the mobile app to see data from multiple diabetes devices in one place. They can log food and activity data, and a 500,000-item food database is included. Patients can export reports to their HCP (). In HCP offices, compatible devices can be uploaded to a computer (PC or Mac platform) using a synchronizing infrared or USB cable and Glooko Uploader software. Many of these glucose-reporting apps and Web-based reporting systems allow patients to export glucose reports to their HCP or download reports from websites as PDF files that can then be incorporated into most commonly used electronic medical record (EMR) systems. This feature enables HCPs to look back with patients at previous glucose statistics to assess progress and set ongoing glycemic targets and other therapeutic goals. Dexcom CGM mobile apps record interstitial glucose data every 5 minutes and allow users to set customizable alerts and share their data by inviting others to use Dexcom Follow to remotely track their glucose. HCPs can engage patients’ family members and caregivers by teaching CGM users about these Follow features. Both the Dexcom CGM app and Dexcom Follow are also available for compatible smartwatches. Dexcom offers separate apps for its G6, G5, and G4 Platinum CGM systems, and are all available from the App Store and Google Play. Dexcom Clarity is an app for Dexcom CGM users that allows them to review their glucose trends and patterns in interactive reports that are available to share with their health care team either by using a “share code” or by downloading and sending reports via e-mail. Data from each user are continuously and automatically uploaded to Dexcom Clarity from the Dexcom CGM app, and the Clarity app is compatible with all Dexcom CGM systems. The reports provide clinically relevant statistics with suggestions for possible changes for both patients and HCPs. Reports can be viewed, saved, and printed for clinic use and CGM interpretation is billable (using CPT code 95251) under private insurers and Medicare. The Clarity app sends users a weekly summary with glucometric data, including average glucose, time in range, glycemic patterns, and trends. Patients can also quickly access their data to view their average, time above range, time below range, hypoglycemia risk, and estimated A1C (called the “glucose management indicator”). They can add additional personal data such as information on exercise, carbohydrates consumed, illness, alcohol intake, stress, or menstrual cycle (). The FreeStyle Libre 14-day system offers a mobile app called LibreLink. This app allows users to scan their sensor using near-field communication (NFC) to wirelessly transmit data to NFC-capable smartphones for blood glucose readings up to the past 8 hours as well as trend arrows.

The BlueStar app by Welldoc, available from the App Store and Google Play, combines data and information on blood glucose, blood pressure, medication dosing, food, exercise, and sleep. The app tracks and analyzes users’ information using artificial intelligence–driven algorithms. Messages from the app health team become more individualized for each user over time and are designed to prompt real-time action. On-demand diabetes education is also available to users. The app is integrated with >300 other apps, devices, and EMR systems (). Users can only get the app by obtaining a code from their participating employer or health plan and entering the code into the app. Eli Lilly released its glucagon mobile app for use on Apple devices in September 2012 and on Android devices in July 2015. This app was designed for use by insulin users and their caregivers, as well as HCPs. It is a tool that teaches glucagon injection technique, with a step-by-step, interactive audiovisual tutorial featuring a simulation to practice glucagon administration. The app allows for reminders to users to repeat the practice and preparation for glucagon use. Users can enter their glucagon kit expiration date and location of kit and get reminders for reordering. The app also contains drug safety information and indications for glucagon use, as well as a link to full prescribing information for HCPs. The app was last updated in July 2018 (). The price of insulin for patients and health plans doubled between 2012 and 2016, from $2,864 to $5,705, according to a report from the nonprofit Health Care Cost Institute (). Many patients with diabetes have looked for ways to reduce costs not only of insulin, but also of noninsulin diabetes drugs, glucagon, and glucose test strips. Several commonly used prescription cost-saving apps have helped patients save significantly on their medications and related costs. GoodRx and RxSaver are two popular ones. The GoodRx app is the number-1 free medical app available from the App Store and Google Play (). It allows users to search for drugs and supplies and compare prices at >70,000 U.S. pharmacies. The app constantly gathers current prices and available discounts and provides users with anticipated costs from local pharmacies. GoodRx coupons can save users up to 80% on prescription costs and can be printed from the GoodRx website or displayed to the pharmacy via the mobile app. The average GoodRx customer saves $355/year on prescription costs (). Patients can also track prices and get automatic alerts on potential savings for their specific drugs and supplies. The RxSaver app by RetailMeNot is another popular prescription cost-saving app. It functions similarly to GoodRx in that it allows users to search by drug name and compare prices at various pharmacies near them. The app then provides a coupon for prescriptions offering up to 80% savings. Users can print coupons or show them to the pharmacy via the mobile app. Patients can save their prescription details in the “My Meds” section, making it easier to access coupons and keep an accurate personal drug list (). Some patients have built their own DIY apps for sensor-augmented pump therapy. These apps, such as Loop, OpenAPS/Nightscout, and AndroidAPS, work with an insulin pump or pod and real-time CGM system using a controller and an algorithm to automate insulin delivery (,). Detailed information for the required components and instructions for building and using these apps are available on their respective websites. Although these automated systems do not currently have FDA approval, there are ongoing efforts in progress to get them, and their apps, approved. The FDA has safety concerns about these apps being used by hackers to interfere with insulin delivery, although there is little information to substantiate this claim. Consumer demands for mobile phone control of insulin delivery devices continue to increase (). In 2018, the Diabetes Technology Society developed a consensus for cybersecurity and new industry standards known as DTMoST (Diabetes Technology Society Mobile Platform Controlling a Diabetes Device Security and Safety Standard) to promote the safe control of diabetes devices via mobile apps. The DTMoST addresses concerns about malicious hacking and interruptions in device connectivity (). Mobile apps increase the accessibility of data for HCPs because patients may access data from their smartphone even if they do not have their blood glucose meter with them during clinic visits. New connected diabetes tools such as app-enabled insulin pumps, app-enabled CGM systems, and smart insulin pens continue to become available. The diabetes app space will thus continue to change and develop with frequent updates and new products. Apps will become more customizable with incorporation of machine-based algorithms to provide customized treatment recommendations and remote health coaching.

a68c9525-b512-4ba9-802f-facf8c09e4ce,"Continuous Glucose Monitoring As a Behavior Modification Tool Division of Endocrinology, George Washington University, Washington, DC Division of Endocrinology, George Washington University, Washington, DC Real-time continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) use may lead to behavioral modifications in food selection and physical activity, but there are limited data on the utility of CGM in facilitating lifestyle changes. This article describes an 18-item survey developed to explore whether patients currently using CGM believe the technology has caused them to change their behavior. ≫ Ninety percent of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) users felt that its use contributed to a healthier lifestyle. ≫ Forty-seven percent of CGM users reported being more likely to go for a walk or do physical activity if they saw a rise in their blood glucose. ≫ Eighty-seven percent of CGM users felt that they modified their food choices based on CGM use. ≫ More research is needed into CGM as a behavior modification tool for diet and exercise in individuals with diabetes or prediabetes. In the United States, an estimated 30.3 million people (9.4% of the population) have diabetes (). A recent report noted that economic costs of diabetes increased by 26% from 2012 to 2017 (). Macro- and microvascular complications from uncontrolled diabetes and multiple psychosocial factors contribute not only to the cost of diabetes, but also to quality of life deficits for those living with the disease (). Exercise has been shown to improve blood glucose control, reduce cardiovascular risk factors, contribute to weight loss, and improve well-being (,). Even low-intensity exercise improves glycemic control over 24 hours (,) and lowers A1C levels regardless of weight loss (). Thus, guidelines from the American Diabetes Association (ADA) and other professional societies recommend that adults with type 1 or type 2 diabetes perform at least 150 minutes/week of moderate- to vigorous-intensity aerobic physical activity (,). Despite these guidelines, 36.1% of U.S. adults with diabetes report having no physical activity within the previous 30 days (), and how to motivate patients with diabetes to attempt regular exercise remains an open question. One study on motivation for exercise reported that exercise expectations are formed individually in accordance with what most people recognize as an “appropriate” level of physical activity and that there is “potential for improving exercise management by stimulating intrinsic motivation” (). Similarly, food choices also affect glycemic control, and limiting carbohydrate consumption and choosing high-quality (i.e., high-fiber, low–glycemic index [GI]) foods may improve glucose levels because higher-GI foods cause greater glycemic responses (). However, data are mixed regarding the benefit of recommending low-GI foods (–). Current ADA dietary recommendations focus more on individualizing meal plans and conclude that, “there is not a one-size-fits-all eating pattern” for individuals with diabetes. The ADA no longer recommends specific total meal or daily carbohydrate intake levels, and there are mixed messages about low-GI diets (). Yet, the GI does provide a good summary of postprandial glycemia (,–) and, coupled with real-time continuous glucose monitoring (CGM), it may be a useful tool for patients to better understand meal-related glycemic fluctuations. Despite the controversy over food composition, most would generally agree that both food choices and physical activity affect glucose regulation, although responses may vary among individuals. Thus, what may be missing for individuals is direct feedback on their lifestyle choices. Real-time CGM captures nutritional intake and physical activity performance and may provide both positive and negative reinforcements of behavior, leading to sustained changes in lifestyle. However, there is limited literature on patients’ perceptions of how CGM influences their behavior. We conducted a survey of patients currently using CGM to assess their perceptions of how its use affects their lifestyle choices. The objective of this study was to evaluate whether patients with diabetes using CGM perceived that its use influences their food choices and physical activity. This study was reviewed and approved by the George Washington University institutional review board. We designed an 18-item questionnaire for current CGM users with any type of diabetes to determine their perceptions of how CGM affects their nutrition and physical activity choices. The survey asked questions about food choices, physical activity, and patients’ perception of change after using CGM (). Data were collected by paper survey at an academic endocrine center over a 6-month period. Patients were recruited on an as-seen basis and given the survey anonymously. Those who declined participation were not included. Demographic data included age, sex, reported A1C, insulin pump or multiple daily injection (MDI) insulin regimen use, type of CGM device used, and duration of CGM use. Responses to the survey were collated and analyzed by descriptive statistics using Excel (Microsoft Corp., Redmond, WA). Results are presented below as either number or percentage of patients. CGM questionnaire. Demographic questions included in the survey are not shown. A total of 40 participants completed the survey. Mean age was 36 years (range 19–68) and mean BMI was 27.8 kg/m (SD 5.2). Seventy-eight percent of the participants ( = 31) used an insulin pump. Mean reported A1C was 7.5% (range 5.5–9.9). Fifty-five percent of the participants ( = 22) used a Dexcom CGM device, 40% ( = 16) used a Medtronic device, and 5% ( = 2) did not provide information on the type of CGM system they used. Mean duration of CGM use was >3 years (range <3 months to >3 years) (). Eighty-seven percent of participants ( = 35) stated that their food choices changed after using CGM. Most participants either limited (15% [ = 6]) or never drank (67.5% [ = 27]) sugared beverages before CGM use. Regarding exclusion of cereals and rice from their diet, 45% of participants ( = 18) already excluded cereal before CGM use, and 55% ( = 22) made no changes in rice consumption after CGM use. On the other hand, 15% of participants ( = 6) and 22.5% of participants ( = 9) did exclude cereals and rice, respectively, after using CGM. When asked if they noticed how different food choices affected their blood glucose levels, 87.5% of participants ( = 35) reported that they did notice, 7.5% ( = 3) said they did not notice, and 5% ( = 2) were unsure. Half of the participants ( = 20) reported already reading nutrition labels for fiber content before CGM use, 15.0% ( = 6) felt that they started reading labels for fiber content after CGM use, 30% ( = 12) did not feel that CGM use led them to read labels for fiber content, and 5% ( = 2) were unsure. After CGM use, 42.5% of the participants ( = 17) felt that they were more active, 27.5% ( = 11) reported already being active before CGM use, 22.5% ( = 9) said they made no change in activity as a result of CGM use, and 7.5% ( = 3) were unsure. Increased likelihood of going for a walk or doing physical activity after a meal if CGM showed rising blood glucose levels was reported by 47.5% of participants ( = 19), 35% ( = 14) said they made no such change based on CGM, 12.5% ( = 5) already took such action before using CGM, and 5% ( = 2) were unsure. Overall 90% ( = 36) reported that CGM use contributed to a healthier lifestyle (). Education to support patient self-management and behavior modification is widely recognized as a cornerstone of diabetes care. The empowerment approach to diabetes care encompasses three guiding principles: ) diabetes is a patient-managed disease and patients make the majority of daily decisions; ) the patient-provider relationship is one of collaboration; and ) when patients set their own self-management priorities, they are more likely to be motivated to initiate and sustain necessary behavior changes (). Several studies about chronic disease management have shown that patient engagement enhances results (). Research has also shown that structured, frequent glucose monitoring (seven to eight times per day) improves glycemic control (). Real-time CGM provides a full picture of glucose trends, especially overnight and after meals, that may prompt positive behavior changes (). In two recent, large studies involving people with type 1 diabetes, CGM use improved glycemic parameters. In the DIaMonD study, participants using real-time CGM showed increased time in the target glucose range (70–180 mg/dL) of 1.3 additional hours (+76 min), a 4% decrease in overall glycemic variability, and a 40% reduction in severe hyperglycemia (>300 mg/dL) (). The GOLD study also showed decreased standard deviation of blood glucose with CGM (68.49 vs 77.23 mg/dL,  <0.001), as well as decreased mean amplitude of glycemic excursions (). However, data are limited regarding specifically how CGM improves glycemic variability in those not taking insulin with meals and what aspects of healthy behaviors CGM use may influence and thus improve glycemic control. Even the most recent CGM studies in type 1 and type 2 diabetes focused on A1C improvement and decreasing hypoglycemia but did not assess nutrition or exercise changes around CGM use (–). Nonetheless, CGM has become more commonly used to study the impacts of physical activity, food, and medication on glycemia. One study highlighted the benefit of sustained glycemic control with low-intensity exercise using CGM (). Another study used CGM to show that walking after meals was more beneficial to average 24-hour glucose levels than 45 minutes of continuous daily walking (), and a more recent study in those at risk for developing diabetes found that moderate postmeal walking significantly improves 24-hour glycemic control (). Without specific instruction on exercise, 47% of our survey participants noted that they were more likely to go for a walk after meals, an action that has been shown to improve the daily glycemic profile. Similarly, CGM has been used to show the impact of specific foods and dietary choices. One study, for example, showed improved glycemic control with brown versus white rice and even more benefit with the consumption of glutinous brown rice (). A more recent study demonstrated that a low-carbohydrate breakfast improved glycemic variability over 24 hours (). Eighty-seven percent of our patients noticed glucose changes from their food choices. However, many participants had already omitted or limited certain foods before using CGM. We believe this is likely because of the duration of their disease. We hypothesis that CGM could have an even greater impact on food choices if used sooner after diagnosis. Despite CGM becoming a more common means of assessing the effects of dietary inventions or exercise, the use of CGM to provide real-time feedback as part of interventions has been limited. As we have discussed previously (), only one study has been performed using real-time CGM in an intervention to increase physical activity, and another study used blinded CGM coupled with counseling on the resulting CGM data to bring about improvement in physical activity (,). Research is even more limited on the use of CGM in interventions addressing the processes of behavior change such as goal-setting and self-efficacy with regard to physical activity (). Research is also scarce with regard to CGM coupled with diet interventions, and there has been only one small pilot study looking at the use of real-time CGM with a low-GI diet (). As discussed earlier, the recent large studies of CGM in type 1 diabetes and studies in which patients with type 2 diabetes had access to real-time glucose data (either through real-time or intermittent flash CGM technology) have focused on A1C and frequency of hypoglycemia (,), lack any assessment of nutrition or activity, and have been performed with patients using MDI insulin regimens or insulin pumps. There has not been a study involving patients who are either not on insulin or only using basal insulin since our publication in 2011 showing initial A1C improvement and a sustained glycemic benefit with no escalation of medications at 12 months with the use of serial intermittent real-time CGM (). However, we, too, failed to assess lifestyle modification in that study. CGM technology continues to advance, and the improved accuracy and calibration-free options now available make it more appealing for general use. However, research into how CGM use affects lifestyle behaviors continues to be lacking, especially in patients not using insulin. A major limitation of this study is that we did not ascertain participants’ type or duration of diabetes. We focused only on CGM use, duration of CGM use, and method of insulin delivery. CGM use among patients with type 2 diabetes at our academic center was almost nonexistent during the study period, although such use is now growing with newer flash CGM systems and improved real-time CGM technology. Thus, we suspect that most, if not all, survey participants had type 1 diabetes and a long duration of disease because the average age was 36 years, and 50% of participants had been using CGM for more than 2 years. With increasing CGM use among people with type 2 diabetes, it would be interesting to study the perspectives of individuals in this population using either real-time or “flash” intermittent scan CGM devices, as well as the perspectives of people with more recently diagnosed type 1 diabetes using CGM. The three pillars of diabetes management are diet, medication, and exercise, and all significantly affect glycemic control. What remains to be shown is how CGM can serve as an adjunct to and enhance these interventions. Overall, 90% of participants in our survey felt that they had adopted a healthy lifestyle after using CGM, and a high percentage of the participants who used CGM reported food changes (i.e., limiting or excluding high-GI food such as white rice, cereals, and sugared beverages) and also increased physical activity, especially postprandially. The survey findings highlight the potential utility of CGM as a behavior modification tool in patients with diabetes and underscores the need for further research on CGM in patients with type 1 or type 2 diabetes or prediabetes.

9f99832a-e863-4936-b0dd-502ae643f187,"Strategies That Adolescents With Type 1 Diabetes Use in Relation to Exercise Department of Pediatrics, Division of Pediatric Endocrinology/Diabetology, Riley Children’s Hospital at Indiana University Health, Indiana University, Indianapolis, IN Corresponding author: Anna Neyman, Physical activity is an important element of type 1 diabetes management, and hypoglycemia is a known risk. There are few data on strategies adolescents use to mitigate this risk. We surveyed 66 adolescents with type 1 diabetes who were 12–18 years of age about blood glucose monitoring, carbohydrate intake, and insulin management before, during, and after exercise. The adolescents completed the International Physical Activity Questionnaire–Short Form and the Children’s Hypoglycemia Fear Survey. We found that adolescents with type 1 diabetes do not generally follow guidelines about glucose monitoring or about food and insulin adjustment around exercise. More targeted education and interventions are needed to improve adolescents’ uptake of recommended behaviors and improve outcomes. Exercise is an important component of managing type 1 diabetes. It has many important cardiovascular health benefits for children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes, including weight control and reduction of triglyceride and total cholesterol levels (). Physical activity also improves bone health () and sense of well-being (). Recent meta-analyses suggest that increases in physical activity can also be associated with A1C reductions (,). The American Diabetes Association (ADA), the International Society for Pediatric and Adolescent Diabetes (ISPAD), and many other organizations strongly encourage physical activity for children with type 1 diabetes (,). The ADA recommends that youth with type 1 diabetes follow the same recommendations given for healthy children, including engaging in at least 60 min of moderate- or vigorous-intensity physical activity per day (). Rates of physical activity for American youth are very low. Only about one-fourth of healthy adolescents get at least 60 minutes of physical activity per day (). Most children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes also do not meet physical activity recommendations, and some reports suggest that those with type 1 diabetes engage in less physical activity than their peers (,,). A recent study by Czenczek-Lewandowska et al. () found that this was true regardless of the method of insulin delivery used. There are significant barriers to physical activity in adolescents with type 1 diabetes, including fear of hypoglycemia () and hyperglycemia (). It is estimated that 10–20% of hypoglycemic episodes in pediatric patients with type 1 diabetes are associated with exercise (). The most commonly identified reason for severe hypoglycemia is exercise, and most severe episodes occur at night, frequently when the patient is sleeping (). Intensity and duration of exercise influences risk of hypoglycemia (). McMahon et al. () found that glucose requirements after afternoon exercise increase both shortly after exercise and then again 7–11 hours later. The latter time point puts individuals at risk for nocturnal hypoglycemia. Of interest, these researchers did not find this same biphasic pattern if exercise is done at noon (), suggesting that changing the timing of exercise can be a way to ameliorate the risk of hypoglycemia. Recommendations for ways to decrease exercise-related hypoglycemia risk are available. ADA and ISPAD recommendations for diabetes care around exercise start with checking blood glucose at least before, during, and after exercise (,). Additional blood glucose checks might be warranted in different situations (e.g., if performing significantly strenuous exercise) (,). Furthermore, management includes considering insulin regimen changes and/or increased carbohydrate intake (,). To decrease risk of hypoglycemia, both insulin pump users and those with a multiple daily injection (MDI) insulin regimen can decrease bolus insulin that is administered within a few hours of exercise, basing the percentage reduction on exercise type, intensity, and duration (,). In addition, basal insulin delivered via insulin pump can be reduced before exercise (lowering the basal infusion rate or disconnecting the pump) for periods of anticipated prolonged exercise. To decrease the risk of subsequent delayed nocturnal hypoglycemia, overnight basal insulin may also be decreased, for those using either an insulin pump or an MDI insulin regimen (,). Food intake can also be increased or additional carbohydrates can be eaten during prolonged activity (,). The ISPAD guidelines also recommend eating meals with both carbohydrate and protein content after exercise, to take advantage of the high insulin sensitivity resulting from exercise (). Although, as detailed above, there are various guidelines regarding how adolescents with type 1 diabetes should manage their insulin and carbohydrate intake in relation to exercise, there are few data about what behaviors adolescents actually carry out around exercise. A recent study by Roberts et al. () looked at behavior around physical activity in youths with type 1 diabetes who were 10–18 years of age, used an insulin pump, and exercised at least once per week. They found that, although the majority of participants did make an insulin adjustment at some point surrounding exercise, only 10% made an adjustment overnight, and they concluded that many youths were not adjusting their insulin regimen adequately for exercise. We wanted to understand the behavior of adolescents using either an MDI regimen or an insulin pump and to try to identify factors that correlate with their behavior. It is important to first understand adolescents’ current management strategies to plan new approaches to increase the time youths with type 1 diabetes spend exercising safely, which, as noted above, is an important component of diabetes management. We surveyed adolescents with type 1 diabetes about their insulin management, their physical activity, and the adaptive strategies they use to manage their diabetes around exercise. We also looked at whether their level of activity and fear of hypoglycemia influenced their insulin management practices in any way. We conducted a cross-sectional study in our academic medical center diabetes clinical practice. Adolescents between 12 and 18 years of age with type 1 diabetes were recruited in two clinic sites during routine visits. There were multiple physician and nurse practitioner clinical pediatric care providers at both sites. The Indiana University Institutional Review Board approved the study, and parents and adolescents provided informed consent and assent, respectively. Demographic data collected included sex, date of birth, and date of diagnosis. Participants’ height, weight, BMI, and A1C were abstracted from the medical record. BMI was compared with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) 2000 reference standards to determine scores and percentiles according to age and sex (). Participants completed three surveys during their visit, as outlined below. Most adolescents completed all questions, and the percentages reported are based on responses received. The International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) short form, validated in people 15–69 years of age, was used to assess activity (). The IPAQ consists of seven questions regarding physical activity in the past 7 days. It asks about type of activity (vigorous/moderate/walking) and length of time spent in that kind of activity. The answers are then converted into MET-minutes/week. There are three possible categorical scores (levels of physical activity), including low, moderate, and high. These correspond to meeting at least one of two criteria, which include either engaging in a certain level of intensity for a specified amount of time or a certain number of MET-minutes/week. These scores do not specifically correlate to the CDC recommendations of 60 minutes/day of activity. Two surveys (one for adolescents using an MDI regimen and one for those using an insulin pump) were developed for this study to assess adolescent insulin and carbohydrate management around exercise. Survey questions focused on habits related to blood glucose monitoring around exercise, carbohydrate intake around exercise, and insulin changes before, during, and after exercise. Many of the questions used a Likert scale ranging from 0 (never) to 4 (almost always). If a participant answered the question with more than one answer, such as for “typical time of day that you exercise,” then each answer was counted. We assessed fear of hypoglycemia and behaviors related to that fear using the Children’s Hypoglycemia Fear Survey (HFS) developed by Cox et al. (). The survey consists of 10 questions about behavior related to trying to reduce hypoglycemia and 15 questions related to worries that children can have about their blood glucose level being low. Each question is rated on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 0 (never) to 4 (almost always). Both the Behavior Subscale Scores and the Worry Subscale Scores are summed, and each is divided by the total number of questions in each category to get a mean behavior (HFS-B) score and a mean worry (HFS-W) score, with a maximum mean score of 4 in each category. The higher the score, the greater the person’s fear of hypoglycemia. Data analyses were conducted using SPSS, v. 23, software. Sixty-six adolescents with a mean age of 14.5 years (range 12.0–18.8 years) of whom 64% were male were enrolled. Participants had an average duration of diabetes of 6 years, and just fewer than half of them were using an insulin pump (). The mean ages of those on an MDI regimen and those using an insulin pump were similar, although diabetes duration was longer in those using a pump (8.4 vs. 4.0 years). Mean A1C was 8.6 and 9.0% for those on an MDI regimen and those using an insulin pump, respectively. Eighty-two percent of participants had an A1C above the ADA goal of <7.5% (). Mean BMI was similar between groups; about one-third of all participants were overweight or obese. Forty-three percent of those on an MDI regimen were overweight or obese, whereas 29% of those using an insulin pump were overweight or obese. A1C was not correlated to BMI score ( = 0.76). The majority of participants (89%) had an IPAQ score reflecting moderate/high levels of physical activity. Most exercised in the afternoon or evening (). There was no correlation between level of activity and A1C ( = 0.19) or BMI score ( = 0.4). Time of day adolescents reported that they engaged in physical activity. The mean HFS-B score for all participants was 1.9 ± 0.6 (range 0.4–2.9) and did not differ between those on an MDI regimen and those using an insulin pump ( = 0.55). The mean HFS-W score for all participants was 1.0 ± 0.6 (range 0.2–2.7) and also did not differ between those on an MDI regimen and those using an insulin pump ( = 0.19). Only 33 and 47% of participants reported checking their blood glucose almost always before and after exercise, respectively (). Forty-eight percent of participants reported checking their blood glucose during exercise, 20% reported rarely or never checking their blood glucose before exercise, and 14% reported rarely or never checking after exercise. These behaviors did not differ between the insulin injection group and pump group. Carbohydrate Intake and Blood Glucose Monitoring for All Participants Only 15, 18, and 18% of all adolescents surveyed reported almost always eating or drinking carbohydrates before, during, and after exercise, respectively (). Proportions reporting rarely or never eating or drinking carbohydrates before, during, and after exercise were 24, 29, and 23%, respectively. No one in the pump group reported “almost always” eating a carbohydrate prior to exercise. Seventy-two percent of adolescents using an MDI regimen reported that they did not make any insulin adjustments before exercise. The remainder reduced the amount of short-acting insulin given for the meal before exercise. Seventy-nine percent did not make any adjustments after exercise, whereas 18% reduced the short-acting insulin given for the meal after exercise, and 3% (one person) reported making a different type of insulin adjustment. No one reported reducing the amount of long-acting insulin given before bedtime. Adolescents who had higher IPAQ scores were not more likely to adjust their insulin before exercise ( = 0.68) but were more likely to adjust it after exercise ( = 0.05). Adolescents who adjusted their insulin before exercise had greater HFS-B scores (2.21 vs. 1.73, = 0.04) but no difference in HFS-W scores (1.03 vs. 0.86, = 0.45). Those who adjusted their insulin after exercise had higher HFS-B scores (2.55 vs. 1.72, = 0.001) and higher HFS-W scores (1.28 vs. 0.81, = 0.04). Those with longer diabetes duration were more likely to adjust insulin before exercise ( = 0.04). Forty-seven percent of insulin pump users reported making no insulin pump adjustments before exercise, 47% reported either taking off their pump or stopping the pump, and 6% reported reducing the insulin bolus given for the meal before exercise. Forty-five percent reported never adjusting their insulin pump during exercise, 27.5% reported rarely adjusting it, and 27.5% reported that they sometimes adjusted it. No one reported changing their overnight basal infusion rate. There was no correlation between level of activity (IPAQ score) and insulin regimen changes before exercise ( >0.46). There was also no correlation between fear of hypoglycemia measurements (HFS-B or HFS-W score) and insulin regimen adjustments before exercise ( >0.6 for both). Those with longer disease durations were less likely to adjust insulin before exercise ( = 0.007). Recommendations focus on adolescents either increasing carbohydrate intake or making insulin changes as adaptations for exercise to prevent or treat hypoglycemia. To see how many adolescents followed these recommendations, we developed an adaptation based on the following criteria. Adolescents reporting that they either almost always ate carbohydrates and/or changed their insulin dosing before or after exercise had a positive adaptation factor related to before or after exercise. Positive adaptation factors are summarized in . In the MDI group, there was a mix between those who reported almost always eating carbohydrates and those who reported making changes to their insulin regimen, with two people reporting that they did both. In the insulin pump group, no one reported that they almost always ate carbohydrate, so all 16 in this group who had a positive adaptation factor got it by virtue of changing their insulin before exercise. In the MDI group, there was a mix between those who reported that they almost always ate carbohydrates and those who reported making changes to their insulin regimen, with one person reporting that he or she did both. In the insulin pump group, no one reported changing their basal insulin setting before bedtime, so all six people who had a positive adaptation factor got it by virtue of eating carbohydrates. Overall, insulin pump users and those with an MDI regimen were equally likely to report adapting their diabetes care. Adolescents were more likely to exhibit adaptive behaviors before versus after exercise, although this was only statistically significant among the pump users ( = 0.02). Our study found that adolescents with type 1 diabetes followed in our academic medical center diabetes practice reported relatively high levels of physical activity. It should be noted that IPAQ surveys categorize level of activity based on total activity per week, whereas the ADA recommends 60 minutes/day of physical activity (). This study suggests that many adolescents do not change their insulin dosing in preparation for or in response to exercise. Those who use insulin pumps were more likely to change their insulin than those using an MDI regimen, but still about half of participants who used a pump did not make any insulin changes, and no one reported using temporary basal rates before exercise or before bedtime. Contrary to our expectations before the study, those with higher reported levels of activity were not more likely to adjust their insulin before exercise. However, adolescents on an MDI regimen who had high activity levels did report making changes after exercise. It should be noted that, of the total number of participants who used an MDI regimen, the percentage who adjusted their insulin before exercise was small, and the percentage of those who made insulin adjustments after exercise was even smaller. Fear of hypoglycemia is a known possible barrier to physical activity (,). However, there was no correlation in the insulin pump group between higher HFS scores and insulin adjustment. In the MDI group, those with higher HFS scores were more likely to adjust their insulin after exercise; for before-exercise adjustments, there was only a correlation with higher HFS-B scores, not with higher HFS-W scores. Many adolescents do not change their carbohydrate intake in preparation for or in response to exercise. Also, the majority of adolescents surveyed do not follow recommendations about blood glucose monitoring around exercise. Our study adds to the limited available data on strategies adolescents with type 1 diabetes use to minimize potential hypoglycemia around exercise. Compared with the study by Roberts et al. () of youths using insulin pumps, our cohort had a mix of pump and MDI users with a higher mean A1C, somewhat shorter mean duration of diabetes, and smaller percentage of adolescents using continuous glucose monitoring (CGM). Roberts et al. reported that most participants using a CGM device found it to be helpful with glucose management around physical activity (,). Differences in these cohorts likely partially explain why we found lower rates of reported insulin adjustments. However, our study results support the overall conclusion of Roberts et al. that more work needs to be done to enhance adolescent engagement with changing diabetes management behaviors in relation to exercise. Based on our study findings, those using an MDI regimen may be an especially important group to target. This study adds to the literature by analyzing both MDI and pump users, looking at both carbohydrate intake and insulin adjustments, and using the IPAQ and HFS to analyze the potential impact of level of activity and fear of hypoglycemia on behavior. There were a few limitations to this study, including that it used self-reported surveys, which could introduce recall bias. The data are also from one institution, which can limit applicability. However, surveys were given at two different clinic locations with different providers. Having approximately equal numbers of participants in the MDI and pump groups and similar demographics between the two groups were strengths of this study. Various other possible explanations for this lack of guideline adherence were not examined in this study. For example, with the significant amount of education that patients receive, exercise guidelines are likely to be a lower priority. Also, as adolescents take greater control of their insulin management, they may need education refreshers. We had a limited number of adolescents who used a CGM device in our cohort, so we were unable to analyze this subgroup separately. However, as CGM becomes more prevalent, along with hybrid closed-loop and predictive low glucose suspend systems, a further direction of this research would be to look at these patients’ behavior as a separate cohort in comparison with those not using these technologies. An additional direction we would like to explore would be to look at behaviors adolescents potentially use to mitigate exercise-induced hyperglycemia. Notwithstanding the limitations noted above, our results suggest that better-targeted education and interventions are needed to improve adolescents’ blood glucose management behaviors around exercise. These data provide clinical insights that can be helpful in practice. Given that neither the amount of activity nor fear of hypoglycemia were significant predictors of engagement in adaptive strategies, especially in pump users, additional factors need to be identified to help predict which adolescents will be more likely to make recommended behavior or treatment adaptations around exercise and determine how best to intervene to encourage more adolescents to follow such recommendations. Additional research is therefore needed.

Glucose is a sugar that comes from foods, and is formed and stored inside the body. It's the main source of energy for the body's cells and is carried to each through the bloodstream. But even though we need glucose for energy, too much glucose in the blood can be unhealthy. Hyperglycemia is the hallmark of diabetes — it happens when the body either can't make insulin () or can't respond to insulin properly (). The body needs insulin so glucose in the blood can enter the cells to be used for energy. In people who have developed diabetes, glucose builds up in the blood, resulting in hyperglycemia. If it's not treated, hyperglycemia can cause serious health problems. Too much sugar in the bloodstream for long periods of time can damage the vessels that supply blood to vital organs. And, too much sugar in the bloodstream can cause other types of damage to body tissues, which can increase the risk of heart disease and stroke, kidney disease, vision problems, and nerve problems in people with diabetes. These problems don't usually show up in kids or teens with diabetes who have had the disease for only a few years. However, they can happen in adulthood in some people, particularly if they haven't managed or controlled their diabetes properly. Blood sugar levels are considered high when they're above someone's target range. The will let you know what your child's target blood sugar levels are, which will vary based on factors like your child's age. A major goal in controlling diabetes is to keep blood sugar levels as close to the desired range as possible. It's a three-way balancing act of: All of these need to be balanced to keep blood sugar levels under control. If any one is off, blood sugar levels can be, too. In general, problems controlling blood sugar levels are due to one or more of the following: not getting enough or other diabetes medicine not following the (like eating too much on a special occasion without adjusting medicines) use of certain medicines that can raise blood sugar, like steroids used to treat inflammation The symptoms of hyperglycemia are similar to those that happen when someone is diagnosed with diabetes, such as: The kidneys respond to high levels of glucose in the bloodstream by flushing out the extra glucose in urine (pee). A child with diabetes who has hyperglycemia may need to pee more often and in larger volumes. Kids with hyperglycemia who lose a lot of fluid from urinating often become very thirsty and may drink a lot in an attempt to prevent dehydration. Without enough insulin to help the body use glucose, the body breaks down muscle and stored fat in an attempt to provide fuel to hungry cells. Because the body can't use glucose for energy properly, kids with hyperglycemia may be unusually tired. As part of the diabetes management plan, you'll need to check your child's blood sugar levels multiple times a day with a . This helps you identify when your child has high blood sugar levels, which don't always cause symptoms. Someone who isn't testing regularly might have blood sugar levels high enough to damage the body without even realizing it. The  can show if someone has been having significant hyperglycemia over time, even though the person may not have had obvious symptoms. If you find that your child is having a lot of high blood sugar levels, the diabetes health care team may suggest changing the diabetes medicines or meal plan to bring the levels back into a healthy range. In other cases, an equipment issue, like an problem or expired insulin, may be the cause. Make sure you contact the diabetes team if your child's blood sugar levels are often above the target range. Treating high blood sugar levels means correcting their cause. The diabetes health care team will give you specific advice on how to keep your child's blood sugar levels in a healthy range. But here are some suggestions for managing some causes of hyperglycemia: Not getting enough insulin or other diabetes medication Make sure your child takes the right type of insulin and the correct dose at the right time. Make sure that all equipment (pumps, meters, etc.) works properly. Diabetes medicines may need to be changed or adjusted — check with the diabetes health care team. Not following the meal plan (like eating too much food on special occasions without adjusting medicines) Work with a registered dietitian to change your child's meal plan as needed. Adjust insulin/pills whenever your child eats more or less than what's on the meal plan (the care team can help you with this). Adjust your child's medicines based on the care team's instructions. Your child should continue to take insulin (the dose may need to change). Check blood sugar levels often as per the diabetes management plan. Insulin or pills may need to change while your child takes the medicine that's causing high blood sugar levels. A single high blood sugar reading usually isn't cause for alarm — it happens to everyone with diabetes from time to time. However, consistently high blood sugar levels need to be addressed. Insulin lets glucose get into the body's cells. Without enough insulin, the body can't use glucose for energy and starts to use fat for fuel. This can happen, for example, when someone skips doses of insulin or when the need for insulin suddenly increases (for example, due to stress or illness) and the doses are not adjusted. When the body uses fat for energy, chemicals called ketones are released into the blood, causing . Some of the ketones, like extra glucose, exit the body through urine. But high levels of ketones in the blood can be a problem because they cause the blood to become acidic. Too much acid in the blood throws off the body's chemical balance. Diabetic ketoacidosis is a very serious — but completely preventable — condition that can lead to coma or death if it's not treated quickly. It happens more often in people with type 1 diabetes, but can sometimes happen in people with type 2 diabetes. Symptoms of diabetic ketoacidosis usually don't start all at once — they usually come on slowly over several hours. Signs and symptoms include: These symptoms are caused by the sustained hyperglycemia (usually lasting several hours) that typically happens before someone develops diabetic ketoacidosis. If the person isn't treated, these symptoms can happen: How do you know if your child has diabetic ketoacidosis? The signs and symptoms can mimic or be triggered by other illnesses, like the flu. So, it's very important to check your child's blood sugar levels and urine ketones during illness — especially if there are high blood sugar readings — or if your child has symptoms of diabetic ketoacidosis. Because high levels of ketones in the blood cause ketones to appear in the urine, ketones can be checked at home by testing a sample of your child's urine. If the urine test for ketones is negative, it generally means that symptoms are not due to diabetic ketoacidosis. If the urine test is positive, contact your child's diabetes health care team.  Tests done by a lab or hospital can confirm whether a child has diabetic ketoacidosis, if necessary. Some newer blood glucose meters also offer the option of testing blood for ketones. Ask the diabetes health care team if such a meter is a good idea for your child. Diabetic ketoacidosis requires immediate medical treatment with intravenous (IV) insulin and fluids and close monitoring in a hospital. Contact the diabetes health care team immediately or seek emergency care if you think your child is having symptoms of diabetic ketoacidosis. All adult family members and your child's caregivers and school staff should know about the risk of diabetic ketoacidosis in a child with diabetes, and they should know when to call 911. In addition, all kids and teens with diabetes should wear some sort of medical identification (like a bracelet or necklace) and/or carry medical identification (ID) information at all times. Besides identifying your child as having diabetes, these IDs can provide emergency contact information.

Treatment plans for type 1 diabetes are based on each child's needs and the suggestions of the . Treatment approaches might differ in the types of insulin given and the schedules for giving insulin each day. The advantages and disadvantages of a plan should be considered for each child. The is the amount of glucose in the blood. Glucose is the main source of energy for the body's cells and is carried to them through the bloodstream. The hormone allows the glucose to get into the cells. In type 1 diabetes, the body can no longer make insulin, so the glucose can't get into the body's cells. This makes the blood glucose level rise. Treatment goals for kids with diabetes are to control the condition in a way that: helps them have normal physical and emotional growth and development To do this, parents and kids should aim to keep blood sugar levels within their goal range as much as possible. eat a healthy, balanced diet with accurate carbohydrate counts Following the treatment plan helps kids stay healthy, but treating diabetes isn't the same as curing it. Right now, there's no cure for diabetes, so kids with type 1 diabetes will need treatment for the rest of their lives. But with proper care, they should look and feel healthy and go on to live long, productive lives, just like other kids. Children and teens who have type 1 diabetes must take insulin as part of their treatment plan. Insulin is the only medicine that can keep their blood sugar levels in a healthy range. Taking insulin as prescribed lets them use the glucose in their blood for energy. When glucose is entering and being used by the cells properly, its level in the blood generally remains within a healthy range. The acids and digestive juices in the stomach and intestines can break down and destroy insulin if it is swallowed, so it can't be taken as a pill. The only way to get insulin into the body now is by injection with a needle or with an insulin pump. Unless they're using an insulin pump, most kids need two or more injections every day to keep blood sugar levels under control. Usually, two different types of insulin are needed to handle blood sugar needs both after eating and between meals. There is no-one-size-fits-all insulin schedule — the types of insulin used and number of daily injections a child needs will depend on the diabetes management plan. Insulin doses need to be adjusted to handle the rise in blood sugar that happens with meals and provide the amounts of insulin the body needs between meals and overnight. Eating meals at regular times generally makes this easier. Although eating on schedule may work well for younger kids, sticking to a routine can be a challenge for older kids and teens, whose school, sleep, and social schedules often vary. The diabetes health care team can help you work through any problems your child might have with scheduling meals and insulin injections. Getting insulin injections today is nearly painless, thanks to smaller needles. Insulin pumps (which deliver insulin through a small tube that is placed just under the skin) cut down on the number of injections needed. Insulin usually is injected into the fatty layer under the skin of the abdomen, hips/buttocks, arms, or thighs. The health care team will teach you when and how to give the insulin, as well as the best injection sites, based on your child's weight, age, and activity patterns. Eating a balanced diet and following a are important parts of type 1 diabetes treatment. Kids with diabetes benefit from the same kind of healthy diet as those without diabetes — one that includes a variety of healthy foods that help the body grow and work properly. Kids with diabetes also have to balance the type and timing of their meals with the amount of insulin they take and with their activity level. That's because eating some foods will cause blood sugar levels to go up more than others, whereas insulin and exercise will make blood sugar levels go down. How much the blood sugar level goes up after eating depends on the type of nutrients the food has. The three main types of nutrients found in foods are (carbs), proteins, and , which provide energy in the form of calories. Foods containing carbs cause blood sugar levels to go up the most. Foods that are mostly protein and/or fat don't affect blood sugar levels nearly as much. Meal plans usually include breakfast, lunch, and dinner with scheduled between-meal snacks. The plan won't restrict your child to eating specific foods, but will guide you in selecting from the basic to achieve a healthy balance. Meal plans are based on a child's age, activity level, schedule, and food likes and dislikes, and should be flexible enough for special situations like parties and holidays. Knowing the amount of carbs in meals and snacks will help you know how much insulin to give your child. Mismatching carbs and insulin can result in either high or low blood sugar levels. The meal plan also might recommend limiting extra fat and ""empty"" calories (foods that contain lots of calories but few nutrients). Everyone should limit these foods anyway because eating too much of them can lead to excess weight gain or long-term health problems like heart disease, for which people with diabetes are already at risk. Treating type 1 diabetes also involves checking blood sugar levels regularly and responding to the results. Controlling blood sugar levels helps kids with diabetes feel well, grow, and develop normally, and also reduces the risk of long-term . The diabetes treatment plan will recommend how many times a day to check blood sugar levels, which is the only way to monitor the effectiveness of your child's insulin planl. The diabetes health care team also will let you know what your child's target blood sugar levels are. In general, kids with type 1 diabetes should test their blood sugar levels with a at least four times a day. Depending on your child's management plan and any problems that arise, blood sugar levels could need to be tested more often. The care team may recommend that your child use a continuous glucose monitor (CGM). A CGM is a wearable device that can measure blood sugar every few minutes around the clock. It's measured by a thread-like sensor that is inserted under the skin and secured in place. Sensors can stay in place for about a week before they have to be replaced and are accurate enough to replace frequent finger-stick testing. The more frequent CGM blood sugar readings can help you and the care team do an even better job of troubleshooting and adjusting your child's diabetes management plan to improve blood sugar control. A blood glucose meter or CGM measures the blood sugar level at the moment of testing. Another blood test, the glycosylated hemoglobin (hemoglobin A1c or HbA1c) test, shows how blood sugar levels have been running over the past 3 months. is good for everyone — adults and kids, with or without diabetes. Getting regular physical activity is also an important part of diabetes treatment. It helps control blood sugar levels and may reduce the risk of other chronic illnesses, like heart disease. Besides helping keep blood sugar levels under control, exercise can help kids with diabetes: keep cholesterol levels and under control get and keep their heart, lungs, and blood vessels in good shape feel like they can do things that kids without diabetes can Encouraging kids with diabetes to exercise might make parents uneasy, but exercise actually helps insulin work better. Some changes to meals and insulin may be needed, but kids can and should exercise. All exercise is great — from walking the dog or riding a bike to playing team sports. Encourage your child to exercise, and set 60 minutes daily as a goal. New exercise habits might be hard for kids to adopt at first, but feeling the benefits can help them stick with it. To help avoid problems during exercise, kids with diabetes might need to: carry snacks, water, and supplies with them when they exercise check their blood sugar levels before, during, or after exercise make sure their coaches know about their diabetes and what to do if problems occur Make sure your child wears a medical identification bracelet (this should always be worn, but it's even more important during exercise, sports, and fitness activities). The care team will offer tips to help your child get ready for exercise or join a sport. They'll also give instructions to help you and your child respond to any diabetes problems that could happen during exercise, like (low blood sugar) or (high blood sugar). Treating and managing diabetes can seem overwhelming at times. But the diabetes health care team is there for you. Your child's diabetes management plan should be easy to understand, detailed, and written down for easy reference. You also should have the names and phone numbers of the health care team members in case of emergencies or if you have questions. You might hear of alternative or complementary treatments, such as herbal remedies and vitamin or mineral supplements. Although research continues into their possible benefits, studies thus far haven't proved their effectiveness. They also could be dangerous for kids and teens with type 1 diabetes, especially if used to replace medically recommended treatments. Talk to the diabetes health care team if you have questions. Each day, researchers all over the world are working to find a cure for diabetes, and many advances have made treatment easier and more effective. Insulin might soon be available in patch and spray forms, and scientists continue efforts to improve results of or transplants. Versions of an ""artificial pancreas"" — a device that senses blood sugar continuously and gives insulin directly based on the blood sugar level — also are being tested. Your diabetes health care team keeps track of the latest research developments and will introduce new products as they become available.

5440c0d5-8a51-44a1-baec-255608f55d01,"Avoiding Hyperglycemia & Preventing Diabetic Ketoacidosis When blood glucose levels (also called blood sugar levels) are too high, it's called . Glucose is a sugar that comes from foods, and is formed and stored inside the body. It's the main source of energy for the body's cells and is carried to each through the bloodstream. But even though we need glucose for energy, too much glucose in the blood can be unhealthy. Hyperglycemia is the hallmark of diabetes — it happens when the body either can't make insulin () or can't respond to insulin properly (type 2 diabetes). The body needs insulin so glucose in the blood can enter the cells to be used for energy. In people who have developed diabetes, glucose builds up in the blood, resulting in hyperglycemia. If it's not treated, hyperglycemia can cause serious health problems. Too much sugar in the bloodstream for long periods of time can damage the vessels that supply blood to vital organs. And, too much sugar in the bloodstream can cause other types of damage to body tissues, which can increase the risk of heart disease and stroke, kidney disease, vision problems, and nerve problems in people with diabetes. These problems don't usually show up in kids or teens with diabetes who have had the disease for only a few years. However, they can happen in adulthood in some people, particularly if they haven't managed or controlled their diabetes properly. Blood sugar levels are considered high when they're above someone's target range. The will let you know what your child's target blood sugar levels are, which will vary based on factors like your child's age. A major goal in controlling diabetes is to keep blood sugar levels as close to the desired range as possible. It's a three-way balancing act of: All of these need to be balanced to keep blood sugar levels under control. If any one is off, blood sugar levels can be, too. In general, problems controlling blood sugar levels are due to one or more of the following: not getting enough or other diabetes medicine not following the meal plan (like eating too much on a special occasion without adjusting medicines) use of certain medicines that can raise blood sugar, like steroids used to treat inflammation The symptoms of hyperglycemia are similar to those that happen when someone is diagnosed with diabetes, such as: The kidneys respond to high levels of glucose in the bloodstream by flushing out the extra glucose in urine (pee). A child with diabetes who has hyperglycemia may need to pee more often and in larger volumes. Kids with hyperglycemia who lose a lot of fluid from urinating often become very thirsty and may drink a lot in an attempt to prevent dehydration. Without enough insulin to help the body use glucose, the body breaks down muscle and stored fat in an attempt to provide fuel to hungry cells. Because the body can't use glucose for energy properly, kids with hyperglycemia may be unusually tired. As part of the diabetes management plan, you'll need to check your child's blood sugar levels multiple times a day with a blood glucose meter. This helps you identify when your child has high blood sugar levels, which don't always cause symptoms. Someone who isn't testing regularly might have blood sugar levels high enough to damage the body without even realizing it. The  can show if someone has been having significant hyperglycemia over time, even though the person may not have had obvious symptoms. If you find that your child is having a lot of high blood sugar levels, the diabetes health care team may suggest changing the diabetes medicines or meal plan to bring the levels back into a healthy range. In other cases, an equipment issue, like an insulin pump problem or expired insulin, may be the cause. Make sure you contact the diabetes team if your child's blood sugar levels are often above the target range. Treating high blood sugar levels means correcting their cause. The diabetes health care team will give you specific advice on how to keep your child's blood sugar levels in a healthy range. But here are some suggestions for managing some causes of hyperglycemia: What to Do Not getting enough insulin or other diabetes medication Make sure your child takes the right type of insulin and the correct dose at the right time. Make sure that all equipment (pumps, meters, etc.) works properly. Diabetes medicines may need to be changed or adjusted — check with the diabetes health care team. Not following the meal plan (like eating too much food on special occasions without adjusting medicines) Work with a registered dietitian to change your child's meal plan as needed. Adjust insulin/pills whenever your child eats more or less than what's on the meal plan (the care team can help you with this). Adjust your child's medicines based on the care team's instructions. Your child should continue to take insulin (the dose may need to change). Check blood sugar levels often as per the diabetes management plan. Insulin or pills may need to change while your child takes the medicine that's causing high blood sugar levels. A single high blood sugar reading usually isn't cause for alarm — it happens to everyone with diabetes from time to time. However, consistently high blood sugar levels need to be addressed. Insulin lets glucose get into the body's cells. Without enough insulin, the body can't use glucose for energy and starts to use fat for fuel. This can happen, for example, when someone skips doses of insulin or when the need for insulin suddenly increases (for example, due to stress or illness) and the doses are not adjusted. When the body uses fat for energy, chemicals called ketones are released into the blood, causing diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). Some of the ketones, like extra glucose, exit the body through urine. But high levels of ketones in the blood can be a problem because they cause the blood to become acidic. Too much acid in the blood throws off the body's chemical balance. Diabetic ketoacidosis is a very serious — but completely preventable — condition that can lead to coma or death if it's not treated quickly. It happens more often in people with type 1 diabetes, but can sometimes happen in people with type 2 diabetes. Symptoms of diabetic ketoacidosis usually don't start all at once — they usually come on slowly over several hours. Signs and symptoms include: These symptoms are caused by the sustained hyperglycemia (usually lasting several hours) that typically happens before someone develops diabetic ketoacidosis. If the person isn't treated, these symptoms can happen: How do you know if your child has diabetic ketoacidosis? The signs and symptoms can mimic or be triggered by other illnesses, like the flu. So, it's very important to check your child's blood sugar levels and urine ketones during illness — especially if there are high blood sugar readings — or if your child has symptoms of diabetic ketoacidosis. Because high levels of ketones in the blood cause ketones to appear in the urine, ketones can be checked at home by testing a sample of your child's urine. If the urine test for ketones is negative, it generally means that symptoms are not due to diabetic ketoacidosis. If the urine test is positive, contact your child's diabetes health care team.  Tests done by a lab or hospital can confirm whether a child has diabetic ketoacidosis, if necessary. Some newer blood glucose meters also offer the option of testing blood for ketones. Ask the diabetes health care team if such a meter is a good idea for your child. Diabetic ketoacidosis requires immediate medical treatment with intravenous (IV) insulin and fluids and close monitoring in a hospital. Contact the diabetes health care team immediately or seek emergency care if you think your child is having symptoms of diabetic ketoacidosis. All adult family members and your child's caregivers and school staff should know about the risk of diabetic ketoacidosis in a child with diabetes, and they should know when to call 911. In addition, all kids and teens with diabetes should wear some sort of medical identification (like a bracelet or necklace) and/or carry medical identification (ID) information at all times. Besides identifying your child as having diabetes, these IDs can provide emergency contact information. Avoiding Hyperglycemia & Preventing Diabetic Ketoacidosis The best way to prevent diabetic ketoacidosis is to treat high blood sugar levels appropriately, which means following the diabetes management plan prescribed by the diabetes health care team. takes insulin and diabetes medicines as prescribed follows the meal plan and/or makes appropriate adjustments to diabetes medicines when changes to the meal plan are made monitors his or her blood sugar levels regularly and ketone levels when indicated follows the instructions and advice of the diabetes health care team and diabetes management plan, which should include instructions for sick days By regularly monitoring blood sugar levels, you'll know when your child's blood sugar is high. If that happens, contact the diabetes health care team for more information and to learn how to help bring your child's diabetes back under control.

5b3eba58-2db9-40b4-8fb1-c9f175b72388,"any copy you likeyourURL Kids who have can help themselves stay healthy by taking these three very important steps: getting to a healthy (by eating healthy and getting ) taking medicine if the doctor feels it's necessary Doing all three can get a little confusing because there's a lot to remember. What comes in handy when you can't keep everything straight in your head? A plan, where everything is written down for you. That's why kids (and adults) who have diabetes get their own diabetes treatment plan. This plan will help you and your parents know what to do to help you stay healthy, active, growing, and feeling good. You, your parents, and members of your will work together to make a treatment plan that's right for you. Doing what your plan tells you to do will help keep you healthy now — and help you avoid health problems later. The plan's main goal is to keep blood sugar levels (also called ) from getting too high or too low. The body gets (say: GLOO-kose), a sugar, from the food we eat. Glucose is carried through the bloodstream to all the cells in the body. Glucose provides energy for the body's cells so they can work. (say: IN-suh-lin) is a hormone that helps the glucose get into the cells. In kids who have type 2 diabetes, insulin doesn't do its job as well, so glucose is less able to enter the cells. It just hangs around and builds up in the blood, causing the blood glucose level to rise. And when blood sugar levels go too high, a person can feel sick and may have health problems. Nobody wants that, so let's look at the three steps that will help keep a kid with type 2 diabetes feeling good. How can a kid get to a healthy weight? The first step is to talk with your doctor, who can tell you how to eat healthy and add exercise (also known as play) into your daily routine. If you take these steps, and your weight improves, you may be able to get your blood sugar levels into a healthier range. If that happens, your doctor may decide you don't have to take medicine for diabetes anymore. To eat healthy, your doctor might suggest that you watch out for two ""C's"" — and . You don't want too much of either one. Foods containing a lot of carbohydrates, such as pasta and candy, will make your blood sugar levels increase, which can make it harder to keep your diabetes under control. And calories — you probably know — are units of energy that each food contains. If you eat too many calories and don't burn off the extra energy, your body will store it as fat. Too much stored fat can cause someone to be overweight. A diabetes can help you learn about balanced, healthy eating. It's a plan that's written down and designed especially for you. Meal plans can help guide you about what kinds of foods to eat for breakfast, lunch, dinner, and snacks. And the plan also can teach you how to eat the right amounts to help you get to a healthy weight and control your blood sugar levels. Some kids might think they don't like exercise, but not all exercise is the same. Did you know that playing in an active way — like playing tag or being at the playground — is considered exercise? It is. Really, any kind of play that gets you moving is a kind of exercise. Even helping your mom or dad with chores around the house can be exercise. Hauling groceries in from the car? That's exercise too. Not only does exercise help kids stay at a healthy weight, it can lower blood sugar levels and help you feel more fit. Exercise can make blood sugar levels change, so you might be worried that you'll feel sick while being active. Your diabetes health care team can tell you what to do if you don't feel right while you're exercising. Knowing what to do before it happens can help you deal with it more easily and start feeling better faster. Don't worry if you don't understand everything about diet and exercise. Between your doctor, other members of your health care team, and your family, you'll have lots of grownups to help you — just ask! Medicine taken by mouth is sometimes used to treat type 2 diabetes. This medicines help people make or use insulin better. But sometimes medicine taken by mouth still isn't enough to keep blood sugar levels under control. Kids with type 2 diabetes might have to take . No one likes to get shots, but the good news is that kids who eat healthy foods, stay active, and get to a good weight might be able to get their blood sugar levels back down to normal. If they do that, they might not even need to take any medicines at all. Checking your blood sugar levels is like giving yourself a little checkup. How is your treatment plan working? Your blood sugar level can provide a clue. Testing your blood sugar level is the only way to know how you are doing with your diabetes control from day to day. Your doctor will also check your blood sugar with a (HbA1c test for short). The test gives your care team information about your blood sugar levels. This helps doctors know if you need to make changes in your diabetes care plan. Your diabetes health care team will let you and your parents know what your blood sugar levels should be and when you should test them. Kids with type 2 diabetes usually test blood sugar levels with a at least twice a day. You may have to test more often than that if you're taking insulin, have just been told you have type 2 diabetes, or are having some trouble keeping your blood sugar levels under control. Does that sound like a lot to remember? It is — but remember that you have your plan to guide you and lots of adults to help you put that plan into action!

But for kids, exercise means playing and being physically active. Kids exercise when they have gym class at school, during recess, at dance class or soccer practice, while riding bikes, or when playing tag. Everyone can benefit from regular exercise. Active kids will have: lower and blood cholesterol levels Besides enjoying the health benefits of regular exercise, fit kids sleep better. They're also better able to handle physical and emotional challenges — from running to catch a bus to studying for a test. If you've ever watched kids on a playground, you've seen the three elements of fitness in action when they: Parents should encourage their kids to do a variety of activities so that they can work on all three elements. develops when kids regularly get activity. During aerobic exercise, large muscles are moving, the heart beats faster, and a person breathes harder. Aerobic activity strengthens the heart and improves the body's ability to deliver oxygen to all its cells. Aerobic exercise can be fun for both adults kids. Aerobic activities include: Improving doesn't have to mean . Instead, kids can do push-ups, stomach crunches, pull-ups, and other exercises to help tone and strengthen muscles. They also improve their strength when they climb, do a handstand, or wrestle. Stretching exercises help improve , allowing muscles and joints to bend and move easily through their full range of motion. Kids get chances every day to stretch when they reach for a toy, practice a split, or do a cartwheel. Kids and teens are sitting around a lot more than they used to. They spend hours every day in front of a screen (TVs, smartphones, tablets, and other devices) looking at a variety of media (TV shows, videos, movies, games). Too much screen time and not enough physical activity add to the problem of childhood obesity. One of the best ways to get kids to be more active is to limit the amount of time spent in sedentary activities, especially watching TV or other screens. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends that parents: Put limits on the time spent using media, which includes TV, social media, and video games. Media should not take the place of getting enough sleep and being active.  Limit screen time to 1 hour a day or less for children 2 to 5 years old. Discourage any screen time, except video-chatting, for kids younger than 18 months. Choose high-quality programming and watch it with your kids to help them understand what they're seeing.  Keep TVs, computers, and video games out of children's bedrooms. Parents should make sure that their kids get enough exercise. So, how much is enough? Kids and teens should get 60 minutes or more of moderate to vigorous physical activity daily. Toddlers and preschool children should play actively several times a day. Toddlers should get at least 60 minutes active play every day and preschoolers should have at least 120 minutes active play every day. This time should include planned, adult-led physical activity and unstructured active free play. Young children should not be inactive for long periods of time — no more than 1 hour unless they're sleeping. And school-age children should not be inactive for periods longer than 2 hours. Combining regular physical activity with a healthy diet is the key to a . Help your kids do in a variety of age-appropriate activities. Make being active a part of daily life, like taking the stairs instead of the elevator. Embrace a healthier lifestyle yourself, so you'll be a positive role model for your family. Keep it fun, so your kids will come back for more. Weight Management: Strength Training Exercises (Video) Note: All information is for educational purposes only.

a5bd7172-9e50-4279-8216-946b0a0e2fcd,"DPP4 inhibitors such as Galvus met increase... - Diabetes India DPP4 inhibitors such as Galvus met increases risk of heart failure! Galvus met, till date claimed as a safe drug has become very popular due to its effectiveness. It is also known as a Gliptin or DPP4 inhibitors. From latest clinical trials , it is seen to have increased risk of heart failure as published in a very recent article in AHA journals of Feb 2018 issue. Galvus met contains Vildagliptin which has not been approved by FDA, though its twin sister Sitagliptin has FDA approval. Talk to your doctor if you need to reduce your dose of Galvus met or substitute by any other drugs. In any case, try to control blood sugar by diet and exercise and minimise medication since most of the medicines seems to have some side effects or other. Insulin seems to be safer than the oral medications. No.Insulin is as bad as secretagogue medicines.Galvus treatment is illogical, unscientific and harmful. Both insulin and galvus increase IR.And to prevent hypoglycemia when these drugs - insulin and galvus - are used one has to eat high carb diet.Not good. That is bad. Diabetes Mellitus is as old as mankind. Unfortunately, not a single medication has been discovered today by modern science which does not have any serious side effects. Yes, people are trying to control blood sugar through diet and exercise which gives limited success ! Any latest up date on LWMDR (Long Wheat Mash Diet Regimen)?? Diabetes is not a disease in itself so it can't be cured.So no medicinal cure for diabetes. Since t2d can't metabolize carbs they should eat carbs to the extent they can clear the sugar from the blood. More carbs than that will harm their vital organs.It's that simple. Agree that it is not a disease by itself. But unfortunately, even if you minimise carbohydrate, still the blood sugar remains elevated without medicines. And whatever medicines discovered so far, there is not a single effectve medicine without having serious side effects. And the uncontrolled blood sugar has consequences / complications which are scary : kidney failure/Heart failure, liver failure, Retinopathy, nuropathy, leg amputation and so on. The only way is yes : minimise carbo, maximise fiber, maximise protein. With Regards to Fat , zero oil and fat. In stead, moderately Source your fat from nuts and seeds rich in MUFA such as Almonds, omega 3 rich PUFA like flax seed and chia, wal nuts. Lchf diet.Low carb high / healthy fats diet.Not zero fat.Ketogenic ratio should be 3-4:1that's 75-80% calories should come from fats - the healthy ones. Zero fats means one has to eat either carbs or prots. How much protein can one eat daily? 1-1.5 g / kg body weight. More than that is not recommended because puts strain on liver and kidneys. Yes.You are right.Sometimes inability to metabolise carbs is so severe that even endogenously produced sugar is not cleared efficiently. But that's rare.One can take drugs like metformin which enhances clearance of glucose by activating certain enzymes in the liver.Any drugs which whips pancreas to secrete more insulin is not recommended because that's what our pancreas is already doing. Minimizing carbs alone can't be effective. One has to lose fats, esp belly fat, to overcome IR.Until that's done bs is not controlled. Minimising carbs brings down the elevated insulin levels which in turn helps dissolving fats from our body.Losing fat is a slow process. One has to be in a starvation mode which is practically impossible having lots of foods around us.That's why IF is also recommended. (1) when I say Zero fat, I meant zero consumption of refined edible oil- RBD. (2) Source your Fat so called healthy fats should be predominantly MUFA and omega 3 based PUFA. Omega 6 based PUFA should be avoided since omega 6 fatty acid promotes inflammation. Thus Healthy fats are Almonds, macadamia nuts, Avocado fruit, Flax seeds, Chia seeds, wal nuts. SFA should be minimised since it increases LDL except coconut meat in moderation. (3) yes very high protein more than 1.5 gm/kg body weight should be avpided. (4) the ideal situation is controlling Blood sugar with(a) LCHF and if required (b) taking metformin only (c) Exercise/GYm/brisk walk 45 mnts twice daily and remain active for the day. Avoid long sitting. (5) underweight/ Low BMI people need to be careful with LCHF as LCHF leads to undesirable weightloss for the underweight. In such a situation , carbo proportion perhaps needs to be moderated. I have different views for sfa.Co contains @46% mct. Vco @54%.Ghee is full of sct and mct upto 71%. The beauty of sct n mct is they get absorbed directly to the liver unlike lct which require bile salts / chylomicron for their absorption. The difference between sct mct and lct is that while lct in chylomicron bypasses liver and go into the systemic circulation where lct are stored in fatty tissues mct sct are carried to the liver where they are burnt to give instant energy i. e. bpc. Further sct mct can't be stored in the human body.All that fat we have is lct. So in my view sfa is wrongly incriminated. Ldl is not a harmful entity. Ldl is very important in fighting microbes.Its level below 80 mg /100 ml may be harmful. Actually cholesterol and other fats should be reviewed if they are harmful or useful. By the way now the doctors are recommending "" nonhdl cholesterol assay. The entire issue of cholesterol needs to be reassessed. My cardiologist put me on a statin as a preventive measure. He told me to keep LDL under 70. Everytime I had muscle pain, he changed my statin but my muscle pain remained. I discontinued statin and learned to keep my lipid profile under control with diet and exercise. No muscle pain now. Though I agree with the basic science behind SCT+MCT , but with coconut, I had a different experience. I took a large portion of raw coconut meat ( white portion of matured coconut) daily. 1 full coconut I ate within 2-3 days. After 3 months while my hdl went up from 45 to 55, my LDL also went up from 80 to 135. I was on a LCHF diet. I was taking almonds 15-20 nos per day. And I lost 5kg weight in the process. My weight reduced from 58 to 53 and became underweight. Now I want to go back to my previous weight by including some more healthy carbo with high fiber in my diet. Not able to gain back my weight. Perhaps, coconut is not for underweight people. Moreover, coconut has most of its MCT as C12, which is at a higher end of MCT which is just like a LCT. The actual MCT as C8/ C10 is just 15% in coconut which goes easily to liver without getting routed through peripheral tissues. MCT as C8/C10 gets easily converted in the ketone in the liver without chylomicron. Not sure about Ghee though. You have mentioned Ghee has up to 70% SCT/ MCT, but to my understanding it would be much less. please confirm ! Still I love coconut. I have reduced the portion. I eat a small portion daily to finish one complete matured coconut by 5-6 days No doubt coconut has anti microbial, anti inflammatory, anti viral. Property. And it can do wonders for the arteries. All are welcome to comment how to increase weight. I am T2 and My Blood sugar is under control. Was taking Galvus met earlier. I have left Galvus met now. I take 850 mg metformin twice daily. I am aware metformin would allow me to increase my weight. What I meant is metformin has weight reducing property. I feel with heavy doses of metformin and LCHF it is difficult to increase weight. While it is easy to reduce weight with LCHF diet, it is difficult for a underweight T2 to increase weight with LCHF diet. I wouldn't be much obsessed about my weight as far as bs remains under control. Let the nature decide.Please review your decision about Adding carbs. Ldl too i wouldn't worry much. 1) diagnostic tests are not totally useless. Yes.The whole body check up like things are means to earn money and disrepute the real need for diagnostic tests. 2) true.Diabetes can't be ""cured "" by drugs because it's not a disease but a metabolic derangement. 3) his dietary advice is disastrous. 700 g of fruits like banana, pineapple, grapes,sapota will cause nafld.Fruits for diabetics are not innocent or as we indians believe, healthy. He is preaching vegan.There are many people in the world who follow vegan diet.There are number of articles on vegan food and its usefulness / harm. Personally i don't subscribe vegan diet.As t2d we should avoid carbs as much as possible. So remaining macro nutrients are fats and prots.For a number of reason we can't eat proteins beyond a certain limit.So remains fats.Now vegetarian sources of fats are high in omega 6 and the studies show their harmful effects. Yes.Coconut oil,palm kernel oil,avocado oil, evoo,voo are useful but ghee is far more better and so much praised by our saints, the ancient scientists. Even science has proven ghee to be a better food. Dr swaroop has his own hypothesis unsupported. If he has done studies he should come out with them or scientifically, logically prove it.I wouldn't recommend or follow his dietary advice. My understanding is that Desi Ghee contains 25% SCT plus MCT i.e SFA containing C less than C12. The rest are above C12 which are of LCT type. You said, Desi Ghee contains 70% SCT plus MCT. I am bit confused. I did a literature search which also confirms my understanding. Also , there are some literature which says coconut oil weight reducing ( which I have also seen practically), where as Ghee may have weight increasing effect which in fact I would desire. (1) Randomised trial on Ghee or (2) if you know some one practising predominantly Ghee in LCHF diet, what has been his results on Lipid profile, BS , weight ! I'm taking ghee plus co predominantly. I have reduced my weight by 10 kg and ag by 2"". I'm also trying to find what i said - 71% sct n mct.Ghee and for that matter healthy fats in lchf diet reduce weight and body fats.Very much Scientific. high healthy fats in lchf diet elicit almost zero insulin response. This leads to lipolysis. With the above fats , what lipid numbers are you getting ? Read this article by Harvard Prof declaring Co oil as a poison. Not sure of the authenticity of the article I don't believe in such articles. I have been using co ghee and evoo for about 2 years. I have fairly controlled my bs. I'll be posting my lipid profile soon.I have understood the science behind sfa scientifically. Let all such people play their tune. There is gross misconception regarding sfa.Any unsaturated fat is less fit for cooking. Pufa is worse than mufa which in turn is worse than sfa.The reason is that on heating usfa get oxidized, become rancid. Lose their efficacy and become harmful. The world has been misinformed betrayed and misled for last 6-7 decades. Just to sell statins. Well. @70% of my caloric requirements come from fats.Co and ghee used liberally for cooking and evoo as dressing. Mustard oil for pickles. As far as science is concerned it is clear with respect to thermal stability at high temp during cooking of SFA Vs MUFA Vs PUFA. But then should it not be stable inside your body if you eat at raw walnut, flax seed, sunflower seeds which are predominantly PUFA and Almonds , cashew nuts, Macadamia nuts, EVOO which are MUFA based. RAW coconut/ oil or ghee is supposed to be stable inside our body whether you eat raw or cooked. The only issue I have seen in my case while both of these fats increased my HDL, it increased my LDL also. My LDL went up from 80 to 135 within a couple of months, though my HDLwent up from 42 to 53. My BS remained stable. I was scared of LDL as I did not find any literature which says excessive LDL is good! Your body may react differently to co and ghee. Hope you are also taking some flax seeds too which to some extent could help reducing LDL and thus balancing Lipids Inside our body oils get absorbed in different ways.Stability is not needed there. Well. Cholesterol theory is totally wrong and the nature is great. If ldl also increases with hdl there should be reasons we are yet to know. it's wrong teaching and preaching - according to my belief - that ldl is only bad. No.I eat flax seeds and walnut infrequently. But take lots of evoo. According to my view cholesterol levels are directly proportionate to the degree of wear n tear. As such also now a days it's nonhdl cholesterol that's advised and taken into consideration. Ghee recommended by saints is not the ghee from a mixed fare obtained from buffalos , or hybrid cows . Even coconut meat or oil is found out to be not so good as per latest research . If everything is expected to be branded and recommended by the modern scientists then dooms day is not far off . I try to understand the science behind recommendations. True ghee recommended by saints is not from buffalo or present hybrid cows but still ghee produced traditionally by fermentation is far better. Researches now a days are sponsored. Also there is lots of adultration to earn more. So unless a scientific explanation is put forward i'd not believe in any research outcome. I always read sfa not good because it raises cholesterol and can cause cva etc etc but i have not seen a scientific explanation. Usa has fooled the whole world for pretty 6-7 decades to sell statins. And for that they have concocted many theories and researches.Such articles i don't believe. Let there be concrete scientific explanation. But where do we get pure ghee? not even ISI branded .Any ghee we get is adulterated with animal fat which can't be used even for homas . so far as scientific researches you have hit the nail .How can we get scientific explanation in the absence of scientific research . Now literally the whole system is corrupt .so we have to go by our own experience and very carefully decide which food suits to our body requirements .In case of type1 D much choice is not there . That's a different issue. I make ghee at home. I also have local dairy/ies selling reasonably good quality ghee.Commercially available ghee usually is not made by standard fermentation process. So better avoided. And scientific researches have confirmed the benefits of ghee. Well type 1 have no choice on insulin but afa foods are concerned the same principles as t2d are applied. home.we take one liter buffalo milk daily in the morning and heat it on simmer to form good and thick Skin on cooling it. I take morning sugarless tea with milk.Then milk is kept in refrigerator. Then again evening at about 5 pm same tea is repeated.Next day morning we remove the thick skin to a pot and keep this it again in refrigerator .Add a teaspoon of curd in it to commence fermentation process. Like wise we store about 2-3 weeks and after that keep this pot out side refrigerator for a day to complete fermentation process.Then in the portion of 3-4 tablespoons we put this in mixer to get white lumps of white butter. The buttermilk is taken away.The white butter is heated in simmer to get pure ghee.This is very tasty. Perfect. That's how ghee is made in my home too.But one can use probiotic or yogurt cultures for fermentation in stead or with curd.Both the cultures are considered better than curd. I posted a message at 4 PM today.. Don't know how it disappeared and did not get posted after submission. Reference to the video in Glucose spike, I find even lean and thin built body is a risk factor for diabetes. The logic explained that if the muscle mass is low, then sugar does not get abosrbed simply because there is no takers for the blood glucose inside body due to lack of muscles. Then it should be imp that one remains within normal BMI range. While I find a lot of posts in this forum on Weight reduction for obese T2 as a result of practising LCHF but I Did not find anyone with thin body structure T2 with Low BMI of 17-18 practising LCHF. As explained you earlier, when I practised LCHF diet, my weight reduced from 59 to 52 within 3 months and I had to give up severe carbo restriction. Can any one throw some light on Low BMI T2 practising LCHF without losing weight and muscle mass, though Suramo reassured me that one should not get obsessed with one's weight reduction as long as you achieve BS. While I am aware that LDL increases with SFA, but I can manage my LDL without statin. Recently when I had consulted one of the top cardiologists after my comprehensive health check up, has advised me to keep my LDL goal below 60 and non-HDL below 100 and he advised to avoid SFA. When I took a second opinion in another city and another cardiologist , he also opined the same thing. All the cardiologists have been taught the same things. But i'm adverse on sfa advice. I don't agree to that advice. HDL and LDL particles seem to play very different roles in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. Therefore, measuring the amount of cholesterol within these particles tells two different stories. While high levels of LDL-C are associated with increased risk of heart disease, elevated levels of HDL-C are associated with lower risk. HDL particles appear to be involved in clearing and removing cholesterol from arteries and atherosclerotic plaques while LDL-particles seem to participate directly in the atherosclerotic process itself. This is the reason the cholesterol carried by HDL particles (HDL-C) is often called “good cholesterol” and the cholesterol carried by LDL particles (LDL-C) is called “bad cholesterol.” Of course, it is the same cholesterol; the difference lies within the lipoproteins that carry it. Measuring total cholesterol provides limited information about risk because the number includes both HDL-C and LDL-C. If we, however, subtract HDL-C from the total cholesterol we will have a measure of the amount of cholesterol carried by all lipoproteins except HDL. Doing this simple math will give us the amount of cholesterol carried within all lipoproteins that are atherogenic. In other words; a measure of cholesterol carried within all the “bad” lipoproteins but not the “good” ones (which is only HDL). This measure is termed non-HDL cholesterol (non-HDL-C). Relying on LDL-C alone may be misleading. For example, individuals with abdominal obesity, metabolic syndrome or diabetic lipid disorders often have elevated triglycerides, low HDL-C, and relatively normal calculated LDL-C. Despite their normal LDL-C, these patients produce highly atherogenic lipoproteins such as VLDL and IDL (intermediate density lipoprotein) as well as small dense LDL particles. A patient with low LDL-C and high non-HDL-C is an example of a patient with increased risk who may slip through the cracks because we only look at LDL-C. These patients are also likely to have high LDL particle number (LDL-P) as well as high ApoB levels. Recent evidence suggests that non-HDL-C shows a better correlation with small dense LDL particles than do other lipid parameters including LDL-C. Clinical studies strongly suggest that a predominance of small dense LDL-C is associated with increased risk of coronary heart disease. Non-HDL-C has been shown to be a better marker of risk in both primary and secondary prevention studies. An analysis of data combined from 68 studies, non-HDL-C was the best risk predictor of all cholesterol measures, both for CAD events and for strokes. The treatment goal for non-HDL-C is usually 30 mg/dL above the LDL-C treatment target. For example, if the LDL-C treatment goal is <70 mg/dL, the non-HDL-C treatment target would be <100 mg/dL. An advantage of using non-HDL-C is that you don’t need a fasting blood sample. Non-HDL cholesterol is your total cholesterol minus your HDL cholesterol Non-HDL Cholesterol = Total Cholesterol – HDL cholesterol So if your Total Cholesterol is 220 mg/dL (5.7 mmol/L) and your HDL cholesterol is 50 mg/dL (1.3 mmol/L); Here you can see how non-HDL-C levels are looked at in terms of risk: above 220 mg/dL (5.7 mmol/L) is considered very high 190 – 219 mg/dL (4.9 – 5.6 mmol/L) is considered high 160– 189 mg/dL (4.1 – 4.8 mmol/L) is considered borderline high 130 – 159 mg/dL (3.4 – 4.0 mmol/L) is considered near ideal below 130 mg/dL (below 3.4 mmol/L) is considered ideal for people at risk of heart disease below 100 mg/dL (below 2.6 mmol/L) is considered ideal for people at very high risk of heart disease. Fats are not villains and required for cell wall synthesis, many hormones and important secretions. One has to eat protein and build muscles by exercise - strenuous if possible. But i think that was a simplified explanation. There are many thin people having diabetes but majority of them are not. Talking about t2d.Obese people tend to have t2d more than thin people. Also bad eating habits are the cause of young age heart attacks. Hats off! You guys are really pioneer in Health & Nutrition and i am sure all diabetes disorder will run away fromyou.! Thanks for clarifying a lot of things. I am sure you have a lot of patience and energy to help the new comers in this forum. I will keep bothering you. In other words, Non HDL-C can also be understood by the following formulae. Please correct me if I am wrong! Another question how much Kcal food need to be taken in LCHF diet? Is it 2000kcal , is it1800? Perhaps it should be body weight based? Now what happens if by chance you exceed the permissible KCal limit per day! As we know 1 gm fat has 9 Kcal where as 1gm carbo and 1 gm protein has only 4Kcal and whether one needs to be careful in Calorie count in case of LCHF I have been on Galvus 50..1-0-0 for last 4 years.. my experience is good...
